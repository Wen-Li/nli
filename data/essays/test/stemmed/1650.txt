i do not agre with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one subject . even though what is better for an individu differ accord to hi person , life style and profession career choic they make after the univers , i believ that have a broad knowledg of mani subject without a concentr area leav individu unskil . in today 's world , it is import to know what you are do at a special level , in addit to be open to learn about other subject . i believ that it is essenti for an individu to have a broad outlook on the world in gener and to be familiar with a rang of academ subject . howev , be open to broad rang of subject should not imped the indivu from concentr and special in the one subject that motiv and interest her the most . come from a background of multi-disciplinari studi of intern affair and intern develop , i realiz at the end of my studi is that i actual lack a special area . in the busi world , even though i knew about a wide rang of issu and could easili adapt my skill set to the requir of the posit , i alway felt the burden of non-speci . thi is becaus in everi area , there are peopl who are heavili specil academ and profession which make it extrem difficult to compet if one is not come from a similar background . that is whi actual i feel that i need to focu and do further studi . jack of all trait and master of none may be relev if you are a good talker , but when you have produc a concret outcom , whether it is in scienc , busi , or it , special in a specif subject allow one to go deeper in the subject matter . moreov , special lead to innov in the field . have said that , i also do oppos individu who onli special in one subject and have no interest in ani other area . one should alway have the skill to evalu issu from differ perspect . howev , have broad gener knowledg should not deter an individu from special . therefor , rather than an either/or , i think the optimum solut is to have broad knowledg on a rang of issu and special on the subject that matter the most for that person .
