i do n't think you have to choos onli one learn method . that will be kind of radic . let 's better to develop an idea that probabl would be more product at the topic of learn . for understand the statement , let 's defin with two word the method of learn : `` theori and pratic '' . karl marx in the 19th centuri develop some idea about `` theori and practic '' and he support that the best for learn , it 's to make a combin of thi two concept . if i decid just to say which of the two word is more import , mayb i would be make a mistak . i think that there is not a uniqu learn method that it tell you anyth about a acknowledg . one you get the acknowledg you need to practic what you learn . that 's the part where the practic get intro the process . i ca n't understand theori without practic and vicevers . the school are made for teach student and the object of thi , it 's that after the have been in the classroom the will be abl to work and produc , for they bring out someth good to the societi . but some research have found that if they reforc the knowledg gotten in the classroom with laboratori , practic and proyect , the learn proccess would be more effect . actual around the world research , teacher , psicologist , have develop studi method . these method are now use in some univers , and ther are effect . if you had the opotun of join two or more differ univers ( of cours not at the same time ) , you would distinguish between each method , and probabl you would be abl to choos the best method for your learn . i recomend from my own expiri not to choos just one method .
