i think that most advertis make product much better than they realli are is a veri true statement . on the one hand , i understand those who make advertis . they are paid by a societi to promot their product , so they obvious focu on their best charaterist and mayb do not talk about possibl problem . probabl the societi itself give them such direct . and if most societi do thi , the remain one must do the same if they will not want to go outsid the market in the near futur . on the other hand , i put myself to the side of the consum . if i have buy someth , becaus i wa impress by a veri well made advertis , i will be veri delud if when i tri it out , it doe not work as well as in the spot . and if thi happen again and again , the consum will doubt of everi spot he will see . in conclus , we understand the polici of seller , alway make their best effort to make their product seem better than they realli are , but if they will continu thi way , i am sure that consum will be tire of all these `` fals '' advertis and then will not believ to ani of them , nope the realist one .
