today advertis is a typic way to support your product . but thi do not alway mean , that you make product better then the reali are . the advertis is to convinc the consum that thi produkt is the right for him . thi could be for sever reason . one possibl is , it wa mention bevor , that you convinc the consum by make the produkt better than it is . so the person buy it becau he espact a veri high return to hi invest . televis spot for clean product are a good exampl . in thi spot it is typic that advertis describ there product as veri affect . possibl more effect then than they reali are . it is shown a veri dirti cloth and when you use the advertis product , your cloth are clean completli . thi may not occour under practic condit , like in normal hous . for me , thi is not the right way of market . thi could effect to an angri consum . an other , in my opinion much more import function is , that you inform the custom . there are product , that have to be introduc , becaus the are new and unknowen . if you do not get to know the product by advertis , you would propabl never have heard from it . for thi point of view , it is import that you look on advertis not like forc the peopl to buy . normali a product should have a recogniz valu to the consum and for that , you reali want to buy it . now it is clear that at first he need to know the advanteg of thi special produkt . to conclud , i would not critic advertis in gener . you have to look behind the reason . in some case it is an useful instrument for boath site , the produc and the consum .
