refer to the statement that it is of more import for student to understand the idea and reason behind a certain topic than it is for them to learn the fact i can agre in a way but not absolut . there are two side of the coin and to me thi statement is not veri well develop and consid . we have differ topic and subject with differ requir of knowledg for each singl one of them . to me the mixur of both , understand the idea/concept and the fact , is what make your knowlegd about a topic absolut reliabl . if someon ask the student to explain a certain issu the student need to know all the background inform and then tri to show practic evid to underlin that it is total right what wa said . in histori class for exampl you need to explor the circumst and reason whi a certain event took place or whi it wa time for a new era-i would consid those question as fact but also in a way as an idea how to solv a problem . then a student can learn about plan which help tri to realiz certain thing . therefor you need to know about both to be well inform . in chemistri you first need to know about the appear and ` charact ' of an element befor you can experi with it . here it is absolut neccessari to do those experi to increas the understand of the topic . in math a student also need to know a definit of a problem and how to come to a solut befor it will be solv . idea and concept are in advantag when it come to learn becaus student are stimul not onli by learn it theoret but by use differ sens such as touch , hear and speak . they get the chanc to experi someth in a practic way . but if you see , hear thing or learn about someth you should also know whi you hear or see it-her we come to the point of learn fact . to come to a conclus both aspect are import to studi a topic in a seriou way and then consequ you will get the ultim result of reliabl knowledg which you can pass on to other .
