mani peopl think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . other think taht make and organ a trip by there own is the best way . i think that thi kind of trip ha both it 's own advantag and disadvantag . on one hand , guid trip are veri good for tourist becaus they give them the possibl to know all the place they are visit becaus the tour guid will know veri well that place . in thi kind of trip peopl learn a lot from the place such as the histori and cultur and they do not have to worri where to go or visit becaus they have all schedul and organ . but the problem come when a person doe n't feel like do what is schedul and want to do someth that they want to , thi is not imposs but thi person is go to loos for exampl the money they paid for an expedit . on the other hand , trip by your own have the benefit that you alway do what you want and you spend your money in the thing that you want to , not in the thing schedul by a tour guid of a group . but the drawback that thi type of trip ha is that probabl you are go to loos much inform that a tour guid could have given to you as regard the histori of the place or the cultur . to sum up , i think that both type of trip ha it 's own advantag and disadvantag , but i do n't think that one is better than the other . i believ that the decis of choos one type or the other depend on the person and the kind of trip he or she want to do .
