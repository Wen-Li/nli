ye realli i agre with thi argument the media is the main reason for thi problem . henc the telivis show and paper advisi are do their busi for their commerci reason . ani one can go and advatis hi product in telivis program by give money . the manag wont see the qualiti of the product and he advatis in hi channel . my personel experi on thi is onc i am think to buy a refrig . and i am think of which brand to take at that time i am watch the televis in that the advisi came on the refrig . i watch it and by that refrig withen one month it got repair there is no warranti for that brand . simpley by thi advis daili nooff peopl are get teft by the dealer . in my view govern should onli rectifi thi problem by keep some strict rule for advis . the rule must be like thi . govern should keep some grade to the product , the product must be check by highley train proffisionl , then onli the product must be releas into the market . govern should also give grade to compini , and also ani advitisi which is been viewd in telis or print in news paper must be registr . then onli it ha to be viewd or print in paper . by thi process the product see better than the advisi . lastli in my view i realli agre with thi question .
