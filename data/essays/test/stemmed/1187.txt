i total agre whith the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , for mani reason . it is the goal of a good advertis to do it , and they have lot of techniqu to manag it . the goal of peopl who make the advertis is to sell the product . so they need to present it in a way as better as possibl . for instanc , for an advertis for food on the televis , they will broadcast the advertis befor dinner time , and it will be expos the item in such a way that you will want to purchas eat immediatli . but then when you have your product , you are often desappoint , becaus it seem to you that it tast better on the screen . all peopl have seen advertis for coffe . on the televis , you have the impress that you will have a lot of cream in you coffe . but when you prepar it alon , the effect is never the same . futhermor , market manag know lot of techniqu to present well the produc . they will use some softwar as photoshop , which allow to highlight the advantag of the item . the item is almost alway replac in a context . for exampl , for an advertis for a soda we will see a woman who drink a soda on the beach . thu . the product seem alway better on the adevertis . moreov , for a paper advertis , they will will place the item in the good place , in order that you focu at it directli , when you look at the pictur . howev , consum are not so stupid . we take into account the fact that the realiti can be differ than the advertisen , and we do not except for have exactli the same thing on our hand and on the tv .
