there are too mani advertis that show the product or servic in a better way rather than it 's when you are go to use it . if you are go to buy someth and the reason is a specif skill that an advertis show about that product , with a strong probabl you 'll be not satisfay after the purchas , and you would like to be refund of your money . when you are look a spot you alway have to think if the product/servic that is show will be abl to attend your aspect and befor buy someth , when is possibl , you have to tri it in . in my opinion we can solv thi problem , and it 's not difficoult , with a strong regolament that fix what a compani can show dure an advertisem and expeci that fix the admit differ between what is show and the real use of the object/servic . thi is the way to figur out a problem taht exist sinc the advertis ha been creat and that caus not real axpet expeci in young peopl . we have too mani spot on the tv , radio , newspap if we do n't want reduc the amount of thi we have increas the qualiti of what everyday we see , listen or read and thi , for sure , will increas the imagin of a compani becus what did you see is exactli the same of what did you buy or what you are go to buy .
