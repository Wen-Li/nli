although peopl can have differ opinion , i certainli agre with the idea that it is more import to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . i have follow three reason . first of all , today , fact can be easili found in book or use internet even if you forget them . therefor it must be wast of time and energi to learn and rememb the fact . i know that mani inform especi on the internet websit are sometim wrong . howev if you know the idea and concept under the fact , i think you can judg if what they say in the sourc are ture or not . secondli from my experi , fact without idea and concept behind them can be easili forgotten and what is more , i could not be interest in the subject onli with the fact . i took world histori class in my high school . i realli learn a lot of histor fact includ which year the american contin wa found . ye , brief fact can help you like it wa found at the veri end of 15th centuri , but i do not think it doe matter that if it wa 1492 or 1495 . after the final exam wa finish , i wa total happi to forget all the detail fact . i sometim regret that if i learn whi they tri to find the new continet , i mayb studi more about the world histori . at last , i would like to mention about japanes educ . it might be wide known , that japanes educ is focus so much on rememb fact . so what hap now ? mani kid can not think by themselv . they can not build their perspect . anyon can not have their own perspect just with fact . we need idea and concept behind the fact for build perspect . japanes govern becam upset about it , and they tri to chang the educ . i recommend the most import first step is start to teach idea and concept to kid in the formal eduat . with the three reason abov , i stronli agre with the idea that it is more import to learn idea and concept than fact .
