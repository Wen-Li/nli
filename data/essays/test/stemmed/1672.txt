success is a thing that can be interpret veri differ , depend on peopl 's point of view . my point of view about `` success '' is to achiev determin and accur goal , and alway have an object , both in privat and professionn life . in my part , i do agre that success peopl are those who take risk and tri to develop new thing and way to carri them out . first of all , peopl take risk becaus they want to go ahead to find a solut to improv their situat , and thi desir of changement is reflect to a determin and self confid , main point for success . then , the thing that do not kill make us stronger . that is to say if we fail do someth , as engag with someon , launch a new busi or choos educ orient , we will rememb our mistak and never do them again . we have to make mistak to know how to do it in a better way , to improv our knowledg , and one day to be success in achiev someth . in the busi field , most of the time , manag who tri to launch their activ on new market , but made a lot of mistak due to their lack of experi , caus a bad situat in the compani , are fire and replac . i think that it will benefit the compani which will next recruit these manag , becaus they should have learnt from their experi and will be abl to act in a difficult situat , know what to do , in order to be success for the compani . final , i think that it is import to have object in our life . object make us volunt , engag and involv in what we do , and without object , our life would be poor . the uniqu way to have new object is to achiev the actual one , and to achiev them , it is import to take risk . peopl who onli do what they alreadi know are self satisfi , so they dont need to have ani object .
