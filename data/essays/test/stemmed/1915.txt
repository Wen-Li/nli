nowaday , with benefit of technolog industri and develop of vehicl , mani peopl can travel to other countri or travel far place veri easili . some peopl like to travel in group with tour guid , but other like to travel by their alon . i prefer to traveel in a group led by a tour guid rather than travel alon for three reason . first of all , it can be more academ travel with guid . one would be the first time visit the place , but the guid know veri well about the place becaus he or she guid the place for long time . the guid can led peopl to mani kind of museum or famou place that we must visit . for exampl , when foreign peopl came to korea , they would not know well about popular place of korea , but guid can lead them to interest and academ place such as kyung-bok-gung . secondli , you may not worri about lost way in new place . some peopl are veri bad at look for way . in my experi , i have lost in new town where i visit for two time . if i were travel with guid , mayb i would not lost my way . final , travel with lot of new peopl in group will be veri meaning . visit mani place and have own time can be reason of travel for some peopl , but make new friend can be anoth good reason of travel , too . for instantc , the group of peopl are first time to the place as same as you , except the guid . so usual in that kind of trip , guid give free time to make peopl to becom friend and know with each other . if you make a friend in a trip , you can keep in touch and get to anoth travel togeth if there is anoth chanc . for three reason i mention , to make a trip more academ , to not lost way , and to make new friend , travel in a group with tour guid is the best way .
