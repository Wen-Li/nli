in today media the consum is expos to a lot of advertis , of differ kind , like in televis or newpap . usual advertis is a way to commun some kind of aspect of the product to a consum . so the compani intens is clearli to sell someth . thi should be kept in mind mind when discuss the question . in my opinion , a lot of compani are tri to make their product to look as good as possibl , but they are not make thi seem better that it actual is . let take an car advertis for an exampl : on televis a compani show their car drive through a beauti landscap with a happi familti . of cours thi make the car look good and adress some feel the consum associ with these landscap . but it is not ad ani featur to the product it self , nor doe it make the product seem better . it is present in a nice way , and noth more . sinc by law , compani are not allow to promis more than their product can hold , they will have a hard time make the product look good . like state in the previou paragraph , the onli legal way of do so is , to make peopl associ some form of positiv emot to it . anoth point about make product seem better that they are , is econom motiv . if a compani make custom buy a product which ha less function than they promis . they are veri like to loos thi custom for ever . es special if you are have a specif brandt , it is import to give custom what they expect . let say a car compani like audi trick a custom into buy a car , by propos featur it doe n't have . on the next car , the custom buy , he 'll for sure not buy a car of the same brandt again . due to the high competit in thi industri thi is a veri problemat issu , and think longterm , veri foolish . becaus , like recent studi have shown , such trick custom , are commun their issu three time more than satisfi custom . as shown , in the previou paragraph , advertis are not make product seem better than they actual are . it is rather a nice form of present fact of the product .
