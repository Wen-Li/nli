i agre with it is import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . although most of the peopl say that is is veri import to know the fact the what ha happen , and how it ha happend . i think it is useless to sit and think about what ha happen . becaus it is just wast of time to relay on the past . as the student of the 21 st centur , where the technolog ha been alreadi develop . we ha to move with the fast move world . .. everyth ha been creat for us . now it the time for us onli toread about the main idea of the product , for what it ha been creat . we have to understand the whole concept regard the develop of the product . analys the concept and should further modifi it . for our futur use . as the fact explain us about what ha alreadi happen and how it ha happen . it onli import for us onli to know what had happen and we should leav about that . becaus they onli give us idea , but noth more than that . it also not so import for us to read it so deepli . we hav to leav the past as the past and should alway move with the futur technolog to make our live beauti . acccord to me as we the student of the technolog we should alway have the creativ thought to invent some thing new and to give it to the societi so , we should not simpli sit and think what had happen , but think about what to do to improv the technolog to make the life so simpl . in order to conclud my opinion with learn thew new idea and understand the concept . i suggest my friend onli to learn some thing new than relay upon the past to know the past . becaus of we be the stundent of the new era ha so much work to do . that is to give some thig to our mother land . there is so much research work to do to invent some thing new . which may be help to thew humankind . so much work ha been done by our father and it is our respons to conclud their work with good result .
