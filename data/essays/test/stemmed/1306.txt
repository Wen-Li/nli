i am complet agre with the statement , becaus when you undrstand idea and concept , you can learn logicali the thing taugh . it happen to me when i wa in highschool , i had a histori profesor that alway said that the date are import , it is true , but when you understand the global thing , the logic chain of event , how one event in the past is link with the next one , like a stori , you will rememb natur the date in which the event ocur . so that i follow my profesor 's advic and i start to understand the process of how and whi the thing happen in the chilean histori . suddenli , histori becam a veri interest subject , like a stori and i bare could wait to the next class to continu learn . then , when i gave the test the date and fact just came to my head becaus i undertood the whole thing and whi it happen . i think that if you onli learn a fact , mayb you can rememb it for the test , but some day you will foget it , becaus as rational be , it doe not have mani senc remeb thing onli becaus . at least for me . mayb there are peopl with better memori than i , i use to studi with a class mate that just keep fact and he repet them onc and again , i almost went crazi and realiz that i can not studi wth him anymor . with the pass of the year i becom veterinarian and i still have some of the histori knoledg that i onc learn . but my classmat doe not rememb as well as i the fact that occuri in the chilean histori . nevertheless , we wa and are onli two peopl and mayb my classmat did have the interest that i had in histori . so that i think that is veri import to understand idea and concept , it make easier the learn process , it work for me then and it work for me now , but it is also veri import the motiv that everi person ha to face one subject .
