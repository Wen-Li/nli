i do neither agre or disagre with the statement . i think there must be a combin of both . a student ha to understand the idea and concept relat to hi career . he also ha to learn fact about it , those are realli import . the reason i think that both are import is becaus both are use in differ situat and the student must be prepar for them . a person that ha learn fact can answer quicker to a known situat than a person who onli understand the idea and concept . for exampl , i studi comput scienc . one of the most common problem in thi field is sort a set of element . know that you can not sort a set in less than a certain time allow you to make quick decis like not use a certain proposs approach and look for a new way of solv the problem . a person who doe not know thi fact but understand the concept would take much time figur the answer . now , if a person understand the concept but doe not know the fact , he ( or she ) can not react as quickli as the person that know them . hi ( or her ) advantag is that he ( or she ) is abl of creat new solut , sinc he ( or she ) doe understand how similar problem are solv . in the situat expos abov , know the fact allow you to determin fast if a solut is the right one or not . if you need to build a new solut , you would need to understand the concept . the main point i am tri to express is that a combin of both characterist is import . it depend on the kind of work you are perform which one is more import . a good exampl is if you are hire to correct thing , you need to learn mani fact , you can not build everyth from scratch . if you are hire to creat new thing , you need to fulli understand the idea behind other creation .
