differ peopl have differ opinion about whether travel in a group is better or not . in my opinion , travel alon is better becaus i think the flexibl is one of the most import factor in travel , and we can rememb the travel longer if we travel alon . first , travel alon give you flexibl . when you travel in a group , you have to keep up with a schedul and keep the pace of the group . howev , if you travel alon , you can plan your own schedul and go to everi place where you want to go . when i travel europ , i wa in a tour group . i had to move on the fix schedul , and the tour guid forc me not to escap the group becaus of safeti . i wa veri uncomfort becaus i want to go to ordinari area in the foreign countri , and watch their daili life . howev , i had to visit onli famili place due to the fix schedul . if i can travel europ again , i will not join a tour group becaus i want to visit whereev i want to travel without ani interfer . also , travel alon provid us with longer-last memori . travel in a group give you onli passiv knowledg . if you go on a trip with a tour guid , the tour guid alway say what the artifact mean and whi it is valuabl histor dure the travel . nevertheless , when you come back home countri , you will recogn that you can not rememb some part or even whole of the tour guid 's explain becaus you do not make ani effort on the travel . in contrast to thi case , if you prepar for the travel by onli yourself , you should choos the artifact or relic that you want to watch , and find the way to get to the destin befor you begin travel . of cours , thi prepar is hard due to lack of expertis , but you will not forget your effort even in the futur . thu , i believ that longer-last memori can be gain onli through such person effort . take all those into consider , i think that travel alon is a better way in term of flexibl and long-last memori .
