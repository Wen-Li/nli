i do believ that a success person tend to tri new thing and take risk rather than stick to what he/sh is alreadi knowledg about . a success person alway seek to tri new thing , reach to new place and look for new opportun . he/sh ha the courag and self-confid to ventur into unkown territori . thi person indulg in new experi , which ultim enrich his/her self and make that person gain more insight and exposur to the world around him/her . advantag of a successfuli person 's approach can be clearli depict from the busi world . a businessman who is do well in provid a certain product to hi custom may settl for that and wo n't care to expand hi busi . thi person may oper profit to some extent . howev for him to be - and more importantli remain - success , he must broaden hi vision and constantli look for new way to improv hi offer and increas hi custom base . for instanc , he must tri to come up with new version or updat of hi product or look for new compon that 'll lead to higher qualiti . he must be open for new trend , say in promot and advertis . moverov , he must be continu seek new market and segment to which he can introduc hi product . some may consid such pratic to be riski and would rather remain on the safe side , do what they 've alway done . but the fact is , we 're live in an increasingli competitv environ , where excel , innov , profession and exposur are but a few of the compet that everon is struggl to achiev in order to be success .
