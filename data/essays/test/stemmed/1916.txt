i agre with the statement and beleiv that success peopl tri new thing . .. let us see how success peopl are made . no one born a millionar . peopl have to work hard use their brain , realis their capac befor they ventur out into anyth , ofcours there is also luck which play an import factor in everyon life . peopl might be all of the abov but yet not as success as them , the reason well simpl plain luck . when somebodi start out with a busi , they have to understand and know what and how thing in their respect busi is . they cant start off with load of busi right from the word go . they have to be focus on a singl thing in the start and then if they are success , ventur out into other area of expertis . one such person who come to my mind would be mr. vijay mallya , chairman of kingfish brewri , kingfish airlin and a whole lot of other organis . it wasnt as if he wa success right from the start . he wa 28 year old when hi father had pass away and he had to enter the famili busi without quit a bit of knowledg . hi compani wa in a loss when he took over and he made it wors as soon as he took over but he hung in there and made a profit after profit everi quarter , he wa convinc , passion and had a goal in hi mind and it wa due to these factor includ luck that he is where he is today . he learnt the hard way and becam one of the richest men in the world . mallya initi start off with beer and water . he saw that sinc he wa earn so much whi not expand like ani other businessman and that what he did , he acquir reput alcohol compani throughout the world . after thi came spirit , hi compani is the world 's third largest spirit compani in the world . be the success person he wa he want to take a risk in the aviat industri . he start hi journey in thi industri with kingfish airlin which today is one of the largest airlin of india after it bought share of air deccan , anoth player in dat industri . i woul like to end by sayung thta look at him u know wy u shud take risl
