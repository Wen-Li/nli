i agre that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour gide . i have some opinion to support my answer . firstli , it can decreas the wast of time for our sightseen . the place we visit as a travel would be strang and there are mani thing we do not know about the place , for exampl , the direct , how to ride the local train or public car and so on . then we can depend on the tour guid what we should do or where we should visit . moreov in the case of travel abrod , we do not have to worri about the problem of languag . tour gide must be good at the languag spoken in the countri . so we would not be panic becaus of the difficulti of the languag . secoudli , it can be sure safe for tourist . as the abov the paragaraph , we do not be familiar with the place so we can not know about the denger spot where we should not go . there are mani case that we can not find such place in the guid book by ourselv . so listen the dirent from guid , we can protect our selv from unexpect acctid . if , unfortun , we meet such accid , for exampl , we lost our pasport or money by theaf , we can depend on a our guid what we should do to solv the problem . thirdli , we can get mani knowledg from our guid . for instanc , in kyoto in japan , there are so mani templ or shrine . then we can learn from him/her about the histori of them . it is too hard to do ourselv
