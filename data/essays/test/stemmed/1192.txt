i agre with the follow statement . nowaday young peopl do n't give enough time to help their comuti . i think it is so becaus young peopl such as me have a wrong model . when i see the televis there are onli a rich peopl that for help their commun spend much money . thi is a good thing , but a normal person , that have n't much money what can he do ? i think that for a normal peopl is enoughgh a normal act . he can spend hi time to help their commun to do a meal to the poor peoopl , or simpli to help a children to do a homework . everi us can do a normal short act that it can chang a day to the other . my granfaht told me that hi friend wa unhappi becaus wa alway singl , without a compani . when i can i go to find them . and everi one of they is happi to see me , a young peopl , that rememb them . in my opinion everi time that i do anyth for a other peopl i 'm happi also for me . i think that if you help a person in the same time you help also yourself . it is same at the christma , when you give a present usual you receiv anoth one present . .. the help is same !! in the last year i usual go to the hospit for meet the young peopl htat are less luck than me . i go in the hospit for 3 afternoon everi week , i stay here for two or three hour and i talk with that who want . when i came back at home i think that i 'm veri lucki . i have thi think everi time . help my commun help me to undertsan how much i ' happi ! that everi my problem is noth in confront to a problem that other person have . nowaday the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . .. but thi isn ' for ever ! for everi one will arriv the moment that undestand the import thing of the life ! in thi moment the person will start to help the less lucki peopl ! i agre with the statement , but i think and i hope also that the thing can be chang !
