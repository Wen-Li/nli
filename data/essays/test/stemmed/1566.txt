although i think that peopl should not be influenc by advertis , i admit that the market initi of compani influenc our life , our mental and our shop pattern . there are sever reason for thi and my person experi reinforc thi idea . as i studi at the univers dure a market cours , the purpos of advertis is to catch the prospect ' and custom ' interest on the advertis product . in thi way they are foster to buy it . the lever which are use to achiev thi target aim at highlight the main characterist of the product . moreov compani do their best to make the product seem much better than it is . so i think that make the product seem better is a specif market strategi use by compani to increas their turnov . there are sever way use by advertis to improv the characterist of the product and to make it better e.g to make it more fashon or more beauti or to increas the smell of the product in the supermarket where it is sold . onc i enter a big store and i wa nearli shock by the advertis done for one product that is bread . the advertis wa done by mean of leaflet , commerci about thi product were screen on big monitor , the smell of the product wa intent diffus in the whole supermarket that everyon bought the advertis bread . me too . to tell the truth it wa not particularli tasti but i wa nearli compel to buy it . as an employe of an intern compani which make use of commerci as a key lever to increas the market share , i believ that thi way of advertis is a good idea to make the busi more profit . on the contrari , as a privat custom , i would like to point out that make the product seem better should be prohibit by the central govern of my countri sinc custom invest their money in a product which doe not have the advertis characterist or featur . thi can not be consid a good conduct !
