today in the media world everyth is show that is perfect . everi product ha sever good way and better option than the other product which are in the same market area . it seem me like a paradis . everi product is incredi good and better than the other that person i do not like . adverstis are creat the world for the person that want to live in that . but real world is not as good as on advertis . i do not believ that the advertis are say the true to us . firstli , in today 's world everyon ha a mobil phone ( cell phone ) . but the new model are come everyday and buyer are on a compatit , to buy the newst ( becaus the best ) from the other peopl . new one can easilli be the bad one from that you have . for exampl a phone compani trade a new product which name is `` shine '' . when i saw that product it wa like a mirror it is realli shine . i went to the market to buy it but i could not expect to see an ugli product . it doe not have anyth in it besid a out view of mirror not even a camera . the advertis chang the truth and expect me to buy it , but adversit can not actual gave me what i expect from the tv . second reason that i do not beliv that adverti are not show the realiti is the peopl on the tv adverti or in the billboard are alway the world top model . it doe not show the realiti . for exampl a jean look great on a top model on billboard but when i tri on it , i can not realli imagin which part of my leg and hump are invis to seen like a top model 's . if they can be more relibl peopl can buy it easili but in thi way the given messag for my opinion is ` if you do not have a bodi like thi , do not even come to our boutiqu . final , advertis are not show the realiti . they want to be seen visibl good and trend but they are categor the peopl . peopl who wnant to buy the product becaus it look great and wear by top model and the peopl who wnat to buy the product becaus it is use . advertis should indic more realiti if they want to sell much more .
