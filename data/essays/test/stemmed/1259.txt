in thi time , the school are give our children diffrent topic . and each topic ha an influanc in thier charectar . some topic made them creatic some do n't . therefor , i agre with th statement and i believ that it is more imort for student to understand idea and concept than it is for tham to learn fact beucas thi thing will make tham creativ by have a big imagin and turn the idea into fact . give the student idea , will help them to have an imagin , which is import in thier life , special if the idea are wrong . give wrong idea to diffrent kind of student will have diffrent influanc on them . some of them might take it as it is and believ even if it is true and that kind we should be awar from them and tri to give them the both fact and idea togeth . the anoth group might think about and tri to think about and by do that they will get a big imagn that could help them to prove it . and as a result of that they will have an open mind , which can discuss ani topic . prove an idea is a realli arduou thing becaus it is an idea ! . but after prove it and turn it into fact you will be proud of your-self and you will feel like a king that time . when i wa a child my mother use to tell me an idea which it is : `` not all of the scintest right you could be better than them '' . she wa tell me thi idea sinc i wa seven year old . after while , when i grow up and becom a man i prove that , by prove that newton 's formula are wrong . it wa arduou for me to believ it and for my peer also , but when i remmeb my mother 's word it becam easier to believ . that moment i wa n't happi for have that big honor , but also to prove that ani idea , as mother 's idea , can be fact someday . and that ha a realli big impact in my life , i am now in schoolarship for the gift peopl onli , and that kind of idea are what the student need . therefor , if the school will not teach my student idea , i will do it by myself . becuas of my love to them i want them to have a big imagin and to tri to turn the idea into fact .
