i complet agre with the idea that peopl who take risk are more success than those who do new with old . it is possibl to justifi thi idea by use the exampl of the music busi . inde , whenev a song becom number one of the chart , it is mainli due to the univers of the singer , the way he write or sing the lyric , or it can be due to the introduct of a new featur or style in a current style . all innov are sourc of success if they are well manag , organis or promot . a perfect exampl of thi argument could be mickael jackson . the reason of hi success resid in all the risk he took by introduc a new style in pop music , and also by invent danc step . he complet chang the vision of pop music and the way that music wa done . plu , he introduc the concept of music comedi in hi video clip . all the action he did were not predict to be success , but he took hi chanc and hi risk were worth tri . i do not think we would have been so import today if he had copi previou singer . today , it is imposs for someon who want to succeed in the music industri to do what mickael jackson did . in interview , new famou artist of pop say that they were all inspir by mickael jackson , and the reason whi they are success today is mainli due to the fact that they use some of mickael jackson 's talent and innov which they improv and combin to their new featur . all these combin are riski , but as the statement say `` success peopl tri new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . few peopl in the music industri do thing that have been done in the past becaus they alreadi know that custom want news . even if singer sing old song , they will alway tri to put new style into it in order to innov by remix the instrument or modifi the text . as a proverb say `` onli those who take the risk have a chanc to succeed '' which goe in my argument way .
