i strongli disagre with the motion that , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i person would like to travel alon without ani tour guid for the follow reason . reduct of element of surpris : when we travel with a tour guid , most of the thing are expect and henc it doe n't put up ani surpris , and as some wise man said ` surpris make you happi . ' so i can comfortablli presum that a travel guid reduc the happi of the whole trip . and significantli reduc the much cherish experi that a trip is bound to throw on the travel . limit access to local : as mention abov thi point ratifi the notion further . if i travel with a tour guid he 's bound to show the monument and other interest of tourist , but what about the experi of mingl with the localit ? it 's simpli rule out and just no scope pertain of it . the most import part of a tour is itinari . on travel on expect line it extrem difficult to get the nuanc of the local cultur and tradit . for a avid travel like me it would be a detereior of experi . understand of cutur : for a travel there are mani question to be answer . like the motif of the travel . unless the motif is fulfil the travel is incomplet in all sens . understand and impart the local cultur is of high import to the travel . to be spefic travel of high calib . he would sure understand the import of cultur and neciss to confluenc with it . thi ratifi the abov mention point by all mean . `` the best experi is the experi of travel '' start some wise man . and inde it is . i would like to take the opportun to exhibit my pragmat side of my persona . i have been irrat harsh to tour guid , but the fact reamin that most of the travel opt fot them . in some way tour group led by a tour guid is inde a good idea , especi when we are in a group an stuck in a problem these group and guid come in handi to the situat . it all depend on percept and interest of the travel .
