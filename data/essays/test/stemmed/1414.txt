there is a gener debat over student ' learn method throughout the whole societi , especi among those parent and educ expert . one import question under debat is that whether the studi of idea and concept is more import than fact . from my perspectvi , it may be a littl too hasti to draw an extrem conclus without regard the differ stage the learn process contain . the first truth , we have admit , is the fact that idea and concept is much more obstract that fact . so at the begin of studi , learn from fact might be a better choic . besid , learn fact will stimul student ' interest easili , which will pali a far-reach role in their further studi . to illustr the abov point , i would take my studi about physic as an persuas exampl . at the first few class , our teacher are forev demonstr some interst experi to us . we just find lesson are so attract that our interest are acumul day by day . we would even be allow to do some of experi by ourselv . from some magic phenomena and vivid experi , we began to dig out some knowledg by ourselv . gradual , these discov accumul to a big one , the knowledg we should learn in thi class . on the other hand , along with the develop of our knowledg base on obsev fact , we need to summar the idea and concept involv in these knowledg , which will help us to have a solid foundat of what we 've learn . in fact , concept inde produc more import effect on the construct of our knowledg system . still take physic as an exampl , the major of peopl will not to use an experiment fact to build hi knowledg . instead , we tend to use some uniqu concept such as ideal state to explain our knowledg , which is more effici and of extrem import . in retrospect , it is reason to confirm that we should appli differ learn method to differ situat . onli in thi way can we learn happier and more effici .
