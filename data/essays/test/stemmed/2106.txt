from my point of view , in twenti year the number of the car on the on the planet will lower . firstli , becaus the mankind will understand that it is imposs to continu to live without respect the envirol . then , it is a common knowledg that the too big number of car with the the big quantiti of smog that they produc are kill the envirol and ourselv . therefor , in my opinion the governa in some year will start a valid politici to lower the number of car . secondli , it will be possibl to have least car with the creation of new regul plan , especi for the big citi . thi becaus , in thi way , it will be possibl , veri easi and also quit chip to build a complit net of pubblic ecolog public transport as like as the elett buse , the train and mayb hydrogen buse . final , i think that in about two decad it will be possibl to almost all kind of work by comput in our home . therefor , thi mean that will not need to go out everi day to go to work and so use the car , but , on the contrari we will be perfectli abl to work at home . in spite of big industri , for exampl bmw , gener motor , etc. , are work for creat and to sell ecolog hydrogen car , i think that howev , for space reason , it will be better to lower the numbher of car howev .
