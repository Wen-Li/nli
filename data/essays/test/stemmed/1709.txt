i total agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . the reason for the truth of thi statement lie in the definit of `` success '' itself . with `` success '' we mean that a person achiev thing that are over averag . a success person is recogn becaus thi person ha manag thing the averag person doe not easili achiev . therefor it is a logic consequ that peopl who tri new thing and take risk are more like to be the one that are over averag , becaus the averag of peopl stick to their well-known way of do thing . tri new thing and take risk veri often is relat to develop new idea as well . and if these idea are of a kind that fulfil the demand of peopl you can becom veri success with it . look at bill gate for exampl . he is the pioneer of the internet and comput industri . certainli he is a clever person as well , but what is more import is the fact that he had new idea and found new way in order to promot hi idea in a busi environ . and now he is the richest man in the world ( i think ) . yet , it is true that some peopl are veri good in someth they are do , although it is not a `` new '' thing and they do not take ani risk . they might not be the most creativ person , but they are still veri good in what they are do , their work is clearli over averag . these peopl are success person too . still the talent peopl that do not leav tradtit path and never take a risk will not be as success as the one that tri new thing and take risk . becaus what somebodi achiev by use new idea will arous more attent and earn more recognit than tradit idea everybodi can think of . look at it from a busi perspect new idea are certainli more success , becaus nobodi ha had these idea befor . in addit human be are curiou and want to tri new thing they have not heard of befor . in conclus , for the reason state abov it is true that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
