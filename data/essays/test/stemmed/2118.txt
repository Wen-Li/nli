i do not agre with thi statement . eventhough today most of peopl know about the disadvantag of car , i think there a sever reason whi there wo n't be less car in twenti year than there are today first of all , peopl do n't like to chang their habit , they are lazi and alway tri to maxim comfort . they are just so use to their car . therefor it would need a big changement in the conscious of the individu and thi can not be attain easili . eventhough nowaday there are organ that tri to make peopl awar of environment problem an so , howev , most of peopl do n't consid their own compart as part of the solut . second , more and more peopl live in suburb , especi young famili . these peopl still mostli work in the big citi and travel there by car daili . i realli believ that thi develop of the social structur doe n't help to get the car away from the street . peopl basic need their car to make a live . last but not least , the lobbi of the carindustri play a big role . as long as there are car , there will also be peopl make a lot of money with it . and those peopl , who are most of the time veri power , are readi to make a big effort to prevent the public opinion to shift toward the unnecces of car . they will alway tri to provid other solut to problem like pollut . for exampl they could tri to argu that today car have catalyz or do n't need a lot of ga anymor . in conclus i tri to show with three exampl , which are in my opinion the main one , whi i do not believ that there will be fewer car in the futur that there are nowaday . the three reason are : peopl 's habit , social structur and the lobbi of the carindustri .
