in my opinion ther would be less car in twentey . i see that becaus of tow main reason that will affect all the countri in the world . the first reason is that the govern of each countri in the world espici the less develop countri will tri to reduc the number of car on the street becaus of the increas of the pupliat and the bad affect that car caus it to the enviro . the number of pupliat is increasin everi year and the most increas is on the less develop countri . for that the govren of these countri will tri to find a trasportt way that will transport a lot of peopl in less space . also the higher number of car on the street the higher effect that it will do for the enviro . so the govren of each countri around the world will tri to solv thi problem by find a transport devic that will caus less rush and less harm to the enviro . the second and the most import reason that i thinck there will be less car for it is the price of ga . the price of ga is to high nowaday and how will it be after twenti year ? of cours it will be even much higher . for exampl i am from dubai , uae and i see the price in my countri that produc oil is high and also i went to austrailia at summer and the price wa much higer than my countri and the last exampl is that my cousin mum is from the usa and he is a us nation and when i ask him about the price of ga in the us he said that i shoud sell my shoe if i had an egiht sylend car in the us becaus of the price pf the ga . final these are the main reason that i think that the car will be fewer in the next twenti year the number of peopl and the price of oil .
