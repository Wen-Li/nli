thi essay is about the question wether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject . in my opinion it is realli import to have a broad knowledg of generel knowledg but not realli of mani academ subject . that doe not mean that is useless to have broad knowledg . it is n't ! i think the main question are : how can you benefit from these wide rang of academ knowledg ? and how deep can your knowledg be in everi academ subject when you have a wide rang of knowledg ? to answer the second question i think everybodi ha a rang of knowledg capac . that mean you can get an amount of knowledg which is in fact not endless . when you have a wide rang of knowledg throughout differ academ subject it hard to specifi in one of it . you can onli sratch on the top of the subject knowledg and so you can not becom an expert in a specif subject . but that is what you ha to be to get a job for exampl as an ingen , doctor or a lawyer . you have to spend realli much time for learn to becom a good or even veri good student in those subject . and it will get your full effort and capac . so there is no realli time left to get a broad knowledg of other academ subject . regard to the first question how you can benefit from a broad knowledg . may you can take part into a quizz show or you find a good job where these skill are requir . but i think a trend lead to more specif skill in do a job . so it is import to be an expert in that academ field you want to work in the futur . nevertheless it seem to be not bad to have a good generel knowledg addit to your specif . to summer i think it is import to be veri good in one specif academ subject to fullfil the employ requir as good as you can . and when there is time left tri to get a wide rang of gener knowledg .
