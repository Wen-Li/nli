when i think about my own experi consid car , i can tell that i alreadi use fewer car within the last three year . three year ago i use to own a car and i wa live in a small town in a rural area and it wa necessari for me to own a car to go to school , to go to work and to meet friend . for three year i have been live in berlin and in the last three year i never felt that i would need a car in such a big citi . reconsid my own experi and argument that i will offer below , i would agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as a first argument i would like to mention that it is evid that the oil recourc are go to it end within the next 30 to 40 year . sinc wether the oil nor the automobil industri show a real interest in chang their behaviour and their market plan , i assum that we will use all the oil until it gone and that in probabl 30 to 40 year there might be final a car that can be fuel with a new kind of `` gasolin '' . my second argument that speak against more car is that i expect that within the next twenti year there will defenit a next big scientifc develop that will make car useless . i truli believ in scienc and the car seem to me a rather old and antiqu way of transport and men will find better way for transport than we have today . mayb noth we can imagin right now but there will be someth and it will not be a regular car . my last argument is the scientif proof that more and more peopl are move into big citi . recent statist show that the rural popul declin wherea the urban popul is constantli grow . just like i did it , a lot of other peopl will move into the big citi to studi , to work and to live there . big citi are attract in mani way and thank to a sensibl public transport system one can easili live without a car in a big citi . as a conclus and to combin all my argument i would say that car are antiqu , the time are chang and humankind ha no need fo car who take a away space in grow citi that get bigger and bigger . therefor i agre with the statement and would say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
