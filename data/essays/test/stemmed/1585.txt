my market professor at the univers alway told me that the main rule of the advertis is make promot product more fashion then they realli are . i , therefor , beliv that in the 90 % of case the advertis make product use and necessari even if they are n't , sinc the advers alway show cute peopl use the promot product and , most of all , becaus the messag they give is abl to persuad peopl that if they use the adversid product they can becam cooler peopl . first , one of the main advertis strategi is the use of famou actor to promot product . an advertis where a famou and gorgeou actor is involv make automaticali the promot product desider sinc peopl start to beliv that if they use the advertis product they will be as cool as the famou actor is . for exampl in my coutri there are mani u.s. actor that come in itali in order to promot italian product , as , for instanc gorg clooney that ha been promot the martin , an alchool drink , sinc 2001 . the consegu is that mani peopl beliv that drink martini is cool , sinc georg cloney drink it . second , there are no rule or regul that impos to the advertis maker to be honest with the public , no moral exist in the advertis war . therefor , doe n't matter if it is true , the messag must be abl to convinc peopl to buy product . few month ago , in my countri a new advertis start to circulet on tv , it regard a new car , the safest one in the world ! . two week ago an articl on the main newspap of my countri inform us that , after some experi , the factori stop the product of the new car as it wa unsaf . noth happen in respect of the advertis , the onli consegu of the news wa no more pictur around the citi of itali show the `` safest car in the world ! '' final i beliv that the main purpos of the advetis is to tell the true but is persuad peopl to spent their money , therefor alway product seem much better then they realli are .
