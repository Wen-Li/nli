`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . i strongli agre with the statement becaus there are sever advantag for peopl to travel in a group led by a tour guid : a tour guid can guid the peopl in right way , how peopl see the entir citi and how peopl commun with other . firstli , a tour giuder can guid the peopl in the right way becaus he know the place well when compar to other peopl . for exampl , the famou place to visit , where to get proper food and board . so that the peopl doesnot miss the best place to visit . at the same time he take care of board and food . if peopl are alon in a place that which they doe n't know much it is alway problem for them to get good food . secondli , thi allow the peopl to see the entir citi . for exampl , some peopl doe n't know the citi and there is alway a chanc of miss import place . peopl spend a lot of money to travel and watch the import place and sometim peopl even feel bad if they miss some import place . final , it is difficult for peopl to commun with other and understand their languag . for exampl , if peopl travel to place that they doesn `` t know mean if a person is from andhra pradesh and if he want to visit a place say oothi ( a place in tamilnadu ) . they ca n't understand tamil so it is difficult to manag . thi problem can be solv onli if there is a tour guid . in summari , peopl can even travel place in a group with out a tour guid . but , i alway prefer to have a tour guid while travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus he is the respons person for a success tour .
