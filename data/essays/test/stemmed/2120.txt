i do agre with thi statement becaus one can not appli fact to situat . for that reason i consid understand idea and concept much more import than learn fact . as i alreadi state the major differ between learn fact and understand concept is that you can appli concept to differ area while fact are onli use for specif situat . for exampl if you mere memor a math formula it will onli help you if the teacher ask you to write down the formula . on the other hand if you actual understand the concept of how the formula work you will be abl to solv all kind of math problem with it . anoth reason i consid understand concept more import is that human are onli abl to learn from concept , not fact . let us take an exampl from histori . if one know when the second world war start and end , who particip etc. one would not be abl to recogn a situat where someth similar could happen . if one understand whi the second world war ha start and know the cause-effect-relationship thi person is like to recogn a similar situat . and onli if one is abl to recogn a situat one can think about possibl solut to prevent it from happen . the third reason whi i believ that learn fact is not veri import is that one is much more like to forget fact . if you memor that the boston tea parti wa in 1773 you are veri like to forget the year as time pass wherea if you learn whi and what happen you are like to still know the import thing even after a few month . that is becaus it is much easier for the brain to memor cause-effect-relationship that are connect to knowledg you alreadi have than to memor mere data . as i alreadi said , the concept are the most import thing becaus you can not appli mere fact to situat . therefor fact do not help you deal situat which everybodi ha to do everi day . thi is the reason whi i think that understand idea and concept is much more import for student .
