i agre that it is alway better to have a broad knowledg rather than to becom perfect onli in one subject . it is true that it is difficullt to learn all the subject at onc . but , if we think that we are wast our time in read all book , learn all the subject then that would be not appropri . learn all subject and becom perfect in all subject it would help us in futur . in my veiw , learn all subject , as far as we can . in life academ knowledg is veri much import to go ahead and take not onli one subject but also take part in all most all subject how much we can cover . later , in futur if we get an oppurtun in a particular feild where we are not perfect we have to lose that oppurtun . becom perfect onli in one subject , we will probabl face some difficulti in find a job or to set up a busi . for exampl , if we studi all subject like account , busi manag , statist , etc. , would all mainli help us in all feild if we are search for a job . mainli in ani compani where we attend an interview they would rather ask us ani question relat to ani subject at that time we might face a problem . at that time we will be blank and think what the answer is ? but , if we are perfect in all then no one can stop us to answer the question . we would be appreci for that and get a recognit on the day one itself . as the trend are chang the think power of a human is also chang . he want to gain more and more inform as he can . he want to be the top one in the world . he can be a perfect men or women in the world . gain all the academ knowledg and appli it in the person life or at work place it chang our career . so that if some one point out that he is weak in thi then it a neget remark . final , it alway better to be the best among all .
