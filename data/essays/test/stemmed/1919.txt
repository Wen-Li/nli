i hope that the number of car that travel on our street will decreas in the futur twenti year . it would be better for environ and health . despit thi i do n't beliv that someth like that will happen . the real situat is quit didiffer . i 'm not optimist about that . there are a lot more car today than in the past year . that 's becaus in the richer countri and contin ( such as u.s.a. , canada and europ ) lot of famili own more than a car . even though we know that car need fuel , and that fuel is goin to cost more and more in the futur becaus of the lack of new resourc to produc it , we need car . public mean of transport are not reliabl . till the public mean of transport are not reliabl peopl wo n't prefer them to their car . apart from that there are a lot of countri whose economi and finanti possibl are grow . also peopl that come from countri such as china or india may want to buy car and they are go to becom car mass produc and user in the next fifti year . they are countri that are grow . an exampl of whi car will increas in number is the fact that from few year the gp is rode also in china . it is a fututr market where to advertis the brand . it is hard to say what the econom speak grow countri will decid to do . they may spend teir money to crate street for lot of car or spend those money to creat or improv the public transport . if they decid for the second option mayb the number of car will decreas . but car bring with them a lot of place of work and money . it 's becaus of that that i think that the number of car wo n't decreas in the futur .
