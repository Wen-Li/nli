i disagre with the statement . first of all let me explain what i understand about `` success peopl '' . someon is success if one reach the goal for a certain task on time . the goal can be either the same everi time or someth total differ . it `` s the same with the task . the task can chang ore keep the same . let me provid an exampl to underlin my thesi . someon like to run a marathon . that is the goal . the task is to train for the marathon in order to achiv the goal . the train method can be allway the same and just becaus of have an ongo diali train it can be possibl to reach the goal . on the other hand train method might chang and even with the chang train method it is possibl to achiv the goal . in both situat the runner is not certain becaus unprodict situat might occur like an il , bad weather condit dure the marathon . in case the runner decid to do a iron-men he would chang hi goal from marathon to iron-men . he could keep hi train method from the marathon prepar or chang it to some other method . tri new thing the person ha to get use to chang which normal decreas the abil of be `` good '' and `` fast '' after a replic of the activ the person get more familar and the qualiti and the speed is increas . that mean tri new thing for the first time peopl are most like not as succes as peol who have done the activ more often . becau of the fact that new thing are of cours not well known the person tak the risk in be not successful .
