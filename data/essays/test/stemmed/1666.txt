first of all i would like to point out the fact that there are alreadi a lot of car today . as far as i am concern i think that there are too mani and i hope that there won t be more car in twenti year . on the one hand i think that there will be fewer car . in fact , becaus of the increas of technolog , i am sure that other sort of transport will be develop . i am think about train , plane , tramway , boat . car are veri conveni but it is more and more expens to have a car . in fact we can point out the higher cost of fuel and petrol . in addit to that , nowaday it becom difficult to obtain the drive licenc and there are more and more restrict law about car drive . consequ i think that peopl will find and use other transport which will be more conveni , easier and less expens . and we can underlin that the develop of technolog will help them and will give them the opportun to do that . on the other hand i am not so sure that there will be much fewer car . in fact car is veri use . nowaday you can go where you want with a car . you can be total independ . it is a wonder invent . thank to a car you can travel when you want , as far as you want . in addit to that fewer car accid can be notic . consequ that make peopl more confid and so there is an increas of the car use . govern put a lot of money in highway , car structur , road . that give the enviou to peopl to buy and use their car . moreov , the technolog enabl car to be more and more comfort . sometim you can find all what you want in your car . tv , cold drink , food , veri comfort seat . peopl can feel as if they were in their own hous . thu thi develop the car market . for all these reason i am not sure that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to conclud i hope that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year thank to the develop of other tranport . but i am not sure that will happen becaus they are veri use and comfort and the car market is still develop . but we must bear in mind that if there will be fewer car , perhap the other transport which will remplac them will be more pollut , danger . so perhap it is better that there will not be fewer car .
