it is not easi to take a side between if is more import for student to understand idea and concept or if is more import for them to learn fact , for these reason be agre or disagre with the statement it 's veri complic for me , howev , my kind of person is compar with the import of understand idea and concept and thi make me inclin to be agre with the statement . there are two characterist of my person that help me to illustr whi i am agre . first , i love to know the thing base , in other word , i dont 's like when i do n't understand thing from the begin . second , i am veri creativ , and that characterist ha implic like use differ idea or knowledg to built new thing or idea . both characterist help each other to support my elect , if i understand thing from the beginig and i have the concept clear , i have the capac to built new thing , besid i can deduc thing by myself . when you learn fact , you are avail to answer just what is involv in the thing you have learn , otherwis , when you have idea and concept clear , you can figur out thing that possibl would't be in the question . in conclus , for me , it is more enjoy the capac of creat new form of knowledg from the one i got befor and learn fact would not offer me tih possibl .
