in my person opinion is more import for student to undertand idea and concept , than , onli learn fact . learn about the idea and concept you would problabl get in to the fact , know step by step how is the result . the develp of the fact would give you the mean and the princip idea of it . whi doe occur ? it is not onli a matter of simpl proccess . moreov some fact ha an extens proccess that is difficult to learn , but , you would get incomplet inform if you onli learn the fact . i think , if you want to have a complet format in ani subject , the idea and the concept will teach you differ fact . for exampl , the idea that roman were the most import ancient poblat , it is a fact , but the concept is valid if you know that they develop a lot of construct tool , and a pretti well develop sociati , dure the conquest and empir . also the idea and he concept can give you the opportun to creat your own fact , stude the develp of some fact you will see new way of one simpl result . in addit one fact could had more that one option to be solv , but if you do not undertand the main idea , you will probabl get in the error that they alreadi found . in conclus , understand idea and concept , would give you the enough tool to have differ option that one fact can give .
