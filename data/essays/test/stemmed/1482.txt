i disagre with the idea that is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the knlowledg of idea and concept in a student life is necessari , is just a step of the long life that a student have . know that a counsciou student life begin in the elementari school , and some time befor , the student must know all the thori , idea and concept that scolar ha been stablish in the past . but no becaus that thi step is import mena that is more import that the fact . the fact in a student life is like stone in the river , you never know where will be place , for some student will be later and some fo them befor of the idea and concept were given to them . i will call fact as expier , and expier as student and human be is everywher , in the famili , with friend , not just in school and have no order in time . perhap , there is a time on a student life to listen , and therefor arriv the time to speak , and that happen when idea , concept and fact combin . usual in the student life it happen in the higher level of a bachelor degre or in the master or phd , and here is when you realli learn more about the fact rather than the idea or concept . i have mani exampl in my life that can support what a tri to explain in thi essay . for exampl , as a art student , i learn how a technic to paint , base on idea and concept , but i realli never will prove it if i will not satrt to paint , and in the apint i found the fact . or in phyisic , you can learn a lot about the idea and concept of isacc newton but you can face the fact hi first law if you grab some appl and let it drop from the fifth floor of ani build , and like i tell befor , you could realiz about the first law of newton befor know the idea . in conclus , the statement that for student to understand idea and concept is more import than it is for them to learn fact is unsustain . both are import and necessari , they act like step in student life . like happen in math , the order in fact do not misplac the product .
