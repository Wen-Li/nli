i definit agre with the statement accord to wich in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for sever reason . first of all , recent statist have shown that the sale of car have decreas these last year becaus the market is overwhelm of concurr and that the new car becom more and more reliabl and can be use longer . secondli , there are a lot of effort which are go to be made concern public transport almost in the great citi becaus it ha becom imposs to drive dure the rush hour ( e.g think about certain big citi like new-york , london , pari , ... ) . for instanc , in london , a tax ha alreadi been settl for enter with a car in the centrum . i 'm sure that that kind of solut wll be soon adopt by other citi . there are also mani effort which are project in order to connect the citi locat at the borrough to the centrum . for exampl , in belgium , they are go to build a rer like in franc to connect waterloo , lasn , ... ( small citi which are about twenti kilomet from brussel ) to the capit . thi will undoubtedli lead to a decreas of the numbersof car becaus for the moment peopl are get more and more bore with traffic jam and are wait with happi thi rer . final , anoth reason is that the price of petrolum ha hihghli increas these last year . when we know that the stock are limit , we ca n't reasonn imagin that the price will go down in the futur . it ha alreadi becom a lux to drive or have more than one car per household and i am convinc that in twenti year , thing wo n't chang . .. due to all these element ( which for sure are not exhaust ) , i am sure that the numer of car in tenti year will be less import than today .
