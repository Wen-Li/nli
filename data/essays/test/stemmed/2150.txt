`` success peopl do what other peopl do not want to do '' thi is my favorit say and i like to say it out loud everyday in order to encourag myself to break the limit of my confort-zon and to be a better person everi singl day . often i feel lazi or uncap to do certain thing in life and certainli the belief that `` sucess peopl tri new thing and take risk rather that onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , ha push me to my edg . i want to be succes therefor , i will do whatev it take to get what i want . that is the reason whi i am here today , on a cold sunday morn , take the toefl . i could have decid to be at home have a warm breakfast with my husband in bed , but i decid to proof and improv myself . i left him , sleep thi morn , warm and love befor i came to take thi test . that is also the reason whi i studi hard everynight after a heavi class day . i alway like to tri my hardest and even when thing do not result the way i want them to result , i gain mani posit thing out of tri . tri make me stronger and give me the chanc to live fulli and deepli . i think that life get form out experi . so as mani experi that i can have , the better i am , the better i will be readi for the futur . it is alway easier to quit or to be indifer to the movement of life . but i alway consid to be a good idea to keep on move forward , even when you are not sure of where it is that you are go . work hard , do differ thing , tri differ way , find your passion ! grow with life follow your own flow . everi littl effort that you make today , will mark the differ between you and the person right next to you tomorrow , who might had decid to not to do what it took to get what he want .
