peopl in the advertis industri and in market claim that public is a mean to correctli inform consum about the qualiti of a product . but person i believ that in fact advertis twist the present so as to make a product seem better . advertis is one of the mean use in market , togeth with price , distribut , etc . the whole goal of market is to convinc consum to buy a product , so that a compani make revenu . as a consequ , advertis tend to be partial in it descript of a product , often highlight just the posit qualiti without mention the drawback . for exampl , last month i gave a tri to a new isol glue for shower be advertis on the press . they were emphas it superior resist to water and it eas of deploy . howev , after the first use the remain glue becom veri sticki and dri up veri quickli if one doe not close it care - someth i realiz onli last week when i tri to use it , invain , for a second time ! hide the neg characterist is not the onli aspect in which advertis alter our percept of a product . when shown in pictur or at televis , the outlook of product is maxim through the sapient use of light , comput graphic , and is often accompani by nice sound effect . all of these factor are aim to increas the impact an object ha on our imagin , so that our desir to possess it , i.e. to buy it , is stimul . the impact on imagin is frequent augment also by the coupl of feel to the present of a product . i rememb a veri funni advertis campaign made by tenent 's , the scottish beer , on bbc a few year ago . there were two seri of spot , one for male consum , and one for femal . on the first , a man wa sit on a couch enjoy a soccer match , while a woman wa stand asid hold a tray with a glass of tenent 's . the man wa tast the beer and then would press a button to open a panel beneath the woman to make her fall below . .. '' not fresh enough '' , he wa say . fun , sens of domin , and sens of perfect all appeal to men . on the women 's version , the woman wa stand in front of a fridg at the end of a long corridor wave a glass of beer and say `` t is readi ! '' ( a smart play on word for a british audienc , by the way ) . the man would run to the beer , onli to crash against an invis barrier at the entranc of the room . .. and the woman would enjoy the beer . here , the sens of a smart reveng wa the main point to appeal the ladi . both version were appeal to the sens of enjoy , and not pure to the product `` beer '' , thu make it appear for what it commun rather than for what it is .
