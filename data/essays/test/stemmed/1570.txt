in my opinion , i am agre with thi statment , becaus i think that if do not tri to made new thing you will never learn to make new thing . some time when you make someth by the first time the most probabl is that it do not will be a good work or will be as you want , and you will have to do in a better way the next time and you will be learn mani new thing and will obtin new experi . for exampl , i from quetzaltenango , and i live ther all my life , but some day i have to drive to guatemala citi , and i never drive here , and i do not know thi place veri good and the fisrt time i wa lost , and i do not know where i wa , but the experi of drive mani time here you will go learn new place , and the same is with all , for exampl , i work fix comput but the fir time that i made it almost burn a comput , but the experi that i have now is a lot , and in cluse i can repair that in a few minut ; but if you onli made onli one thing , the most probabl is that you will made it veri well , but you can not do ani thing more , and is import thath you know mani thing , becaus for exampl if in your hous the tub in your bathroom is not work , you will call at the person that will repair that , but if you know some thing about it , but you can not rapair that becaus you do not have time , you can leav the work at thi person and you are sure that he will do a good work becaus you know what it ha and what happen with that . in conclus , i am agre with the statment `` success peopl tri new thing and take tisk rather than onli do what they alredi know how to do well '' becaus it help you to be a better person , and if you take risk in your life you will take experi in mani thing , and if you do someth wrong , you will know that the next time you will not do it again or you will do it in a difer way .
