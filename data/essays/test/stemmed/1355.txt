i agre with the fact that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . even if learn fact is someth import , undersatnd them is realli more import and actual veri more use . i explain , learn someth is a processu that impli the activ of your memori , precis , most of the time , your short-tim memori . studi have shown that when you learn someth `` by heart '' you will forget almost evryth after 2 week . except if you are veri interest about the subject . in that case , it assum that you have made the second step . .. : understand the idea and the concept . my opinion is that with the processu of understand someth , you will keep it in your memori longer and that is the most interest thing . most of all it wa proven scientif . for exampl , i rememb when i wa at high school , i hate the physic class becaus the teacher wa n't veri clear in hi explan , confus , nobodi could understand him , never . it result in an exam where peopl just learn the sheet , by heart . final , now , i do n't rememb at all what wa thi class about . i thing it is a shame , becaus if i had understood the purpos , i will first rememb , at least some part but also , i would enjoy it . becaus everybodi hate thi class and the teacher . convers , i had a veri hard and high level of ancient greek class , but with a nice and so great teacher . he explain so well . when i went out the class , i wa abl to explain everyth to my mother . for me , thing seem immedi easier and more pleasant to studi . inde , when you understand what you are learn , it is easier to studi it after the class , and to rememb . i realli agre with the fact that understand the concept you are learn is veri essenti if you want to rememb it . i sustain it strongli and think that teacher who know that are most of the time `` good teacher '' love by everybodi , even if the class is difficult . learner must also know that becaus if they onli studi `` by heart '' they will not go far and are more suscept to get what we call `` the gap '' dure the exam . . they will suddenli forget everyth becaus of the stress . i can conclud that understand what you learn is the key to pass the exam and rememb it . it is a shame to wast all these effort to just forget it after a few time !
