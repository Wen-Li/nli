peopl can nowaday interest themselv and studi whatev subject they want , thank to the internet . the widespread idea is that thi is a good thing . but what about the academ subject ? do we have to tri to learn a bit of the broader rang of subject or special our studi in a singl way ? i do believ that we should tri hard to have knowledg on sever academ subject . be a generalist allow you to make your futur safer . let 's imagin that i have chosen to studi nuclear scienc onli and that , in ten year a world agreement will forbid the use of such a power - even if it is not about to becom real at the moment . i will not find ani job and i will have to go back to school to studi someth els or find a job with no special studi level requir . gener speak , have a wide knowledg of sever academ subject prove that you are a curiou person who is not afraid by find out other domain and who is mayb much more flexibl than the other . if you lose your job , you can even find anoth one in a branch you have studi befor . it is a way of be well-mor integr in a societi : you can talk to someon whose main interest is formula one such as someom who is keen on the renaiss period . mayb , they will be both brighter in their specif domain , but to their contact you will continu to learn . and thi is not the case for peopl who have a singl subject of interest . they eventu are not so-wel social integr . howev , we need them for job in the research domain for exampl which demand a lot of them . but , i personn could not do that . in conclus , i need to commun a lot and express my opinion on ani subject , i am so curiou that i could not stand special in onli one domain . that is whi i think have a broad knowledeg of mani academ subject is better .
