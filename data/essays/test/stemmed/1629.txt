nowaday there are mani topic which are controversi , one of these is if student must understand idea or learn fact . mani peopl believ is better to have comprehes abaout what you are studi . on the other hand a lot of peopl prefer learn fact , mayb they have argument to support their belief . i am inclin to believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them learn fact by mani reason . i feel veri strongli that with thi method you can learn about the subject , you are creat your own knowledg of the matter and probabl you will never forget thi idea you have studi , for exampl if you are studi busi you will appli the idea you have learnt in the futur if you are work for exampl in a bank . the greatest advantag of understand idea is you will have to memor less concept than if you are learn fact so you will work less , for exampl i am studi architectur , and mani subject like math , or structur , or physic you have to resolv a lot of problem , and if you use thi method , you onli need to understand few idea to do thousand and thousand of problem . in my opinion thi way to work is easier , more intellig and also you will obtain better score in your exam . there are sever reason to support that thi is the correct way , if you understand the concept or idea you could appli thi concept to anoth subject if someday you need it , for exampl in my architectur studi if i understand a lot of formula and concept in math i can appli thi in the structur lesson in order to calcul buld structur . if you understand one idea you have the knowledg or the posibl to transmit thi idea for exampl one person that studi astronomi and understand the concept of graviti consequ he can explain you perfectli thi phenomenon . in my opinion i think thi is the correct way to work and the peopl who learn fact is becaus of they want to work less , and they are do not mind the subject they are studi .
