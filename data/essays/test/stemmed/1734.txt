the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid rather than travel alon . i feel it is true becaus i would like to share one of my expereinc , when i went to chennai i wa left all alon to go out with noon to tell me where to go . you have noon to guid you through the citi , you tend to get bore and without a companion and without a guid a person is defin get himself in a funni and dumb situat . if you travel in group you tend to be more cheer and share xperienc anmd talk happili . and if you have a guid with you it would be more cheer and enjoy . the guid can help your way through the citi and help your way out with the transport etc . one may feel that travel alon will help him a lot or it may be enjoy but it is all wrong notion . the best way travel is in group or with the person who know the citi and is well acquantain with the town or so call citi . i have anoth expereinc thi wa when i went to mumbai , we were all in a group , our wa a group of 10 member . if you go out you enjoy the tour throughli and never have a dull moment in the tour . we had also taken a guid in the citi who help us in find good hotel , good food , and good transpor . a tour guid is a person who will help you in all the physic amenti start from the transport to the miscellen activ . also the group we are go through should be live enough to have a fun time . alway a group led by a tour guid help you in have a no problem tour .
