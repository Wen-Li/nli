i mostli agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . thi kind of i dea is said at everywher and becom a huge problem . the reason i use the word `` mostli '' is becaus i use to give much time to help my commun when i wa in elementali school . i particip in a lot of commun event such as valleybal game and road race by the sea and the volunt recicl and so on . i had so much fun at the time , and i think i wa somewhat help the commun . but sinc i becam a junior high school student , i get not to particip in ani commun event , becaus i get too much work to do for myself rather than for my commun . thi can be said for everyon els . and i also have other reason for make thi statement more reason . as long as i know , there is no interest inform about commun 's event . nobodi would even know how to help commun . i previous wrote whi i think no young peopl give much time to help their commun but now i can put some exampl for what happen in result of the littl or no help for commun . the first one is at the disast such as at fire or some scientic errupt . the result of young peopl 's no help made disast more terrif becaus they have the most strongest power . the second exampl is what happen in my citi . sinc they do n't particip in ani event which commun held , the most event becam onli for elder peopl ; thi led less young peopl particip in . from these fact and exampl for the result , we can see that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
