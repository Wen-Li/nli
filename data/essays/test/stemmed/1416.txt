i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i can quot mani reason to support my statement . in a modern societi , it not possibl to restrict anyon from use car becaus of hi busi schedul . with popul grow rapidli , the increas need of modern societi are increas and henc the number of car are grow , also , becaus of grow popul the unemploy problem is increas and henc is demand a busi schedul from the employe and thu forc them to go for easi and safe mean of travel . so , thi search for a mean of transport might end anyon with usag of car . also , with grow technolgi the peopl are move from old mean of transport by buse to new and advanc mean of transport . the youth are easili influenc by new technolog car and race car and might forc their parent to buy him one . everyon in thi societi want to improv their social statu by save someth for their later need . the social posit is measur mostli by the person 's wealth and thi endur to the vehicl they are use . so , in gener peopl want to go for a car discard their old two wheeler , given a chanc . in some case they may be forc to take a car just becaus the famili member are increas from two when they are marri to four after have children . in some case when someon get marri , though the dowri is prohibit , becaus peopl are not use to it , they give some present , in gener a vehicl so that their daughter doe n't suffer . if one get an oppurtun to buy a car thi way , i do n't think he will refus to take one . in the current situat , i do n't see ani possibl of reduct in the usag of car , if the popul increas thi way and peopl do n't chang their way of think .
