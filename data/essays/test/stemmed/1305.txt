the industri of advertis ha develop so tremend that advertis and commerci have becom an inevit part of our daili life . there is not a singl day that we have not seen an ad on a billboard as we drive our car , or we have not encount a commerci on televis while we are wathc our favourit tv show . but , the question is that are the advertis realli decent and reflect the realiti ? or are they simpli the product of some subtl strategi to deceiv us and make use of our money ? i have the opinion that advertis are realli convinc us that the product are much better than they are in realiti . firstli , the purpos of an advertis is to persuad us to buy the mention product whatev the qualiti of the product is . for thi aim , it is veri typic of advertis to exagger the desir properti of the product . it may even happen that the product do not have the marvel properti suggest in the ad . for exampl , i onc saw a commerci on televis about a shampoo claim that my hair will be so soft as it ha never been if i use that shampoo . consequ , i went to the market and purchas the product . howev , when i wash my hair with it , i saw that it wa even wors than my ordinari shampoo that i wa alreadi use . anoth reason whi i am convinc that advertis are deceiv is base on my observ about the industri . the industri process of sale , which cover a wide rang of phase like the prepar and the product of the item , the transport of the product to sever market and sell the product , involv a huge amount of money . product and sale is an industri process , and the uniqu aim of thi process is noth but make money out of it . as far as money is concern , the produc will do anyth to cut down on the capit spent to prepar the product . so whi spend a treasur on the product phase to implement product of except qualiti instead of produc someth with just moder featur and be persuas enough to make peopl but it ! these point bring me to the conclus that the advertis are not reliabl and accur enough to believ in them and plan our purchas habit base on them . we must not believ what we see and what they want us to believ , but we must behav accord to our own reason when we are spend our money .
