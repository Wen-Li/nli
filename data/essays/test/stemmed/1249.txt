in modern life , when you turn on your tv , you will hear mcdonald ' `` i 'm love it '' ; when you go to the street , you will see nike 's `` just do it '' ; ... it is an era of advertis . you would see them everywher , in the bu station , in the highway road , in the plane , etc . howev , do these advertis exactli reflect the real product ? as far as i am concern , my answer is `` no '' . for one thing , the advertis alway magnifi , or even `` creat '' the merit of the product . it is quit common in the product of make-up . the director of the advertis alway hire some famou model or movi star , and claim that the beauti of these person should be contribut to the special product . they concern noth about the truth , but the busi effect of the advertis . for anoth , the advertis would gener trivil , or even neglect the disadvantag of the product . some product may even have side effect , to which most advertis would pay no attent . a case in point is an equip for eyesight therapi sever year ago . in the advertis , mani children who had use thi equip were interview `` randomli '' , and claim that the therap result wa quit satisfi . howev , when thi product wa put into real use , it caus mani children to lose their eyesight perman . as a result , the manufactur and the advertis produc were sentenc after that . in addit , some advertis may not even mention the effect of the product , but onli to link the product with the consum ' special emot . for exampl , a home-mad food simbol it as `` the tast of mother '' . you would never know how thi food exactli tast through the advertis . neither would you know what effect thi food will do to your bodi . to conclud , to be a wise consum , i think we should pay littl attent to what is said in advertis . the reason manufactur pay to make advertis is to gain profit , not to tell the consum the true stori .
