i think most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are becaus that ' s the reason of public . the main reason it is to sale and the second reason it is to keep costum , no one in a commerci it is go to say `` do not use thi product , it doe not work '' suposs that you are read a fashion magazin and you find thi amaz product that make your skin look '' youngest '' no one can stop the pass of time , becaus it is not revers , but they do not tell you that , they tell you that the cream '' young '' make your skin better , of cours if you do not use ani hidrat to your skin , make an excel diet , quit smoke and do exercis your skin it is gonna look horribl , but for use the cream you can not revers the past of the time . other product it is the food , on the pictur the meat look bigger and more juici , and when you get your order your meat doe not look as the meat of the pictur , of cours the meat of the pictur wa made for the public , made for a realli good photograph and a good program of photoshop . but other product that in the advertis recommend no to use are cigarret , in the adevertis prevent the use know that the respons it 's the costum , but in the public they use happi peopl to show how you are gonna feel if you smoke their cigarret but do not get upset , not all public it is bad , of cours the main idea it is to sell a desir , but as costum we have the choic to accept or not a product , we know that in the public are lyi , but sometim that lyi make us happi . i
