i disagre with the statement that travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way . i think that the best way to travel is to creat own plan and travel without a tour guid . the reason are as follow . first , if i go to travel , i would like to decid the time schedul and place to visit by myself . in the tour , time schedul and the place to visit is usual almost fix . i wonder if these thing are sitabl for me. 3 year ago , i join a tour in thai land becaus that wa first time to got to the countri and i thought there were not so mani peopl who could speak english . in the tour , tour guid wa good but time schedul wa tight . also , the place i want to go wa not includ in the visit place in the tour . at the time , i thought i sholud arrang my travel by myself if i have alreadi had the place where i want to go or the activ i want to do in the travel . second , i want to save my money for travel . and i want to investig my money to studi english instead of a tour . if we join a tour , we need to pay for the tour guid . so , that mean that it will be more expens than without a tour guid . in my last travel with a tour guid , it cost twice as much as without a tour guid . it wa so expens , but i could not satisfi . to prevent thi situat , it is better to creat own plan and to trave by ourselv . third , to ceat travel plan is so fun and interest for me . it will make my travel so memor . in conclut , i prefer to travel by myself not with a tour guid . i hope mani peopl tri to creat their own plan .
