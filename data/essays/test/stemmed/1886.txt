if a person is travel to a certain countri around the world . the person can be led by a group of a tour guid . as thi can be a benefit or unus way . the benef veiw , is the opportun to meet new peopl and exchang knowledg and intrest . by have a tour guid to lead the way that he or she take you to the place that are worth to seek it can be a histor or modern area . the person would be handl the pressur of make difficult descion becaus it reli on one person which is the tour guid . he or she will be handl and plan the trip for the day . and the person main conern is enjoy their time in that countri . the unus idea , which is not coopert with the group or with the tour guid have argument and disagr . the other fact , would be dislik the tour guid that the person feel that the tour guid is not plan the tour correctli . have a group which mean that the lost of time need to make sure that each person is on the bu or that mayb meet on a particular area , wait for all the memeb in the group to be there on time . some peopl prefar travel with the member of a famili , friend or by themselv . it is becaus it enjoyb moment to be with somebodi your know and relat to . travel without a group and a tour guid which mean nobodi is plan the day and by just plan thier day as they move along . i usual travel by a memebr of a famili becaus i feel much comfortubl . some peopl who feel that travel with a group and a tour guid it can be sutabl also . from my point of view , travel either way it is up to the person to decid .
