some peopl say that young peopl , nowaday , do not give enough time to help their commun . i think that nobodi , actual , can do gener about thi question for the follow reason . it is imposs , for me , to measur the interest of young peopl in help their commun . the second point i consid import to undelin is the tendenc to critic young peopl and to consid the peopl who live in the past ( especi young peopl ) better than the peopl live in the present time . i think that there are a lot of young peopl who give their time partecip activ for the well of their commun . there are also boy and girl that are enthusiast about thi idea , but they do n't have enough time becaus they spend most of their day studi or work . i think also that the qualiti of the time dedic to these activ is more import that the strenght of the time spent on them . moreov , there are certainli young peopl that do n't have much interest in help their communieti . for me is import to underlin that the problem is not the age ; ye , i agre that it is a veri good thing that youg peopl could give their time to help their commun , but also all the compon of the societi ( adult peopl and old peopl , men and women ) have to be involv in thi good project . final i think that nowaday young peopl have more opportun to becom protagonist of the commun they belong ; thank to the school and the spread of the media they can know better the main problem , and to feel better involv than in the past time in solv them .
