the assign of the advertis is to show the advantag of a product , becaus the peopl should buy it . but here is the problem . some advertis show a product better than it realli is . the peopl thing someth of a poduct , buy it and then see the truth of it . in my opinion that is the problem of the strong competit in thi centuri . firm want to surviv in the market and so work with all opportun . the custom should buy their product and not the product from anoth firm and for that reason they also work with unfair thing . a veri good practic exampl for that problem are the work of the energi firm in germani . the advertis of these firm show low price and the best avail condit . but last week the newspap wrote about some ( not puplic ) negoti of the energi firm where they bargain a common price level of energi . the custom , the govern etc. did not know anyth about that negoti process and after a while you heard in the tv that one energi firm increas their price . after some day the next firm increas their price and so on . the problem here is that the custom do not have the opportun to chang the energi supplier , becaus all have the same condit . and so the custom can not do anyth against thi . so you can see that thi problem in the advertis come from the strong competit . if the competit would be of a normal level then the custom would get what they see . the competit is veri import for function of the market , but the firm should recogn the custom valu . the custom confid is the main driver for their firm success . but if the custom do not confid in the firm and their product than the firm can not surviv anymor . my messag to the firm are : recogn the custom valu , becaus they buy your product . so make a true advertis of your good .
