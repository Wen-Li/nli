i entir agre with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject for two main reason . in the first place i 'm convic that it is realli import to studi mani academ subject in veri differ field becaus it help student to be open-mind with is an import qualiti for the present and the futur . moreov if we learn art , histori , music , which are subject that are often outsid our major field of studi , we learn at the same part a huge part of our gener cultur . thu , if we know histori or religi scienc , it can help us to know where we are from . by the way we can thu be more toler with peopl who have differ cultur and understand them better than befor . philosophi is also a veri import subject to learn even if it is not enough valoris in colleg . if you studi philosophi you get use to listen to differ point of view which is not easi when you believ that your is the best . secondli i think that it 's import to studi mani subject becaus it can be use later in our profession life . it is true that we need to be special to get a job as doctor or lawer or everi thing els . howev i would like to underlin that today lot of peopl have to chang of job in the middl of their life . it can happen lot of time in a societi such as our where the sucess is synonymu to adapt . so even if you are a lawer you could have the opportun to becom a paint seller , for exampl , but thi would be possibl onli if you have some basic knowledg about art . in conclus , i would say that a broad knowledg is a big gift
