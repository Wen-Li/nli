it ha been said that most advertis make produc seem much better than they realli are . i agre with thi statement for the follow reason . first , the product compani want to get more profit from their product . the product compani need suffici profit from their product to compens thier cost to produc it . it is necessari for the product compani to promot sell the new product . therefor , the product compani have the advertis compani to make an attract advertis , even if it contain the mislead statement . i have work for a japanes advertis compani for about 6 year . one of our client is a pharmasut compani . they produc not onli the medicin but also the supplement . the supplement is the top sell product that bring a lot of profit to the compani . the client alway care about the sale of supplement and alway say `` make good advertis '' . thi `` good '' mean that they want us to creat good look advertis to earn more profit . therefor , we sometim creat the advertis that seem much better than the product realli are . second , the situat that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is caus by the natur of advertis . the advertis ha it own purpos to make the product more attract . therefor , i think it even natur the content of advertis is better than that of real product . when it come to the reason whi the advertis need , there is no doubt that the product compani and advertis compani want to sell the product more and more . it is not the consum who ask the advertis compani to creat the advertis . if the advertis say that there is a lot of but point of thi product , that is no longer advertis . in conclus , the compani pursu thier profit from the product and the purpos of advertis is to make the apper of the product good . i definitelli agre with the statement .
