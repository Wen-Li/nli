i 'm sure agre with the statment . i think that veri often advertis lead our percept of realiti in the wrong path . and there are differ way , i think , that buis , or compani in gener , use in order to convinc us that someth is realli good . i think that one mean they use is the amount of advertis . in fact we you can find everywher a pictur of a product , or you can listen to a person who speak about anoth product , and so on . for examl when you wacth the televison or you read newspap you will sure find at least half of the inform about someth that someon want you to buy . thank to thi tecniqu you are led to buy someth . howev , veri often , if you buy it , you will be disappoint just becaus the good or the servic you have bought doe n't correspond with the thing you had seen befor . moreov , in my opinion , it would be interest understand also the reason thank to someon lead us to buy someth even if we know that veri often they do n't correspond with the realiti . howev i think that thi is one difficoult problem becaus it 's relat with our faculti to choos freeli and it should be explain with some psychologiacl aspect . i do n't think it would be appropri to speak about them . i want rather exaplain an exampl that happend to me just three day ago . i need a new brush for my hair . i wa wathc tv in the even and suddent an adertis occurr on televison . it describ a vari multi function brush with batteri includ ( there wa a beauti girl in the spot ! ) . of cours i 've bought it but i 've soon realiz that it wa veri differ from televison . it wa veri small and abov all it wa everyth except use !
