all advertis no matter if they are tv add or magazin add have the same goal and that goal is to sell . in my opinion advertis doe not make product seem better than what they realli are , they just show the cualiti of the product . a market campaign ha the object of creat advertis that will sell a product . therefor the product need to have an imag , a set of cualiti that set it appart from ani other product in the market . thi doe not mean that the advertis is not tell the true or miss lead the consumm just becaus it focus more on it advantag than on it disadvantag . it is also import to keep in mind that an advertis is a reproduct of the real thing . it creat an imag of the product and it also allow the consumm to develop a relationship between the product and what he or she expect to abtain from it . a good advertis will not creat fals expect , it will show what the product is capabl of do , but never what it will not do . as i mention befor a market campaign object is to sell and the advertis disign for thi porpus are ment to creat a need that did not exist befor . as a resoult of thi there might be consumm that might feel that their need are not be cover or that the product seem to be better than what it realli is . thi doe not mean at all that the product is bad or that it faild to do what it said it could . what thi mean is that the consumm need anoth kind of product to meet hi or her need . i realli do not think that all product look better on the advertis than what they are . most of the product do what they say they could do in their advertis , but in an open market like the one we have today it is imposs to control everi advertis and what it say . but we can not make a gener becaus of a small sampl from a huge univers .
