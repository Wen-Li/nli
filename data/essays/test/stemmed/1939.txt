i do agree with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi known how to do well . success peopl achiev their success througth their continu hardwork , concentr , commit and face risk . it is hard to believ that peopl can achiev success with out take risk . do onli what we know will never help in the long run . it could make happi for a short period of time . but , in the later stage we need to strugl for not tri new thing . for exampl if we do n't abreast with latest technolog and innov we do need to depend lot on other peopl . we need to spend lot of money for everi function that need new technolog . similarli at the job we do n't get enough pay and promot . we need to work for the same pay and in same posit throughout . tri new thing may need to face certain risk . they are all for a limit time . when we start a new task we do need to face certain risk . the task need more attent and time in the begin to learn . all thi is just for a period of time . later , we are pretti much better at work compar to the other . get good posit at the job . tri new thing help in grow mental and econom . for exampl , if we see the peopl like microsoft , googl , yahoo . everyon wa pretti good in their posit . if they keep do the same what they were do they could not withstand in the market . there is a lot of competit that come . new challang need to be face . if microsoft just think the window is a user friendli softwar and there is no need to develop new version and face new problem , we could not see ani advanc in today 's window oper system . the competetor would have taken over microsoft by thi time . we know how the window softwar develop . first it start with just basic function . then at the time of each newer version there were sever new function ad and new problem were start . all those problem were onli for a certain period of time . later they streamlin each version and made as the best softwar compar to the previou version and the competetor . tri new thing will alway need to face certain risk but they are all for the good in the long run . therefor , i strongli agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' .
