i agre that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . although i think that it ha not alway been thi way . due to the technolog invent and to cultur chang , the import aspect of life in the eye of young peopl have chang . wherea help in a commun and be activ as a volont ha been quit common some year ago , young peopl nowaday prefer spend money , and have as much free time as they can have . in order to afford all good which they assum to be necessari , they start work veri earli . they are convinc that be wealthi and show it fulfil them with joy and happi . in the meantim they neglect that thi emot profit can also be achiev differntli . to young peopl `` profit '' often equal money . to my mind , profit ha it mean in a whole other aspect . my understand of profit is to enlarg the joy and happi of the largest number of peopl possibl . help in commun as a volont is one of the best way to achiev thi goal and to enlarg the resent happi around me . the contanct to other peopl and the offer help for exampl contribut a lot to thi goal . the fact that nowaday money ha becom more and more import and the it could even be state that `` money rule the world '' is a sad develop . qualiti such as loyalti and friendship have been exchang by egoism and the desir to be rich in a materialist way . be rich in non-materialist way is noth to aim at anymor . i am convinc that young peopl have to make up their mind and serious overthink what they have been do . the should reflect the real import of be aliv . possess a lot of money can defin not be the reason for be live in a commun . a communitiy is a group where mani peopl should feel home and be happi . all member of it should contribut as much as they are capapl to make the live as beauti as it can be .
