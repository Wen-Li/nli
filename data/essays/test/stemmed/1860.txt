i strongli desagre with the question say that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i trulli think that to understand the concept and the idea is equal import with learn fact . student need to understand idea and concept point out by the teacher . the student also need to have proof and learn fact of what the teacher is say . give an exampl , if a student is follow a chemestri lesson and the teacher make him understand the concept of an experi but the student ha n't done the experi , the student will understand it but he will be miss the practic part of it , and he would not poss the proof that what the teacher is say is true . understand idea and concept is a theoric part of the studi , fact are the practic part of studi . when in primari school we learn that an addit is the concept of ad number togheth but that the teacher doe not show it with an exampl , the childrend will get the concept of addit but will not know how to appli thi new concept . therefor it is import that the teacher show to the student a fact and prove him that it work and connect with the concpet he ha learn . i.e : 1 + 1 = 2 , thi is a fact and with thi fact we can show that one candi plu anoth one equal to two candi , it is a proof for the concept of ad number togeth and the children will appreci it . some fact can be seen or even touch that help a person appreci the concept he ha learn . it also can make a person , personn content grow to show fact on what he ha learn and show that he know what he is talk about . sometim we learn fact but we do n't fulli understand the idea or concept that is hidden . thi is whi i am strongli convinc that understand idea and concept is link with learn fact and that it is import for a student to get both inform . one without the other is not use .
