i agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . i start by defin success as have a person , emot , monetari or creativ gain in ani aspect of life . i believ that risk taker have the chanc to test new idea and accomplish their person dream , whilst peopl who do not take risk pick the safer choic which is to keep do what they are use to do . they do not pursu their fantasi and therefor will never get to know if their dream would have been success . for exampl a person work in a bakeri , who know how to do well a certain pastri and never tri to open hi own store . he doe not take the risk , thu he will never know if hi dream would work , and will never be success while he keep do hi job even though he is veri good at it . peopl who do not take risk are afraid of failur , sinc do what they do bring such stabil to their life they do not feel the need to chang . howev take risk even though they could end in failur , that failur would teach you new lesson in life , it would give you new experi . risk taker can develop idea , deepen concept and improv their technic , sinc take that extra step will creat a whole new set of possibl which will give them not onli person and emot gain but also will widen their creativ . for exampl , pursu a sing carreer instead of just be a sing teacher . if that person would tri to record a cd , may be she would even end up meet new singer , band memeb , peopl from the music industri who could help her sing , give her tip and even widen her scope and introduc her to new rhythm . that way by take a risk , she ha a person and a creativ gain , and she could even improv her vocal capac . if she had not taken that risk she would still be a teacher , teach the same class for the rest of her life with no possibl of growth or success . in conclus i think that risk taker are capabl of gain mani posit experi , by follow their dream . they will not be left with the doubt of whether that idea would have work or not , and even though they are more expos to failur , that failur come along with valuabl lesson that will help them in futur situat , that in itself determin success in an aspect of life . thu risk taker have more probabl of have person gain , and therefor be success , than a person who pick the safer choic .
