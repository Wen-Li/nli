i have alway studi in school which ask student to understand idea instead of learn fact with no reflexion . i am well-awar of the advantag in understandind idea . i can also imagin the advantag in learn fact . there are strong advantag in learn fact . the first point i would like to make is that it is an excel way to get a larg gener cultur . understand idea take time wherea learn fact can be quit quick . thu peopl can learn more thing . anoth argument is that in life , peopl do not need to prove exact inform becaus it ha been alreadi prove and all they have to do is use inform for a particular purpos . for instanc , in my school , gener cultur and histori test were usual multiple-choic test becaus known the fact wa the most import point . if there are strong advantag in learn fact , there are some even more compel advantag in understand idea . first , even if it can be long , peopl get a better memori of these fact becaus they have understood the concept and in the case they have forgotten the fact , they can be abl to find it out . secondli , peopl can more adequ use these fact becaus they know how the whole theori work . for exampl , i onc had to cope with an intric math problem and i knew all the proof and concept for each formula . therefor it wa veri clear for me how to use them and i final reach the solut . to conclud , i think that it is far more import to understand idea that to learn fact . learn fact give a larger gener cultur but peopl will mayb not abl to use it adequ . understand idea give import asset to cope with problem , which is veri import in activ life .
