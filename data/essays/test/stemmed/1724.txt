think about educ process it is possibl to affirm that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the understand allow the student not onli to adquir knowledg , but also to use that knowledg in the solut of differ real problem . a commun educ problem is that the teacher usual ask the student to learn fact and not to understand the concept or idea that they are learn , so the learn process becom an insol thing that doe not result use for the real life . if the student do not understand what they have learnt and they onli worri about memor inform , that inform or knowledg will be complet unus for them . on the other hand , the learn process ha to be signif for the student , so he can be motiv with hi own learn . in thi way , if the teacher doe not help the student to understand the idea or concep , the learn process will not be signif for the student and he will not be interest on continu learn what he would consid unus thing . the knowledg or the inform becom interest for ani person when he or she is abl to understand that inform , when you onli memor or learn fact it is difficult for you to get interest on that . what is more , if a person doe not understand one concept or idea it would be difficult to keep that idea in his/her mind , in other word , the inform that is not understood is easili forget . in conclus , in the teach process is veri import to worri about the learn process of the student for help them not to learn fact or memor inform , but to understand the idea and concept that they have adquir , and also for him/her to be abl to appli the knowledg in real context .
