in my opinion , idea and concept do not exist on their own , but are base on fundament fact that we all agre on . howev , if one must choos between them , i believ that understand ideaa and concept is more import than mere rememb fact . first of all , mere learn fact rare give you gener idea or concept , but if you have a good understand of idea and concept , then fact natur follow in mani case . for exampl , in an introductori econom class , if a professor just tell student that the `` gover regul of maximum price on certain good result in a shortag of and the subsequ illeg trade of those good , '' student may tri to understand it intuit , or more like , just tri to memor it . howev , if studenst are first taught to understand the concept of suppli and demand , the specif fact natur follow , togeth with numer other piec of inform . by draw a simpl graph of suppli versu demand , student realiz that fix the maximum price of a good mean that more demand occur than suppli at a particular price , and therefor a shortag would natur follow . understand concept and idea is also gener more benefici than learn fact , becaus fact , especi complic one , are easili forgotten . howev , properli understood idea and concept are rare forgotten . actual , forgotten fact may even be reconstruct from those idea and concept . typic exampl aris in mathemat : mani student forget exact equat after some time ha pass , but the idea use in deriv those equat are not so easilli forgotten-th idea that help us form logic thought and induct . by care learn those idea and concept by heart and examin them , some student may even be abl to reconstruct those equat . in thi regard , student will have a better chanc of rememb what they have learn over the long term , if they concentr more on learn how variou theori and equat are form . in summari , understand idea and concept is prefer over learn fact , in two respect . it remov the necess to memor mere fact , becaus fact natur follow from a good understand . it is also an inargu effici and effect way of learn , becaus idea and concept remain with us longer than just fact .
