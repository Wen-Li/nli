ani compani ha at least an object to increas it product ' sale . for that , the compani 's manag should do sever method to reach thi goal . for exampl , the manag is suppos to enhanc the product ' qualiti , decreas their cost and let the custom recogn their featur and benefit . how can the compani let the custom recogn the compani ' product with thier benefit and featur ? the answer is clear that it should be done by have mani advertis use news paper , tv and other to advertis the compani 's product . howev , i total agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the reason is , as i indic in the first paragraph , to increas the product ' sale in order to increas the compani revenu and profet as well . in my opinion , the custom who have the responsibl to recogn good product from bad product by not believ all the compani ' advertis but check and verifi thi by themselv . for exampl , if there is an advertis in the tv say when you have or buy a toyota car , you will get better mainten servic by repair your car within 24 hour onli . in fact , thi advertis could be true for someon who live in ny but not in middl east . for that , the custom should check his/her local market and verifi that thi type of servic are avail in order to get a new car . in addtion , the custom may have thi 24 hour mainten servic for maint his/her car but the qualiti of the mainten servic will be low and not as it should be if he/sh use to get in differ car mainten shop . in conclus , ani compani should consid the advertis method as one of the major object to reach thier custom . as a result , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . for that , the custom should recogn and check the product not onli by these advertis but also by other way .
