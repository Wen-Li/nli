i disagre with thi view . on the other hand of develop countri which are tri to protect natur , develop countri are tri hard to catch up with develop countri . to begin with , develop countri are develop land , such as forest and farm , to be attract . so they build mall that have mani place to play , such as shop center , super market , cafe , and so on . and usual , those place are made far from place peopl live . that mean , peopl should achiev at least one car per famili in order to play around thier countri . for exampl , when i visit honkong , it wa not too much to say that i could see more car than peopl . accord to an woman live in honkong , peopl live there should have a car as they must go far place by busi , as they should go around whole countri a day . secondli , develop countri succeed to make car that use less or none gasolin , which move by solar system or wind or other kind of energieswhich use less sourc than the usual car use these day . and also , govern are encourag peopl to use them . though the price of those car are high , peopl start to be interest in them . so if the price got cheaper by have more technic peopl in the futur , peopl who did not want to drive car in the respect of protect natur will tri to afford car . to sum up , in the futur there will be more peopl use car .
