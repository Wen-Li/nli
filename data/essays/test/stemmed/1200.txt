i agre with the statement that ` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ' . success is often achiev with hardwork , persist and by be dynam . rather than do thing which we alreadi know , it good to experi onc in a while depend on the econom , polot and social condit that might affect the business/car etc . take an exampl of a chain of icecream store in a particular state . they could just record the averag temperatur at differ part of the state everi year and further decid upon open a few temporari store at differ part of the citi depend on the environment condit . thi would increas the mobil of the busi and at the same time could prove to be more profit than the strategi that they were previous employ on . so it okay to tri new thing as long as the decis made are sensibl enough . the person should'nt be too fickle-mind to tri new thing abruptli without ani base . the chang should be done by take both the posit and neg aspect into consider , that these chang might bring into the business/car , he should look in and out of variou option and then take the right decis about make chang or no and if ye what kind of chang . be rigid and get stick to onli one kind of strategi might not help in achiev success . take an exampl of a milk product in the market , in order to compet against the differ other product in market it should be abl to make suitabl chang so the product stay veri much in the market yield better profit than yester year . so , i would conclud by say that it better to tri new thing in business/car as long as the chang made are sensibl .
