i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i have two reason to support thi idea . first , both the maker and the seller of the product want to sell more , so they have good reason to show it attract . for exampl , when i bought a skirt at an internet shop mall , i check the pictur of the skirt in which a model have the skirt on , check the size , length and textur , then bought . but later when the percel arriv at my hous , i found that the skirt did n't fit for me complet , as i am not so good in style as the model in the pictur . second , especi the maker have more inform on the product than the consum . becaus there are not so sever ban on the advertis which bring the wrong inform , the advertis tend to express the merit , conceal the demerit . think of the advertis on the wemen 's magagin , there are hundr of advertis of drug for loos weight , but most of them have practic no effect , even some are toxic , but no consum know which are realli effect and which are not . some say that the maker which creat good product can appeal the good to the consum in order to make their life richer and happier , they just want consum to know the merit . nonetheless , it is consum who decid which product is good . in conclus , i think becaus of the differ of the amount of inform they have , the advertis can easili be too attract . i think the maker have to make big effort to convey the right and enough inform to the custom , also the retail have to stand for the consum and sell good product to the custom .
