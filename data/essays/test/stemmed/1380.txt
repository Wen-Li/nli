advertis are the crucial way of an industri to earn profit by attract the coustmer . i agre with the statement that most advertis make product look better than they realli are becaus the industri want to atrract mani coustmer by the add and improv the product sale . so obviuosli the product should be shown better . advertis make the product look better by mani mean like cover with nice design so that the coustmer feel to buy it . also , add do n't tell the bad effect of the product so peopl are lighten with onli the posit effect . as the advrtis are the onli mean by which coustmer get to know about the product product must be better shown than they realli are . everi individu accept the product if it is good so if the add show them in real they may be dissatisfi with product and they refus to buy . although the process may deciv the peopl but i think it is a busi trick to gain profit , afteral the object of ani busi firm is to gain profit . some advertis show the real pictur of the product but may fail , like one of my friend car wa put for a resal . he actual show the real condit of the car with crack on the bodi and dim colour , no one dare to buy it for the cost he expect . then he realis the situat and improvis the textur of car in the add and then mani coustmer flood inn . final he sold the car for the cost he expect . thu , most of the advertis show the product better then it is . after advertis when coustmer com for the buy of product the actual product must be showen and we have to tell him the bad effect of the product . and we have to convinc him by decreas the amount to that state in the add . so , i agre to the polici that advertis show the product better than they realli are for the reason i state abov like it is a busi trick to attract the coustem and thu the product sale would go up .
