time is the most valuabl resourc that peopl have in present world and young peopl do not stand differ . to some extent i agre that young peopl nowaday are not abl to devot time to their commun . one of the most import reason is that they are overburden with the ever increas quantiti of educ materi in their colleg . they are alway load with the cours work , assign , test , etc and therfeor they do not find enough time to be devot to their commun . dure my colleg day it use to be difficult for me to attend commun function becaus studi use to take a lot of time and i wa seldom left with the time to devot to such function . howev on the other hand , i would like to add that studi never discourag young peopl from particip in commun work . infact educ make them more awar of what sort of commun event are requir to be condut ? young peopl have more enthusiasm and so they tend to particip commun work with more zest . ani commun work becom a success onli when young volunt particp in it . young peopl organ event for the benefit of whole commun . plenti of blood donat camp becom a success becaus of young peopl themselv donat blood in huge number . some social organ are run onli with the involv and support from young peopl . even educ class for old age peopl are gener organ with the help of young peopl in their commun . young peopl go on tour in their commun and encourag old age peopl to come in greater number to such class . similar class are organ for peopl who want to learn a particular instrument or are interest in ani other art form . young peopl organ commun event where they can educ their commun of the latest happen aroundhti local . young peopl dure their school often tend to join scout and guid . scout and guid is a well known oragn for the young peopl and they are invovl in host a rang of commun event , confer and camp round the world . particip in thi group organ anti-malria campaign , aid awar program , etc . so in my view it will be wrong to comment that young peopl do not give enough time to their commun . i support the statement that young peopl tend to be more inclin toward commun work . howev the natur of involv ha shift from onli local to global . nowaday young peopl are better awar of matter of global interest and therefor tend to work for issu of larger concern rather than the local one . but hey a
