the best way to travel in group is not led by a tour with a guid for whill it can be conveni , one can not enjoy at the maximum extent the marvel of the visit place . mani individula choos to trave lwith a guid . most of the time , not have the time to devis an organ plan of place the individu want to visit , he resort to a pre-mad `` field trip '' in which for sure all the most import and relev attract of a place would be visit . it sound good so far right ? but it is not . travel with a guid is romantis by the ignor and yet hate by the knowledg . those tour are way too strict to actual feel the sweet feel of be in a beauti place becaus everyth is in a rush . 6:00 am one have to be readi to take the breakfast in half an hour . then half an hour to get to point a and then anoth half to reach point b . .. just too stress for one to enjoy . at thi pace , the tour seem like a photo album : one is just look at it from a far away place and despit the fact that you are look at it , after all , you just look at it and are not abl to reach it . anoth problem with thi is the expenditur . everytim one goe to a restaur , that restaur charg too much capit for food that the resid of those area obtain it for low price . i would be bold enough to say that the guid take adavtag of the tourist to go to eat to expens restaur where whether the wealthi , ignor or unstopp spender go . final , the apathi of some guid is just admir and unconceiv . they have so mani peopl to attend that in notim they are overwhelm by stress , tired , and boredom . they do not do the job that they are suppos to . they just tri to go by day after day , make the travel experi one of low qualiti and monoton . travel with guid in a tour is not the best way to travel . if one want a full great experi one ha to plan care one 's own trip . it is not worth to put trust , money , and time in a mediocr compani to offer an , in most case , one-time-onli experi . thu , travel with guid is not onli hte worst way , but also the one that travel would regret the most .
