sinc thirti year , the number of car increas all over the world , but is it true to say that in some year there will be fewer car in use that there is today ? firstli , the real problem today with car are the petrol and hi pollut . ye , the level of petrol decreas quickli and some scientist say that we have petrol still for 80 year . if i stop my reflexion here , i can say the number of car will decreas in the futur becaus peopl will can not use their car . we must to find new carbur to succeed petrol . we have found it , and we call that bio carbur . they are clean for the earth . today they are not readi to use , we need to improv research and develop becaus car have n't a long autonomi . and it 's expens to make thi carbur . we need a big place for the cultur of plant . with thi crisi of petrol a lot of peopl take care about the environn now , and chang their behaviour . the town of la rochel in franc is a good exampl . you can find a free acc of bicycl . so , a lot of peopl use it , chang their behaviour and stop to pollut the environn . even it 's easier for peopl to take their car for go somewher , a lot of peopl ( in franc ) are readi to use bu , railway , plane , boat , bicycl . then a car is practic but expens . befor the price wa cheaper than today and everybodi use car even for make a short travel . now it 's differ , petrol is expens . to conclud , it 's hard to plan if there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus all the time we need car 's . in franc , mayb we can say ye becaus polit are develop new way of transport in town ( ralyway ) and behaviour is chang . but in china , for exampl the market increas all the day and they use all the year more car than the last one . human need car becaus now he need to move all the day . i do n't know if the numer of car will decreas but i am sure that pollut car qualiti 's will increas . and it 's the most import .
