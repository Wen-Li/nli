peolp in thi world are devid into two type , the first type is peopl who take risk , and the other type is the peopl who onli do what the know how to do well , so what do you like to be the first type or the other one ? some time to take a risk in a thing is good in a way , and bad in onoth way , from risk you can take experinc and you will get to know thing well , but some time it is a danger thing to risk , like if you tri to fix you car your own self and you dont know ani thing about car , you may kill your self by touch a high voltag wire , or you may damag the engin , and that will cost you a lot af money . so if you want to risk you can risk but you have to think in the thing that are go to happen , and that your the one who is respos for all of thi . be expert in a someth is a good thing , becaus you can teach other peopl how to be good in thi thing , like the teacher he is an expert in hi major that whi he teach student to make them learn about the major . so if the person iss realli now what hi is do no bodi can say that he is not success , if he is not success who is go to be . in conclus , i agre and disagre at the same time becaus it a good thing to have new experinc by risk , in the other hand it a bad idea to risk in danger thing . also learn some thing and be an expert in it that a thing will make proud of my self .
