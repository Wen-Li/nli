a group led by a tour guid is not my favorit way for travel . i think thi depend a lot on the kind of person who is travel , becaus mani peopl find them use and practic . even though a guid ha a lot of knowledg , they are too strict on the itinerari and do n't let you focu on whatev interest you the most . i think thi kind of travel is more for peopl who worri a lot on time and have thing strictli accord to plan , but i am not that kind of person . i like to be free to do whatev i like , whatev interest me and come to my mind at that time . thi is whi i prefer lo lead my own tour , obvious with the help of map and inform about all the new place i am visit . anoth thing i do n't like about the group led by a tour guid is that you have to be all the time with the same group , and for me it can sometim be annoy . i like to be spontan , and decid on the last minut look at my option what i want to do . when i travel to europ , with my mom , we had a train pass that wa valid for a month i think , so we could go anywher we want and on the date we wish . we alreadi had seen some place we want to go , so we book a coupl of hotel with the approxim date , just to have a safe place to stay . the plan chang a lot dure the trip and we went place that were n't on our plan , amaz place we usual guid ourselv with the `` michelin '' guid that gave us the most import inform . thi wa the best trip ever , i got to visit mani citi and got to know mani place on my own itinerari . i like travel alon and base on my interest , i do n't like group or guid .
