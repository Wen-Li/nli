like the elderli peopl say : the world ha been chang . nowaday peopl are more busi with their job and themselv . everyon is complan about someth which they have face with , but they are not listen to other about what they are complain . the new gener , the young peopl are the best exampl of peopl who appli thi kind of behavior : they are the most chang and most adapt to new world , afteral . we all see teenag when travel by buse , railroad or anoth anoth mean of transport : they all wear earphon and listen to their own music . if a burglar steal the bag of the man who walk behind them , they will not even recognis thi event happen . thi is a simpl exampl of teenag becam unawar and indiffer of their commun . we also see mani other situat which teenag take part in : a colleg student is on a bu which is full , but he ha a seat , he ha worn all of hi brend new cloth , probabl he is go to meet some of hi friend and go to the cinema or have fun in a some differ way . an old woman get on the bu , she ha a limp , she walk realli slow and she harden herself to walk as quickli as she can for not to wait the bu . there is no vacant seat so she is stand . the boy recognis the woman , but he is pretend like he is unawar of her get on the bu , just to keep on sit . the worst of all , young gener is quit unawar of that is happen around the world , or even in their countri . even celebr . as it is ask to britney spear that if she is support the war between america and iraq , she say ` if presid bush support it , it is ok` . she doe not even have her own argument about such a big event ! to sum up , the world keep chang , but the path it follow doe not seem bright . there is a thing must be done : thi gener must be help to realiz that the world is live and also they are live in thi live world . human is a societi , and a societi ha to share mani thing togeth . as all peopl combin themselv in such a way , peopl , especi young peopl can not behav so selfish .
