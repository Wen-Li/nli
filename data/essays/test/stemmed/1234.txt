it 's veri hard to say which is more import understand idea and concpet or learn fact but i agre that student should understand idea and concept for two reason . first , student could have desir to studi by realiz idea and concept . second , it lead the student make great invent without know themselv . first of all , understand idea and concept is basi of learn somet . of cours , they could studi more without them but it offer good chanc to the student to studi more . the great inventor or scietist knew the baisic idea of they inventon . edison invent light , bell made telephon . they did n't do that by accid . they studi and stuid on the base of the light or comumicatin use wire . second , it 's realli difficult to understand idea or concept howev , onc the student realiz what they learn exactli , they could studi much easier and enjoy their lear . when i wa in high school , i realli hate in chemistri class becaus i did n't understand lot of name of atom or principl and i never studi it for the time be and my grade of chemistri wa terribl . there wa no teacher who cheer me up or help but i had to studi it to get good score . and i just mermor them everyday for almost one month . then miracl happen to me . a littl by littl , i got to realiz what i memor . to be more suprisingli , i have experienc that again dure in my univers . i wa major in socioloy and sometim the term were unfamiliar with me and mani time , i gave up read socioloy book . and i made a decis again to read them more care and slowli . i realiz again what the term meant . it might be my person opinion but i am sure there are mani peopl with the same expereinc . i think all of those were than to that i focus on baic concept so i still agre it 's more import to understand idea and concept .
