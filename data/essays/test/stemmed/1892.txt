in these day , peopl can see a immens amount of commerci and advertis . a research said that one human see averag of 80 thousand commerci in his/her life time regardless of the kind of item or product peopl tri to advertis , they point out that their product are excel , and are better than other . but , is it realli true ? review my past event and other inform , a lot of these advertis are not actual true , and are just tri to make custom attract . in other word , they are bluf . here are some exampl . about a year ago , i bought a digit camera from one internet shop mall . the advertis said that thi camera come out in variou color and with a free memori card . becaus thi camera seem cool , i bought it . and when i paid , it clearli said that the compani will deliv thi camera to my home exactli a week later . after two month , the compani deliv me a pink camera ( the color i want wa silver ) without ani memori card . it is clear that advertis are make their product seem much better then the realiti becaus advertis doe n't show us the bad side about the product . they point the better qualiti and hide other . actual , advertis are made to point out the product ' best part . for exampl , compani sometim point out that the price of their item are low while hide the fact that the qualiti is low too . my uncl who use to work in a pizza store told me that peopl use cheep ingredi to make more profit for themselv . while do that , he told me that the advertis of that pizza store clearli say that they use fresh ingredi . to conclud , most advertis bluff about the product and make them seem better to attract more custom . and , i want to warn other that the advertis are made to be point out their best portion of the product .
