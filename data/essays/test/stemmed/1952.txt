if i consid my own experi i will definit agre with the speaker 's claim . compani today are motiv by profit and sale , whatev the mean . advertis act a medium to inform the peopl about differ product along with their special highlight . thi ha led to increas in competet among compani . the compani whose product sell most emerg as the leader . it due to thi competet that advertis is be misus today . it doe not give custom an assess of product but tell them it is a panacea for all their problem . let me illustr my view with an exampl . whenev we watch our televis set the advertis about a fair cream is fairli common in between programm . these advertis show a model who previou to use that cream x wa dark and wa shun by girl becaus of hi complexion . but within week of use x he becom a colleg heartthrob with girl die to get a date with him . but is it possibl to get a fair complexion in such a short time or to even get a fair complexion . to speak the truth i could not notic a chang in my complexion in even a year . arent our bodi , our charact , our behaviour a result of genet materi ? but these advertis refut all the scientif theori becaus their main purpos is not to support them but to increas their sale . the reason behind make such claim about their product is profit . we all think that when we are spend money we should get the best . but how we are go to decid which product is best ? we are not technic expert of the field . we can onli see advertis and make decis . so for ani compani to prosper thi medium advertis should be utilis or to say misutilis properli so that the custom get convinc that thi compani 's product is the best . so instead of actual improv the standard of their product they take the easier rout - to make us believ that their product is the best . thi strategi ha work well and is still work well . but these compani should understand that it their moral respons toward the societi from which they deriv their bread and butter ; that they should not deceiv the societi with such exagger claim .
