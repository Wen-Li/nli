i do agre that most advertis make procut seem much better than they realli are . let 's take for exampl the pictur of a fast food meal . they alway show perfectli shape sandwitch , color sauc flood out of them , fresh salad leav and veri attract color . but when you find yourself at the counter , thing are realli differ . the sandwitch seem half size compar to the advertis one , an unidentifi mix of sauc appear at the side and a few slice of salad can be found insid , which are almost tasteless . i think that with food there is at least some hoest reason whi the product can not look exactli as the advertisw do : in fact , there is an inher difficulti of produc ident item . but what about kid game ? here thing are differ : the product is ident of that shown in the advertis , but it is alway advertis in a context which let him appear much more better than it realli is . for exampl , a singl lego polic station , shown in the context of a huge and fulli oper citi made of lego , will appear much better than it is taken alon . it might appear a veri interest item in that enviro , but taken alon on a shelf in your bedroom , it could be not so attract . off cours , you might alway buy a full citi made of lego , and probabl that is the actual target of that advertis ! in both case , the reason for make a product seem much better than it realli is , is to attract peopl toward that product . sometim , similar product have similar characterist and featur , and the onli way to direct the consum 's attent toward a product instead of anoth one , is to tell the thruth plu . .. a small lie . that small lie is the actual differ between the realiti and the appear .
