i do agre thi statement . take risk make us success . if we do n't tri new thing or we scare a lot from chang , we won '' t be abl to get what we want . for instanc , in busi life , if somebodi want to be an entrepreneur , but scare to lose his/her money , he wo n't even be abl to start a busi and will keep work for somebodi els . and probabl he wo n't be product and motiv to be success . especi , technolog effect our life . my mother is a kind of person who doe n't like to tri new thing . sinc we are pretti far to each other , she had to learn how to use comput to commun me . now she is abl to use the comput for her work and thi make her work life easier and faster . so she ha time for her social life and she doe n't have to worri while she is work . so , tri to learn comput make her more success . risk also give peopl enough ambit to succe . i like to tri new thing and take risk . and in the life , we have to be a littl adventurist . if we dont ' tri , nobodi will give our wish in our hand . we do n't have magic creatur to have three wish in life . we have to be our own magic creatur . accord to the researc , one of the properti of a success manag is take risk . if he wait to be secur for a decis , he will be later than the competitor and the compani will lose it market . so take risk and tri new thing are import for both our self improv and busi life . also , in my opinion , it is quit bore when i do the the same thing over and over . to do new thing keep me aliv and make me posit . and if we are posit , we can get success . tri new thing give us the patienc , so we can keep studi to be more success .
