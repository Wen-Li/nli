i think today young peopl are seper into two group . one group 's member onli think of themselv . help to their commun is not a seriou respons for them . they onli aim to live their live in the best way they can . the second group 's member are tri to chang someth in the world . they want to be help and prevent the factor that may creat neg effect . nowaday , i think the number of the second group 's member are increas . young peopl are now more senset about commun . the are tri to be a part of someth . and commun are the best place for them to reach their aim . i think there shuold be more encourag to guid these young peopl to commun . as i mention abov , the number of these peopl increas but the not with the same ratio of their nation popul . so in my opinion the number of peopl who help the commun are not enogh today . when we walk on the street we can see a lot of young peopl walk around , spendig their time with unnecessari thing . if the govern can guid these peopl , it is sure that their commun will develop them selv faster . and thi will be for the benefit of all member . i think educ system of school can guid these peopl succes .
