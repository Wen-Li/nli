i actual think that you ca n't say if it is better to be focus and special in a singl and specif subject or to be broad-mind , it is to say , to know about mani subject in a less accur way . let us take the instanc of a researsh and develop depart manag . i dont think he will need eight person when each one know a few about a lot , but i do guess that he will be quit more satisfi by a team of eight specialis person who , gather , will be abl to give complementari inform and final do a better job in such a depart . thi exampl tend to make me disagre wtih the question . till , if i had the choic between be focus on one skill , or at contrari be open to everi topic and be educ so as to have a broad knowledg , i definit acknowledg that i would rather be broad-mind . although it is taugh , to interest oneself in variou topic help to build a critic state of mind , wich is over essenti nowaday to understand thing of life like polit , philosophi , economi , histori . .. to be critic is to be well-construct in our modern and so complic societi . to conclud i shall say that the solut seem to be a matter of point of view . appear , we need both kind of educ way . as i alreadi said you cant answer the question simpli by ye or not until you put it back in it context . of cours it 's better to have mani specif tool that are more effici than unspecif one , but if you simpli got to choos onli one tool , it 'd obvious be better if thi late can be use in a lot of differ task .
