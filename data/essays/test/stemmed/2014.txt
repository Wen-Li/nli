as grow up the econom condit and develop of transport such as car , plain , ship , peopl use to travel where they do not have ani experi . and one of the most import thing plan the trip is make their schedul . howev , it is realli difficult for common person to schedul their sightse . so mani peopl who have plan to trave tri to get a travel agenc for group and lead by tour guid . but i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus it is possibl that if somein choos group travel , they might miss what they want to do or where they would like to go . admittedli , lead by travel guid is one of the best way to trip a unfamiliar place becaus travel guid use to have acquaint with the cite where the travel want to go to . and the group travel use to give the travel some econom us becaus of low price . howev , it is possibl that the travel incount some problem caus by group travel such as schedul of visit place , entertain at the cite and so on . for exampl , when i went greec and turkey , i led by tour guid with my colleag and my familli . at then , i realli want to fo to gafadokia where are compos by sever hundr of artifici cave becaus there is one of the seventh myter remain in the world . but i could not go there becaus even though i ask my travel agenc and travel guid , they refus my request as a reason whi other peopl did not have ani curios about the place . in addit , if someon goe to travel alon , he or she might meet unexpect delight such as new friend , strang experi which other can not have . i went to guam island as honeymoon . when we arriv in hotel , it wa 4:00 am. as it wors , the next morn schedul would be start at 8:00 am. we never could not particip the trip even waken up . so we are isol from my travel guid and group . and we went the downtown of gaum island by cab . we got a wonder time which other are never have . and the experi is one of the most expect occur my life . in conclus , travel in a group led by a tour guid is just one of good way .
