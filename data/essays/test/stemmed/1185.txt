the problem thet young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun is veri common . i think that it is true , i am agre with thi statement . nowaday the young peopl are busi , between school , work and sport activ , but it is not a good reason . the problem that their are not interest at their commun , they think about themsev , their studi , their job , their friend . all are first that help their commun . i think that could make a promot of thi activ , the gover must be interest about thi problem and make someth to chang thi situat . i feel that if exsist a organiz associ that give inform and contact person that could help and how need to help , more young peopl give their time to help someon . also the school could sesibil their student in thi way , it could introduc promot about thi . for exampl could give extra credit to the student that give hi or her time to help the comun . i think is import to promot thi activ , becaus a young person that give someth at hi or her comun , will grow a good person . but not all the young peopl do not give time to help their commun , i know mani person that make someth for the commun . they empli same of their time to make someth to someon , they could take a child or make volontari at red cross , organ travel for children or aged peolpl . in conclus i think the young peopl could give more of their time to help their comun , but also they have need to be encurag and motivi . the institut could play a key role about thi problem .
