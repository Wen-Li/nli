ye , i agre becaus it is unbelievebl how mani car are on our street are nowaday . especi in germanz if you heard them cri over the bad job situat . on the other hand if you see on the street you can see a lot of expens car . i think the most import thing whi there will be much less car on the street than today is that the oil and ga recurc get more less and less everi year . thi is like a circl if the is not enough ga the price will be increas . if that happend less peopl will buy a car becaus it is too expens to drive it . that will be the biggest reason whi there less car in the futur . the onli way to stop is to find a new recurc with which car can drive , too like the bio ga or the sloar the sun energi . here is the next problem to find altern you have to look for new techolog . that 's veri expens , too . if the poepl do n't like the new stuff zou wast a lot of money for noth . i think a lot of compani are littel bit scare to finac into new product aslong there are still the old recuc . an ohter factor is that the peopl have a certain life standart and thez do n't wonna leav it . it 's the same with me i have my car with some extra which can drive 250 km per hour . it 's veri hard to chang thi life standart if you grow up with it . there are some way i had explain what could the compani do to sell there car in the futur but i do n't believ in it . everz companz what to make as much money as possibl at the moment and i do n't think the are think that much about the futur . .
