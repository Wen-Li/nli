i disagre that staement is the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guid for sever reason . first of all , i think the best way to travel is alon . thi way can go to want place in your mind for free . howev the way to travel is a group led by a tour guid can not yourself to place for you mind . if you want to go a see , but group travel plan doe not includ a see . you can not go a see . howev alon travel can go to want mani place without a plan of guid . secondli , the alon travel can take more time better than the group travel . if you are without a tour guid , you would have more specif role of travel so you can get outsid of night and a long period of trevel . you can walk in middl night or earli morn . the situat in night or morn give you a special mood and condit . third , the way to travel is alon without a tourguid can meet a lot of peopl in local . you can talk to peopl and close them . you would be invest their home . therefor you learn their cultur and life . mayb you would have relationship and make friend . so if you are a singl , so lucki , you make coupl .
