i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . let me explain whi thi is so in the paragraph below with reason and then give coupl of exampl that i have face myself . advertis typic use a veri high qualiti of present skill in all aspect . be it a radio/tv advertis or larg sign board advertis seen over the road , they tri to captur the viewers/listen attent veri well . a lot of research is done prior to the make of the advertis as to how should the attent of consum segment that they target for be caught . it is now veri well realiz fact among advertis that unless they have someth novel present , it may not be abl possibl to attract the attent of the consum becaus of the over exposur of advertis that a consum is face today . advertis make use of the latest technolog and audio-visu techniqu to display even extran action that take place in the advertis . becaus an advertis last for veri short time , it is possibl to enact the scene again and again till a veri good present level is achiev . repeatedli show the same advertis also help in make the consum make him listen to watch it is and typic he or she may be attract to buy the product . i can now provid some exampl as to how an advertis can make a product much better than what it realli is . i have been see advertis for energi drink call boost sinc my childhood . the brand ambassador is sachin tendulkar hit good shot and then say that boost is the secret of hi energi . it is quit unrealist to assum that i will becom as energet as sachin by drink boost . recent , i have come across advertis of axe deodar . in it , lot of girl come from all over the place to the hero becaus they are attract by the odor of the deodar . it is extrem unrealist that if i use the deodar , so mani girl ( or atleast one girl ) will run toward me . final i atttest to the fact that most often than not , advertis will make the product better than what they realli are .
