`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . i partial agre with the abov statement . everi individu have their own opinion and their own interst regard the tour . some peopl dont feel comfort in a group and some feel more comfort in a group . peopl who want to know everyth about a place would prefer a travel guid with them . for exampl , some peopl feel to explor the histor place . they may be interest in know the histori of the place and the myth behind the construct and the monument . for such peopl , a travel guid would be much help . he would help the tourist to know the signific of the place and also the stori behind each construct . thi help the tourist to gain the knowledg regard the art and cultur of that place . the peopl who travel with their famili in a vacat for a limit period of time would mostli prefer a tour guid . they feel that they have less time and should explor the whole place without wander unnecessarili here and there . some peopl like to know the place on their own and explor the finest part of the place . they feel uncomfort in a group . the person may be interest in some place and the tourist may explain less about that place . sometim the person may feel to enjoy the beauti of the place and would prefer privaci . but the group tour doesnt allo it . the tourist may also get bore on listen to the word of a tour guid . some peopl may travel to the place veri familiar to them like devot place and the place near to the resid . thi kind of travel doe not requir a tour guid . it just wast of money .
