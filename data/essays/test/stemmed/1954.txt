to tell my opinion , i agre . when you see a commerci in the televis , you will be abl to feel that some advertis requir a function that the product do n't have . for exampl , when i wa young , i watch mani advertis about doll sinc i 'm a girl . one of the advertis which wa veri impress for me , wa an advertis about mimi ( the doll 's name ) . the advertis wa say that mimi 's hous is depart into seven room . one of the room wa a bathroom and they said mimi can take shower or a bath in the bathroom . and they show us an imag describ the water fall out from the sink . i wa so young at that age i believ all of the word they 're say and told my mum to buy it for me . it wa veri expens dollhous . but i wa veri happi until i notic that the sink wa not a real sink . i mean , the water do n't fall out of the sink ! the advertis wa a stink lie ! i think most advertis requir some kind of a lie to make their product look better . i ca n't blame them for make such an advertis . they just want to sell their product as mani as possibl . and that mean that some of the fault are our . most of us like to use much better , high qualiti product rather than cheap product if we can afford the prize . we do n't realiz some cheap product are as good as the expens one . kind of like thi : if we tell the peopl , `` i saw a veri beauti blue house. '' they don ' t understand about the hous . but if we say , `` i saw a million dollar house. '' most of the peopl understand it . the point of what i 'm say is that , most advertis make product seem much better than they are becaus we want expens , high qualliti product if we 're not veri poor . so , the maker must make the product look fantast and high qualliti by put some lie in the advertis . we should know that the prize is not it . we should judg the product by our clever brain and eye . forget about the prize . just think if you can afford the prize , and buy the most high quallifi product you can buy with your wage . that way , it 'll make the maker to provid high quallifi , averag prize in the market .
