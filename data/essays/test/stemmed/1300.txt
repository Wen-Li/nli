i agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guid . thi is an effect way of enjoy all the moment in the right spirit and know the peopl around as well other than explor the local . i am one of those few bless peopl who had the pleasur of travel with famili and and unknown peopl . it bring with it the chanc of make some good friend if we are with unknown peopl in the group . or when we go out with our famili the joy of spend time is differ altogeth . the best part is that one can never get bore throughout the trip . at the time of ani difficulti you have peopl around you to help out so that make one of the problem solv automat . it make sens econom . everybodi pool in the money and so the total cost goe down considerably.e.g : travel cost , stay cost , wine and dine cost . when these thing are taken altogeth it doe make a bug impact on the budget alloc for the tour . not everyon can travel alon all the time . it cost and bore most of the time . have a guid with the group is extrem help as it make the task of locat the place easier . the biggest plu point of have a guid is that the guid give the whole histori about the place that we travel to . we get to know about the languag and cultur in a more firm manner through the guid . that make the task of recogn and identifi with the peopl easili . the guid also give suggest about what to do and what not to do but it can be expect onli from veri few of them . not everi guid take a keen interest . thing can be plan out effici when in a group . that make the job of makng the decis easier . suggest can be taken from peopl in the group and the guid also to if ani problem relat to stay , eat or travel occur . though travel alon give the option to be a free bird , the experi of travel with peopl is a complet differ experi . anytim it weigh over travel alon .
