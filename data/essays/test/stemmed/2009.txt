i agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guid . follow are the reason whi i support the statement . though travel alon or in a group is good becaus it provid you feasibl to decid what to do and when to do . when you tavel alon you can not decid on your budget and you may not even control your expenc . while travel in a group you can have control over your budget and can spend limit amount in the journey . sometim it is possibl for the budget of the travel to increas sinc we do not know about the good and cheap hotel to stay that are avail in the area . sometim the time factor may be one concern to deal with becaus do not know the exact place to move and see them . have a guid along will solv the problem when we go to new place and can have good tour along with the guid . a guid would know the best place to stay which would match our budget and also plan a proper time schedul for us to see the best place around without much problem . sinc a guid also know the best place for us to visit we can have a brief idea of the place of visit and choos where we would like to go also when we visit the place we may not know much of the import of that place . it is guid who can slove thi problem owe to the fact that he is a localit and know each and everi place over there . so have a guid along with you lessen your problem to see the place arround and also can control the budget from your end also . though hire a guid might be a bit expens but still u can have more satisfact on the tour as you can see all the best place around . as i could rememb the last time when i went around myself i could n't catch up with my budget and also the time . so i prefer and agre with the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid
