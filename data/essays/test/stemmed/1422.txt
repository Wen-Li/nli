one could think that in the futur the use of car will be increas , becaus peopl today becom more and more lazi , so they buy car and they drive whenev they are abl to take the car . and there defenitli are peopl with that opinion , but the prize will increas also , so not everybodi will abl to drive by car the whole day . so my opinion is that i agre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use . in addit i think there will be law about drive everytim becaus the ga which is come out of car is disturb the natur . politician nowaday are discuss that problem and they are talk about a law that forbid the use of car on sunday . furthermor the standart at train and buss is get more and more secur , comfort , faster and flexibl so there will be mani peopl who decid to take the bu or train instead of an expens car . although it is not realli cheap it is cheaper than buy more and more oil for the car . anoth solut for that problem is that mani peopl will build up driving-commun to divid their cost with other peopl . i also think that the number of peopl who experi the result of the gase of the car will grow . there will be more and more peopl who will die in fact of get cancer or els . so there will be more and more peopl , who decid to `` forget '' their car , too . i am a perfect exampl ! i start to learn for my drive lisenc but now i do not want to get it anylong becaus it is too expens so i continu drive by bu or by train , not onli in fact of the cost , but also becaus it is often faster becaus i can not get into a trafic jam . to summer my thought i final say that i agre with the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
