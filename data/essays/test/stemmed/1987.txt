knowledg is an enlight on a dark path . it is good to have knowledg of vari field . but , today , it not an era of ` jack of all trade and master of none ' . one is identifi with hi profess . it depend on the stage at which one is , whether he should have a broader knowledg of mani academ subject or special in one . if in a school , definetli , one should have a broad knowledg to mani academ subject . it wil help the student to decid , what subject he is actual interest in . he can identifi hi apptitud and choos a field of studi accordingli . thi will help him folllow the path which lead to hi carrer . but , if we stress on peopl in colleg , i believ it is better to special in one subject than to have knowledg of mani subject . onc a student reach in colleg and is out of hi teen , he know what he expect from hi life . hi goal are set . he take everi step care and make sure that these step lead him to the door of success . if he tri to studi differ subject all togeth , he might not be abl to master in ani . he will be confus with varaiti of subject in hi hand . and what if he is not interest in mani of those ? if one is an engin student he can not handl subject like account or polit scienc . a friend i know wa practis medicin , it got difficult for him to attend even hi music class , which also taught the histori of music . how could he studi medicin and someth els which need him to know it histori ? he final gave up music . thu , if one tri to hold mani thing in hi hand at one time , he might land in a situat where he will have noth in hi hand . student in school can handl differ subject but at colleg level , it not an easi task . knowledg is someth that is justifi , true or believ . it would be not feasibl for them to look for answer to all those justif .
