travel is one of the import activ for entertain and to gain knowledg . it is better to take the help of a guid who is familiar with the fact and event that occur in the histori in a particular place . so in my opinion travel with a guid along a group is the best way . first to know about the tradit , custom and civil about a particular place is quit difficult without a person who is familiar about the place is a difficult task . so to explain and illustr the import of a place a guid is necessari . in mani case the guid will be a local person of the place and he is much more familiar than a stranger and he know what the particular place is promin for . second , mostli the tourist who visit a place will not be know the local languag . so to help them a guid is essenti . a guid act as a mean of commun between the tourist and the local peopl . for exampl , if we go shop we dont know much about the valu and cost of a product which is famou there . therefor take thi advantag about the stranger the seller may cheat the travellor by say too much cost which it doe not actual valu for it . in thi case a guid may help the tourist without be effect by the seller . in a group if ani individu suffer from the health problem the other person may help and the guid help to consult a doctor for the problemand there is lot of co-oper among the fellow person and also the commun skill develop a lot in a group . final a a tourist guid is veri help in travel for know better thing about a particular place which it is promin and famou for and also as the tourist are not familiar with the local languag a guid may help them in mani way .
