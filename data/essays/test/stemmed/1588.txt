i would reali love if it wa true . but unfortunatli , i do n't think that in twenti year of time peopl will actuali give up on their car and find a better way for travel . it just ca n't happen , becaus of the way thing are now . and by experi , i believ that thing just do n't chang that fast . except mayb if there wa a major invent for travel . .. but i do n't see it come . let me explain to you whi i think the number of car wo n't decreas , but more like , it will increas . car have been invent in the arli xxth centuri . it 's been a major invent at that time . everybodi want to travel without get tire and just let thi machin do the hard part . well , thing have n't chang at all . a car is fast , easi to drive , and it allow mani travel that we could n't do without it . our societi becam addict to the car , almost everybodi must have one , for the social life life as much as for the work life , it is requir . some peopl even have a few car now , one for go around , and one for their job ! i find it crazi , what 's the use of that ? what 's the point ? the number of car in the world ha n't stop increas over the last centuri , whi should it chang now ? the reason whi car will still be there , polut our atmospher , make the wall go dark , and increas the greenhous effect in twenti year is just becaus peopl do n't care ! we are a veri individualist societi , everybodi think for themself and do n't care about what 's happen around them . onli their own happi count , and they do n't think about the consequ of their act . our planet is burn underneath our feet , peopl see it , fell it , talk about it , but they do n't do anyth to get thing to chang . they alway think that someon els will do it for them . .. but it is n't the case . so , that 's whi , for all these reason , i think there will still be more car , as there are more peopl . as long as peopl find it useful and in spite of the danger it repres for them and their commun . peopl should start act for the futur , but i do n't see ani chang .
