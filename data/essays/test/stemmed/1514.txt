first of all , i 'd like to say that i am a student , i am 22 year old and i consid myself one of the young peopl that i 'm go to write about . i do not total disagre with the opinion that young peopl today tend not to dedic some of their time to help their commun , but i think that thi happen for a reason . the follow reason and exampl support thi opinion . firstli , i think that a lot of young peopl do their best both to be good at school and to do servic for the commun , but it is true that they also give import to stay with their friend and have fun . mayb , someth that differ from the past is the amount of time that is dedic to thi purpos . until a few year ago , there wa no televis , no videogam : the famili and the commun play a more central role in the everyday life of a child or of a teenag . nowaday there are so mani leisur activ direct to young peopl that they tend to prefer to spend their time play with their playstat rather than volunt in an hospit . anoth point that i would like to make is that young peopl do have a lot of thing to do . for instanc , they are expect to get good mark at school , to do well in their sport team , and often at the end of the day they prefer to just relax . howev , i see around me a lot of teenag help in activ such as entertain the elderli , help in keep the neighbourhood clean , organ activ for the commun . recent in my town a group of youngster ha organ a littl associ that aim at help peopl that want to stop use drug . sometim i think that adult ask a lot from young peopl of my gener , without realiz that they are alreadi do their best for themselv and to improv the world around them .
