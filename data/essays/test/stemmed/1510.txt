the question call is deal with the fact to special or not in academ subject . thi issu is rais by a lot of student when they have to choos their orient . on one hand , i think that it is import not to special too earli in your life for differ reason . the main reason are that , first , it is realli a good thing for your own knowledg . you will be abl then to be interest in mani subject and convers . so it is a way to be somebodi open-mind and interest . then , i believ that onli few young peopl know what they realli want to do in their life . you can not be total sure when you are eighteen . inde , i think that to choos mani academ subject will help you to discov what you are realli want to do for the rest of your life ( even if now , it is easier to chang your carrier ) . for instanc , i have chosen for thi academ year busi subject which are use for all type of job in busi , becaus i am not determin . it allow me to have a global vue of how function compani . it is a way to keep more opportun for my carrier . but on the other hand , you can not stay generalist all your life . one day or anoth , you will have to specifi in order to be more perform and more interest for recruit . most of the job requir specif . thi special can occur when you are more matur , and more experi in life . it permit to avoid from mistak in your orient , problem which are gener difficult to solv when you are fourti for instanc . as a conclus , i think that both are necessari in the construct of your futur . you need time to open your mind , in order to help you to specifi in a better way , and to feel better in your life .
