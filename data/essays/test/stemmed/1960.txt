i strongli oppos the idea that '' success peopl tri new thin and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . '' becaus , in my opinion , if a person want to be succes , he ha to concentr on just one subject and ha to learn all the aspect . i am will to discuss it by propos two main reason ; one of the primari reason is that peopl suppos to do the same thing to get profici . for exampl , suppos a person who ha been play drum for ten year , even if he tri new thing and take risk , he could forget what he know in drum and probabl could not be the one in hi new field . i am a determin person and i alway want to be perfect in what i am do . therefor , be interest in one thing and focus all the small detail , make an individu complet and more succces . the second reason is that , when you are do what you alreadi know , you feel yourself more comfort and relax becaus you will be more self confid . thu when you believ in yourself there will be noth for you that you can not handl it . for instanc , my brother is a profession chess player and if he take risk and tri to do other sport , i know that he can not be success even it make him unsuccess person . becaus he know how to play chess and he know that chess is the most conveni way to express hi feel . to sum up , i think peopl have to discov what they are capabl of , and have to find out the way of be much better rather than tri new thing . becaus onli by thi way an indiviu can achiev hi goal and can lead a success life .
