i agre with the follow statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . now a day with increas industrialis and the growth of the market economi there is a cut throat competit among the industri as to which industri sell most of it product . so , in order to increas the market of their product larg scale as well as small scale firm are use advertis campaign . these industir often hire the well known televis star and actor to launch their product . and the one that can hire the most reput actor win the race and it market increas manyfold . but in realiti these advertis overr the product than they actual are and henc cheat the consum . peopl also prefer to buy those product that are campaign by the big actor becaus these campaign develop a sort of relationship between the product and the consum . a small firm can not hire a renown advertis compani to launch their product so even if they are produc much better qualiti than the larg firm are produc , market of their product remain low . advertis compani aim at develop a sort of relationship with the consum . for exampl , if they are advertis for a newli engin car that look veri attract , they tri to attract the younger gener through their campaign and often hire a younger actor to do their campaign . as a result younger gener is grealtli influenc by the advertis and is tempt to buy the product even if the product is not veri well engin on ground of strength and other capabl such as mileag etc. henc they make the product appear much better than they realli are . henc , consum are often mistaken of the type of the product they should choos and henc they often make mistak while make choic . moreov , the number of industri are increas day by day and are come up with their more recent technolog and product which serv to worsen the situat further . henc , in my opinion thi problem of be falsifi by the flamboy advertis can be reduc onli through the awar of consum . by give more import to the qualiti of the product than on the advertis a consum can make an effect choic between the variou product .
