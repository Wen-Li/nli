i firmli agre with the statat that ` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to specialis in one specif subject ' real life encompass divers aspect and it is not possibl t0 deal with them with the knowledg of just one . a person with kowledg in numer field will alway be better equip to handl real life situat than a person specialis in onli one field . specialisaton in a particular academ subject crippl the mind and confin the intellect to a bound region . it prevent the mind to develop in more profound way . by specialis in one area , one is bound to gain , but onli in one direct . mind remain facultio are wast and left unexplor . also , academ subject are more or less theoret . i person believ that no student ha had enough exposur to decid with suriti what he want to do later in life . i will like to illustr thi pont with an exampl . let consid a student veri intersest in the scienc . he doe a chemistri major and becom a research . but after becom a research he realis that he doesnot like the redund and mundan laboratori procedur . he doesnot want to continu with hi work . but with onli the knowledg of chemistri , it is not possibl for him to do anyth els . he is now stuck in a profess that he doesnot like for life . but suppos he had also acquir the knowledg of market or informaton technolog or ani other field for that matter , he would definit have been abl to improv upon hi situat . life is all about grow and experienc . the more we learn in life , the more we grow - not onli intellectu but also spiritu . the knowledg of myriad subject doesnot onli make us a scholar but also make us more awar of everyth that life ha to offer and we are abl to appreci it in a more complet way . a broad knowledg of multiflari academ subject put us in a better posit to take a decis of what we want to do further in life . it bring in greater adapt as well as greater oppotun . the specialis can be brought in at a profession level . ` i feel it is unfair to depriv a learn mind of knowledg just as it is unfair to depriv a thirsti person of water or a hungri person of food'
