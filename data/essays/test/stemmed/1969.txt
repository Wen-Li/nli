i agre thi statement . becus , i think to succ somet , you have to tri new thing and take risk . for exampl , i think that tadataka ino is one of success person . he made the first survey japanes map in edo period . he start lean survey at the age of 50 . although thi age wa quit old in thi period , he tri to start a new thing , servey all of japan on foot . finari , he made realli exact map . someth new usuali good for us . we can not find them unless tri . about tadataka ino , if he had not tri to start lean , japaneas map would not have been made . i think success peopl usuali like tri new thing or can take risk , so that they can get good result rather than popl who onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
