diffrent peopl have differnt idea about the statement that travel in a group a with tour gide is the best way . howev , i disagre with thi idea becaus travel alon give you more experi and travel in a group led by tour guid will forc you to visit place where you do n't want to go . to begin with , if you travel alon anywher , you can experi mani thing from start to end . while travel with tour guid need you to prepar just extra money and time , travel alon make you learn mani thing about the place that you want to visit . you have to find a flight ticket , hotel and inform about the place . for exampl , when i travel india , i plan by myself . to prepar for thi , i had to book a flight ticket , find a youth hostel to stay and search inform on the web . it took my time and wa not easi , but a good experi for me . in addit , travel in a group forc you to visit place where you do n't want to go . becaus you have to keep to a schedul and keep up with the pace of a group , you can not enjoy the time enough . also , travel in a group is usual cheaper than travel alon becaus of commit , so if you travel with tour guid , they usual bring you certain restaur which give commit to guid . for instanc , my mother visit china two week ago . when she came back from the trip , she wa so angri becaus waiter in restraur she visit requir too mani tip . in thi respect , it is hard to think that travel with a guid is a the best way to travel . to summar , trave alon give you mani experi and allow you to visit the place where you want to go , so it is better than travel in a group led by a tour guid . there is a say that a jouney make peopl grow up . what can you learn from travel led by a tour guid ?
