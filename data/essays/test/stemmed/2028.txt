i do agre onli partli with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstli i think that of cours through consist technolgi develop , new idea and way of transport will aris . but i do not necessarili think that there will be therfor a signific decreas in car manufactur or car use in gener . as new technolog is alway more expens than old technolog . therefor i rather think that there will be an increas in car , as more and more peopl will have the possibl to buy a car . becaus the price of car will decreas , when new better way of transport come to the market . then by look at the financi situat of mani german household , we realiz that an averag german famili poss one car , but would need more than one car . as when the father of the famili is away with the car , the woman or mother need for exampl to bring their children to school or get to her workin place . but the mother could use other transport system to do that . she could use other transport system such as train , buse or bike . thi would also have a good effect on the environ , as there will be less co2 concentr in the air . the pollut problem , caus mainli by the mani individu car , could lead to a decreas in car in use . becaus the environ will be pollut more and more , the more peopl buy their own car , therefor could some peopl decid to switch to other transport system , which are more friendli to the environ . but not mani peopl will think about such factor and prefer have their own car to be not depend on time . howev drive with car ha also it neg aspect . as trough the constant increas in the number of car , the traffic situat on motorway or in big citi ha becom a big problemin our daili life . therefor mani prefer use the undergroung railway system in citi and for longer distanc will decid to use more often plane or train . as for exampl fli had been becom cheaper in the last year and you save time and time mean money . therefor thi could be a reason for a decreas in the use of car . but in gener i think car will reain in our s
