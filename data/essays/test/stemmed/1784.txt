i think that thi statement is a good interpret of the realiti . a good advertis ha the great respons to give the best imag of the product that it is promot . throught it , the consum must be sure that the product that he is buy is what he need . most of the advertis are creat with thi kind of goal and to fulfil it , they also don ' t tell the truth about the realli natur of the product . when you see the mc donald ' s advertis on the tv , they show you veri delici food !! everyth seem to be veri special and you want to tast it ! but when you go to the fast food you realiz that everyth is differ and the food is not like in the advertis . the product that you saw on the tv wa unreal ! the big cheesburg is not so good and the flash it ' s not so soft ! i 'm not agre with thi kind of polici . i think that when you buy someth , you have to be awar of what you are spend money for . i know that it 's imposs to pretend the truth caus busi is busi ! but at least , not to emphas someth that it 's not the best !
