some peopl like to travel in a group such as a tour guid by a spscialist who know a lot about the place , and some like to travel on their own . if they do n't have enough time to travel , then it might be good idea to go with a specialist becaus they do n't spend vain time wonder or get lost . howev , there are more good reason whi it is nice to go without tour guid in a group , and the reason are as follow . first of all it is becaus that tourlist can spend time as much as they want if they travel by themselv . they do n't need to worri time or other tour member if they are by themselv . on the contrari , if they go on a tour , they ca n't stay or visit the place even though they find on their own becaus they are alway with somebodi and need to follow the rule or time . as a second , it is becaus that they have more opportun to meet peopl or touch the cultur there if they go by themselv . for instanc , tourlist are not famili with the place if it is the first time for them to visit . so they need to ask the direct to the local peopl . then they commun with peopl there use foreign languag , which is great opportun to feel the cultur . also , it is common that peopl use tour buse if they travel in a tour group . so , it is hard for them to have a opportun to talk to local peopl . on the other hand , tourlist use public transport such as buse or train if they go by themselv . in thi case , they can see the local peopl or even talk to them . nobodi know what happen in thi convers , mayb tourlist can get great inform about place to visit , or some nice restaur to tri . final , some peopl say that a tour guid ha much inform . but there are mani nice tour guid book which are avair at book store . those book are enough to cover thi matter . and moreov , it is easilli for them to get a map the place to visit . therefor , travel alon ha mani good point , even conclud the good reason of the tour . there are limit about group tour with a guid , but not for tou alon .
