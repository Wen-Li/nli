i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason whi i agre with thi is becaus without understand the fact there is no use of learn it . if you understand a concept you will find it easi to appli . for exampl if you are take a class and you will ge gven assign . if you just read the the textbook you can answer some straight question but not the logic one , for which you have to understand . suppos if you understand the concept you will be in a posit to answer ani type of question relat to that topic becaus you know what is happen with that system . for exampl take the function of heart , here the fact that we learn is the heart pump blood to differ part of the bodi . if you just come to know about that without understand how it is pump the blood it remain a mysteri . on the otherhand if you understand the function of heart you will have that pictur in your mind . onc you understand the whole concept of what you are read it becom easi for you to rememb what it is and you need not spend much time on that subject becaus as you understand it will be save as an imaginari pictur in your mind . understand the concept save a lot of time dure the final examin as you dont have to struggl rememb that becaus that pictur is alreadi print in your mind and you just have to refresh it which will take much lesser time . understand the concept also help for futur class becaus the higher the class you are go mean you are go to read most of the known fact with an elabor sens . so if you dont get the concept in the earlier class you will never understand what it is and you will be lag behind compar to other student . understand the concept influenc the grade which is veri clear . so to be in competet i agre that get a concept is import than just learn the fact .
