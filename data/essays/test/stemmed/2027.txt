i agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they are in realiti , and i am pretti sure of it becaus i am a graphic design and a lot of time my work definit consist in make someth appear what it is not or what it should be to make peopl like it . appear , in gener , is veri import in our societi . most of all how peopl appear is fondament . and obvious peopl appear is base on what they want , what they buy , what they have . .. some of the product themselv are good . they are product of good qualiti , mayb handmad , valuabl becaus of the materi they are built of . but mani other time they are not , and they are just present like that . sometim the food with the nicest pack is the one which tast as dog meal . .. but it is successful becaus of it wonder packag . in fact the packag too is a type of advertis . the same thing can pass with a pair of shoe . mayb on tv it is present as if it wa the most comfort pair of shoe in the world , and everybodi buy it . .. but after one week of use they break or they begin to be unconfort . sometim advertisemnt not onli make thing seem better , but even differ ( thank to photoshop , for exampl ) ! it is strang even to notic that mani time peopl alreadi know that one product is not so good , but they want it anyway , and thi becaus the most import thing is to be cool , cool , cool ! i think one of the most appropri sentenc to express thi topic could be the titl of a song : `` smoke get in your eye '' by `` platter '' . of cours it wa refer to anoth kind of relat but the relat between consum and the advertis could often be express thi way .
