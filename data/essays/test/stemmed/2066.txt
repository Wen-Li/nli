i total agre on what the statment incolud , to have knowledg of mani academ subject is alway better than to have of one . everyth that ha more root to it is alway better , to have knowledg in a coupl of thing is better than just one thing , becaus sometim what we know in other subject , may link to the subject we are seek as well and give us hint of what we are focus on . for exampl , if i go to collag and think of studi onli math , well if i studi financ , account or ani other busi major , i could get to studi math and learn more than one subject at onc , so what would be better to learn one subject or more than just the subject im focus on ! ? the answer is alway ye to more than one , it give us more than the inform that we seek and give us more knowledg on to our regul life , and make us know more . if i choos to focu on just one subject , i cant have differ goal in life , but if i set my mind to acheiv more than one thing , the chanc of me get one of the goal i set my mind to is high , so whi just think to myself that im plan to studi one subject when there are alot of door wait to be open , and i could acheiv mani thing if i set my mind to it , becaus have one goal somtim fail , and if it fail , what is a person to do in a situaion like thi , it alway better for a person to think of have more than one goal , unlik have one goal and fail to it , becaus if i have more than one goal , i would not be disapoint if i fail in one , becaus there are other wait to be acheiv .
