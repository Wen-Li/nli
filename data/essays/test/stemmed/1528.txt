one way of learn is to understand idea and concept that is to learn the basic idea and concept that are deriv from the variou fact . the other way of learn is to learn fact and it is learn the fact that make up the variou idea and concept . among these way of learn , i believ that learn idea and concept should be learn with prioriti . first of all , understand idea and concept make it easier to learn fact afterward . idea and concept are deriv from the similar between variou fact . therefor , learn those basic idea and concept will be a lot help when learn new fact . for exampl , when i wa prepar for my scienc test , i wa tri to memor all the chemic term as a whole and it wa realli difficult . then , my sister saw me struggl with those term and she let me know the idea beyond those term and it becam much easier for me to memor . likewis , learn fundament idea and concept would be help when learn fact . next , learn fact onli doe not have ani valu . although we learn a lot of fact , those fact can not be util as fact . in turn , to be util and improv , understand the idea and concept beyond the fact is much more import . new techniqu or new theori are base on the idea and concept not just the acuumul of fact . for exampl , if newton could not find the concept beyound the fall of appl , it would be noth . learn that appl fall is noth , find the concept of graviti from that fact is import and it 's the concept that is util afterward . for the follw reason , i believ understand idea and concept is far more import than learn just fact . through learn idea and concept , it would be easier to learn fact . also , it is the idea and concept that matter not just hundr of fact . therefor i strongli agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact .
