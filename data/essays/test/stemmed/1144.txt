i do agre with the follow statement : it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . here are my reason . fact are a collect of past situat and/or activ without ani depend . fact could also be repeat event : e.g. a collect of date christma day , christma eve etc . on the other hand side are idea . they are time univers . idea did exist in the past , in the present and also exist in the futur . without ani idea there would be no progress or develop . our ancist had the idea that the earth is round . columbu did prove it and explor a new contin . the horizon of the human bee grow , some group lost their influenc and power . concept are a collect of fact and activ with a futur orient . concept are can be possibl answer for complex situatu or can help solv problem . here an exampl : you want to remodel a live room , becaus the fireplac is broken and need to be repair . a possibl concept could be just do disabl the fireplac and keep the remodel cost low . anoth concept could be to replac the fireplac and spend more money . the student are the key to the futur . the need to understand the fact , the situat the human race is in , no doubt . but much more it 's more import keep idea / concept aliv to go anoth step . the human race is challeng in the futur with environment chang and resourc issu . the climat is chang , oil is run out in the next 50 year . answer are need to question like : altern transport , global warm , civil . the onli key to find the answer is to develop new altern concept and creativ idea rather learn the fact .
