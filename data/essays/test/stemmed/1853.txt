success is , for a person , what he defin it to be . to succeed , a person might resort to use tri and test way , which have littl risk and a fair chanc of success . anoth way is to risk it all and tri new thing . i agre with the statement . success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well . pioneer are peopl who are first in do someth . pioneer have done what is new and that which hasnt been done befor . pioneer would n't be pioneer if they were not will to risk it in do someth that wa n't done befor . to support my stand , i would like to use the exampl of dhirubhai ambani , the founder of relianc group of industri . he wa a person who took whatev risk were requr and made it big . he knew that by do what he wa do , he could never becom succes , alhough he did it well . he decid to tri hi luck and he risk it all by tri new busi . the result wa tremend success . onc someon attain success in a field , it doesnt take time for the other to catch up . in order to stand out from the crowd , to attain great success , a person mu7st be will to come out of hi `` comfort-zon '' , and tri someth new , keep in mind the risk involv . the outcom might not alway be success , but it is alway worth give a shot . do what you know , all the time , for the rest of your life is not realli an interest prospect for me . life becom too monoton . chang is alway for the better and to succeed , a chang is requir at a certain point of time . in my opinion , it is alright to take a risk in do someth , but one ha to be sane enough to not underestim the effect of the risk . to succeed , risk should be taken , but never to the extrem .
