i agre with thi statement . it 's a common experi to buy someth that reveal it real valu just when you 've observ it with a littl more attent . the problem it is that usal you notic the real natur of the product after have bought it and the delus that reach you is propot to the desir you have been feel sinc that sad moment . advertis obvious tri to show their product better than they are and to make them desider , in order to sell them to the major number of peopl . howev i do n't think thi is alway a good thing for everi kind of product . in fact there are thing that a buyer need just sometim , and also if he is not satisfact by what he ha bought , probabl the next time he will need it , he will not rememb of hi wrong chosen . but there are also other product that are daili request , and an advertis that show a fals aspect of them mayb will move the interest of a buyer to anoth product . on the other hand , i think that today peopl , in itali , is less influenc by advertis than in the past , becous of the higher cost of life . so also if a product is present in a marvel way , there is alway an accur evalu of what someon is go to buy . today it ' not just import to show a product better than it realli is , an import part is the thought to who will receiv the messag thet regard that product , that is to say for exampl , the import of oulin the comparison between the qualiti of a product and of it cost .
