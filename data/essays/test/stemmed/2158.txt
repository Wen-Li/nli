`` flight of fanci , my sens reel '' ... ( pink floyd , `` learn to fli '' , the divis bell , 1995 ) . in twenti year time - let 's see - would we realli have to look at the amaz invent of diamler and benz as a `` speci go extinct '' with the throe of time , or would be see a revolut in man 's concept of the `` car '' ? ! we are head into what mani peopl would choos to call `` the space age '' ; numer invent the veri concept of which might have been consid ridicul in the distant , or even the recent , past have been beholden to men over the recent past . at the same time , howev , the earth is cri out as natur resourc are declin . the typic car that run today use gasolin for fuel - thi wa how car start . slowli , as time move by , gasolin start turn scarc and becam expens , and a novel idea wa to run car on natur ga instead ! - it work out extrem well - allow peopl to have the option to actual switch over to natur ga as oppos to gasolin ( petrol / diesel ) - though it did not see the glamour of popular becaus natur ga can be a danger explos , and peopl do not like to drive when they know they are sit on a potenti bomb . also , both of these are but natur resourc , wors that they are usual found togeth , and the fate of such car is sole depend on their avail - they are form by chemic process that take place over thousand of year , and consum at a pace maddeningli faster ; so that sooner or later , they are go to `` run-out '' , and we are go to be left with a lot of car that are but mere relic of the past , devoid of life - like dinosaur , or the dodo for instanc ! henc , it might seem that in twenti year there shall be fewer car than we see today . but . .. but . .. but . .. lo and behold ! necess is but the mother of invent . it wa man 's idea to use gasolin for fuell car ; it shall be man 's undaunt resolv to surviv in a hostil world that shall lead him to circumv the limit natur impos - for after all - natur is not just gasolin ! man ha been exploit the ubiquit avail resourc of sunlight - which it is to the point of omnipres ! there have been built car that can store energi from sunlight in cell , and releas thi energi in the form of electr energi for run them ! - complet cost-effect , and remark ingeni ! it is onli a matter of time befor these car becom commerciali viabl - as the current trend do impos , the cost of a technolog innov alway goe down with time - becaus the demand increas , allow mass-scal product to becom cheaper . such car of the futur shall complet replac car of the past , and as the number of the regular gasoline-car declin and they proceed to join antiqu collect , the number of these `` tech-savvi '' car shall go up ; even if the cost of product is larg , such car are in the long term go to be an extrem profit possess becaus they can be recharg as soon as the sun rise ! - virtual mainten free . moreov , these car shall last till the end of time for us - that is , till the day the sun final swell up into a red-giant and engulf the earth , so worri about the futur are go to be a thing of the past ! there have also been step to somehow util sea-wat as fuel , and sinc we do not have to worri even remot how abund that is , there 's our sister option ! both the idea of use solar energi as well as sea-wat are go to complet do away with bother about `` running-out '' . henc , even though the number of gasoline-car are no doubt go to declin over the next twenti year , the technologi star shine bright , and foretel that the number of car on the whole is go to increas - rather exponenti onc mass-product begin , and the faith of the peopl in a new technolog ha been secur .
