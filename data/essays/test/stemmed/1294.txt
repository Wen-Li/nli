i disagre with the statement , as some of my most valuabl and unforgett travel experi are from travel on my own or with friend independ . travel in a group ha it advantag , yet i would say that doe not necessarili mean that it is the best way to travel . for exampl , there are also great advantag in travel independ , such as you are free to wonder around on your own pace , stop at certain place that interst you most and improvis the rout as you go along . what i like about travel is that you can see a whole differ world , cultur , life , languag , food , custom and so on , that is complet differ from what you are use to see or live in . and it is usual in those small street i went in wonder about when i meet the most interest scene of local life , unfamiliar thing or exot shop . also you tend to get to know more peopl easili when you are move individu , which is anoth big purpos for me to travel around . convers with other travel , local peopl , or even taxi driver , meet and get to know what all the other peopl are feel and think in their daili life is someth i find veri intrigu , as they often have complet differ way to see thing and open my eye . i see some benefit travel in a group led by a tour guid , for instanc to have someon to reli on when problem occur , or never to get lost or be in denger situat . the tour guid can provid interest insight about the place they go too , yet i am still inclin to valu more the experi you creat on your own account , which make the trip and experi you live realli your . to conclud my opinion , therefor , travel independ can be as great as travel in a group . firstli becaus you are not restrict by the travel time tabl made by the tour agenc and free to spend as much as time you want on place that realli attract you . secondli , becaus you get to meet peopl from differ background and peopl who you would never met otherwis more easili then when you travel in the group . although the guid tour can provid variou valuabl benefit such as safeti and inform , i think you can suppliment element like inform by join a short tour in the particular spot , and you can alway be care and causiou to not to encount problem . for those reason , in my person opinion travel individu is more prefer than travel in a group led by a tour guid .
