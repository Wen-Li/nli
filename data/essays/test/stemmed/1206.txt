i think that statement is fundament true . i often view on tv or other media that one entreprenau is say he is alway tri new thing to be success . now i have bliefli consid the reason and tri to present them below . the first and most import thing is that no one can alway be success by stick to one certain way . for exampl , in automobil industri where the top lead compani ha been changeng guradu these day . at the earli stage of thi industri , american compani wa success in sell a larg number of car by produc as mani car as econom as possibl . but thi busi measur are not fit for now . nowaday , consum need other valu toward car as well as plice . they choos to buy one car becaus of the shape or oil effici and so on . in the mordern automobil industri , compani have to chang and erabol the busi tactic incessantli . secondli , tri new thing may make one person more skill . peopl can learn mani thing by charangeng entir new thing and it , in return , will give that person more inform on that field or abil to deal with some difficulti . for exampl , if one automobil compani tri to develop a new engin which run more effect than usual gasolin engin and unfortun fail at last , with less profit . we can say it is failur from the point of busi . but if it is view from other standpoint , it provid great benefit to the compani becaus the engin could experi the develop and get some import knowledg . or the moral in the compani might be enhans by the future-look plan . charang enabl peopl t
