i complet agre to the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my opinion onli when you tri new thing you will be abl to learn new thing . one of the most success person we have today is mr.bill gate . had he been content with what he had and what he knew , thi era of inform technolog would have been unheard of . but becaus of thi chang he brought , he not onli benefit himself but also the entir world . small , under develop countri are develop at a faster rate becaus of thi technolog . tri new thing is veri challeng and is often consid a gambl espesi when larg sum of money is invest . it goe without say that monetari gain are veri crucial in ani busi . so peopl often refrain from take risk . but it is veri import to take risk when you want to tri someth new . let consid a simpl exampl of a small shopkeep . the shopkeep can allur custom onli when he ha a veri good rang , qualiti and a varieti of product . if he is readi to take a risk and store product as per the custom ' satisfact he 'll be larg profit by thi . hi busi will be success . even when you consid in the field of scienc , most of the theori propos by the success scientist were not approv in earli stage . but the zest to do someth new ha kept them go and got them all the accolad they have won .
