consid the exist petroleum resourc will be eventu use up within decad , it is possibl that in twenti year , there will be fewer car run on the street than today . also , if we take into account that peopl may be more consciou about the pollut and damag caus to the environ while we are drive , it also may result in the overal increas in the usag of the public transport in the futur . perhap , peopl might even think about switch to bike instead , result in the overal number of car be use to decreas sharpli . thi is onli one possibl of how the stori may end . if we turn to see what is on the other side , there may lie an entir differ answer . know the consequ of drive , what it can do to the remain natur resourc and our environ , measur have been taken to avoid further damag as well as to seek our solut for our futur . speak from the environment perspect of the matter , for exampl , i have seen on the news peopl are start to purchas permit to emit carbon dioxid into the atmospher or by taken action by grow more tree , hope to do their share of save the environ . although these are just small step , but i am optimist that in the futur , we will find mani other method that we can involv more peopl into protect the earth . therefor , simpli becaus someon is concern with what their drive to work is do to the environ , instead of give up drive entir , they might just take on other action to lessen their guilt . have address the problem concern pollut , the other problem with drive in the futur is that we will eventu run out of petroleum . luckili , we seem to have found the solut to thi problem . in recent year , research in mani field have tri to find altern method and resourc to replac petroleum in the futur . for instanc , use solar energi could be a possibl method . in the depart of mechan engin of nation taiwan univers , a professor ha led hi student to complet a project , build a car that run on solar panel , and that turn out to be a success , win intern award and recognit . who is to say what els can happen in the futur , in thi day of rapid technolog revolut ? if that project can extend further , make the solar energi car avail to everyon , it is veri like that peopl would not want or have to give up their luxuri and comfort of drive . overal , as grim as some of the problem may seem at time , i believ the old say `` there 's a will , there 's a way '' . human be have proven to have endless capac , especi at time of need , so who know what the futur may bring ? so let 's have our finger cross , and i bet in twenti year , there would still be as much car run on the street , if not more .
