in my opinion , it is more import for a person to have as much extens knowledg of a varieti of academ subject as he or she can becaus of two good reason . firstli , it could be consid to him and other as hi background knowledg and experinc of life . secondari , some knowledg of everyth is prefer that one might somebodi by in need of the use of the type of knowledg , and employ it in hi or her own life . one the other hand , be especi in onli one subject and forget about know alittl from there might make someon ignor when he or she is expos to situatiion where he or she is requir to give an answer to gener knowledg question . our live are not limit onli to what is state in book and what he or she is specil in . for exampl , when peopl gather at my sister 's wed , they discuss the effect of drought not onli on land and animal , but also on economi as a whole , althou the nation product opf saudi arabia ha noth to do with rain . peopl were ionterest in the subject becaus it will definit affect their everi day life . for exampl , their prefer diet will ; be neg affect . thi ha noth to do with what is in book but rather to their gener knowledg about how thing are complic in a way that they may seem not so . anoth exampl is that when we have a broken car . we may run to call the car agenc or someon who might be abl to repair it even temporarili . on the other hand , if we had that littl knowledg about how the system of a car function , we might be abl diagnos the problem and have some . te
