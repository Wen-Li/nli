the issu in question is whether most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is an interest question , differ peopl hold differ view due to their differ background and life experi . as for me , i strongli agre with the assert for the follow reason . first of all , advertis is the magic of market . advertis can be show in variou of way , such as magazin , newspap , telephon , televis , radio and so on . the compani can also held a product launch confer to introduc the new launch product person to person . there are sever way to induc the buyer to pay the money , but we seldom find a advertis to reveal the weak of the product . it take a lot of time to compar all of the same categori product , so we often make the buy-it-or-not decit by onli receiv the strengh-sid inform provid by the advertis . secondli , the need for the product can be creat by the talent market geniu . they produc attract stori , event , pictur to appeal for our notic . exel advertis make us feel that we need the product in our daili life even though we actual do n't . for instans , the oreo snack make a good advertis in taiwan , they make a film that is about a cute boy eat oreo when he play with hi littl dog , he melt oreo with milk befor everi bite . that is realli a impress . after my sister saw the advertis , she buy a bottl of milk everytim when she buy the oreo snack . and she tell me that she agre in thi way oreo becom more delici . actual , we all know that the product `` oreo snack '' never chang , but the advertis success transmit the new imag about the product and make the product much better than befor . consid the aforement reason and exampl i cite abov , i total agre with the assert that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . though good market approach , everyth can be better .
