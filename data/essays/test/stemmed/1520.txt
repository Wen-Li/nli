i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . whi becaus understand an idea give us a practic knowledg . it give us the exact mean of the idea . we think that what inform behind that idea . understand a concept mean to know the whole inform of the product or thing . becus one idea can chang our life . we all know that famou scientist newton , one day he wa at the appl tree sudenli one appl wa felt infront of him . he thoght that whi it is not go back to same place . for thi he invent an idea that there is a gravit forc on the earth . today all peopl around the world accept thi truth . thi concept of earth gravit forc came from the idea of newton . so it is import for student to understand idea and concept . i disagre that it is not more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus an experi will make you leader in the societi . great person mahatma gandhiji becam the most popular person in india becus of hi experi . so mani freedom fighter struggl hard for the societi with revolut but fail to get freedom for the countri . for thi reason gandhiji struggl for the freedom with peac and got freedom to countri . so by learn the thing everi child or person will becom the good citizen to thier countri . so thi is the best way of do right thing . final i would like to conclud that understand idea and to learn fact both are import to the student . so student must choos the right thing and give the good name to their famili and for their countri . so we all hope that student will do the right thing .
