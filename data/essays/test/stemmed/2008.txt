from my perspect , it is true that success peopl tri new thing and are will to take risk rather than limit themselv to do what they alreadi are abl to do well . it is fundament to recogn that the chanc of be success are significantli increas by tri new thing , sinc the potenti opportun provid by an effectv invent are most probabl higher than with persist thing . a good exampl in thi context is the bill gate 's creation of comput oper system `` window '' . thi new technolog provid person comput user with a formerli unknown measur of effect in how to oper their comput . accordingli , thi `` invent '' enabl an effect and straighforward usag of comput , a fact that drove demand for thi product to an enorm level . as a consequ increas sale of microsoft window drove the success of bill gate . by simpli stick to and slightli modifi the persist ms do technolog bill gate would have not been abl to have such a great impact and such a high level of success . furthermor , success peopl are better in deal with risk . when risk can be handl in an appropri way they would not limit the winning-potenti of new thing to an extent they could do . correspondingli , if risk can be manag and limit , the incentiv for not do new stuff is lower . let us imagin a project involv the construct of an entir new type of bridg - span a much larger gap and be much more filigran than ani other bridg befor . a good project manag would alway have variou way and tool to manag and reduc risk . for instanc , a detail and accur time plan for the manag of time risk . in addit effect project manag also have creat conting plan of what to do when certain plan process fail to work . by have tool that at hand the level of risk can be reduc in such a way that the project success can be facilit .
