i do agre with the given statement . i think a main fact is that have success rather push one forward than stay on the same level or take step backward . for exampl a gymnast who just success tri a new more difficult jump at the vault is will to go further and tri anoth new difficult jump in the futur compar to a gymnast who ha not much success in learn new jump or move . thi last person is rather discourag by the former experi than the success person . success gener encourag peopl in tri new thing and take risk . i do agre with the fact that it also depend on the individu as far as charact and habit but there are peopl who might start take risk , who have never done so befor as a result of posit experi in the past which encourag them to act more riski than befor . therefor i think the individu charact affect that habit onli to a certain degre . human be also tend to rather want to go forward and experi new terretori than stay where they are . that desir is even greater when one is success becaus it make one feel good . eventu one want more of that feel and therefor tri to find way of get to that point again . of cours it can result in surrend and discourag but even then one would tri again to get to that level of success . anoth exampl could be a player in a casino . at the beginnig thi person ha not won anyth yet but onc he or she start win it will be hard to stop becaus there could be more to win and it give a certain pleasur . a fact whi mani peopl ca n't stop play is the feel they get by win , which is enorm at gambl . the feel of success is one mayor caus of peopl take even more risk .
