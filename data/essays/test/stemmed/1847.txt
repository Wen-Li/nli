in my opinion , advertis should be use to explain which are the real product qualiti . nowaday advertis are mainli use to `` confus '' peopl that have to buy them , so they are not abl to estabilish which product is realli the best one , becaus they are blind by a lot of advertis that seem to indic that the product which they are refer to is better than the other . the question is : there is someth true in those advertis ? how can we choos a product start to hi adveris if we are not sure about their effect qualiti ? thi is the point ! we ca n't . .. we can onli tri it , and off cours , we have to buy it . . there are a lot of exampl , like product relat to the fit . in televis , dure a spot , somebodi show someth that could help us to loos kylo in few day . is that true ? just tri it , and it could happen that thi isn ' t a real and possibl goal . in my person experi , i bought a flat televis and the seller told me that there wa n't the possibl of dead pixel , in agre with the product advertis . after few day , i find three dead pixel on my monitor . i agre with that statement , it is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is becaus nowaday there is the necess to sell as mani product as they are produc , but , in seller opinion , the onli way to do thi is to manipul the real product qualiti use fals advertis . i don think thi is a good thing . . it is a kind of trick that can be danger for peopl who beliv in advertis , and who buy someth hope that it can help them .
