no fuel no road no car peopl would not be abl to breath after twenti year due to pollut and we think of cars. `` dust dust everywher , no tree for oxygen , a big hole in o-zon '' are enough to make my view clear that car would be extinct from the world in near futur . car run on petrol and diesel would not get fuel for their startup . today in the present era , the consumpt of fuel and energi is so rampant that within no time our world would be xhaust from all what god ha given us . the foremost thing requir to run car is the fuel which is depleat day by day . the indiscrimin log of wood for our selfish motiv would also becom a decis factor for the futur of vehicl in the world . scientist have evolv a new concept of solar car run on solar energi but i have a question for all of tham that what willl be the ue of car onc situat aris for pertain your own surviv . the increas pollut due to danger gass emit by car would be the caus of their demic . the road are built after industrialis on the place where forest prevail . tthese thing would ultim lead to the damag of societi . the ozon layer ha got a big hole which emit harmful ultraviolet wave straight to us from sun . onc these wave start flow , even solar car would be of no use . the car newli made to run on ga are activ and highli inflam where a bit of error can caus life suffer . these gass are also deplet due to their extens use . thu virtual there will be no way out . i would person like to suggest the use of cycl and public transport mean which would increas the life span of vehicl reduc pollut and preserv resourc . thu conclud thi topic , i would like to take a note to all scientist to prepar way in which the earth can be save and not the increment in car . the deplet of resourc sure would end up the era of cars.a fewer would also be difficult to be sought out .
