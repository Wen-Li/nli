i do agre with the statement that most advertis are exagger their product to be seen more better . in fact , there have been mani case the consum critis that the product they have purchas did not pleas them much but disappoint them . there are some reason whi these product be advertis are in actual fact more degrad than describ in the advertis . plu , there are also factor which make us becom attract to the product . firstli , the compani exagger the product on purpos to make a better profit . the compani normal do not tell lie on the function but do tell lie on how effect it is . there were mani case report in news that the peopl who have actual came out in the advertis to tell about the product effici did not tri the actual product . some advertis do show the interview of consum . howev , thi act is not reliabl sinc they may not be the real consum . secondli , the advertis may not exagger but may hide the disadvantag of the product . for exampl , we can see a televis advertis . the advertis will emphas on the posit view of the televis for sure , that it is wide or that it is clear . howev , the televis may not have a good function in channel or may have a bad design . all consum will choos thi televis when the advertis highlight the clear and the size , but not it design or function . and soon , the consum will critis the advertis compani . thirdli , the word use in the advertis are too attract . these situat are often seen on poster on build . i have seen mani diet class poster . these poster will sure attract mani obes peopl , who desir a better bodi line . howev , the scientist state that a balanc diet and regular excercis are a better way to make a perfect bodi line . and plu , mani peopl did not succeed in their diet by attend these diet class . the unreli interview of consum , the limit advertis and the exagger word use are all factor which attract the consum . howev , if we , the consum , calm ourselv down , we will be abl to see that the product may or are made to be seen better than actual by those advertis skill . we have to be care when choos a product , whether the advertis is exagger or hide someth .
