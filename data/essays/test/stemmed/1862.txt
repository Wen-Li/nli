although i can understand peopl argu that there will be more car in use in twenti year from now than there are today , i support the idea that there will be fewer car in use . there are three main reason whi i think thi will be the case . first , dure the last ten year oil price went up constantli . thi wa mainli caus by polit tension aris between countri provid and consum oil . i think thi develop will continu sinc most polit conflict caus these tension still exist today and becaus there are no easi solut avail to solv these problem in the near futur . therefor , with oil price continu to rise , less and less peopl will be abl to afford to pay the fuel need for their vehicl and as a consequ , the number of car in use will decreas . second , global oil resourc are shrink . it is becom more and more difficult to bring oil to the earth 's surc and to find new sourc of oil . thi is back by the fact that alreadi today an increas amount of off-shor oil platform are built and that oil is alreadi be explor in life-threaten area like the polar region . therefor , sinc fuel suppli come to an end and sinc altern technolog like hydrogen power car will probabl not yet be public avail , shrink global oil resourc are a further reason whi number of car in use dure the next twenti year will decreas . third , air pollut will continu to dramat increas in the futur . thi put a seriou threat to peopl 's health and a countri 's citizen ' live qualiti . therefor , it is veri like that countri start to restrict and even reduc the number of car allow on their street . as a consequ , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . consid all the argument and develop mention abov , i think it is veri clear that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . person , i hope that i will still be abl to drive my own car , sinc i would miss the conveni of unrestrict mobil veri much .
