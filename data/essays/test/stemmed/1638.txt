i agre that peopl who are success take risk and tri new thing . it is not a coincid that it exist the say `` who doe not risk , doe not win '' . the world is alway chang and there is alway the need of someth new and differ and if we onli do what we know well it can come a moment when what we know is not enougth and we need to learn someth new in order to stay in . success compani are those who take risk . let take the photo industri as an exampl . when the digit camera came out , not all compani new well how to do thi kind of technolog but they took a chanc and tri it , if they had not done that , they would still be sell regular camera and would alreadi be out of the market . becaus the need have chang . the same situat happen with peopl . it is true that we are usual afraid to tri new thing and get out of the routin , it is mayb becaus we feel more secur and confort with the idea that we know exactli what we are do and that we are do it rigth , but we migth come to a point where we need to chang , to evolv , to look for new horizon . i say thi becaus if we take and exampl of a person who work in a compani , he knwo well what he doe , but he doe not have the posibl to grow in the compani anymor , he ha two option : stay there becaus he alreadi know what he ha to do , he alreadi know the peopl and the system and he doe not have to chang anyth . or , look for other option , it can be riski , differ , new , mayb he is not go to know exactli the job and will have to learn new thing , but mayb he can have a better chanc of success . take risk and tri new thing open new door for the present and the futur .
