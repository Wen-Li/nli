i do n't agre with statement . success doe n't depend on tri new stuff . it depend on how much effort that person put in . even if some peopl take risk all the time and tri new thing , if they stop right there with just experi , and not studi about it , that 's not go to help with their success life . it 's just wast of time . as i mention befor , it depend on their effort . sometim , peopl learn from take risk , but not often . plu , peopl can be success through discov new thing without take risk . peopl learn from past , includ how to do well . they learn from past first , befor they take risk . let 's say i wa read art histori book and find out how to improv my art project . then , that 's learn from past , not learn from take risk . learn from take risk , could look cool or creativ . but is doe n't alway work that way . if someon doe n't have ani common sens , and tri to find out new thing , that person can end up die , not just take risk . of cours , it 's not healthi to do `` onli '' what they alreadi know how to do well . but import thing is , they have to know thing in the book that peopl from past found out for us befor they take risk . peopl call person , who take risk and find out new way of someth , `` inventor '' inventor is onli one form of success . to be success peopl , we do n't alway have to take risk , but concentr what they are do , and tri to find the way from experi , not risk . ( of cours , i 'm say take risk and experienc is total differ . ) everyon ha their own talent . they should tri to find their talent befor they take risk by tri new thing . we have to improv from thing that alreadi say how to do well . not start over . take risk could be start over . i disagre with the statement. ; `` sucess peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
