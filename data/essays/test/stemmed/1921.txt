do young peopl have nowaday fewer time to sacrific to their commun ? i deepli think that the respons to thi question doe not depend on the age of peopl but more on their origin and on the countri they live . for exampl in a countri like the unit state peopl who earn a lot of monney are more like to give a big amount of their salari to their commun than in europ . in fact in the unit state peopl are will to give money to associ becaus they feel oblig to help when they can do it . nevertheless it is true that befor peopl were closest to their commun than now . inde becaus of lot of thing like the global or free market for exampl peopl tend to work more than in the previou year . therefor they do not have as much time as befor for their commun despit that i think that they don not deslik them . in my opinion elderli peopl give more time to help their commun than young peopl . the reason is easi to guess , they stope work so they can give their time to help their commun . whatev they do they are to me less useful than young peopl but their without their help their commun do not work well . in a word i assum the fact that nowaday young peopl do not give the same amount of time to help their commun but there are other paramet like the countri they live or the job they do to consid . inde someon who work twenti hour a week is more like to help hi commun than someon who work eighti hour a week that is my point of view
