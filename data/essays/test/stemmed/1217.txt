i am disagre with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i do not think the statement by two point . that is travel in a group and led by a tour guid . frist , i do not like to travel with a tour guid . i think one of the excit thing on travel is plan , but led by a tour guid mean almost all of the travel plan is made by a tour guid . flight is decid , hotel is decid , schedul is decid , rest time is decid , sometim suveni shop is decid ! the onli thing we choic is where we go . it is never joy becaus everyth is restrict . although travel in a group is not so bad , led by a tour guid is so bad . i feel i am rob my pleasur . next , i do not think travel in a group is the best way . the reason is i want to do everyth freeli in the foreign countri . i enjoy what can i do in the foreign countri , so i do not want to use mother tongu dure the travel . furthermor , the most excit thing for me is `` no plan '' . i am a backpak . so , when i am tire i sleep all the day , when i want to move i go next countri or back to home . i go somewher i want to go , i stay somewher i want to stay , sometim i stay sobodi 's home . these thing can be made by travel alon . becaus of the two point , i do not think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the best way to travel is `` alon '' .
