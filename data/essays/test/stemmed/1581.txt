it is often said that advertis is a form of lie , that most of the time consum do not buy their expect . i do not agre with thi assumpt . first of all , advertis are made by salesmen and women . their final goal is , logic , to sell a product . in order to sell a product certain thing are need but the most import one is the envi of the custom . a good salesman will present hi product in a way that hi custom will get the feel that he need that product more than anyth els in the world . everi good salesman ha an ethic code and so is not suppos to lie to hi client , but logic he will alway emphas the posit featur of hi product . normal salesmanship doe not start with cite everi neg aspect of the product . second , i call upon the respons of the buyer . it is veri easi to blame advertis for misbuy , but in thi modern age inform is everywher . consum can inform themselv about product in numer way and they alway must take into account the point of view of the advertis , which is to promot their product . when a consum ha not inform himself properli he must not play stupid afterward . do advertis make product seem better that they realli are ? ye , but everybodi should take that into consider when purchas someth . the rule of the game are clear , when peopl feel cheat on , they should reread their manual .
