some peopl think go to have a trip with a group and a tour guid is a good choic while other hold the opposit idea . as far as i am concern , i believ it is a good choic to travel with a group with a tour guid . there are may be one or two disadvantag to have a trip with group and tour guid , howev i think the advantag are far more . first of all , one of minor disadvantag to have a trip with a group is that you will lose your freedom partli . for exampl , you can not go wherev you want to dure the trip such as you want to go to visit somewher is not includ in thi trip schedul but you just begin to be interest in . anoth drawback is you can not arrang your time freeli . for instanc , you need be on time and make sure not be late for the arrang dure the trip . such as have breakfast in time , leav time , gather time . though there are one or two disadvantag to join the travel group with a tour guid i do believ the advantag far outweigh them . by take the group trip with a tour guid , you can enjoy your trip as much as possibl and do not need alway check your arrang . for exampl , you do not need check the inform about the trip arrang such as hotel book , reastaur book or bu arrang . also by join the group trip you do not need prepar a lot for the trip . for exampl it is not nessari for you to prepar the knowledg detail about citi or countri you will go such as histori , cultur , eat habit , climat inforn . all those you will be told by the tour guid befor or dure your trip and by take group trip you can help or be help dure the trip . for exampl you lose you way dure the trip . you will be help by other to find you back to the group . anoth advantag to take the group trip with a tour guid is that you can make friend and have a veri wonder atmospher . for exampl you will feel more enjoyfui to travel with lot of peopl with the same interest as you . so you can share the memor moment with them and each of you is abl to have unfotget memori such as your good pictur which were taken by other . you may becom friend later through the trip . although i agre there are one or two disadvantag to take a group trip with a tour guid i believ the advantag are more obviou . consider though the benifit spend the trip time freeli alon enjoy are , they can not compet with the advantag that take your trip with other bring out when share the joy moment and make friend are taken into account . so take a group with a tour guid is noth but a wise choic for me .
