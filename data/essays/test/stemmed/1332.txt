when face the question whether understand idea and concept is more improt than lean fact , differ peopl have their own choic over other . howev , if it is up to me to make a decis , i do believ understand idea and concept are more import with out hesit . and with respect to my prefer come three follow reason . first and foremost , the reason enjoy the propriti as my optimum choic state that real idea and concept could make student get more useful knowledg which they must equip to find more fact . concept , i think , is the basi of scienc which could explain lot of natur phenomena . for exampl , i have a litter brother who alway fell coriou about some amaz thing which i think is just a simpl work . howev , becaus the lack of concept understand , he alway get confus of it . so , no concept , no problem could be solv . the more concept we have receiv , the more way we could explor our life , and then , the more chanc we could invent new product and achiev success . accord to a survey for the inventor who all have got sever invent prise , ninti percent of them had acknowledg the real concept befor they went to work on their think . that is true becaus a person have no specif idea will not plan their work well . no wonder mani scient believ basic concept are so necessari . last but not least , idea and concept understang could be easi to measur student 's qualiti and how mani much knowledg they have achiev . a concept repeat or exam , rather than talk about the fact the student just experienc , may test the ture abil of student by present the score they just got in the exam . mayb it is easier for teacher to understand their student 's studi condit howev , a coin ha two side and the flip side of it is that without learn the fact , student will not understand anyth well . though it exsit , i state that understand concept is more import .
