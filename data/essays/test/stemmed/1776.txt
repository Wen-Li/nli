i agre to the given statement , that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . bacaus , dure the travel we will visit mani place . they may be familiar to you or may not be . if i travel alon without a guid there are a lot of problem that i have to face . i may be misguid by my minor knowledg about the place and it becom difficult to manag them . for exampl , i may enter a new place where i do n't know anyth like where to go , how to get my work to be done . some time if i am out of the countri there will be a problem with the languag . sinc i do n't have ani idea about the place , i have to enquir other to get the inform , and there come the problem with the languag . if i am travel to a new place and if i miss the rout to travel , then i will be struck there without help and i ca n't reach the destin . if i travel in a group with a tour guid , he or she can assist the correct way to travel and also help in get the thing to be done . the guid take care of us and guid in a correct direct in ani matter . we can solv the problem like the languag problem , sinc ther are more chanc that atleast a singl person in the group know the languag , which help a lot for our travel . a group can give the best solut to a problem , rather than a singl person . if we are travel in a group and if there is ani problem there are mani chanc of get the best idea to getrid of the problem . if i am travel alon i may not get the best idea of get out of the problem . the guid also help us travel to our destin without ani problem sinc he know everyth about that place . so i prefer travel in group led by a tour guid .
