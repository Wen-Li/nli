i agre that it is more import for student to underst idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understand the idea is the goal of the studi becaus if you understand the idea you can invent a new idea , understand the idea is the basic of ani thing to be profission . howev , just learn fact is not enogh to be creativ or profisson . understand the idea is the best way to studi , whatev you want to studi . by thi way , you can learn anyth . for exampl , when a student want to learn about a complex subject , he want to understand the subject first and he will have a lot of question , that is whi understand the idea is veri import . if you pay attent in an acadam class or in the school , the professor or the teacher alway ask `` do you have a question , do you understand ? '' learn fact is also import but not as much as understand idea , learn fact should come after you understand the idea , it also good for exampl . veri rare subject that count on learnig fact more than understand the idea . all of them is good way to learn , sometim student should make hi own way to staudi and alway tri to know what is the right and the wrong .
