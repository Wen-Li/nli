i travel about 20 countri in my life . travel around the world wa fun and veri good experi for me . sometim , i travel by myself or friend and i use group packag tour with a tour guid . some peopl said that travl group led by a tour guid is the best way . in my opinion , there is no way for best way for travel and you can enjoy your trip without a tour guid and not invlov in group . travel in a group led by a tour guid , there is n't much free time to enjoy yourself . you have to follow a tour guid and listen what he say . after that , you have to ride a bu right away and go to the next place . these are all schedul by a tour guid , so you can not enjoy yourself . person tast are all differ , and you might want to stay more time in some place . howev , it is imposs to do whatev you want , becaus it is a group tour . travel is seri of unexpect happen . i think it is one of the reason that peopl are enjoy the trip . a group tour ha fix schedul , so experienc unexpect accid are veri rare . some peopl might do n't want to have thi kind of situat . howev , when you look back your trip in the futur , i can strongli say that unexpect accid give you more memeri and portrait on your trip . tour with a guid are more expens . all the packag tour fee are includ payment for guid , so it cost more that travel without guid . theseday , mani travel go to the trip by themselv to save money , and there are a lot of inform to help them . there is no best way for travel . everyth can be chang depen on trip of purpos . i think best way to travel is not a group led by toyr guid , but for you memori
