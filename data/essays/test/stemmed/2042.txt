typic , it is more import for student to learn about idea that help them with up come event in their life , howev , if student learn about the idea without understand them , there will be diffculti that will face them . be a student , i believ that understand the idea and concept of thing is more preferr that just learn them . less mistak occur if the understand of the issu is there . although , if the understand is not present , mistak will occur . for that , student will onli know the littl detail behind the action but will not know from right or wrong . learn fact is like have a world where anyth is possibl . noth will seem wrong to peopl becaus the reason behind the fact without understand , will lead to peopl do wrong from good . furthermor , understand the concept teach the student to choos the right decis without think about the fact behind it . understand the fact will lead to an understand with peopl that have differ issu that ca n't be solv . for exampl , war is the wrong thing to do , but they are still happen . if an american solid were to kill an unarm man from palastin , for the fact that he did noth but protect hi famili , that solid is consid to be stupid and heartless . the fact that thi unarm man is the solid enemi , where he is in a helpless posit , without understand the concept that kill is wrong , that man is dead for just that fact . to conclud , i believ that understand the issu or concept of thing is better than just learn the fact . it give the student a chanc to learn from right and wrong without hesit . they will also have the chanc to know the reason behind the choic made becaus without that understand the concept , wrong will be right .
