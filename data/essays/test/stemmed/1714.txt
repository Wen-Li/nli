i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are and thi is veri famou trick to attract custom to buy their product by make huge announs in magazin , news paper , and tv show and give free sampl for custom . howev , some product are not get good advertis but in realiti these product are excel . so advertis are play a big role in sale product . for exampl , i use to buy anti dandruff shampoo it wa good and suit my hair then i saw a big advertis for anoth shampoo when i use it i was'nt good . in the other hand , some advertis reflect a good imag for the product and the other are not , so it is depend on the compani and how much money they have to spend ot for thi advertis . in my opinion we should not look how much the advertis are big but we should know the qualiti of the product . more than that , avertis are veri important in produc the product and produc the qualiti of these product so it should not be exagur or veri simpl but it should reflect how much the product are use and good for custom .
