although i think that learn by fact is more import in the life of student , in my opinion is more import for them undestand idea and concept than learn fact . there are two fundament reason for which i think that the understand is more import that learn . in the first place , as far as i am concern without idea there are not fact to learn . the most import discoveri in the all kind of scienc there are not possibl if there are not base on an idea or a conpcet . we think to the theori of the rel formul by albert einstain in 1902 is an exampl that it can support my opinion . in my view in fact for a student is more import know and understand the process and the question that thi theori had open and develop than know the fact itself . anoth reason for which i think so is the import of the immagin and of the creativ . understand the idea and the concept of the whole world open our mind to new discoveri . accordingli the develop of the tecnolog is possibl becaus of it is base on the studi of other peopl that probabl have not had the possibl to continu their studi or have not been abl to see a particular thing . so , in conclus , i think that the possibl to immagin or to conceiv an idea is the basi of the progress of the world . fact are simpl a fact .
