i believ , that mani advertis do display the featur of a product in a fairli too posit way . from my point of view , there is a variati of reason whi thi is the case . frist the main obejct of an advertis is to attract peopl 's attent be ani mean . a normal product we use in our everyday life normali doe not provid that , becaus it is just too ordinari . therefor the creativ peopl in market depar who produc these advertis need to put someth special to the product . thi might be a product featur which is a bit exager ( in comparison to other product in the relev market segment ) or a featur which is not neccesaryli combien with thi product . a problem of thi strategi is probabl , that costum may chang their to a product of a competitor , if their expact are not met . but from my perspect thi risk is fairli low , becaus all costum known that everi compani act the same way . therefor the client usual do n't expect to reciev a 100 % of what is said in the advertis . second : sinc mani compani in the market tri to get someon 's attent , the advertis may show a tendenc of get a littl bit more extrem from time to time . thi get obviou if you compar advertis in televis dure the 60 's with today . so compani do have a real advantag if there ad 's are just a littl more recongnis as the ad 's of competitor . thi a kind of a ` herd movment ' in the whole advertis industri . i think , there are a lot of good argument in favour of my point of view .
