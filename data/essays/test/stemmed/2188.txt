i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it is becaus the advertis is a tool for compani how can they spread the product the most effect . i will give three reason to support my opinion . first , the advertisemnt is for sale . the compani need profit to suistain their compani , so that they want to sell their product as much as they can , and maintain the high price as much as they could . to make it effect they need a good advertis which turn out most peopl feel that advertis is better than a actual product . second , the advertis is for commerci reason , which i mention a littl in the first reason , so that to make an advertis leaflet they just take the best pictur of the product . for exampl if the compani made a packag of 10 special tasti appl but they do not have to show all of them , what they can do is , they can simpli show the one best pictur which they have taken from all of the appl . third , most of or all the compani want to maintain the high price for their product . they tri to advertis more effect to more peopl get attract . i wa encount sever time , i can give an exampl which i still rememb , i order a chocol box but the size of the product wa much smaller than i expect , which wa veri unexpect . in conclus i agre with the sentens from abov three reason . the sad thig is even some compani , made a good product they can not sell effect unless they are success in market , mean good advertis . so that everi compani need to success in advertis which lead to most advertis make product seem much better than what they realli are
