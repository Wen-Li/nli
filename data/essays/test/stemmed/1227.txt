i partial agre with the statement , but not complet . although differ peopl might have differ perspect for it . some peopl prefer to travel in group led by a tour guid , wherea some prefer to travel alon or in group without be led by a tour guid to explor thing on their own . a tour could have differ purpos . it could be an educ tour or a tour in vacat with an intent to explor and feel the beauti of natur . there are mani literatur and book-guid avail for well known place round the world . a book written by explor could help you understand the place of visit thoroughli than a tour guid could explain it to you . it is worth spend after a book , though expens but onc , rather than spend out money for the tour guid . a tour guid is a human be and we human be are demand bunch . a group might have to spend a fair amount after a tour guid , wherea a book ha to be bought onli onc and it could guid you throughout it lifecycl . interact with a tour guid could be uncomfort for few member in the group as the tour guid is an unkown person from the unfamiliar place . moreov , visit a foreign place , to enjoy the compani of a good tour guid , we might have to overcom the difficulti of cultur or linguist differ . also , we could not judg what kind of person he is . so it is alway better to travel without a tour guid and tri to explor new thing and place on your own than to prefer to take risk . apart from the ambigu that could be encount in decis to take a tour guid , it could be benefici to have a tour guid at few place of visit like forest , where there is an intrins chanc of an attack by the wild predat . a tour guid can warn you befor enter a particular zone . he can help you to understand what thing are to be taken care of or consid befor enter such area . but a tour to a familiar place like the unit state of america doe not requir a tour guid . there are mani book materi avail to understand and explor the natur beauti and cultur heritag of the unit state . so , i concur , without ani ambigu that , to travel in a group by be or not led by a tour guid depend on the type of place you are visit .
