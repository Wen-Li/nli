from my point of view as a consum , i total agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are sever exampl to support it . to begin with , there are full of toothpast in out market . some of them are made to attract peopl who want their tooth becom more bright . the seller made the advertis which describ a man whise tooth wa dark three week ago , but after he use the amaz toothpast , hi tooth now is brighter ! i think mani propl will be haunt by it . i wa one of them . i went to the supermarket and bought one to dri , but as you know , it wa in vain . moreov , the women in asia dedic themselv to make their skin becom more white . hundr of product were design to serv thi appeal . as i can rememb , one year ago , i bought a so call fantasi lotion which would not onli whiter your skin and also protect you from the sun light . howev , after my roommat and i use it for two month , none of us becam whiter ! last but not least , young ladi are alway concern their bodi shape and weight . there are countless medicin and loss weight oil in the market . i never believ that we can lose weight onli by take pill , so i never buy them . but one of my friend wa crazi about it . she bought a lot of product that have lose weight function . but she alway complain to me that `` the medicin wa a lie . '' sometim the advertis describ their product with exagger . we must have to know it . in conclus , i wa the victim of advertis . i spend a lot of money to buy them but the result are realli limit . i think all of us should be awar that some of the advertis are not as good and effec as they present .
