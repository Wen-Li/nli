a first and foremost qualiti of the human race is ominpot in thi world of fusion , commun and progress , i firmli believ that a persion with the possess of a wide spectrum of knowledg overtak the one with onli a specif knowledg in onli one field . research in thi current advanc world requir us to have a broad rang of knowleg . as we can see in the case of newton and hook , it is hook that rais the discuss of univers graviti , while newton is the first person to give the mathemat proof . hook is onli a empir physicist , which contribut to hi narrow-minded in hi field-h do not own the same mass volum of mathemat knowledg as newton doe . as we can perceiv in the histori book , newton util calculu in complet the proof , which make him a great differ in the scienc histori . a second requir deriv from our own self . for instanc boethiu , the cathol sentenc to death by the theodor , innov the neoplaton and brought forth the tradit `` liber art '' in the mediev time . liber art conduc to the holist develop of a success individu , at least in hi time . even univers in middl age are base upon that idea . accord to hi work , the realm of knowledg can be divid into the tier of theolog , philosophi and scienc . let 's take a switch from late antiqu to modern time . it is alreadi clear that einstein 's innov in the field of physic ha much to do with hi music train and philosoph think , through the care anatomi of hi brain . a scientist , especi a scientist in the field of theori , share the basi of creation with musician and artist . that is the hominin essens within human-b . then what is hominin essenc ? we human-b are distinguish from the brutal beast in that we creat with intent . thi creation , if view on macro-level , includ all aspect of human knowledg . it 's a splendid star with the combin of art , histori , scienc , mathemat , philosophi , theolog , et cetera . therefor a repres of the human race should possess all aspect of human knowledg , with noth omit . to be one member of the human race , how can one person onli possess a limit amount and a narrow rang of what is essenti in the foundat of hominin essenc ? therefor he or she should get accoutr with anyth , or ani aspect that character the whole human race ! whether consid the respect of research or ponder the aspect of hominin essenc , a human-b , if he is eager to becom a member of the human race , should equip himself with a wide spetrum of knowledg . a man , by definit , is the master of all exist art per se . he , without ani doubt , should be omnipot .
