it can be interest to tri to respond to the follow question : `` is it better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' . i ' ll tri to give few exampl of my person experi . one the one hand , i think it 's import to have a solid generalist basi , becaus we are abl to solv a great lot of problem and we are much more smarter . our job often demand us to have broad knowledg in veri differ subject , so it is import to have solid basi in mani academ subject . but one the other hand , it 's obviou that specialist are veri import to our societi . the first exampl i will develop is the doctor . generalist are necessari to make a first diagnost of what we suffer , but they are not enough qualifi in mani situat . for exampl , when whe have audit problem , whe have to go to an audit specialist becaus the generalist can not help us . it is the same for view or skin problem . the second exampl i want to bring about is the teacher . teacher with a broad knowledg are veri useful for teach the young one in the begin of their scolar . but sinc we decid to make long studi , we have to be taught by teacher which are special in a subject . for exampl , a gener teacher can not taught you complex algebra or differenti equat becaus he doe not have learn to teach it . when you are studi in order to becom class teacher , you are learn a great lot of subject . so you have not the time to develop a particular subject , such as partial equat in mathemat . as a conclus , i think that it is import for everybodi to have solid basi in mani academ subject , but specialist are necessari in our societi .
