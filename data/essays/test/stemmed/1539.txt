i do agre with the statement becaus i am convinc that advertis are creat with the intent of not onli promot specif charaterist of a product , but creat expect in the mind of the consum . thi expect are what in the end , lead the decis of the consum , and without thi expect , the consum will not be convinc about whi expend their money in one product or anoth . so the creation of a better imag definetli is the main object of the advertis . i rememb to have analys thi situat of whi doe the advertis make look to a product much better than what they reali are . when i studi busi administr at universidad de la america , a global and higli intern mexican colleg , and i felt that the program apporach social issu in a veri broad and comprehens manner . nevertheless , i felt form the start of the program that understand of social issu would be use to improv my gener manag in the human factor . thu , i enrol in some cours delv into the complex of the mind and how doe it affect everi activ undertaken . thi led me to studi the work of dr. jose carroza , a famou spanish sociolog that discuss the topic at lenght . he make secer studi relat to the impact of advertis in potenti custom . he wa veri interest in know wheter a custom will buy a product just by the object characterist . hi research conclud that even if a product could perform better than other , it will not be buy by the custom . he demostr that a good advertis can sell more of a product that doe not perfom as good as anoth one . in my own experi , i have been also wit of the observ that good advertis sell when it present larg expect for a product . work as a project director for grupo aitex , a major real state develop with public and privat concern ha expos me chanlleng situat not onli relat to technolog , busi , industri and econom situat , but relat also to the peopl with whom i close work . thi exposur ha broaden my mind understand on how doe differ background and experi affect everyon decis and ha also help me in see situat from differ perspect befor make a decis . i rememb one time when i wa abl to prove the efficieni of make an advertis campaign for a new project of 500 flat . at that time my boss explain to me the import of make high expect for the target market , becaus as he said `` the success of the futur sell depend on how much we could encourag the peopl to come to our new project . '' the impact of the campaign wa so sucess that we stablish a new record on sale . i will never forget the impress of that experi produc just becaus of an advertis . but the impact of a good advertis is not just local , as i had the opportun to discov in mani of my trip around the world . mani of my most import memori are relat with travel , not onli to major citi , but to the rich and fabul divers of my beauti countri mexico . in my travel , i had taken time to chat with the local about differ situat , and i rememb one time when i wa in india take dinner with a group of peopl from difer countri and we were discuss about the impact of public in our percept to some product . we were recal one televis spot from the gillet compani that wa promot the razor for me . with the group , we discuss about how that advertis wa spread all over the world , and it wa amaz to discov about it impact . all the peopl that were gather that day conclud that we had been affect by that advertis in the same way , but in differ countri . that experi proven to me that the impact of the advertis when they make a product seem much better than they realli are , is global .
