i support the idea that succes peopl tri new thing and take risk , becuas that the first step of success . the first thing you need to do in order to begin someth new it 's take the risk that come with it . the fear that the unknown bring it 's what hold us back in life . if you 're not will to take ani risk in life you 're alway go to be sure that noth bad it 's go to happend , but neither someth good and unexpect . and you 're go to loos a lot of opportun that involv take risk , even simpl thing like go on a trip , or buy someth new and rare . thi fear can becom a problem in our live , and i experienc them , as i think a lot of peopl do . you becom afraid of what may happen if you do someth new . and that becom like a habit and you just stop tri becaus you feel confort in the world you live in , and ani opportun of chang you livestyl or anyth in your life bring a risk , a big risk for you . the realiti , i think , it 's that what happen or if you get what you expect it 's not that import , what 's import is that you do what you feel it 's right and can make you happi , and it may bring you a lot of new and good thing into your life . that 's whi the peopl that take risk and tri new thing are more like to experi a lot of differ situat and learn from them and get a lot of succ , becuas they take the risk and they do n't stop if someth goe wrong they just tri someth new !! . i admir thi kind of peopl and i 'm work on becom one of them . there 's noth to realli fear about new experi , they mean that you live and learn , and after the time ha past , all we have left it 's our happi moment and experi throughout our live .
