i do fulli agre with that statement . from my person experi as a consum of product and of their advertis , i can just underlin thi estim . sinc my father run an advertis agenc , i got some insight into the world of advertis and am even more convinc that product are in almost everi case better look on tv or in newspap than in realiti . to start of with my person experi as a consum , i made countless experi with product or servic that were suppos to be a `` revolut in their field '' , `` the one and onli '' frozen pizza , cellphon contract , hair colour or whatev . .. and turn out to be as complic , bad-tast and expens as everi other product . by work sometim in my father 's advertis agenc , i took a look behind the scene . pictur of product are work on with special programm until the product or the model hold it look perfect , import inform and condit are often written extra small , so that one realli ha to look for them in an advertis . sinc i know now how that work , i know how to deal with commerci and announc . but particularli children and older peopl might not consid advertis as advertis but as factual descript of product which is a problem . there are alreadi numer children in dept becaus of too much consumpt . as to older peopl the increas use of english word may also present a challeng for them to understand the featur of a product . although there are mani neg aspect in thi regard , i do also realiz that i like to buy or have product which transport a certain life style - which must be great to hear for peopl work in the advertis branch . .. and thi life style is veri often commun through advertis . to conclud , i am of the opinion that it is import to know that the aim of a commerci or a nice pictur is to make peopl buy the product and not to deliv pure and object inform . especi children should be taught about that by parent and in school .
