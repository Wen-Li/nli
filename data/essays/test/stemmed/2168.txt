from my point of view thi statement is absolut true . there are three major argument that support my opinion . first of all i would like to invit you on a trip through our recent histori . it wa about 1000 a.d. when erik the red set sail to greenland with about 25 ship . more than half of them sunk in the rough sea passag between iceland and the coloni they were head for . they set sail even though they knew about the difficulti which they might have to face . all of them could have continu their career as bee a craftsmen of a farmer . but they did not becaus of their inner desir to discov someth new , to extend the border of the known world . erik 's son leifur ( nation hero of iceland ) wa the first to set a foot on the new world ( northern america ) . with thi exampl it can be seen that progress onli occur when men or women take risk . thi is of cours onli one of thousand of exampl throughout histori . what about the discoveri of x-ray by the german physicist roentgen or the apollo-11 mission to the moon ? all these achiv ( mani of them increas our life standard enorm ) would not have been possibl without take risk . therfor we should be thank for all the brave peopl who put their idea and dream abov their own life . in contrast to that i would also like to point out that it is hard to defin a success life . is somebodi less success just becaus he stay at home with hi wife and care for hi kid ? as you can see a conflict aris about a clear definit of success . nevertheless i would like to leav it like that and draw my conclus . throughout histori progress wa onli possibl becaus of brave men and women .
