it is an undeni fact that increas number of thing are avail and therefor we need to learn those thing in order to widen our knowledg . howev although it is import for student to understand the concept , i person believ that it is much more import to learn fact rather than concept for the follow reason . thu i partli disagre with the statement . first of all , without know the fact , we might make a wrong decis . there are variou of incid are happen nowaday and we need to know them in order to plan thing well . when i am watch news , i realis there are so mani thing are happen everyday . those fact will chang our behaviour . secondli , although understand idea is a import aspect for us , learn fact will chang our behaviour . when i am appli univeris i need to know how good the univeristi is . i do not need to know the idea of the uiveris . as a result o howev , on the the hand , learn differ kind of idea can widen our knowledg . sometim if i do not have ani idea i can not do thing well . for exampl , when i am studi psycholog i need to know the idea of the studi rather then that fact . in conclus , even though it is essenti to understand differ idea , i person think that learn fact are more import . moreov , the fact are actual happen so it need to know about it .
