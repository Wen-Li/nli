i total agre that most advetis make product seem much better than they realli are . first of all the purpos of advertis is to sell through a varieti of veri convinc argument . they tri to answer question like whi you should buy my product . how it is more import and ha better qualiti than ani other product on the market . with competit be so high , the focu sometim shift to a more convinc advertis as a mean to increas sell and therefor the advertis exce the qualiti of the product . let consid advil for exampl . a tv commerci for advil usual protray someon experienc an intens pain . the next clip of the commerci would show you that by take one tablet of advil the pain would complet dissappear . everybodi know veri well that it doe not work that way but in other to draw peopl 's attent to the product advertis have to repres the product in a surreal way . the advertis in the motor vehecul industri are even more extravag and surreal . my favorit one is the toyota thundra commerci . in thi commerci a toyota thundra pick up truck is drop over 100 feet from an higher elev . to everybodi 's amaz the truck wa still intact and without a scratch . other commerci would should car drive over water , the most rag terrain without ani problem at all . all those commerci are veri mislead . the portray of those product exceed their qualiti . those car commerci far exceed the perform of those vehicul . even though peol are away of those fake computer base commerci some would buy into them . they help increas not onli the perform of the product but the sell . some peopl would still believ and buy those car with full awar that the commerci or advertis are mislead . some would go as far as to say : `` their is noth import on tv anymor except the commerci . '' in some way they have an intertain qualiti that drone peopl to them . with absolut certainti i would say ye that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
