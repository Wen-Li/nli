i agre with the statement that travel in a group and should be led by an experienc tour guid . then that tour would be full of fruit and sweet moment to cherish and recal . i would like to state the reason gradual whi it requir a tour guid for the new place which we are visit . first and foremost , an experienc guid might have a plan outlin the place , order of visit , time need to spend and take care of lodg ( if requir ) . at thi point , i would recal my person experi with my famili member in the tour with a guid . we visit all the spiritu and tourist place in northern part of our countri ( india ) . the guid wa perfect in plan the logist and place of visit . the guid ha plan our itinerari tour 25 place , lodg and food . most of all he cover all the place in stipul amount of time . the guid had fix specif amount of time for each place of visit . so that , we dont spend more amount of time in one place and spend less in other . he had taken care of food and lodg requir in each place of visit . some histor and spiritu place requir a person who is well vers with the origin of the place and ani specif mythic stori relat to the place . thi kind of inform could be avail from the guid . the guid would make everyon at eas by reveal the invalu inform to us . on the other hand , thi inform could be avail from the book at the site , but thi would requir a read through the book and understand . the inform from the book might be supplement to the inform which guid ha given us . sinc it is the group of peopl visit place , it allow to develop the sens of fratern among everyon in the trip . a sens of belonging and meet differnet person take us to differ horizon of think . it would be lot of fun go as a group and enjoy it .
