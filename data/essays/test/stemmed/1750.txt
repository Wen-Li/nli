i complet disagre with the thought of `` the best wat to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . there are a coupl of reason whi i think thi way . let me tell you one by one . firstli , guid tour doe not allow me to look around anywher . if i want to go to somewher els to where the tour will not visit , i could not visit there . also , i maight have to go somewher i do not want to visit . secondli , in guid tour , there is timekeep . whether i want to stay more or leav as soon as possibl , they will not allow me to do so . for exampl , when i visit kyoto in that tipe of tour , i had no enough time to see the place , becaus in that tour , we had to visit mani place in a day , so we had onli thirti minut per place suprisingli . and the make matter worth , we spent a long time in a bu . thirdli , when i travel in a group led by a tour guid , there are few oppatun to meet and talk with peopl who live around there . meet new peopl is one of interest purpos of travel . when i visit malaysia on my own , i made mani firend there and peopl who live in there tald me much about not onli the place but also their custom . on the other hand , when i visit u.k. in that kind of tour , i did not make friend with anyon . the last but most impot , reserch and find about the place by myself is the best interst thing in a trip ! so , the guid tell me all about the place is someth bore for me . truli , guid are kind to tell inform , i appreci that , howev reserch by myself is more int these are whi i do not prefer travel in a group led by a tour guid . see to anywher , stay anytim , meet new peopl , and fide about someth are the goal of the travel .
