the question at hand is what help student more - understand idea and concept or learn the fact . though i agre that mostli learn a theori is crucial to gain insight about ani topic , howev if it is support by the fact , it expedit the process of learn . to start with , in mani case a student can not visual a concept unless a physic fact accomponi with it . imagin how easi it is to explain a kid graviti by show it exampl compar to explan it just in theori . so a thoeri with a fact is sometim easier to grasp for a student . anoth exampl is subject like physic and chemistri . one can not learn these subject just by read book . thi is reason all school provid practic class along with lectur for these subject . also , sometim just know a concept doe not help to gain the complet understand , fact are requir to complet them . in addit , in certain subject , fact play a bigger role than the theori . for instanc archeolog , histori and upto some extent geographi too . archaelog is noth but fact . histori can not be explain just in theori . moreoev , if we go to the root of it , all idea and concept have been driven by fact onli . each theori ha been invent to explain a fact . so in order to make student think beyond textbook , it is almost mandatori to learn about fact . also , fact motiv student to find their interest . for exampl , just look at star trigger some peopl to choos their profess as astronomi . in summari , i disagre with the opinion that learn idea and concept ha more valu for the student than know fact . to keep their think broad and comprehens , student need to be taught both in balanc .
