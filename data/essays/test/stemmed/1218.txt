to have a real discuss about thi topic , we must rememb the object of an advertis : it is one way to inform peopl , by the paper , the radio or the televis , of the exist of a product and where it is avail . moreov , it ha to show peopl whi the object is necessari , and , in case , whi it is better than the other . but the law forbid advertis to express fals statement about the product : so they have to find some way to sell it the most . it is the reason whi sometim , we find product much better at the televis or the radio than they are when we have it in hand . if we look at the exampl of a children game , the advertis put it in a way that is more conveni for the product than the child bedroom : barbi doll are put togeth in an advertis to make it more interact for the children , but in other way , without the hous , the car , the sister . .. i think the littl girl will be disappoint with a girl alon without possibl . for adult product , the aim is differ : there are sever way to make them buy a product . in car advertis , for exampl , if some advertis aim at attract peopl with power and speed , other prevail design , or the spirit of the car maker . in our time of pollut and energi economi , the smart brand alway put forward in advertis the consumpt of the product , which is the lowest one . but without know the condit in which the test wa made , the argument doe n't have credibl anymor . it is the same thing when you go to the movi or at televis : in the trailer , the advertis put togeth the best extract of a program , in onli one or two minut , so , for action movi for exampl , it give an impress of continu action , which is not necessarili true in the whole program . peopl who like action may be again disappoint if there are too mani slow moment in the whole movi . to conclud , i would say that advertis do n't realli make the product to seem better , but they give it the best in . and moreov , if it seem particularli attract at the begin , a lot of peopl are get quickli bore , and the product loss it attract .
