i person disagre with the opinion that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun . i think that if young peopl are strongli motiv they will do a lot and not onli in help the commun . an exampl that come to my mind is that when last year i did a cours for help and work , of cours without be paid , on the green cross at the hospit . thi ha been a realli interest and challeng experi for me and i think that i gain a lot from it . thi wa just an exampl , but i rememb that there were lot of young peopl at thi cours and all of them went there for my same reason : be help for the commun or at least be a part of it tri to make it better . when i look at my societi in gener i see that are usual young peopl that help the most in the commun . i know that they must be direct or guid from peopl that have more knowledg in it but , again , if they are moitiv they can give lot of satisfact . in conclus i can say that there alway been critic to young gener but in thi case and base on my person experi i do n't find thi statement absolutley true .
