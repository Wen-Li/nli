in the 20 th centuari . advertis drive the consum select . all the intern compani believ that good advertis mean good sale . so they tri to prepar effici and exit advertis for the consum . most of the compani use the effect and also famou person for excel advertis . briefli they use all the way to show product much better than they realli are . befor 10 year the custom select the product after the advertis and most of them dont chang their first product . so that whi the advertis were most import way for the compani . but today all of the world know the advertis lie . the custom dont select the product accord to the advertis . so in thi point compani advertis not onli product but also compani and plant of the firm . becaus today most of the consum select the product accord to the compani name . today all of us know the danon , phlip morri , kraft , coca cola . .. etc . so thi techniqu is also wrong for the select to buy someth . for exampl , i dont want to wacth ani advertis but sometim i am wait the advertis . becaus compani use the ferrari in the advertis . and when i buy ga i am go to the shell becaus i think that ferrari never use bad oil so thi mean that shell oil is the best , it is more appropri my car . actual shell ' oil is not good than bp and also oil is more expens in the shell but they use the ferrari in the advertis . but last month i use the bp oil that incraes my car perform and i reduc the my monthli oil cost . so i agre that mot adevertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
