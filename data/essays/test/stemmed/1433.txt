no i do not agre about thi subject for mani reason , and what might happen to the market or the compeni when they lie or repers their product in better than as it is . firist the compeni when they creat a new product the should make advertis for thier product , but they do n't have to make it better than how doe the product look like becuas if they make it better than how doe it look like the peopl will be suppris and they will not trast them on their new product ani more , becuas the lie to the peopl about their porduct . second the compeni will not success in there probuct and they peopl will not buy it , for exampl one time i saw a product on the t.v and they said it is the best and when you tri it you can not leav it , but unfortun when i went to the market i saw a guy who wa talk to the saler about the product and how the compani lie to the peopl and then i desied to not buy the product . and thi a sempl exampl how the compani might lose thier money in their product and no baddi buy the product . so the compeni ha to get more customar to success in thier work and get mare money , and to make the peopl trast thier product and them , too . i suggest that if a compani want to make an advertis on the t.v or in the road or anywher they do not have to lie to get more money to thier compani ha to foce in the money and how to grab them not to lie on them , so the compani want to sale a new product the peopl can trast them more than ani compani becaus the repres thier product and they did not lie to the peopl about it .
