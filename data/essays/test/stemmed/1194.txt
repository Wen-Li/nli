ye i agre with statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' , thi is becaus if we travel alon and with out a guid you will get bore and u will feel lone in the tour . and accord to me , when i went to tour with my friend i enjoy lot with my friend share the experi and feel and make me more intrest . the best way is to hire a guid so that he will explain the thing which we are go to see and which we are watch , becaus none of us didnot went to that place and none of us known about the histori of that palc . if we hire the guid he will explain the histori of the palc and play some joke on that and make the tour more live . and when i went to the banglor citi alon for some purpos i have to sati alon for 2 day and i wa pretti bore on 2 day . if i went to banglor with a group so , that my two day will more enjoy . lastli , i would like to conclud that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , so that the tour will more live and tour guid will explain all the thing about the tour and the site which we are go to watch and the tour will be well plane by guid and all the time schedul and all other thing will be seen by the tour guid . and by use the tour guid there is no problem of miss the site see place and wounderful thing becaus the tour guid is the profession in that . so if u travel in a group you are go to make the tour more enjoy and give ur most unforgat experi with your group .
