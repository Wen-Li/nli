although it is more import for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and consept , i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and consept . there are two reason for thi : more use and more edic . first of all , to understand idea and concept is more use in the futur . for exampl , to my experi , when i wa a jonior high school student , my math teacher did not tell the answer immidiatri . i would to know the answer fast . howev he teach us import oh think . second , to understand idea and concept is more educ than to lean fact . when student learn concept , they can think of matter . if a lectur thought student onli fact , student do not consid . for exampl , accord to the survey in my countri , in the case that a teacher do not tell fact , 70 % student tri to find fact in their own . for these reason , i agre that it is more import to understand idea and concept .
