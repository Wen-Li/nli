the content of thi discuss is whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre with the statement that it 's more import for student to understnad idea and concept becas of the follow logic reason . i believ onli learn fact doe n't do anyth in the real world . let 's say about the environment problem . lot of disast ha been happen in the world includ flood and harican . we all know it 's not safe to live on the earth anymor . of cours peopl want to live in the safer world but we did n't know whi it 's happen . ten or more year ago we were get to know temperatur of the world is rise up . we found there were some certain relat between them but we did n't know the foudament thing . i mean we didnt't know whi it ha been happen . we did n't know the foundament reaon , so we could n't do anyth about it . thi exampl show it doe n't chang anyth you onli know the fact . now when you understand the basic what can you chang ? retur to the global warm , you can get to know the basic idea and concept of the global warm from news or paper . now we know it caus lot of disast to human . we also got to know sinc industri revolus the amount of co2 ha been increas beaus of our life . you can get to know how to stop the global warm from know what 's be the caus of it and now we can stop it if we tri . it lead one conculut . without main or basic idea or concept you ca n't understnad the fact or detail of the fact . therefor it 's far more relev for the sutdent to understand the basic than it is for them to know the fact . onli know the fact does't do anyth and solv the problem . you can understnad the real fact deeplli onli when you get to know the foundament idea .
