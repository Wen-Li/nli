i agre with the statement , but still think that it vari in it import from differ subject . of cours it is alway better to have a holist perspect on a subject that a student is studi . in subject like social scienc , human , histori or law it is import to have a certain degre of an overview of that subject . so it is import to understand idea , certain time period or theoret concept in order to be abl to think in the context and languag of that subeject . in more technic subject and mayb natur scienc their is huge import on know certain fact and figur . an engin for exampl ha to be abl to reproduc certain formula or data whenev he is ask or a biologist should know certain fact about for exampl anim popul . but still , all fact fit into idea , theori and concept that import peopl have develop in the evolut of the differ academ subject . i think the problem with fact is that they may turn into a kind of weight for studi . they can also lead away from the research aim if concentr to strong on them. a lot of research start with an idea and do experi as long as they have a proof for it . thi can be a support proof or one that elimin the idea . theoret think and theoret concept can be brought to student via professor in lectur . that is the import function that univers have to fulfil . but the learn of fact should be the responsibilitiy of the student , whether he or she is interest or not . even if you compar univers to univers of appli scienc it is still import to set a focu on give student the opportun to understand idea and concept if they shall be abl to work with them in a scientif , but also in a product way someday . altogeth i think that fact can alway be chang , but idea and theori have a much longer lifetim . even if nowaday an idea ha turn out to be wrong , student should still be inform about it in order to understand whi it wa wrong . such a mode of educ is not possibl by simpli learn fact .
