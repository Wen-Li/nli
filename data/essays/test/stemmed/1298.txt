i total agre with that statement . there are lot of product present as the best ever and that there will be never again a better one . as an exampel can be mention the automobil industri . often they present their car in advertis as one of the fastest but on the other hand as one of the most friendli one to natur . but how can an fast car with lot of horsepow be friendli to natur . the pollut of an car with lot of horsepow is still veri high even it is alreadi lower compar to older car which were produc year ago . also mention ist the cell phone industri . how often is explain in their commerci whi everybodi should use one specif cell phone . a produc of cell phone for exampl creat an new cell phone and promot it as the best one for manag or peopl with lead posit in compani , becaus it ha special featur which will make their work and daili life much more easier . but after a while first test are publish and these one show all the mistak which were made dure the product process . the onli choic a consum who had bought one of those cell phone ha is to buy a new one or updat hi one with new softwar . but he never can be sure that all mistak will be delet through such an softwar updat . the produc will then offer the same cell phone model with new featur and without the mistak of the older model a few month later . an other point is that in advertis often the product are so easi be put togeth . in these commerci the consum is told that by put the product togeth you have onli to pull there and to do thi and so on . for exampl a babi bed which a friend of me bought . she tri to stand it up to place her littl babi in it . accord to the direct and the commerci a woman could put it togeth an her own , at the end we were five peopl tri to put it togther .
