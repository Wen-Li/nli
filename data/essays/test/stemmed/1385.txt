i will be discuss the statement under the busi 's umberlla . i , person , agre with the state statement which say that success peopl tri new experi and take risk . i think that not all success peopl are risk taker , but take riski thing might be a veri good idea to start busi . no one know for sure that hi or her busi will be a success one , but a person , of cours , will know after be involv in busi world . most of businesspoepl had encount difficulti at the begin of their busi . they would not be success if they had not take the advantag of take risk . for exampl , as a person one , my father start hi work in the field of real state eventhough hi expertis wa in softwar program . so , he took the risk and made hi person dream to be a busi person . he ha been work in real state for thirti year and he own some hous and land . tri new thing is also a veri benefici in busi world . for exampl , the youtub founder were not sure that their web page would be that success . at first , they thought that the web page would not grap peopl 's attent becaus it wa a new idea in that time . after it use growth among peopl , googl corp. paid more than $ 1 billion dollar to the founder . thi prove that tri new thing might be a key to be a success person . therefor , tri new thing and take risk in busniess world are sometim a veri win equat .
