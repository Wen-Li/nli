special in one academ subject ensur that you have excel in a specif area in life . - someth that distinguish you and make you stand out in one area . in today 's world , everyth ha becom so interconnect and everyth is intertwin - we are inevit expos to new idea and we therefor do have an extens understand of the world to some extent i disagre with thi statement as i believ that it is better to special in one specif subject . my reason for thi argument , is that in today 's world , we are inevit expos to broader subject . for exampl , with the televis and the internet , and we are therefor no longer restrict to consum inform on a specif subject and we come out with a more extens understand of the world , that may not necessarili be present in an academ institut . secondli , i believ that as a person excel in a specif academ subject , he or she is ha excel in a specif area in life . for exampl , whether it is scienc and learn about the characterist of what make up the world we live in , or whether it is histori and learn about our past , what distiguish us as a human be , and how our world ha evolv throughout time , they are two subject that are complimentari in some manner . when special in a specif subject , a person is abl to distinguish him or herself in comparison to anoth individu by have excel in a specif subject . by excel in a subject such as scienc , thi individu ha an extens understand of how our world work and what character it . they understand the distinct characterist and fact , and therefor becom proffession that are educ about a specif subject . same goe to an individu studi a subject like histori . he or she is abl to becom a proffession in a subject where it is absolut essenti to know the detail and the characterist of . furthermor , by have a broad knowledg of subject , a person lose hi or her individu and to some extent , are no longer distinguish . more importantli , in today 's world , we are expos to the broader knowleg of the world . we are live in a global world , and therefor , we are expos to such thing such as the internet and televis , and travel , that we are inevit educ about subject in a broader sens . we are no longer constrain to a certain subject and we are therefor inevit expos to new inform . special in a specif subject is veri import as it is a way of distinguish an individu in comparison to anoth . furthermor , as we are live in an extens global world today , there is no need for special .
