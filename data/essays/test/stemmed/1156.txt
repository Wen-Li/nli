i most certainli feel that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is far more benefici than to specialis in one specif subject . accord to me gain knowledg is an ongo process . to restrict oneself to a particular sphere would encourag ignor . for exampl , be a law student if i restrict myself to the studi of crimin behaviour and it impact on societi i would total be ignor the vast field of civil law which contribut greatli toward the well be of the societi . let me elabor further , while i wa in my first year of law , we had sociolog as a compulsori subject . all of us fail to understand how sociolog could be connect to law and we were anxiou to get over with the cours and move on to someth more interest . it wa in my second year of law that i realis the signific of what i had studi . sociolog provid the basi and the reason for whi the variou law were initi frame . it explain how the need of the societi gave rise to the collect will of the legislatur to frame certain law . without understand the basic sociolog concept i would never have been abl to understand the logic behind law . as a law student i have come to embrac research . i have time and again come across legal problem of vari natur . i have alway built upon my basic knowledg of law and substanti it with concentr research over the area relat to the particular problem . but without the basic of everi subject it would definit be imposs to give the client a complet and well inform advis . in thi era of globalis and knowledg share it would be highli disadvantag to close door to ani academ sphere . i feel that it is a must to have broad knowledg of mani subject to be success in ani career .
