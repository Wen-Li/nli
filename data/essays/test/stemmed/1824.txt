mayb most of peopl on thi planet will agre with thi statem . becaus nowaday thare are too mani environment probrem in the world . mani differ countri have mani differ problem . but each countri ha each problem . so i do not think that if in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , it is so import thing . if in a countri , there are not so mani car in use , in thi case mayb thi countri is worri about other kind of problem . for exampl , water polut . becaus of the water polut , in thi countri , mayb peopl can not get safeti food as much as they want . but peopl have to live . therefor they might eat food which are not sure these are safe or not . and also adult give children such food . for children , such food are veri danger . if they are onl littl boy or girl , they may die becaus of the emviron . in thi case i do not think the number of car is import thing . besid , late , peopl care about the number of car . therefor we peopl alreadi did make some kind of solut for thi problem . and thi solut is not so difficult to solv . now , what we have to care about is relationship between countri . our planet is get smaller , the tie of countri have to be care more than the use of car . we have so mani smart peopl who could solv polut problem or car use . therefor basic i agre with the statement . it is alreadi start and not a big deal . i think if it will be inconveni situat , some idea will be com up . i believ in that we have more thing to care and we should . otherwis in twenti year , we will get a huge seriou problem .
