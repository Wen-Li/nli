i agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus new gener are becom more unrespons . i can support my opinion with the follow reason > first of all nowaday young peopl spend too much time to attend the school and they studi a lot of subject . one exampl to support the first reason is that young peopl such as student have to studi much more subject than befor therefor they ca n't spend enough time to help other peopl . anoth exampl is that there are some young peopl that have no time becaus they whether studi and work . the second reason to support my opinion impli the young peopl that think onli about theirself . for exampl most young peopl think that buy a lot of thing is the best way to feel good . i do n't think so . i think that these are superfici peolp . other peopl think onli about enjoy theirself and anyth els . they prefer spend all their spare time drive expens car or get in the disco . i believ that young peolp nowaday dont give enough time to help their commun becaus they do n't care about the problem of other peopl . i think that if everyon give littl of own time , it is possibl improv the relationship among peopl .
