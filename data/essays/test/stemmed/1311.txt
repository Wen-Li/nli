i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car on the street than today . although i disagre , i would like to briefli examin whi such a statement could have been express . after that i would like to show whi i disagre . first , a possibl explan for thi statement could be that in twenti year there is a shortag of oil or the price are that high that bare anyon could afford the ga . anoth possibl is that the gover make a law which set a limit on a certain amount of car in a countri , due to environment problem . the third thing i can think of is that the peopl themselv restrict their usag of car . but , as i mention abov , i do n't think that will happen and therefor i can not agre on the statement . so thi bring me to my argument that there will be more car in use in the futur . i am expect that the automobil manufactur will invent new technolog which are pollut the environ less than the car today . so there wo n't be ani critic who state that use a car would destroy the world . anoth major factor is the increas popul . let 's assum that onli everi second or third citizen of china use a car on hi own . thi would lead to an enoum increas in the demand for car . the third point i would like to mention is that more and more peopl own more than one car . i can tell from my experi that in my neigborhood there are a lot of famili who have more than one car . even some singl person have two car . one for the summer and one for the winter . i also have to admit that use a car is much more conveni than use the public transport system and as more and more peopl have two job they have to use a car to be mobil and to arriv at the compani in time . all these argument make me think that the amount of car will rise in the next year .
