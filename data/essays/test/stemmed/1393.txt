first of all , i agre with the statement given here that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . my first reason is , as we go to a new place , we may not be know how the place will be , how will be the behaviour of the peopl , what their cultur is , what their custom are , what their tradit is etc . if we go to some latin american countri , we may find some difficulti undevelop their languag and also we can not understand their accent even though they speak english . for exampl suppos you plan to go franc . the languag the peopl , speak there is french . you may not understand french , here you need a guid . my second reason is , if the place you plan to tour a histor place without a guid , you final end up with the rocki structur you saw there . as each histor place ha a histori behind in the main purpos is to know it histori . as we are not familiar with the place and it histori , a guid it is right person to explain it . fot exampl , take an instanc of visit mahabalipuram , a famou histor site in india , it 's all fill with templ made of rock , carv on stone etc . we need a guid to explain what those rocki structur are . lastli i desid to say from all the previou thing i discu `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . from these you know everi thing mean histori and what are the resours are thereand the great of that place . moreov you enjoy the compani of the tour guid , travel with compani is good .
