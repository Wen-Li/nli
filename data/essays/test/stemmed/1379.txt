i think that both understand idea or concept and learn fact is import for student , but i think that learn fact is a better way to understand everyth . in fact if you understand properli a fact , you wo n't forget it ! on the contrari if you learn a concept it is possibl to forget it becaus concept and idea are too astract . when student have to learn someth they usual read some concep into some book , but they do n't underst properli what they have read until the professor doe n't explain them refer to some fact . the more professor refer to a fact , the more student learn quikcli ! and professor are usual awar of it and so they explain the lesson refer to a practic fact and not onli read to the text . for exampl if a professor explain how to use a particular program of comput read the explan on the text , the student do n't understand how to use it ; but if he support hi explan with a comput and he show to the student the program , they probabl understand it better . but there are a lot of professor that prefer read the text without ani explan and so student do n't understand properli the lesson . start from the fact to the concept is the best way i know to understand someth . i am realli sure about my posit and i wonder how student can think the contrari ; i think the statement is not correct ! probabl student prefer start from the concept becaus they can use their brain and they can improv their conceptu skill .
