now-a-day advertis have becom , intent or not , a main part of public life . even if one is awar of it , advertis follow us all the time and to ani locat . they want to give us an impress that the product that is advertis absolut need in one 's life and that one particular compani ha the right and best product for one . undestand thi mechan , i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . one key point is that advertis report onli about posit side of product . of cours , thi is suppos to be the usag of an adevertis in the common opinion . howev , have seen mani advertis of product in the same categori , in which one compani claim advantag of it product while anoth compani degrad it point out some disadvantag , one get the feel that those product can not be such good as one or anoth compani claim . anoth aspect is the lack obeject in advertis . mostli , they have not undergon an independ test . so , what consum get told is quit subject . in conclus , i am convinc that the real perform of product is issu of advertis but prais advantag of them . i think , defin some test bench for product which are publish also in advertis and avod exagger would help peopl get trust in advertis .
