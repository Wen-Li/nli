accord to me , in twenti year from thi date , there will probabl be fewer car than there are today . there are mani reason to whi i agre with te statement . the most import reason be , increas in fuel price . current , most car run on gasolin , which is a petroleum base product . fuel price have been increas continuosli from the past few year and it might get so costli one day , that use a car could becom veri burdensom on a common man 's pocket . in my countri , the price of petrol ha doubl over the past 7 year . go by thi rate , petrol will soon be an unafford commod . anoth problem with petroleum product is that , they are in limit suppli in thi world . oil is consid to be a non-renew sourc of energi . it can not be replac natur in the short term . oil produc countri may reduc their product in order to sustain their economi over longer period of time . thu , the price will rise higher . the process is irrevers and the price will continu increas . apart from thi , peopl will be more educ and conciou about the environ around them . that 's whi they will avoid car as they are a major sourc of pollut . they will also be more health consciou , and may take a walk or a bicycl ride to nearer place and burn some calori instead of move around in the comfort of their vehicl . becaus of the abov reason , peopl will be more inclin to use public transport system , as they are more effici fuel-wis . buse and train will be more common and there will be fewer car . unless an altern fuel is made to run car effici and cost effect , the the number of car on road are bound to decreas . it 's the job of engin and technologist to find new and cheap sourc of energi . some car have alreadi been design which run on electr . but thi is n't becom popular becaus of it 's slow speed and accelar . research is alreadi underway to produc car work on solar energi , water , biomass and anyth which can act as a substitut to petroleum but their success is doubt in the near futur . so unless an alten fuel is made . the number of car is set to dwindl in the year to come .
