from primari school to highschool pupil have to work on mani differ subject such as mathemat , biolog , litteratur . but when those pupil becom student , they gener have to special in one or sever subject . thu , it seem to me that know lot of thing about lot of subject is necessari to obtain a good general knowledg and to chose what to studi at univers . first , when somebodi goe to colleg , he ha to think about what hi profession futur will look like and about what it would be better for him to studi . on the one hand , i tend to think that to concentr on one subject is not enough to acquir a good compet in the work market but on the other hand it seem hard to have an extrem good knowledg of mani subject . for instanc , if one want to be a manag and if he just studi manag he will not know whi he ha thi fuction and whi he need to do thi . he will not have a good knowledg of hi job . furthermor , though one is a veri good manag and doe not have a good knowledg of foreign languag it will be veri hard for him to adapt in busi . moreov , nowaday more thant few decad ago the master of few subject is requir to obtain a good chanc to have a job . some peopl thing that if they know thing about lot of subjet they will be prefer to peopl who have been special in their whole scholar educ . it is not alway true . the student 's personn is veri import but , of cours if a student is veri good in few subject and that he ha an interest personn it will help him to find a job that 's whi to special in two or three subject is essenti for me .
