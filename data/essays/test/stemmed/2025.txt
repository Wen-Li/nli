in substanti number of peopl mention that success peopl tri new thing and take risk instead of onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . but i strong disagre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . becaus someon who is accustom to their job can upgrag and anyon who is tri new thing ha lot of possibilit to fail . first of all , it is veri import to improv the thing are alreadi knew . becaus if you keep do your job , you could be a best in your field . it is often say that in my conuntri there is a famou quot , that is `` onc you dig onli on spot . do it until you find water fountain '' . which indic that the import of advanc . for exampl , one my dad 's close friend call yoon , he start the studi about comput when it just introduc , he make an effort on comput , now he is an well-known person in hi field . moreov , if you tri to do newth , there are numer percentag of fail . becaus , sometim tri new thing mean you began the thing without specif inform . for instanc , i have a friend who quit hi job and start bar be que restaur , hi origin job wa teacher , but he quit teach in the school , and began to a restaur with hi own money . when he start the restaur , he even doe not know about what is go on the restaur . final hi restaur close and my friend got much money to pay . in conclus , it is not true that success peopl tri newth instead of do what they knew . as i said abov , if you keep do about what you use to do you can improv the thing you use to do also when you tri newt you might loos not onli your money but also social relationship .
