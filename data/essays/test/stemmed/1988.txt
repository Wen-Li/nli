i disagre with the follow statement and do firmli believ that the trend of increas number of car , which ha been in place for more than three decad now , would be revers in a short durat of twenti year . the growth in number of car in the develop nation of the world and in the past decad , in the develop nation of the world like china and india ha been meteor . car manufactur like hyundai and honda are among the biggest corpor in the world now . the primari reason for thi is the rapid increas in popul in the citi . as more and more peopl will continu to move away form the rural area , the public transport system in the citi will not be abl to cater to the need of all and peopl will resort to car as their prefer mode of travel . altern mode and mean of travel have been slow in develop and do not offer an econom solut as provid by car . we still depend on fossil fuel for energi and the develop of new energi techniqu like fuel cell are also direct toward applic in car onli . the advanc in public transport system like railway ha not been abl to keep pace with the increas demand . car are also aggres advertis as statu symbol in a societi which is increasingli get materialist . as the purchas power of peopl increas and the price of car decreas by new technolog advanc in their manufactur , it will becom access to more peopl and henc ever increas sale figur are insur . car are still among the top of desir chart among the common populac . they are no longer just transport system but offer popular and increas social stand to the owner . the argument that the number of car will come to a satur point is not vaild as effici mean of dispos of car and recycl of their part is be brought about car manufactur . these polici would ensur that the need of a new car would not be offset by the problem of dispos of an old car by an owner . bank and other econom institut are also readili provid loan for purchas of car and low interest rate and easi pay-back option . new market are be creat and captur by car compani . we are inform daili of newer deal and strategi by these conglomer for market captur in localis sociti , primari among which are asian and african nation . car are be made accord to local need and desir which enhanc their attract even more . these argument can not be repuls in a durat of twenti year alon . it would requir a more sustain and rigor effort than the measur which are be current underway to check the number of car on our street .
