i partli agre with the statement , that young peopl do not spend enough time to help their commun . from my person experi i know , that there are lot of young peopl engag in work in their commun . i grew up in a cathol commun where i spent a few year on voluntarili look after children in weekli group meet or even multiweek holiday . i think there would be even more peopl get involv into commun life , but there are just too mani other activit you could take part in . mani parent tri to push their children too hard to achiev reward or to get train in certain area ; thi might rang from sport club to music lesson . therefor they might have littl time or littl interest of spend even more time on extracurricular activ . apart from that , there is an increas number of children who spend most of their time with play video game , surf the internet or watch tv . addit , there are those peopl you who do not see the point of get involv in commun life : firstli , your are not reward with money or mark to do so . secondli , work with peopl from all walk of life can be difficult and sometim even hard work . at last , there are peopl who work after school or work to maintain a better incom or an incom at all . so choos to work voluntarili in your commun might not give you a direct benefit . therefor i agre with the statement abov , but it need to be mention , that it got a lot harder nowaday to choos from the varieti of activit on offer . i think it is benef to your person and even your cv , becaus spend time in your commun might reward yuou with so call `` soft skill | , you might need in later life .
