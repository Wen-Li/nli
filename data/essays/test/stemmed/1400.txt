althogh both lear by experi and studi pricip of the subject are signific part of learn fact , i agre with that understand idea is more import for academ situat . fistli , studi idea and concept are effecticv for lear , beacaus it support to distinguish the fact . for examlp , if i search endang alpin plant dure hike a mountain , i could not find which is the specif famili of the plant . moreov , by previou investig for the plant is anabl to me where i should go . therefor , understand the concept should be center . secondli , comprefens of ida and concept are crucial for develop our knowleg . for instanc , when i research endangerd alpin plant without seek inform of the fact which alreadi discov , i would wast of my time and fures reach to consid the caus of extinct . becaus the fact is so largthu , understand idea is advantag for learn , sinc thi advanc studi allow us not onli recogn the fact but aslo make progress of learn fact . consequ , i definit think that if it were not understand funderment of each area , the studi would be insuffici .
