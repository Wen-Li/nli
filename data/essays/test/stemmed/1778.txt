is more advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ? as compani spend astronom amount in advertis , i would say definit ye ! the main goal for a compani to advertis a product is for sure to sell more of it , but first , it ha to convinc the custom of buy it . they have to make them believ that they need the product , and onc that goal is reach , they have to convinc them that the product is better than the other compar . as i mention befor , the idea is to increas sell , but a compani want to make profit , and thi is done also by reduc cost . unless we are in a monopolist environ , the competit can be veri strong , as well as the incent to make profit . due to a reduct in cost , the level of qualiti may seem alot better in the advertis than it may be in realiti . the best exampl for me would be a cosmet advertis for a face or bodi cream . the appar of the young model seem so perfect , but in realiti , doe that cream make them look so young ? the model do not repres the specif group of user of the product . they are much younger and the photo are also correct . the intent is to convinc the user that the cream is effici as it look like in the advertis , but in realiti , it is not . an other exampl is advertis for a natur supplement . as it look like , those product help you live longer , healthier , and it doe n't make sens . in my opinion , what make you live that way is a healthi way of live , as eat healthi food , practic sport , enjoy life in gener . as i mention befor , the main goal of compani is to sell more of a product , and unfortun , thi is reach sometim by lie to the custom .
