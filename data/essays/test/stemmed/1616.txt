there are advantag in both understand idea and concept and learn fact . if you learn fact , your knowledg about a certain fact will increas . it is veri import element in the life ; howev you need to know whi fact are creat . in short , it is a process to reach a fact and i think it is more import than just know fact . therefor i agre the statement . of cours , learn fact is a veri signific factor in your life . if you know more fact , you can learn more about the world ; howev the process is more import becaus if you do not know the process or concept , you can not say that you fulli understand fact . if you understand well about the fact , you can explain and appli them to the real life . student are younger and they are go to particip in the societi in the futur , so learn is the time for them to prepar for the futur . they need to learn skill to appli their knowledg in the societi and then they should know the idea and concept behind the fact . person , it wa veri difficult for me to understand the fact without explain idea and concept . if i do not know concept of the fact , i can not explain exactli what it is includ it background . also the worst thing is that you can not connect a thing from other thing . for exampl , you have learn the histori of american independ . if a teacher explain the flow of the histori , you can explain as he did ; howev if you onli know the word `` american independ '' , you can not explain exact histori . it is not effici for your life , and you can not broaden your knowledg more . therefor you need to find the connect between the idea and concept and the fact . in thi sens , i think student should understand idea and condcept rather than fact . therefor i think understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . if you understand well about idea and concept , you can broaden your knowledg more by yourself and appli them to the real life . it is one of the most import thing to be abl to combin idea and concept with the real problem in the societi , so it is not enough to know onli about fact but you need to know the idea and concept .
