when you are student , you are like to be in dilemna which consist on choos between have broad knowledg ( like what is done in the french busi school for instanc ) , or special in one specif subject ( which is the case for medecin studi ) . for my part , i prefer to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , even if thi solut includ the follow shortcom : you are not an expert at the end . nethertheless , attend to differ cours ( financ and market for instanc ) enabl you to be more open mind , to understand all the complex of one firm for instanc ( for the case of a busi school ) and simpli , to have a more open vision on the societi , becaus you are abl to understand more subject , and more phenomenon . by a person point of view , it is a way to discov differ way of think , to work with differ peopl , who sterm from variou academ background : you are not close in an onli way of think . and in the same kind of argument , meet a lot of peopl , have a lot and variou talk with them , you are more like to do your own opinion about one matter for instanc . for my part , when i wa in preparatori class , i share my bedroom with a student who wa in colleg of scienc , and both we appreci to discuss to variou subject ; what i wa not use to do with my classmat ( becaus , unconsci , we had the same idea ) . then , studi mani academ subject is a good solut to break the day-to-day run , and that is import for me . i can not imagin to do alway the same thing , without upheald . to sum up , i am convinc that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is a good method .
