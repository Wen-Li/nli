which way do you prefer to travel ? person , i have expereinc both way of travel . howev , i would choos to travel in a group with a tour guid . there are abund benefit i get from travel thi way . if i travel in a group led by a guid , i can visit most of the crucial and promin monument and citi . due to the fact that the guid is veri familiar with the famou place , we can go to fabul place without ani help or difficulti . furthermor , when we travel individu or in group without a guid there are mani disadvantag . primarili , even though we visit well known place , we wo n't be abl to know the histor fact unless we search for them in the internet . in my opinion , we should know histor name and peopl that is relat with the monument we look at . final , by travel in a group i can get to know the peopl i am travel with . as we talk and experi convent and ritual tradit dure the trip , we can know about other peopl . perhap , after the trip we can still be friend and call each other and talk about interestin stuff . for exampl , i wa in japan few month ago without ani guid . my famili could n't speak ani japanes and were unfamiliar with japanes cultur . there were a lot of difficulti in travel . we were n't sure where to go and the transport wa so complic that we lost ourselv in the subway station . even though we went to sever templ and monument , we did n't know ani histor fact about it . look without know what it is wa veri unfamiliar to me and our famili . to sum up the reason whi i would prefer to travel in a group with a tour guid : foremost , i would n't have a lot of difficulti in travel . also , we can be more recept with inform about promin place . last , i can get to know peopl in the group i am travel with .
