i absouletli agre with thi statement , as it discuss over and over , but fortin no bodi listen to . most or all the advertis seem better or much better than they realli are , for exampl , for food they make the sandiwish bigger or look taster . for toy , they make they make the toy as it is the best toy ever and it 'll make your child happi for the rest of hi life . and for furntur , they will draw an imag and make you believ that if you did not buy thi furnutr your home will be veri sad and can not be live in . adivertis main aim is profit , which mean money , they do all of these advertis on the televs , radio , newspap , magazin , bu stop and even on the street , taxi 's car roof and on the bu just to let you buy there product . they let you like the product as you live happi with it , as they brian wash you , alought may i add the way they attract children , with toy and children food for exampl biscut , chipt exl . mani of you look throught the newspap and saw a tasti sandwish and decid you go to buy it . and mani of you sepriz buy it size or it look . ! i ask the govern to stop that brian wash or atleast control it by make or give the real pictur or the real imag of the product caus at it seem that not bodi like to be lie to or acual no bodi like to be roub . may i add that lie in the advertis is forbedden in everi reliogin and it not a good thing to do to atract custom or clint . in the end i would like to ask the advertis one question , is everi product you put advertis is on your home , or your firg ,, whi not ?
