i am strongli with the argument that assumpt most advertis make product seem much better than they reallli are . thi is a strategi which i can not accept moral . advertis are the tool for a product to be known better by public . it ha to point out the advantag of the product compar to the other in market . so the consum would make a proper decis on what he need while compar the item . also , to creat a repetit and a popular name is not bad at all . nevertheless , advertis go a littl too far nowaday . develop into a big sector , the disadvantag of mass advertis can be uncontrol . the competit push the compani to glamour their brand . to replac them with some basic need . to hold their posit in the market , they spend a dramat amount of money for advertis . the sector is one of the fastest grow in all the world . in the futur , i assum that more adveris compani will be activ than their costum compani . these compani take advantag of all kind of art , idea and philosophi which is a misus to my opinion . they have barter all these for money and market power . thi have result with not onli a cultur degener , but also idol a brand to despis the consum . and thi is just becaus of the start idea of make a product seem much more better than it realli is . and thi too is a dishonest and non - ethic action . in conclus , i think the advertis should be control by author . one of the most import prioriti of the govern should be protect it peopl . then they have to take the respons in advanc .
