i disagre with the opinion that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun : in fact i think they do it , but their work and their contibut are not evalu and appreci as much as it would be . i will support my opinion with sever exampl of situat i experienc in my life . young peol is more interest in cultur event of hi contemporari period and more expert in term of knowledg of music , theatr or visual artist than older peopl of their commun ; so young peopl often organ show , concert or read in order to share their experi with the rest of the communiti . thi special help to their commun is often undervalu to the other citizen . for istanc , when i wa 16 , a group of friend and i organ an art exhibit of contemporari art in the citi hall of my villag collect and show sever piec from local artist . the major of the exhibit piec wa rather orribl and all the citizen did n't appreci our work . look from anoth perspect , we gave the chanc to young artist to exhibit somewher and some of them now is a famou intern artist and he rememb yet he exhibit in a small villag where everybodi despit the youngpeopl hate him .
