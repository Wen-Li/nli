i agre , with that statement that most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are , becaus all the compani want to show that their compani is the best , so they tri to show that everyth is extremli good than anyth els you can imagin . they think with that they will get more money from it , but eh problem is that the peopl will buy it and they will tri it and if it 's not better than ani other product no bodi is go to buy it from them again . for exampl the tv advertis for the cream they alway say if you use the cream for like 3 week you will get the result of it in less than 5 day . you think they are right so you go and buy it and then you use it for like a whole month and noth is chang . then you go back to teh compani they you ask them `` what happen with thi '' they will give you an explanit that you are the one that use it wrong and they tell you anoth way to use it . then they ask you to buy anoth cream so you can use it right thi time and you do it again without think about . then a few month after that i new cream come out and they make it look like noth is better than it and you go and buy . all compani for advetis is look for money . they dont care if you use the cream or not as long as you understand the advertis and you are readi to buy it . that will give them more money and that all they need . thi whi we shouldnt believ advierstis veri fast and alway excpect less than what they actual write in there advertis . tri to avoid be tricket by those kind of compani .
