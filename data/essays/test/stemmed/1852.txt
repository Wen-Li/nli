the world we live in is constantli chang , and everyon in it is chang at the same time . the prduct that we are offer have to total satisfi our need and want . thi along with global ha creat a lot of competit in most of the market . therefor compani have to relay on advertis in order to acquir more custom . a lot of time they put more effort on advertis campaign than on the real product ; therefor , thi creat that the product we consum is not what we expect . most of the comsum expect a lot from certain product becaus of the way they advertis it , and at the moment they receiv the product they will be veri dissapoint . big compani such as mcdonald do thi . they focus more on the imag of be a happi place for all the children , and have hambuerg that hey appear to be realli tasti , but they actual sell food that is unhealthi and doe not tast good . a good exampl of thi will be the bigmac , thi hamburg is veri advertis as be huge and tasti , but when you buy it , you will see that is not that big and it doe not tast that good . other compani such as nike , where they advertis their shoe as the best run shoe on the market , and there are actual other brand that produc more last shoe than they do . the problem when compani focus more on advertis their product than actual offer a high qualiti product , is that when their custom consum their product and realiz that it is no good , they will not consum it again . therefor ; thi lack of offer a good product will caus them the loss of their client . in a near futur they will be forc to run out of busi becaus they will not have anyon to sell their product to . adverstis can be a great tool in order to acquir a lot of custom , but the person use it should be careful when do so . the key is not to sell a lot , but to sell constantli . when adverstis a product they should offer exactli what they are advertis , becasu if they do not do that , their custom will be highli dissapoint and they will lose them in a short period of time .
