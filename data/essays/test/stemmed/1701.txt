person i believ that it is essenti to understand concept and undermin them with experi and hard fact . but how can we train our student , who have not the work experi to be creativ enough and still compar with evid ? at my mba cours we do combin the two of them and that is what i would think of an ideal educ . some student are more theoret orient than other . therefor it is easier for them to sit down and studi theori . other are more practic orient and learn while exchang concept and idea with other . a sound educ focus on both : theori and practic . all of us student work on manag level of compani and have not so much time to studi hard on concept . howev , we get our book ahead of the respect block ( 2-3 month ) to studi and complet a pretest which we have to hand in to the professor who teach the cours . if we have prepar well , we will pass the pretest and will be abl to particip at the respect block . our block last two week . dure thi time we repeat and improv what we have learnt befor in our class . on top of that programm we do work in the even on so call live case . thi mean that a compani come in and present us their question or problem which we - split in group of 7 to 8 peopl - tri to solv in the so call live case . have understood the theori , we tri to adapt it in practic and learn , that there are much more factor which need to be taken into consider than onli the theoret concept itself . idea are not alway enough to rate , analys and understand . it doe in fact need hard fact to compar previou experi to understand or reject our idea . summaris the educ explain abov i would realli draw the line that i person profit more from the practic experi . but i could not benefit if i had not learnt theori befor . onli the combin of the two is for me success .
