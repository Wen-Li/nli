for the develop of our countri 's economi , mani peopl are richer than befor , so travel is good way of consum . and it can take a lot of benefit , for exampl , it can releas the pressur , and for children , it can give a lot of knowledg . but i donot think follow a guid in a trip is good way in travel . there are some reason for thi . i think , for me , travel is not onli the mathod of consum , but also a communit with friend , when we start of work , there is limit time for me to meet friend , so in holiday , take a travel with close friend is a veri import way of keep in touch with them , i did not want someon els play with us . so i did not need travel in a group . secondli , travel in a group with a guid lead may be a good way for some children and old man , becaus they need to take care . but i think it is not nessessari for us , becaus we are not adoles ani more , we can take care with ourselv . and follow a guid , she or he can is talk about the place where the person visit . but we can go to the internet to download some inform about the farmou place . last and most import , follow a guid in the trip , had disadvantag for me , our plan is limit by the guid . she or he do a lot of thing for us , for instanc book he hotel , decid which place to play in , by plane or by train . these thing i want to do it on my own opinion . and a lot of famrou place like the summer palac in beij , the great wall , where we want to spend more time in , the time of the guid give is to limit for us . if we want some place els to look around , thi is not allow becaus that could bring some other peopl wait for us . for all of these three point , travel by our own is a suitabl method , we can travel in the hignway in our own car , meet the peopl in my own ,
