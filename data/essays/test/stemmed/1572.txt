nowaday , in mani job , peopl becom more and more special . for exampl in medecin , there are more and more specialist who can just help a few peopl otherwis there is a lack of generalit , who are veri import for litll and frequent deseas . therefor , in my opinion too special is bad both for societi and peopl themselv , for their life and job . gener cultur is veri import for everyon and for the societi . for exampl , if a person is veri special in one specif subject and know noth about other topic , how can he have a good relationship with orther ? therefor , in my point of view , pepol have to have broad knowledg of mani topic in order to be abl to speak with a lot of differ person about a lot of mani subject . moreov , it can bore for someon to be interest in just one subject . secondli , i think that a good worker doesn ' t have to be too special to be good in hi job . for exampl , nowaday , a lot of doctor are veri special . there are some doctor who are pneumologist , one special , and special in one deseas : tuberculosi . therefor , they have just patient with tuberculosi . if a patient goe to see one of them for a littl thing , as a pneumonia , he doe n't know what to do ! he is special in hi special and that is too much . i do n't thinkthqt , even if he is veri known for tuberculosi , he is a good pneumologist and at least a good doctor . so , i think that is import , to feel good with peopl and in your job , to have differ knowleg .
