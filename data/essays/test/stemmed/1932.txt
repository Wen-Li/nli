advertis is an often discuss matter in a time that is highli domin by all sort of media . in a sens of media as someth that transport a mean , advertis also is one of them - and it is almost omnipres . but it doe n't onli have a social aspect , it is also a larg factor in today 's busi . some advertis , like for exampl the one in the break of superbowl game , cost unbeliev amount of sum . thi money sure ha to be gener somewher els - product have to be sold . that most advertis make them look better than they realli are , just to reach thi goal , is a veri common opinion about thi topic . i am a student of journal and mass commun and therefor have heard sever lectur about thi specif phenomenon . i think that most advertis make their product look better than they are , becaus - and thi is simpl - they have to . it is necessari to make peopl believ that they need to buy a certain thing and in order to fulfil sale expect they must present it in a posit way . if onli see it in a market or a store would be enough for a person to decid to buy it , the advertis would not be necessari at all . research ha shown that thi is not the case , so compani tri hard to stimul peopl to buy their product . problem occur where it is tri to achiev thi effect by lie about the featur of the product . the statement seem also true to me , becaus of my own everyday experi . not onli tv station show a great amount af advert , it also becom more and more present in the radio , one the street , in the cinema and variou other public area . not onli onc have i tri one of the offer product - and been sever disappoint . an aspect of the topic that make it even more urgent to discuss , is that nowaday , mani advertis seem to be highli aggress . the `` stimul '' to buy a product i have mention befor , ha turn into manipul and sometim even into an order to do so . make a product look good and worth buy is tri so hard that , in mani case , the mere opposit is happen : peopl feel repuls by the aggress and are push toward a neg attitud toward the product . i think that thi a dramat danger develop and even though i criticis the fals posit present of product befor , i would highli recommend some advertisor to return to thi way of sell . even if i do not agre with thi sort of advertis , it would certainli be a first step of improv for them .
