i partli agre with thi statement . i think that there are a lot of problem with fuel as the main sourc of energi for car nowaday . thi will get much wors in the next coupl of year . that 's whi there have to be some solut to solv question of pollut and energi requir . car belong to our dayli routin like coffe and bread , so there ha to be someth instead . i believ that there could be differ sourc of energi for keep car go , like the sun or even wind or electr . if that happen , the prize for those new car would rais immidiatli to an incred hight . so in such a time there could be much fewer car then nowaday , becaus most the peopl would n't be abl to effort a new one like that . but i do n't think like thi for a long term object becaus technic develop alway becom cheeper after a while . so after a few year our car , as we know them now would just be replac by anoth type of them . anoth , i guess much better possibl , would be to reform the public transport system worldwid . of cours there would be a huge number of problem to face , but it would be much better for the enviro and also for the live condit in `` melt pot '' like new york or even berlin . if there are electr subway and cabl car avail at each time of the day , a car would n't even be necessari anymor . at least in big citi . also if it would be safer to go by bike through the street it could be possibl to have fewer car in a few year . but i do n't realli think peopl want that , becaus they are spoil of indipend with a car and do n't realli face the problem with it . but i guess if the prize for a reform public transport would be lower and it could be a relyabl altern , then it would work to get the citi free of car after a while . but that doe n't count for littl villag or hidden area somewher far away from a town . becaus without a transport possibl , peopl there would n't realli have a chanc to live on theyr own . so after all i think there wou n't be much fewer car then today . hope i am wrong and there will be at least differ one , but i do n't believ in it for certain .
