in my opinion , i doe n't agre that there will be fewer car in use twenti year later compar to today . the reason that i said thi is mainli becaus peopl are go to have higher live standard twenti year later compar to today 's . becaus of thi , they will have higher demand ask for vehicl as now they can afford to purchas luxuri and veri expens car . becaus of thi , car becam an neccess in their daili day , no matter they want to use it for travel , to show off or mayb they just want it as other have it . the follow reason that support my idea is we will have the more advanc technolog in twenti year time . thi will make the issu of the petrollum which will polut our enviro might not be an issu anymor , so everyon who want to purchas a car will need not worri about thi issu anymor . furthermor , there 're techolog that make a huge impact on our daili life such as we can just simpli switch on a button and pick up a locat from the map which we will like to go and the car will then move by itself and bring us to our destin . by thi , we can do mani other thing within the travel period instead of drive a car . we can even get chang or take our breakfast in the car while outsid wa have a terribl traffic jam . if thi realli happen , then wait insid a car might becom an entertai instead of someth that drive peopl crazi . therefor , the last reason that i think the number of car will be increas in twenti year compar to today 's is becaus the price of a car will be much more cheaper compar to today 's situat . the reason that make thi happen is mainli becaus , when there 're high suppli in the car industri and peopl are overal rich , there 'll definit a decreas the car price . to further explain thi , when peopl do n't take car as a symbol of their wealth as all ordinari peopl were capabl to purchas luxuri car , the demand for luxuri car will fall . develop of the technolog might also becom one of the reason that caus the car price fall . due to all the reason abov , i think that in twenti year time , there will be an increas in car use compar to what we have today 's .
