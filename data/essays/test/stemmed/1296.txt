there is no doubt that i support the idea that peapl will succeed when they tri new thing , rather than onli take advantag of their current knowledg . i point out two reason below . first of all , if peapl do not challeng new thing , they cannnot widen their knowledg . i would like to say that success peapl tri new thing by use their current knowledg and obtain new knowledg and experi . in my experi , i wa in charg of a new project , which nobodi in our compani did . honestli , i thought that the project is not my current busi directli . but undertak the new project , i obtain mani knowledg and connect between the project member , who i had not talk with . even after i finish the project , the knowledg and the coneect i have gotten from the experi is veri use for my current role . second of oll , peopl not tri to challeng new thing may tend to narrow their perspect , the way of think . in my offic , there is a professon person who is in charg of same task for about ten year . he can do undertak onli hi task perfectlli . but it is the problem . he in confid to hi skill of hi task and tend to be obstacl . and then he doe not want to chang hi way , or improv it . it mean that progress would stop in that area , that would lead to declin . so i definitelli mention that peopl should tri to do someth new to make a progress of their skill . and that lead to big success .
