the car play a signific role in the develop of what is call the `` american dream '' . have one 's own car symbol the freedom and liberti to choos what one want to choos and to go where one want to go - independ and easili . certainli , there are mani develop countri , that tri to adopt the american way of life . ca n't we therefor easili conclud that the number of car worldwid will significantli increas in the next - let 's say - twenti year ? in thi essay , i want to shed some light on thi question in order to provid better argument on whether we will have more car on the futur or whether we wo n't . my posit will be , that we will definit have more car by 2026 , but that there are also good reason to doubt a rapid , extrem growth . firstli , one of the most import issu of intern polit call car-product into question : car pollut our environ massiv . therefor , there is and there will also be in the futur a strong movement against the use of car and in favor of public transport . thi argument in certainli true , but nevertheless i believ that technolog progress will allow big corpor to creat car , that pollut the environ less and less . although some peopl will avoid car and although their number might increas , i do n't believ , that thi polici can significantli lower the number of car world-wid . furthermor , the econimoc growth of develop countri mention abov mate with a second factor : their rapid popul rise . in the come decad , there will be more and more peopl on our planet , who all want to particip in the western game of capit and democraci . and these will certainli also want to drive car . probabl , car will even necessarili be a part of their western-ori way of life . but thirdli , one could argu , that the grow popul and the restrict of space on our planet will lead to veri larg town and citi , citi for exampl as big or even bigger than today 's `` megac '' mexico citi . car , thi argument goe , would just hinder the traffic in such place and could be gradual replac by better public transport . thi is again an argument with a great plausibl . but still , i ca n't come to believ that the number of car will fall in total , becaus at least in the upcom centuri there will alway be place , where there is no such strict limit of space . today 's citi alreadi provid enough room for car with all their road and highway . and thi is veri unlik to be chang at all . final , there is someth in mani western peopl , that can nearli be call an obsess for car . they belong to the western way of life , they are good of luxuri and of statu or sometim even playth for grown-up boy . thi attitud toward car will certainli stay to be part of our cultur for quit a long time . strikingli , such an attitud is even enforc by the industri , their advertis and their product . these compani need to creat and maintain a market for their car and - as all corpor - they expand . how could we believ - or hope ? - that car will becom less popular due to these circumst ? to sum up , there is hardli ani strike evid for the idea , that we will have fever car after the next twenti year . rather , all the argument for such a posit and all the problem about car i point out , can be account for in a larger pictur of our planet 's and cultur 's develop . and in such a pictur , car will definit maintain their place dure the next decad and possibl even centuri .
