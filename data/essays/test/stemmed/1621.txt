success can be defin as the complet of a goal a person had set himself . in my opinion , it is in the natur of humankind to alway want more , to never be satisfi with what we alreadi have . it seem therefor logic that success peopl would still want to tri new thing and take risk . first of all , the want for more that lead to tri new thing is sometim driven by greed . a casino player who ha won the jackpot will undoubtedli want to tri hi luck one more time . he therefor take an import risk . moreov , a success person who want to tri new thing show hi creativ and hi will to advanc in life . a simpl exampl is the one of the 2006 nobel prize winner , muhammad yunu . mr yunu , befor creat the grameen bank wa a success colleg professor . howev , he decid to stop teach and dedic hi life and knowledg to help the poor . he took an import risk when he creat hi bank : be an econom teacher , he did not know much about bank . success peopl , for reason that can be both neg and posit , are gener will to tri new thing and take risk . on the other hand , some peopl work their entir life befor they are success . onc they have achiev their goal , it is understand that they would not want to jeopard their situat by take new risk . they therefor tri to consolid it . a man who ha work for year tri to make hi busi successful , onc he ha achiev hi goal , will not want to tri new thing by start up a new busi in a complet differ field . he will onli tri to expand the one he alreadi ha sinc he ha learn to manag it well . in conclus , success peopl can decid to either take new risk or rather keep do what they know how to do . in my opinion , it complet depend of the type of person : someon who is creativ , motiv , or even thirsti for wealth and power , will tri new thing . moreov , even in the case of a man who onli tri to consolid hi busi and not start anoth one , he is still take risk by expend . i therefor agre with the statement . rare are the peopl who are will to let their life stagnat .
