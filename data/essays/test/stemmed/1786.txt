`` the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide. '' i i person support the statement becaus whenev we go to a new tourist place we doe n't know anyon there , and may face problem about the accommod , nice restaur , and may spend extra money forth we buy over there as we are not familiar about the rate . so , if our group is led by a guid he can help overther . as guid are local peopl can explain the hi the histori of place we watch . we can enjoy the tour much more if we have a guid with us . we feel more securea he will be guid us . in a tourist place onli some place are famou exampl in my citynam hyderabad charminar , golconda fort , nizam palac , zoo park are famou . most of the visitor want to visit onli these place , but with these place the citi have other place to watch like gandipet , ramoji filmciti , birla mandir , salarjung musium etc. if the visitor do not hav the guid with them they can watch the place which they heard befor , they can not plan effici how to make a way to watch the places.a guid is veri help to enjoy more on what we spent . but choos the right guid is veri difficult task for the visitor , we have to first desid the charact of the guid . becaus he is the person we are go to trust , if we trust a wrong person then we have to suffer . but onli one thiong we miss if we have guid is that , we have to follow hi instruct and unabl to do anyth we want . i feel that if a guid is with us the reason whi we make the tour can be fulfil effici . and for safe and secur tour a guid must be there . and the guid should be enough good . so , i person agre with the statement given .
