from my point of view , . the reason for thi is becaus it is easier to learn and special in one subjet rather than mani differ one . if you alreadi know what area of work you would like to be work in the futur than it would be better to concentr on the particular subject that relat to it . have a braod knowleg is good but not necceserali useful . by concentr on the specif subjet that relat to the area of work you will be in the futur give you a great advantag of learn everyth there is to know about that specif subject and be the best at it . broad knowledg of differ academ subject is good and use for dure the erali stage of your life . when you are at school , you do n't have a choic of what subject you want to studi . you learn and studi differ academ subject up to high school or up to the time you are realli sure of what subject you want to special in and work in for the rest of your life . have knowledg of mani academ subject , although not perfect in all of them is essenti to special in one specif subject as everi academ subject is link in a way . for exampl , you might know everyth about geographi but if you do n't know anyth about math then you wo n't be abl to work in that area as it requir a certain knowleg of math . i would say that moder knowledg of may academ subject is need to acheiv a special in a particular subject .
