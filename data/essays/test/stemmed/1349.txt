advertis are a thing which i am veri skeptic about . i think that advertis are more focus on make money , on sell the product , than on actual show the public what the product realli is , or what it realli doe . rather than just present the product as what it actual is , and let it sell itself becaus of it true characterist , advertis enhanc certain thing in order to make the product seem more desir or irresist . exampl of thi can be seen in our daili live in thing we might not even notic . one exampl of how advertis make product seem much better than what they are is the present of food in the advertis of fast food chain or restaur . when we see a mcdonald 's ad , for exampl , we see an enorm , juici , perfect-look hamburg . thi make us want to go and buy one right away . later , when it is sit on our plate , we realiz that it is noth like what we saw on the poster or banner . it is smaller than what we imagin , and not nearli as perfect as the one we saw previous . thi tactic use by publicist make the product sell more , by give the buyer the illus of a much better thing . anoth exampl of thi is the way celebr are shown in magazin . when we see magazin cover we alway see peopl with the purest skin , the most flawless makeup , and most perfect hair we 've ever seen befor . thi make the magazin more desir to peopl pass by becasu the `` beauti '' peopl on the cover stand out more , which sell the magazin . peopl are led to believ that these peopl are perfect , when in fact they are normal human be , just like the other six billion on earth . anoth exampl of a product made to seem better than what it is is the mona lisa . thi paint by leonardo davinci is advertis , in a sens , by mani histori book and movi . it is portray by mani as the most amaz work of art that ha ever been paint . i wa lucki enough to be abl to visit thi paint in person , and it wa n't all that i imagin it to be . when we see the mona lisa in book and movi it appear to be a larg paint , when in fact it is quit small in relat to other . also , there is n't anyth special about it , in my opinion . advertis can have a veri influenc effect on peopl , which we can see throughout societi everi day . we can not believ everyth that we see .
