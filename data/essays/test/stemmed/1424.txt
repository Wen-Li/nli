i agre with thi statement . in my opinion it give you mani advantag to have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject . first have knowledg in variou differ area allow you to be more flexibl . the advantag of thi is shown for exampl at find a job . when you are special on just one specif subject , and in thi area there are n't too mani job avail , you have a huge disadvantag compar to those who have the broader knowledg , sinc they can just switch to some other area , and be as success . anoth import argument is that know stuff in variou subject improv your skill in problem solv . sinc you are taught in variou area , and know mani way to solv problem you can think outsid the box , increas your knowledg and evalu problem much easier than peopl who are base on one subject and decreas with their possibl and way on solv the same problem . becaus the peopl who have a broad knowledg can appli to higher think skill , with combin their knowledg , and thu have a higher chanc that in their knowledg there might be a similar problem they alreadi had solv . peopl who have a broad knowledg can be sure that they wo n't find the problem of not like there proffes anymor . what if the person who special almost all hi life on studi and special on one academ subject doe n't like hi subject anymor ? what if he find out that there is someth els , someth he would be more interest and better in than hi special area ? thi can be a destruct problem , that peopl who have a broad knowledg do n't have . in the end i want to conclud that in today 's world peopl with broad knowledg are more in favor of get a job in a lead posit compar to peopl who are special on one subject . sinc today 's world is veri flexibl it also need manag and lead peopl who are as flexibl . have a wide knowledg increas your chanc in the present time .
