children are recquir to learn a lot of fact at school . later , student still have to learn some fact but they must also understand idea and concept , and i believ thi is the most import for them . the first aim of studi is to make peopl readi for thier professin life . student can not learn how to face everi singl situat , so they will have to adapt . as a consequ , they will have to use idea and concept and think of a person solut to the problem they face . for exampl , i want to becom an engin : it would take more than an entir life to learn the characterist of all the product we are go to work on . instead , we learn method on sampl case and we will have to adapt these method and to find new one in our professionn life . thi is whi , when recruit , a firm doe not onli chek what studi you have made , but they will also chek your person dure an interview . studi also help peopl to build their social life . inde , interact with a teacher and with other student is veri import . on the one hand , peopl understand idea and concept by interact with other . on the other hand the best way to learn fact is to studi alon , with a book . student do learn how to commun . thi will be veri import for them , in their group of friend , in their famili but in their compani too . these three area of life interact one with anoth . for exampl , someon who doe not have ani social life outsid hi firm will lack some simpl knowledg about commun life . the other way round , if someom is jobless , it will be harder for him to explain hi children that they have to work to live . nowaday , be jobless is badli perceiv in the societi so peopl might find it hard to tell their friend too .
