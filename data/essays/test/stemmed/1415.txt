i disagre with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . for thi opinion i have sever reason . first , i think if one special in a specif subject , one will be abl to spend a lot more time on thi subject than one would if one studi a wide rang of differ subject . thi extra time can then be spent on studi the one subject one ha chosen even more detail and get deepli into it . if one is real good at it , one may even do some research on it and discov or invent new thing , which can be enourm help to societi . thi is to say , educ will be more effect and product thi way . secondli , if one doe not special one will never becom real good at someth but more like perform averag on most of the class . thi is just simpli due to the lack of time . be averag is not a cathastrophi . howev , one will never get the sens of achiev one would have when invent or discov new thing and would thu probabl at some point becom dissatisvi with oneself , alway work pretti hard , but never have a real breakthrough . one may even feel kind of stuck . final , there is proven evid for my first argument of increas product : our societi ha develop thi way . back in the time when primit human be were hunter and collector , the strong men had the task to hunt and the women had the task to take care of the children and collect berri and so on . later , job specif took place , becaus peopl notic that if one person ha to do all the job by him - or herself , he or she will have a veri low live standard , as there is no way in which one person could possibl be a cook , a hunter , a plumber , a farmer , a dentist , and so on at the same time . howev , one 's live standard can be improv bz job specif : if everybodi special in one special job , everybodi will be a lot better and thu a lot more product at hi or her job . if then peopl start to trade , everybodi can be suppli with a lot more and better good than he or she would have produc by himselelf . therefor , job specif is more effect than do everyth by oneself . thi idea can also be transfer to academ subject : if everi student know a littl bit about everyth , there will hardli be ani progress in research , becaus the student will be busi studi what ha alreadi been found out . but if student special , progress is more like to take place and help the other student as well . for exampl if a student in physic or mathemath found a way to store sun energi , then thi would be help to all the other student as well as an altern sourc of energi . so after all , i mainli have two differ reason for prefer specif over broad knowledg of a varieti of subject : first , the increas effect and secondli , the sens of achiev one get . moreov , the first argument can even be proven by the fact that societi is organ in the same way .
