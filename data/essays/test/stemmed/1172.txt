travel is a quit wonder way to relax for peopl live in morden sociati with a lot of press . howev , if one would travel , he or she must decid where and how to travel . for thi situat , mani travel compani have the programm that enabl peopl be a group and let a tour guid lead . then , travel can just have fun without the worri about where to live , what to eat or how to get . howev , i disagre with the statement of travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way . firstli , travel is quit a person thing . travel by ourselv , we can go anywher we want to . but mani tour guid have their own rout , and they alway take travel to those place which have been famou or crowd . it is hard to have enough time to breath the fresh air out of citi . secondli , with a tour guid , if you don not like the tast he or she order for you , you have no other choic , or you have to pay more to get some food agre with your stumacl . meanwhil , travel by yourselv , you can have more local tast and much cheaper than the meal order by the guid . what 's more , travel in a group led by a tour guid , the time tabl alway have been settl and you have to follow it exactlli . if one travel want to take some more pictur at the place he love and take a littl longer time , the other travel who doe not like the place may be unpleasur . so it is quit a big problem that make everyon in the group have one opinion . travel by oneself have no worri about these problem . wherev you like , stay here for sever day to enjoy and take as mani photograph as you like . all in all , i don not consid travel in a group led by a tour guid is a good way . i love the way that travel much freeli and cheaper .
