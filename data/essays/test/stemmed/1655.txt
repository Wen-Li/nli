nowday young peopl give enough of their time to help their commun . today world is total depend on the youngster if they stop help their commun , it would not be an easi task for govern to do whole lot of it . it 's the youngster onli which come out to help on a singl call for it . onc when in my coloni the condit start becom wors to live becaus of the smell of the garbag collect . due to strike of the local govern , no offici help wa avail . at that time it wa youngster who came out to help and clean all of it , make the place possibl for live . they did a team work which also show their co-op power . mani time young peapl are missunderstood becaus of the gener gap . elder peopl dont like their rash drive , their excess smoke or drink , but thi ha noth to do with social work which young peopl do , and should be appreti by the elder . i rememb the time when the kargil war wa go on between our countri india and neighbour countri pakistan . at that time it wa local area youngster onli who help the soldier in the war . they serv them food , medic aid , and mani more needful thing . take them on strecher or even in their arm in emerg wa someth which old peopl fail to do becaus of their physic weak . on the other hand , young peopl have alway given their best to help peopl build templ or mosqu . they are the one who collect fund for it . they also take the full respos of build it . suppli of water , cement , brick all is done by them onli . i would like to conclud by say that there wa a period when young peopl did n't use to give enough time to help their commun but nowaday it 's not so , they help their commun , particip in solv relev problem and give their hunder percent .
