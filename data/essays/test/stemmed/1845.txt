though i think that it 's good to have a knowledg of thing beforehand but in long run to succeed further one need to tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do thing one alredi know how to do well . the first reason for my agreement with the statement is that one can not alway take it for grant that he will alway get the standard situat and even if he know everyth about a situat he will be abl to do well . one alway face new situat or problem while work . so to overcom those problem and succeed one need to appli new solut and even take risk . most of the time , the peopl who hesit to tri new thing and take risk get stuck to the same level . there is alway an amount of risk and uncertain in new thing but i also think that everyth is evolv . so the peopl who are succes are the one who were the first to do that . these were the peopl who explor the thing first and creat the set of rule for other to follow . so when one is readi to face new challeng then hi whole approach of do thing chang and no bodi can stop him from the success . he get new idea to implement . hi whole energi is streamlin in get thing done and he then look in to everi singl thing and resourc for the solut . he start think in term of oppurtun and make best use of it . the peopl who do n't dare to do new thing alway keep think and get stuck to same routin and job . thi also sap there creatinv think and energi from in to do there normal thing .
