i agre that understand idea and concept is more import for student than understad fact . there are two reason to support my opinion . i would like to show in the follow statement . first , studi of idea and concept lead for student to the abil to adop to the variou situat and field . although fact are import , it tend to be in the limit area . student have a lot of possibl of work place , job and career . they have to strengthen the abil to adopt to anywher . second , current societi becom specil in the quit extent . the materi that student have to studi lie in the broad area . for exampl , all the student need to know the fact of nanotechnolgi ? on the other hand , the time for student to spend studi is limit . although there are a lot of graduat school for higher educt and it extend the time to studi . yet , they still have to util their time effect . therefor they should focu on the common materi includ idea and concpet and give them prioriti . in the conclud , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . althougn , fact are also import becaus they consist the basi of everi studi , research and so on , i do agre the import of understand iea and concept by the befor mention reason .
