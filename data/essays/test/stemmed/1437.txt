what is an advertisementd ? what is adverstis ? it help compani to sell there product . thank to thi , there are abl to compet with other firm , to battl against their rival and show which product is the best or at least to make you think so . `` most advertis make product seem much better thant they realli are '' . i will start my respons by say ye , i do agre with thi statement . most commerci want you to think that you will never find the same product anywher els , that thi is the one . in order to make you think so they but an enorm budget into advertis . to make it look like a movi for exampl where you could perfectli pictur yourself in . let take the exampl of a food product or a beverag , they make it look like it is a real extas as if you never felt such a sensat befor . the problem is , it might tempt you but i dought you will feel the same as they show you on an advertis . on the contrari i partial agre with thi statment . i think compani canot lie to the public , of cours they probabl exager a bit , sometim a lot , but they have to sell their product . that is the reason whi i would say that they do n't allway seem much better than they realli are but it 's just a question of tast . compani main purpus are to aim a certain public that is like to consum their product . peopl who like a certain product and it advertis will remenb it and in consequ buy it . therefor
