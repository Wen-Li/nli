i do agre with the given statement due to the follow reason . the word ` advertis ' ha becom self-explanatori . it basic stand for promot a product or a servic by emphas or in thi case over-emphas on it good characterist . the advertis are primarili to help to attract the comsum and to increas the sale of the product or servic . for thi the peopl usual happen to exagger a lot and tri to manipul the comsum ' thought process . the main motiv is to show the product in a good light and to make it woo the comsum into buy it . mani a time thi may work but it may also make the product look unattract at time . for exampl consid the current advertis for the beauti and fair cream . you are shown a girl who is veri dark and soon as she appli thi particular cream , she becom as fair as milk in a week . these are not accept to the consum as they claim to total chang the skin tone of a person . how is it possibl for a girl to becom fair in a week time if she happen to be wheatish for the last twenti year ? a sensibl person would alway know what the truth is . at time these advertis happen to exagger to such an extent that they feel unrealist . take the case of the advertis for slim product . one day you are thi fat , obes individu weigh around 200 pound , and as soon as you start use one of these product , you will be around 130 pound in a fortnight . consid that these product may be effect but how do you explain their claim of help a person slim down so soon . still mani desper peopl do buy such product and later realis that they made a faux pa . these advertis should instead be more real and show the product as they are meant to be . the feel good factor should alway be there but it should not be blown out of proport .
