thi is an argument standpoint whether most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . depend on person judgement , we may find that some peopl will agre that the advertis make thing look like better , in contrast , some will not agre thi point of view . the judgement , howev , is hard to make . nevertheless , in my opinion , i think the the former statement is more reason . among countless factor which can influenc the judgement , there are some conspicu as follow . first of all , the main reason whi i support the abov statement is that advertis make product more popular than the product which do not be show on tv or newspap . for exampl , dell is a one of the most famou brand of comput in the world . you could see dell 's advertis everyday . and there is an unfam brand in my countri , which you even do not hear about it at all . now , you want to buy a comput , which brand will you choos ? it must be dell . but in fact , the qualiti of thi unfam brand comput is better than dell . so the advertis make product seem much better . in addit , i agre with the statement also becaus the advertis will exagger the function and qualiti of the product . for instanc , a veri famou cell phone compani say that their new cell phone is veri strong , you can use it as a tool when you are in emerg . howev , nobodi will use their phone as a tool . but peopl would buy thi kind of cell phone just becaus of thi function . in fact , the cell phone is sound as other cell phone . of cours , sometim advertis are not use . for exampl , a new brand claim that it is the best in all other same product . thi will not persuad the custom at all . but i feel that the advertis influenc peopl deepli . consid and analysi all these fact , frankli speak , most advertis make product seem better .
