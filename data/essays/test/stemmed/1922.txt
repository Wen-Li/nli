in my opinion , the success peopl is the person who tri to challeng new thing and is will to take risk . i agre that know how to do well is importamnt to get a good evalu in a sopm situat , such as daili job routin . howev , i think the mean of success is to get someth it seem to be rather difficult for him or her by challeng it . there are two reason to support my opinion . first , in thi competit world , get a stabl salari doe not mean success , i think . we need hous . we want to go abroard . we want to manag our own compani . if we make effor , there is a possibl that the dream come true . for exampl , some of pur success busi exect in my countri had a hard time when they were young , but they studi veri hard invest their properti in their futur . second , success person is someon whom other peopl want to be . i do not want to be like officework who come to the offiec at nine a.m. and type mani document and talk telephon , and leav offic at five p.m . . i want to think how we can increas profit , and how we can win in the copetit with other compani . success peopl alway tri someth new , even after be a successful person . they seem to be full of energi and dream . final , if you tri new thing take risk , you sometim face the differ situat . such experi make you stronger . today 's success doe not mean that tomorrow 's success . therefor , to be a success , we should be enouogh strong to bear the difficulti . you can not surviv the difficult time by onli do what you alreadi know how to do it . you need challeng spirit and experi of overcom the difficulti . i think that the road to success is not easi . if you can investig your time and properti in your goal , then you have a chanc to get it . the success is the fruit of challeng . to get a sweet frut , we need to tri new thing and take risk .
