i disagre with the idea that travel in a group led by a guid is best . i think travel with tour guid doe n't make me grow and sometim feel bore . first of all , in the case of travel with tour guid , we do n't need to make a schedul or book the hotel . but these kind of effort make my abil of arrang grow . for exampl , my job is examin to the bank , and i have to go to the provinc everi each month . so i 'm requir to arrang the shedul , like book the ticket or hotel . at that time , i feel that my experi which i travel in mani provinc of japan for a month in my colleg 's day . at that time , i arrang the tour myself . secondli , travel with tour guid do n't make me effort ot learn about the direct . in the case of travel without guid , i have to learn about the direct to choos where i 'll go to see . the knowledg gotten through schedul the tour sometim help me . for exampl , when i analys of certain bank 's busi model , the knowleg about that bank 's busi erea is requir . i have help by the knowledg which i got through the tour schedul mani time . thirdli , travel with tour guid reduc the fun of the toravel becaus sometim i can not go where i want to see . especi in my case , i 'm interest in the japanes castl and want to concentr see the castl in my travel , but i have never found such special travel tour . also there are mani case the tour compani affili with the suvenior shop and take the tourist to these shop in the tour . for exampl , i have ever join in these kind of goup tour , and i wa requir to spend half of the tour time in the meager shop . i felt bore and even affliciton . for these reason , i thought travel without tour guid is best . it give me more knowledg , experi , and movement .
