i strongli agre to thi statement that it is more importang for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . thi may be support through sever idea and point . firstli , understood idea and concept are a much more reliabl and use type of knowledg rather than memoris fact . have spent my school life in two veri differ countri ; japan and australia , i have experienc both way of learn . an effect exampl of thi would be the way scienc wa taught . in japan , we were expect to memoris all the scientif terminolog and definit of key term . the exam were focus on how much inform student were abl to memoris from the text book rather than how much they could understand and develop . at my current school in australia , the teacher expect us to understand concept and develop them in our own way . the exam are frequent base on basic concept that were taught in class and how we can adopt that to a situat in real life or a new scenario provid . i find that the knowledg i have gain at my australian school ha been more use in real life and make sens , wherea the inform i learnt by memoris never made complet sens to me , or connect with the other fact i knew . in addit , i think that idea and concept that are onc understood are more difficult to forget . memoris can be an effect way of studi in the short term , but these fact are often forgotten in a short period of time and it is unlik that student will be abl to rememb those fact in the futur . oppos to thi , understood fact enabl student to develop their own idea base on them and expand their knowledg . also , as these form of knowledg will not be forgotten easili even after a long period of time , it make it easier for student to link what they have learnt in their previou year of studi with what they are studi in their later year of studi . although learn and understand idea and concept are more import , i think that learn fact still play an import role in gain knowledg . no matter how well the concept is understood , if the key term or rel definit are not memoris , it make it difficult for the student to demonstr hi knowledg or convey hi idea base on them . thu , i think that a minimum amount educ should focu on make student learn fact by memoris . in conclus , although i agre to the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , i can not deni that learn fact also play a signific role in studi as well . they each cover differ type of inform and thu is benefiti in differ way . therefor , i reccomend that educ should be primarili base on enabl student to understand concept and idea but also it is requir for a minimum amount of some basic definit and terminolog to be learnt by make student memoris them .
