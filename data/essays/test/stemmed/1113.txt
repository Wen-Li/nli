whether it is more import that to understand idea and concept for student is import to learn fact ? difffernt peopl hold differnt opnion due to their differnt experic , in my point of view , i think that it is both improt to abtain the idea and concept and to learn fact . there is no one more import than the other . in my follow argument i will make some commend on the question . on the one hand , it 's basic for a sudent to learn the idea and concept . learn the idea and pricipl can let us learn the world more comprehens . all the later fumual and fact are relay on the basic concept . without the concept all the later exper and conclus are unreal . for exampl , if a student dont comprehans the theori of ` graviti rull for everyth ' . how can he culcul the speed of the thing drop from the air . and haw can he find the outer space of the univers . idea and pricipl are realli the basic theori of the more progress inversitg , on the other hand , it is also import that the student need to learn the fact . to learn the fact realli can deduc the time we need to explor the world . there are so mani fact and conclus that had been find and test for a long time , that the treasur that our presecor leav to us . if we don'tn learn the fact , all the thing need to be find for the individua himself . it 's a such waster of time and energ . and no one can make progress not bass on the fact , for exampl , at the medic field , there are so mani anatomi fact had been dissect and we student ca n't learn anyth more without learn the fact , after gather the all the fact we can keep our reserch on humankind . then we can contribut to the socialti in our limit life . so in conclus . it is no doult that student need to learn the idea and pricepl as well as the fact . they are so import to let us know the univers quikli and comprehens . they are all the base that we can excav the univers more realli to the realiti .
