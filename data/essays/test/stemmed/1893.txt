in my opinion the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' can in some case be true , in other not . it alway depent on the kind of product the advirtis is referr to . one problem with advertis nowaday is , that mani thing can easili be chang and improv with computersoftwar . if you look at an advertisemnt of a cosmet product , like an anti age cream on tv for exampl , you will alway see a pretti woman with a perfect skin , which should be caus by that certain cream . so somebodi who realli ha a problem like that might think , that if he use thi cream , he will look like that as well , which is probabl not true . thi case show that the advertis definitli make the product better than it actual is by use visual thing like a pretti woman to convinc custom . the same count for exampl for wash powder etc. , where wash result can easili be fake by use a comput programm or just use a clean piec of cloth instead of the clean dirti one , which they could never get that clean . anoth kind of product may be servic . compani can alway tell a lot about which advantag they might bring you , but in realiti everyth might be differ , like it happen to me when i went to australia with a well known work and travel compani . they promis help with jobsearch for exampl , but in realiti they did not help me to find one job , they just had a veri convinc advertis . apart from the group of product mention abov , there are also product like electron , car etc . if there is an advertis about a product like that , there will not be much to fake about it . you can get technic fact about the product , which can not be fake , otherwis it would be against the law , and if you buy a product like that and it is doe not work like it wa suppos to be , you can easili complain about it and ask your money back . so if you look at all the metion point , you can final say that it alway depent on the product the advertis is about and if it is possibl to make it appear better than it actual is by visual effect .
