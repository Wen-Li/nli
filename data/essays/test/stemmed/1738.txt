- hairspray that give your hair the same great look all day , dure all activ - someth almost everi woman want . but is thi realist ? if you see a commerci for exampl on televis , have you ever ask yourself `` is it reason what the poduc is advert , is it true ? '' in the follow essay i would like to discuss exactli thi statement . is the advertis product as great as produc say it is ? first of all we have to consid , that the main thought produc have in their mind is to sell their product , make profit of it . so i person think that they few a littl cheat not as a major problem but make the product look more likabl . second , in an advertis you can vari the condit such as temperatur and light , so the custom automat see the best part of the product and might not even consid possibl risk . third , peopl are easi to influenc . see a product on a young , healthi and good look woman or man in a breathtak set make them want to be there , have the same look and the same experi . so that a uninfluenc perspect is given . on the other hand there are regul that control and narrow the rang of the produc creativ . as a result there ha to be a certain truth within an advertis . person i have experienc that not all advertis product are better present in a commeri than in realiti . so for my own opinion i tri not to get as much influenc by the media and there propaganda .
