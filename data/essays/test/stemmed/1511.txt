without a doubt , it is more import for student to know idea and concept than it is for them to memor fact by hard . by just learn fact , student may onli rememb them for a short period of time . after a while , they will forget everyth . thi is not an effect way to studi . i believ the most effect way to studi is to learn how to deriv fact . first of all , in my experi , i have suffer a lot from memor formular in physic . even though i can input all formular befor exam , i alway forget after exam have finish . but there is an except . for those formular that my physic teacher ha deriv for me , i still remeb complet . he ha taught me the way to find one formular by combin and calcul use differ formular . by do thi , i am abl to remeb the origin of formular which alway alert me when i see them . moreov , student can learn more if they particip in class discuss . dure histori class , i did not particip in class discusison just becaus i wa too shi to say my own opinit . howev , after a while when i got use to situat , i have began to say my opinion . and that moment , i have realiz that i can learn more if i interact with other peopl becaus they have differ view , perspect and answer . from then , i have alway been tri to gain other peopl 's opinion . in addit , bill gate , the creater of microsoft is one of mani who ha absorb idea and concept by himselv . he ha been studi in harvard univers , howev , he quit school and ha began to studi about comput on hi own . he ha form a team to interact , commun and learn more about comput from the perspect of concept . at that time , there were onli few comput develop in the world , so he had veri small amount of fact . he ha develop idea on hi own and ha acheiv to creat person comput for home use . learn fact are onli use if student want to rememb onli a short period of time . but when it come to research , they should use mani kind of sourc and teacher to understand idea and concept .
