i partial agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are : thi in my opinion occur especi in sector in which the market are not so develop . in the case of not develop market , advertis are bias to creat a good imag of the product : they do that becaus the main purpos of the advertis is to make the peopl buy the new product . thi is done show the good part of the product they are market . one of the main reason whi thi is true is that in thi kind of market the success of an advertis compani is measur by the amount of purchas of the product advertis ; the peopl will be more inclin to purchas the good that is present as be `` good '' and not as be a `` bad '' . thi inde mean that the advertis compani is go to tri to highlight the good part of a product and it will tri instead to hide the wors part of the product . the custom are betray and treat as stupid . thi mean moreov that the imag of the product will be distort by the advertis , as the advertis will be bias to show onli the good part of it . the problem with thi way of do advertis might actual come when the market develop and new competitor enter the market . at the begin they might just compet brutal , tri to highlight the best part of their respect product but when the custom realiz that the qualiti advertis for the product are not true , they might stop buy thi product and buy the competitor one . in thi case , the advantag to the produc of exager in advertis the good qualiti of their product fall dramat , while a more respons statement of the good qualiti of the product could be the key to achiev more custom . in addit to thi the compani might be inclin to invest money in enhananc the imag of the compani in gener and make the custom believ that not onli the product are enough good but also that the compani is reliabl and respons . in conclus i think that advertis make product seem better than they are onli in some case .
