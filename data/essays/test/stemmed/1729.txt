idea and concept are veri import for student than just to learn fact . idea and concept are pracitc in real life than just learn the fact . i total agre with the statement that , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . few reason and exampl are illustr below to hold my opinion . fistli , understand idea and concept make the student more practic and applic in respect field or subject . for incid , take medic surgeon student , if the student surgeon know the idea and concept how to do the surgeri , when the student becom a surgeon , he or she can perform surgeri veri easili than learn the fact about how to do the surgeri . anoth incid comput programm student , by learn idea , and concept it is easi to develop new comput programm when they becom the programm . secondli , understand the idea , and concept make student more innov . for incid , if the student is a chemistri student and the student learn the idea and concept regard the chemic compound than learn just the fact , student can exper the idea and concept that she or he learn and innov new compound that would be use for mankind . for exampl medic compound etc . final , understand the idea and concept make student understand the subject . no matter how the question are frame regard the subject , student are abl to answer the question and attain good grade in class . for incid , if the student is math student , by understand the idea and concept of math , it is easi to resolv ani type of math question on exam and can get veri good score . but learn just the fact of math do n't help the student much in solv math . to summeris , understand idea and concept is import not onli to improov the grade in class but to practic and appli in real life , and also to make student futur innov , reaserch and scientist .
