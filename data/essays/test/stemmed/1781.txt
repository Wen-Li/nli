accord to the context , i could agre and also disagre with thi statement . on the one hand i agre that open mind peopl who tri new thing tend to be successful becaus they gain from each new thing they tri , name an experi or a profess . it is in fact import to have knowledg in mani field in order to work with peopl from differ sector . nowaday , in fact , in the labour market it is veri import to have knowledg of sever subject , in order to be abl to work at high level , where a more gener understand of sever aspect of a firm is need . on the other hand focuss on one subject , field , profess can also lead to success . be an expert in what you do , make you valuabl and abl to work at a higher niveau . furthermor a deep knowledg of a subject/field/profess is also necessari to develop it and inferr implic , often veri import and applyabl in the practic , that a non-speci person would not notic . a person who doe n't special in someth never realli know the subject deep enough to exploit it knowledg in a valuabl way , and often doe n't realli know what he is realli interest in . therefor , i person think that both approach can be posit , depend on what a person realli want to reach . at today i am still tri to understand what i would like to do , and i do n't know if it 'll be better to special in one topic or have a gener knowledg of sever subject . nevertheless in my person life i prefer to tri new thing whenev i can becaus i consid new experi essenti for my person growth . the best way to make new experi for me is to travel . travel in new place , with new cultur and differ peopl in fact ha alway fascin me , and help me to strongli grow person .
