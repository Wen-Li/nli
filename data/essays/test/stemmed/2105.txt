although have a knowledg of the fact is import for student , i think that a better understand of the idea and concept that caus the fact is crucial for a student 's growth and develop . first of all , a truli understand of the fact is onli possibl through an indepth understand of the idea or concept behind them . for exampl , i read on the `` discoveri magazin '' that in 2007 some scientist have thought about the opportun to delet bad memori from an individu brain . thi is a fact that may not be understood by peopl that have n't had a bad experi . appar , the idea behind thi fact is that a bad experi occur in an indivu 's childhood may have a neg impact on the individu 's life . by elimin the memori of a bad experi the indivu may live a `` normal '' life . for exampl , let 's assum that a child wa abandon when he wa 5 year old . he will rememb the feel of abandon everytim someon that he love leav for a trip or move to anoth citi . such person will then be less inclin to get closer to other peopl becaus he know that if he love them , at a certain point they will leav and he may suffer . by elimin the memori of hi abandon , he may leav better and without misconcept . furthermor , know the idea or concept behind a chemistri or a biolog fact , for exampl , may help the student in appli that idea ( or concept ) to other disciplin and find an explan of similar result . in conclus , although know the fact is import , onli a knowledg of the idea or concept behind the fact may give a better and complet understand of whi and how someth happen . thi is true in all disciplin , from histori to scienc to chemistri to biolog and so on .
