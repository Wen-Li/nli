nowday mani peopl think young peopl do n't spend enough time to help their commun . i do n't find my self compleatli agre with thi statement . i am 26 year old and i have mani friend of my same age that work in their free time in cariti associ and i did too in the past . anyway i can see that more and more peopl just take care of their self , special young peopl . i work as volonte for carita in my own town for a few year . i wa spend there 2 hour per week each week , but then when i start the univers , i move in bologna , i could n't save ani time to work as volont and i stop . at thi point , me and my famili decid to adopt a child in bangladesh , in thi way i feel less guilti when i think to how mani pooor peopl there are in world . some peopl can object that i choos the easiest way . i could find someth more close to me , and i think thi is quit true . there are may old peopl in my littl countri that need help : as for exampl keep their compani , go to the supermarket , or go to the porst offic , but i ca n't handl it . i do n't have time enough for that . anyway adopt a child is better that noth . i have a few friend that help old peopl in their own citi , or their grandpar at home . i think young peopl are sensibl to the problem of their comun , just if their own famili let them be sensibl to them , becaus the societi doe n't give you ani input about that kind problem , the societi nowday is too caotic and led you thi just to money , and power . i think young peopl would spend more time help their comun if they will be sensibl to that kind of problem .
