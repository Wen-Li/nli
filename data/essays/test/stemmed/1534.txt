most of the time , there are two way of teach . the first way could be to expos the fact and discrib these fact . the second wy could be the explan of idea and concept . some subject , as histori impli the student to learn the fact . other subject , as philosophi , impli student to learn idea in one side but also to understand these idea and concept . in fact we can see those two way of teach in the same subject . to my mind , i think that it is interest to learn fact . fact , in the past , help us to understand the present time . in histori for exampl lean the fact could help us to understand the present time . moreov when we learn fact , we learn their process , their consequ on our time . it help student to understand the wolrd where they are live . for exampl learn the fact of the second worl war is realli interest for an european student becaus he can see , firt , the histori of hi countri , second , what wa the childood of hi grand parent who can explain cont to him thi period . econom is an interest subject when we learn the fact . we can understand what is the origin of our sociti and of our economi . we can also anal how the economi ha progress for the ninetenth centuri . learn the fact is a good way too to imagin what will happen in the futur . but , i think that it is more import to understand idea and concept . i think that some peopl by their idea , their genu play an import place in the histori . for exampl , aristot had a special view of the literatur and yhe philosiphi which is still today a model for the writter . it is veri import to learn the idea end the concept of p [ eopl who were a geniu becaus they discov thing which have an impact today . moreov some concept seam to be etern . for exampl artit are etern by their work . accord to me , it is more import to understand fact and concept becaus they the produc of a reflect . in gener , they have no effect of destruct
