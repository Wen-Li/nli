in japan , where i live , some young peopl prefer to travel by themselv . howev , i agre to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for the follw reason . my first reason is that to travel in a group led by a tour guid is safer than to travel alon . for instanc , when i wa a junior high school student , i travel to new york in a group led by a tour guid . in that time , i heard that new york wa a quit danger citi . we plane to visit a famou theater . actual , the theater wa locat in a downtown where wa a quit danger place . becaus i wa in a group , i wa abl to take a tour bu from a hotel where i stay to the theater . in addit , a tour guid help me to visit there . so it wa total safe for me . if i had travel alon , i would have had to take a subway to visit the theater . i am not sure if i wa abl to visit there alon without ani help from a tour guid . thi exampl clearli show that to travel in a group led by a tour guid is safer than to travel alon . my next reason is that i can make more friend if i travel in a group led by a tour guid than i travel alon . for instanc , when i wa a studi in waseda univers , one of the most famou privat univers in japan , i travel to europ in a group led by a tour guid . in the group , i met a girl , shiori . aithough i never met her in my campu , she wa also studi in waseda univers . in addit , i wa abl to make some friend in a group , includ a tour guid . a tour gude , miki , and i wa actual live in a same apart . after the tour , i often contact with her . she is now one of my best friend . if i had travel alon , i would not have known them . becaus i travel in a group led by a tour guid , i wa abl to know shiori , miki and other peopl . thi strongli illustr that i can make more friend if i travel in a group led by a tour guid than i travel alon . in conclus , i agre to the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
