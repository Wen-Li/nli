i agre with the import of the understand of all subject or topic . i believ that is more imoprt for a student to understand someth that just learn it . as an exampl , in a histori class you will memor , date , place , number of individu in a certain place , and that is right , but that is not the full concept of histori , histori is know how the thing happend ? , whi they hapend ? , for what reazon ? , all that kind of doubt that you should be abl to understand . anoth exampl will be mathemat , your teacher give you a formula for memor and you will memor it but if you dont know how to use it in a problem in a quiz you will be stock and you wont go ani farther until you understand it . peopl need to use their brain , more than just save record , date and name . student need to start think , in that way they can develop better understand toward ani subject . one great thinker in the histori of human kind , galileo galilei he learn how the graviti work by understand it spend time watch think over and over again until he figur it out . a big part of our societi reli in peopl that are abl to understand thing , like geologist with the global warm , they need to understand whi the world temperatur is increas drastic , detect need to understand what happend in crime scene in a way to catch the author of the crime , scientif need to understand whi the thing happen in physic , chimestri , biolog and all kind of branch that the scienc have . my conlus on thi subject , is that student need to understand everyth that is arround them in a way to develop more the logic behind everyth .
