mani peopl might think that travel alon with out a guid will give them more time to examin the foreign countri individu and thoroughli . howev , i do not suggest to do so becaus after it is hard to commun easili one might get lost and also the guider no much more about the famou place in that countri . befor travel we usual buy a trip book of the particular countri for convers that might sometim be necessari . sometim like when we are lost . trueli , when i visit franc i onc wa out of the citi where i did n't even know the name of and wa terrefi of my curcumst . well , eventu , by ask and ask sever foreign by tele them to show me how , and where should i find thi place by bodi languag , i wa back to where i belong . thi realli wa a hard time for me . i alway imagin wheather if i had a tourist at that time in the first place i would n't have gotten lost and would n't have to be panic at that time , so on , i could have had a good time dure the trip , then have a bad memori . furthermor , if travel with guider you can visit place that are famou and spend your time without anxiou where to go next , becaus the guider will lead you to the next destin . also , as we visit ancient tomb or kingdom , guider would explain about these monument which give you more comprehens to the countri . on the contrast , if you dont have a guid , you sill have to ask everi person to go to a particualr place and will lose the opportun to have a closer look at how the countri custom are about . in brief , to travel conveni such as not have ani complex situat or have troubl to find ani good place to visit follow a travel agent is benefiti in time and effort and at the end one will have a pleas memori of the trip .
