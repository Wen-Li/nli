advertis are veri import for custom to gain inform about product or have a knowledg about a new product that ha just start to be sold in the market . but there is an import problem about advertis whether the product seem how they are in real or not . i agre with the one who believ product seem much better in advertis than they realli are . first of all , in the market there are mani produc for a specif type of product , and custom usual decid between the product accord to his/her need , technic and design aspect , price and qualiti . the custom want to buy high qualiti product with a less price and the produc want to sell a lot of them to get the highest profit . sinc the produc know the demand of custom and what they are look for , advertis are prepar accord to custom usual . for exampl , i decid to buy a mobil phone but not an expens one two month ago . i search over the internet and came across with an advertis . in the advertis they were claim that , they sell the cheapest mobil phone . when i click the link , a pictur of the phone and price of it came to the screen . there were also some technic detail written with a small font . on the screen of the phone in the pictur , there is a colour sailer pictur and a blue sea . i thought that the phone ha a color screen and immedi order one from the internet without read the technic aspect becaus price wa veri good and it wa a hot offer for that day . two week later my phone came and i realiz that it doe n't have a color screen and also larger than the size shown in the pictur . i becam shock and immedi phone custom relat . they told me that there is a small note which say that there are two model for thi phone and they put the pictur of improv modal under the web page . as you can understand thi experi produc prepar advertis accord to custom and they do n't real reflect the real model
