in my view , i think that advertis are alway make product seem much better and more benef than they realli are . first of all , what advertis realli want is to show the import and the effect of their product in peopl 's life so they can sell it easili to them . sometim they may lie to their custom just to let them buy it as quickli as they can . it 's like a great movi that they show the most beauti scean and forget about the rest of it . therefor , advertis will display what is good and posit about their product and put everth is bad and neg a side so buyer will not figur it out until they tri it by themselv . moreov , advertis are carri about the money and the profit of their product more than the product it self . in addit , they dont care that much about the peopl need or what they realli want . thu , they will focu more often on their product profit than it benefit . in conclus , advertis are a way to earn some money even when it 's wrong and untru .
