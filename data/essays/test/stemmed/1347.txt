i do not agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . to hold the contrari opinion is tantamount to affirm that most advertis cheat custom , which i think it is not true . howev , in order to defend my posit i have to face one straightforward object : if your statement is true , whi do custom sometim expect more from the product they bought than what they actual receiv ? i will carri out my argument in two step . first i will give the two reason that support my claim , and secondli i will address the object i have present . the main point to bear in mind is the distinct between what a thing is and how doe a thing appear or is present to other . for while what one thing is is just `` one thing , '' the way it may appear or be present vari a lot . and advertis know thi and play with it . i see no problem when they take advantag of thi differ , provid they do not alter what the product realli is ( in thi case they will be cheat ) . moreov , i think there is no `` sheer object '' in present someth , and we alway have to choos the aspect we want to focu on or that should be stress . thi happen , for instanc , when we are tri to convinc other . anoth point is that a product interact ( in the sphere of the seem ) with mani other factor , such as environ , compani , an so forth . for exampl , when we see an advertis of a 4wd suv the car is not present in a garag , but in the best condit : in the mountain , with a wonder overview , a nice day , good compani and so forth . it is the same car we may be drive a raini day in the midst of a traffic jam after have a flat tyre . .. now i want to meet the object . i agre that in fact thi sometim happen . you have bought such amaz car you saw in tv , you have spent all your save there and the first day you want to use it is a raini day , and you are hit by anoth car . .. you have not been cheat . rather , the condit do not help to enjoy such a product at it best . so thi come from a failur on the side of the custom , who did not understand the differ between be and seem . it is the duti of an advertis to tell you the good reason for by a product , but it correspond to the custom to think about the reason for not buy it . the correct synthesi of both side yield alway the best choic .
