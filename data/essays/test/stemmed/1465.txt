in my opinion there are no sign whi the number of car should decreas in the next twenti year . at first there is a common growth in world popul even the number is declin in the industri state . as thi is no sign for more car of cours you have to regard the develop of china for exempl . it cross domest product is increas with seven per cent a year what mean they are abl to buy more consumpt product involv car . even local car produc see china as the futur market and build facil there . what count for china is also consider for india and other asian countri . moreov there are no altern for mid rang destin . the bu support in bigger citi is well develop and to reach other citi you can go by train or airplan but the one live in the wide spread suburb are forc to take the car . but in fact they are not onli forc to do so , they want to becaus it is much more convini . you do not have to wait for the bu and you can go everywher becaus the street allow you to . anoth aspect that prevent the car from vanish is more in peopl 's head . car are symbol for the wealth and the social statu of their owner which affect especi men and can not be deni . thi lead to buy behaviour that no bike will ever caus . as a summari you can say that there are mani good reason whi car will remain part of our societi for at least the next few decad , even if oil is run out soon engen are search for method ( like hydrogen ) to keep the car run .
