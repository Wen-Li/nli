i total agre with the follow statement that state that all success peopl tri new thing and take rick rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well . well thi statement total correct becaus everi person who start from the bottom , or let say who start from scratch and becam success with it will eventu get board of it and will want to start someth new . in my point of view he will be show hi friend that he is a veri success man am a challeng person who is not affraid of tri new stuff . take the risk of do someth new it need a success strong person to do it and accomplish it . to be success in all the field you must start from scratch and start grow up . start go to the new busi and to a new field . while , not take the risk and open a new busi and stay on the field that you are worokingon for your whole life in wont take you anywher you may still be a success man , but in your on field where you cant go and do busi with the peopl that are more success than you . to prove that you are success in your life and your busi you must take and do some risk in your life to prove to yourself that you can do it , that you are up to it , and not be affraid to lose it . just the feel that you have for know that you are up to it and you can do it , will definitli make you do it no matter what is in your way you 'll end up do it and be a well-success man in all the field . stand at place where you are well at do at not move forword will not help you to becom a success man .
