i do think that advertis make somtim product seem much better than they realli are . first i think thi is logic sinc advertis are usual commerci and thi make the main porpus for an advertis is to show the advantag of the product even if that mean exagur . advertis in gener is a rel larg field , it studi the respons of consum in order to be abl to design the right advertis for a certain product . in an open market full of competetor usual the most effect way to sell a product is to claim that thi product is the best and to tri to convinc the consum to buy it and thi is the main aim . i can recal now the wash powder use for wash machin , when i watch these advertis i get confus as a consum , everi advertis for one kind of wash powder is claim that it is the best in the market and it can do what other can not . like remov stain from cloth and give a refresh smel to cloth , and i have experienc that some of these claim are not quit right . some say whi a good product need to be advertis in the first place , they say the product can talk for them selv , in other word adverstis is use for the less qualiti product in order to sell it . i do n't quit agre with thi view sinc we see advertis for the best car brand in the world ( bmw , merce . .. etc . ) . again do these veri fine product seem much better than they are when shown on advertis ! i think not , sinc all fine qualiti product produc know they will loos some of thier credit in the market if they resort to exaggur and that might shock thier posit in the market , and such name can not afford to loos thier rank posit in a certain market for exampl car , wash powder , food . .. etc .
