i agre that most advertis make product much better than they realli are . i have a some reason and they are follow . first of all , person who sell product they must be get mani consum as much as they can , becaus they want to get profit . most of all seller , they do not tell ani lie , but they do not say bad aspect of the product . of cous , they do not need to say them . if i want to sell someth at the school festiv , i mean when i want to introduc our store or product to other , i deffinetli say onli good thing . so , probablli , custom maight be seem or discov bad aspect of our produst . secondli , some advertis are exassar . i mean it is emphas too much . it is also not lie but just too much . so , sometim when i got a new stuff i will be dissapoint at it becaus i just follow that kind of advertis . i think everyon ha that kind of feel sometim . i have a experi , as well . one day i watch the tv and they sold some food for diet . i want to loos my waight . and they said a lot of good word and also introduc someon who lost waight a lot becaus of that product . and i dont think that wa lie , but now i know that the someon wa just exampl . of cours i do not now all peapl who use that food to loos their waight . some could loos a lot , other could onli 1 pound , i do not know . final , i bought the product but i fail to loos my waight . so i think someon could loos waight a lot , they did exercis and ate that product . becus i did not do exercis a lot . the seller just told the ture . so the advertis is not bad . so what wa or is the problem ? i think the problem is myself , at least in my case . i get influenc of advertis , easili . now i know becaus of my imagin . when i see good word of advertis , i never think about bat aspest of it and just thiknk about good one too much . that 's whi i dissapoint sometim . in conclut , i still agre that statement . howev , i thiknk it is not advertis but our imagin is problem , too .
