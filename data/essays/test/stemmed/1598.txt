i disagre with the statement that it is better to have bro dnowledg of mani academ subject that to specailez in one specif subject for mani reason : well-organ for the main subject , aviod student from what they do n't like to studi , and other academ will be forgotten . initi , if a student studi onli the academ subject which he like , he will definit be creativ in hi subject . for exampl , i have a cassmat who ador chmestiri and get a veri high mark in chmestiri . unfortun , he ha to studi biolog which he realli doe n't like , he fail in the foundat year in the univers becaus of the biolog albeit he got high mark in chemisteri , as a result , he could studi onli chemsteri and pass the foundat year , second , if a sudent studi onli one subject , he will definit be a well-organ in thi subject , in addion , he spare their time do the same subject and have extra informatoin about the onli subject which he chose to studi . third , the extra academ subject , which are not use dure the jod , will be forgotten , so the student do n't need these academ subjent which , in my point of view , wast of the student time . from the infom given , it 's not true that a student can have broad knowledg of mani academ subject if he studi mani subject becaus student get bore of the subject which are mandatori to studi in the univers and we can aviod them from fail in the cous which they do want to take . in brief , we can make better and creativ student if we let them studi the subject of their faild .
