most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it doesnt matter what product , it could be fondat , eye shadow , lip gloss , eye linear and mani more . in magazin , we see girl that look amaz out of the lip gloss , so we buy lip gloss , and it end up look way differ . the eye make up too as well . though there 's some advertis which are real , like hand cream , accessori and mani other stuff . but most of them are just wast of money and time as well . howev , women that are interest in such thing , they would keep on buy and get stuff , think that they look way better with the product . though they dont know that it no good for their skin . i rememb a friend of mine went onc to thi huge skin care , and she knew that she 's go to pay way more than 200 buck ! but she said , `` oh it ok , it go to make me look good , i realli want to tri thi cream on . '' it wa thi browni cream which look extrem disgust , but becaus she saw that pictur of a woman who use it , she believ it ! she spent over 250 $ to get her face done and it end up have thi brown thing stuck in her face ! and her skin is realli bad now , it like a cream that burn her face not fix it . though in the pictur she look so sexi , hot and no word would describ her . i do n't realli recommand to get product without make sure it ha in , what it made of , make a huge research about it , and ask peopl who tri it instead do it blindli ! it realli interest to get our skin clean , and take care of our beauti ! but i guess it 's much nicer to make sure what we are use befor go ahead and do it ! right , most advertis make product that seem nice , but my point is to make sure of it , dont look at pictur , look at the main skin !
