in my opinion i think that successful peopl tri new thing or take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is correct . peopl they are rich or have a good reput , have a big selfconfed . so it is easier for them to tri new thing and take mayb risk . i think they have the money and if they loos somth , by do riskful thing or tri new thing , they take not so much damag as less richer peopl . they have the chanc to tri out new thing becaus , they are save becaus of their money or wellknow . a good exampl are actor like brad pitt and angelina joli they adop children form fare countri , like cambocha . the risk is that these children have danger ill , or other peopl see thi adopt as a bad thing . so mayb some peopl hate them for adopt these children and so pitt and joli get problem . they can lost their good reput and will mayb get in futur not good actorrul . an other exampl is pari hilton , she act veri provoc and a lot of peopl hate her becaus of her charact . she iss often drunk , or make a lot of embarass thing . so i think she do thi becaus she ha the oppurtun , she is rich , wellknown and ha a big name . but she could take also a lot of risk by do such provoc thing . peopl ignor her more and more and say she is crazi and did not want to see her . so i think her reput statu will be more and more less . in my view the rich and wellknown peopl can do such thing , i state at the top of my report , becaus they have the money and the reput . their social live is save and they will not get so a lot of problem like `` normal peopl `` if they fail sometim .
