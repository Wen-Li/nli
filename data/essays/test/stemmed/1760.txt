most of the prodcut we can see on advertis seem better than what they realli are . everywher we are flood with advertis , but whi a compani should pic product in a differ way they are ? advertis are the medium use by compani to purpos their product and mainli to increas their profit and , all around the world , compani follow money . if a compani can increas the number of custom also the money they will get will be increas . for exampl when i wa work in a comput shop i could see how my boss wa describ , in a leaflet , a new kind of comput he wa sell in a way it wa not . that comput did not have the power that wa written in the advertis but peopl wa accract by the nice pictur of the comput , by the captur style of the font and my boss could increas hi profit . and as we are speak about a market , with all it rule , it is obviou that an advertis must captur the attent of the custom in order to be better than anoth compani . for exampl when i go to eat an hamburg the sandwich i usual get is not that big and colour i see in the advertis but obvious it ha to be like that so that peopl will eat at that place instead of go to anoth one . but sometim the advertis is studi so that we creat the idea that the product is veri good . for exampl imagin a clean liquid for the bathroom , in the advertis they can onli show it as it is but what if they put a pictur of a shine bathroom in the background ? peopl will like the idea of the shine bathroom and will think the product is veri good also if it will probabl not be like that . in conclus i think that advertis alway make seem product better becaus in the moment we wanna purpos someth , and get money for that , we alway have to do it in the best way , sometim even cheat .
