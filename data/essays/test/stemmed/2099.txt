i agre that most advertis make product appear much more better than they realli are , i agre becaus everi day we see alot of advertis on t.v .s and read it in newspap , it is actual apart of the market of the product and we alway go and buy thi product accord to the adertis , some time we find it averi good product but so time also we found it moder or bad but still not so pretti as showen in t v. or news paper . so advertis is an essenti part of market , we see in each compani a big sector for advertis and thi sector choos averi creativ peopl who can invent a succesfult advertis , we see also the compani pay alot of money for aperson who give anew idea oe design as we see it is veri impot for compani and their product . for exampl certain compani produc cracker , usual cracker as all cracker in the market but it show in the packag spiderman pictur in hi new movi and the cracker have spider man shape so alotof kid love spiderman , as aresult they love spiderman cracker even they do not like the tast of it sothi compani buy veri much spiderman cracker as aresult of intelleg idea or design . thi for children but for adult it may be differ , adult can compar between product and then decid which is good and which is bad , for exampl all deteregnt advertis show averi resist spot or stain befor wash then but the detereg and wash the cloth then becom veri clean and brigt , so onli women candecid which is real and which is fake . so it is amarket problem but i thinkfor the advertis to be succes it must be near realityto convinc the peopl and to be logic becaus we will by the product and decid if we will buy it again or no . ,
