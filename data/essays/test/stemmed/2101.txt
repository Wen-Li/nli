i disagre with thi statement and am quit sure that the number of car world-wid will even increas . one plausibl argument against my assumpt could be the energi resourc of the world , especi the current main resourc for run a car , oil , is run out in the futur . but thi object can be easili wipe away with the argument that the oil resourc will definit last longer than onli 20 year . even when the consumpt of oil is rapidli increas current thi wo n't lead to the dri out of oil well within 20 year . big oil compani invest a lot of money in detect alway new oil field . now as thi object to my statement ha been discuss i would like to sum up some reason for my supposit . in the industrialiy countri mobil is a decis factor for peopl to get a job . without a car the job search is nearli imposs nowaday as mobil is a capabl which is expect from all job applic . as wife and husbond often work at differ place there is a basic need for both of them to be mobil and therefor even in the industri countri the number of car will even rise . but when i am think of a rise number of car , in the first place i have countri like china and india on my mind . both countri have boom economi with record profit each year . thi will automat result in grow incom and grow prosper of their popul . chines and indian peopl who will have more money will definit feel inclin to spend their money on luxuri good they were not abl to afford a few year ago . that peopl in these countri behav like thi can even be seen nowaday . the boom economi ha creat meanwhil an upperclass which spend it money on luxuri good . car belong to these desir luxuri good also . when the boom industi of both countri will go on like thi with yearli econom growth rate thi will gener higher incom for more and more social class in these countri . these peopl as well will then be prone to display their newli won prosper with a luxuri good like a car . if we consid the gigant popul which both state have , we can be veri sure that the number of car in the world will certainli rise veri quickli . even when thi behaviour will certainli result in more air pollut and the run out of resourc , thi will be a fact which will be disregard by most peopl . to appeal to the reason of peopl will be useless .
