some peopl may not consid that most product look better than what it is due to the advertis . in my understand , advertis is one of the effect tool to promot the sale of the product ; henc i assert that produc are made seem better than usual by the advertis . i base my assert upon the follow three aspect : the function , the appear and the price of the product . first of all , the advertis will impos on the good point of the product and will not reveal the bod point or effect . an exampl that make thi clear is that the recent advertis of the laptop comput . some japanes manufactur impos onli on the endur of it batteri wherea the batteri is heavi . some korean manufactur impos onli on the mutipl function of the laptop comput wherea it work veri slowli . secondli , the advertis make product look better than what it realli is . for exampl , car maker use the most good-look color of the car in the adverties . and , they design the angl that the pictur of the advertis is taken . in addit , the product are locat in delux surround in the advertis , which contribut to good a appear of the product . i have found thi true from my own peroson experi , too . i bought my car becaus i wa attract with the good look in the advertis . in the advertis , the car wa exhibit in the citi of pari , one of the most beauti citi in the world . after deliveri of the car to my home , i have found the car not to be attract in the advertis in the suround of the rural area of japan . thirdli , advertis impos on the inexpens price of the product in spite of the fact that the price is not compar in the advertis . in japan , where i live in , fair trade coimmis , which correspond to the feder trade commis in the u.s. , prohibit the advertis from compar the price of the product . therefor the custom can understand the mean of the price of the product are expens or not onli after they compar by themselv . consid all of the abov factor , i believ that most product seem much better than what it is due to the advertis . as i see it , advertis is the potent tool of manufactur and seller to attract the custom ; therefor we have to deduct the bottom-up of the product by the advertis when purchas the product .
