the youth of today is the futur of tomorrow . keep thi say in mind , i strongli contradict the opinion that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . '' to support my claim , i would like to provid exampl of a chariti school and an incid i wit on the road . i am awar of a chariti school that is run entir by peopl within the age of eighteen to twenti - five . these young men and women come to school everi even for two hour to teach and instruct children who are not privileg enough to receiv a formal educ . they also instruct the children in extra curricular activit such as danc and music . in my opinion they are open a number of door for these children by provid them with an educ free of cost and are save the children from a life of poverti . the educ these children have accquir , howev less it may be , will help them to secur a job which in turn would ensur them a livelihood . in thi , one can not say that the youth of today is not help societi . i often walk on the street of the citi in which i live . onc i notic an old man tri to cross the road . he wa rather hesit and visibl scare but no one came to hi aid . to my astonish , i saw a young girl of not more than 16 year , come up to him and help him cross the road . these are two of the numer incid which , made me think that our prejudic against the youth of today is not complet valid . there are still the young men and women who devot time to their commun hope to help peopl and better their live .
