a veri import question for peopl whose have the opportun to travel is how to do it ? in a fix group with a fix program and a tour guid or alon . each answer ha it own possitv and neg thing . to analyz them and after decid which is better ( actual , i will give my person oppinion , which doe not mean it is the correct for everybodi ) i will first describ the two option . when you travel with a group and a guid , you have the opportun to learn some thing that the guid know . for thi to be true , it is veri import to get a good guid , becaus if you do not get a good one it will be a wast of time and money . if the guid is veri , but realli , veri good , you will go to place otherwis you will not have the opportun to know . other benefit is that you will be with other peopl and mayb it is possibl to find some new friend . for thi , it is import to tri to travel with a group compos of peopl you thing you will find identifi with them . the neg part is that you will be fix to a schedul , that probabl you do not like it completli , and will not have the opportun to make some chang at the act . if you travel without a guid and alon or with a known group , you will have the option to do whatev you like at the time you like and the rhym you want . in the other hand , it is possibl to do not learn a lot of interst thing and visit some place . but , all thi could be fix if befor the travel , you make a littl bit of research . i think is better to travel without a guid ( to have some liberti ) but with some friend caus , it is alway better to not be alon . but it is veri import to know , befor the travel , someth about the place that is go to be visit .
