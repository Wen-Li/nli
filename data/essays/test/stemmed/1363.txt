i agre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today . i have three reason whi i think so . the first reason is that anoth transport system will be more comfort than now such as train and bu . in some countri it is imposs to move to anoth place without car . and so , mani peopl have to use car . howev , 20 year is long enough to spread anoth transport system . there are still few transport system in the countri side . in some place , there is no transport system at all . the secound reason is that peopl will care about environ more . car are not good for earth 's environ . even now mani peopl care about earth 's environ , i think there will be much more peopl who care earth 's environ in the futur . train is better than car about environ becaus train can move much more peopl than car with same enogi . and train work with erectr which is better than fossil enegi for environ . recent car compani are deverop new car which are good for environ , but i think even such car are not better than train . the third reason is about popul . popul of the world will not increas ani more . and the ratio of elder peopl is increas . older peopl doe n't prefer to drive car becaus it is danger . these day mani elder peopl were kill by car accid . becaus of abov reason , i think there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . i also wish there will be fewer car becaus of environ and reduc car accid . mani peopl wish there will be fewer car as i think . thi is anoth reason whi i think there will be fewer car in the futur .
