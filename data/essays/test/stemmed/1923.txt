advertis are widespr and they play a mayor role in today societi , sinc they significantli influenc the behaviour of the mass . while it is gener believ that advertis alway make product seem much better than they realli are , in my opinion thi is not exactelli true , sinc a distinct ha to be made on the type of product and on the type of custom . the main object for all kind of advertis is to emphas all the posit aspect of a product , and thi often translat into total neglect the neg one . thi is onli possibl for non technic product , or product which are not conceiv for profession . in thi case a lie or a non work featur would lead to the opposit effect . in the case of non tecnic product which are to be use by mass , advertis usual aim at stimul the more subconsci and subject idea of the consum . the valu of the object is therefor not the valu of the bare object itself , but the valu that societi give to it . a veri popular exampl is the ipod by appl , which ha becom a statu symbol . it is veri difficult to evalu the valu of an object by look at it advertis . i peson think that in gener advertis are quit object and it is peopl that give object they see in the ad more valu , due to the appeal that the advertis is abl to give .
