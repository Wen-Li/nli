all around the world , all of the histori , all of the civilaz and all the old peopl use to live with the same problem : young peopl , and still the problem didnt be solv from anyon . it veri import to have a child and grow him/her up with a good educ and also grow them up with the necesseti of the societi . not onli the educ is import : but also the cultur is import , so it must be in the balanc . all of us have some respons to our famili , school , work , neighberhood . in my opinion the most import part of the respons to our famili . becaus all the time they were like a emercenc bag , whenev we need to someth they came to help us . none of our friend neither our collic nor our pet can be the closest part of the realitionship , onli our memeb of famili can help us in some special subject . the time is chang veri quickli , therefor the realitionship are changinig with the time . alway there were a huge gap between our behaviour and the attidut of our famili . they are expect so mani thing from us that we can not do . they may be want onli the respons from us but they have to undetrstand we are top of rebelti of the teenag . anyway the main subject is time is veri import for all of the peopl . some of the peopl are awar of import of time , someof doesnt . also chang technolog affect the relat and socalizm . so mani pc game and other staff make our life veri complic . chang time is also effect our social life . in the past time the young peopl could spent their time in the commun howev now the lifestyl of young peopl have chanc aswel , we cant find ani time for commun or other social activ unfortonuatli : becaus our life becam veri sophist . we are live as a robot lifestyl , come to the school after school alway have some homework or other thing to do . what i want to say is we dont have ani spare time anymor even we can not find time to make sport . peopl must do whatev they want to do if it possibl .
