i disagre with the statement as the advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . becaus their is number of reason to support my opinion these are the follow . first the main aim of the advertis ( adv ) to acknowledg the consum regard the particular product . as the sole aim to produc an item or the product is to earn the revenu from that , for thi purpos the product should be sale and for thi the consum will be awar thu the adv will be done . second their is the norm or law or guidlin that should be follow when the process of manufactur wa go on . so the qualiti will be depend upon the norm made by the regular author not by the particular manufactur although their is the minimum limit to check the qualiti and henc all the product from the differ manufactur should have that charcterist as written in the norm . third the purpos of the adv is to acceler the sale of the product and compet with the same product produc by the differ manufactur , for thi reason the adv mainli done as to show how superior their product w.r.t. anoth . fourth the adv sometim show the effect of the product after use the same to stimul the consum but all the consum may not get the same effect , it does'nt mean that the product have the inferior qualiti . for exampl it may be possibl that the product does'nt suit your skin in case of skin prepar while show a good effect on the other . in all i say that the advertis is the mode of commun between the manufactur and the consum , it is neccessari for the compani to sustain or compet with the market contend . so it is not meant for the make product seem much better than they reali are .
