some peopl say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept them to learn fact , if i could make decis then i could choos that to learn fact is much import when we l are learn . three most crucial reason whi i think fact is much use are list as follow , we can associ with societi ; we can understand more quickli by handl a situat ; moreov testbook and definit is not alway true . one veri convic argument for associ with societi is the best way to clarifi what is the fact that we will encount in the futur . for exampl we could meet a lot of peopl and they can share a lot experi eith us , futhermor no one can deni the fact that associ with societi could make us more confidenti . a point also veri wealth to notic is that to handl a situat is the shortcut which we could pass the process from textbook . for instanc if we learn much more fact or do somemor experi form lab that can make us understand more faster and make deep impress in our mind , furthermor in some part of depart fact is alway more import then idea and concept , onli by do yourself that could help you more . last but not the list , all of we know that idea and concept just similar as definit in testbook , not everlast true , and much of then we can not prove it , as examplif from a brightli frame of refer it is no way to prove whi e = mcsquar . moreov if we dought about that and no mathod to prove we will feel distress . in summari i protest the point that ideal and concept are more import then to learn fact , as i mention sometim concept are no more reliabl but peril to us if we have no opportun to prove that . after all to learn fact is much bet
