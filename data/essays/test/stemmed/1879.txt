in my prespect , i agre that broad knolwedg of mani academ subject is better than specialiaz in one specfic subject but to a certain extent . and i quot here `` knowledg is power '' , so wider knowledg of mani academ subject give more insight to a gener theme and allow to explor and relat a differ aspect of one issu . for exampl stude econm as a major subject alon will not be reward in comparison to stude it with other relat academ subject such as polit and human scienc . we know that these other subject do have an influenc on econom . so it is more of have a hollist knowledg rather than see one face of a coin . know differ academ subject also give the opprtun to explor person prefer on stude a certain topic and help make choic . so on the other hand , special after a certain extent is need to increas effeci and qualiti of knolwedg or work .
