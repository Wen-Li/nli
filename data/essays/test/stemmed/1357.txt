i do agre on the statement that most advertis make product seem better than thez realli are . the reason are easi to find : the person who work for a certain compani as the administr for it advertis are veri well inform about the psycholog process in peopl 's brain when they encount certain stimuli . with thi power the influenc the costum and make him or her want to by their product . these stimuli are veri often visua : if you want to sell babi nutur success , all you have to do ist to show a happi babi with it mother advertis it . anoth way is to onli list the posit featur of the product , such as it low prize , all it extra etc . if the compani did not use advertis to manipul their costum , the would have much less profit then they current have . sometim it is veri use to hire popular star , such as model or musici . one exampl for that would be the advertis of mc donald 's in germani . here , the supermodel heidi klum goe to mc donal 's and order a menu with chip and a salad . she even bite a bit off one chip to demonstr that it is complet okay to eat at thi restaur . but they do not show is that she never swallow the chip . anoth exampl is the advertis of deichmann shoe in german tv : in thi littl film you see the intern celabr so-cal pussi cat doll dress in their usual style of cloth and walk on a stage , pretend to be perform . they all wear the latest shoe that one can find in the name shoe store . and even if they look realli fashion , thi doe not chang the fact that these shoe are highli uncomfort and of a veri low qualiti . but thi fact is not veri import to the girl who admir thi group and who now seem to see a possibl to be like their idol . summar , i am of the opinon that advertis present a product as someth which it is not in order to make sure that the consum will buy their product . i think that one should have a critic attitud on advertis in gener and to creat one
