i agre with the follow statement . that is to say , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have three reason to show thi . first , a tour guid ( or it mayb a tour compani ) will make plan about travel . when should we leav home ? where should we go and how long we should stay there ? what place should we see ? etc . .. i am reluct to make plan of travel , but i like travel becaus i can see mani build which i have not yet visit and mani peopl who i have not yet met . so it is veri happi for me to have a tour guid make plan . second , if we travel with a tour guid know a lot of thing about the cite , i can learn a plenti of knowledg from him / her . i live in japan , and there is a lot of place to visit . sever world heritag make my mind feel good . a tour guid may explain the tradit valu of that cite , and we may know much about it . third , use packag tour , safeti will be save . i heard that one of my friend travel abroad alon and encount a lot of troubl . he lost hi passport , and he had to stay there more than he would expect befor . if he had gone there with a tour guid , he would n't have experienc such a event . if we use packag tour , insur to deal with thi sad event can go well . therefor , i agre the idea of `` the best way to trabel is in a group led by a tour guid '' .
