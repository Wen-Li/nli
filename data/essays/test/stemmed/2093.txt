human life ha differnt stage . student life is one of the stage in the human life . we can know about more thing in thi stage . we can experi major incid at thi stage onli . the student life includ studi , understand the fact and understand the idea and concept . i strongli disagre with the statement that state `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . a fact is true statement . student should learn about fact . i learn about so mani fact . firstli i learn about earth rotat around the sun , thi is a fact . by learn about thi fact i got some doubt in mind that how much time it will take to complet full rotat ? and also i learn mani thing by thi fact , for exampl how day and night are come ? and lot more . secondli i learn about a fact that `` energi is neither destroy nor creat . energi can convert into differ form '' . by know thi fact i came to knew that how thermal energi is convert into electr energi and how mechan energi can convert into kinet energi . i learn these piont by observ electr and variou machin those are underwork . thi is the fact that thought me how to learn . thirdli i know the fact `` light is one form of energi that can exibit sever properti '' . by know thi fact i thought in such a way that what are the properti of light and what happen if light is project on some reflect object . i can get the properti of the reflect materi by studi about fact on light . i can know about opequ natur of light too . in conclus although student must understand idea and concept , the student must have learn the fact becaus fact teach us how the fact is effect real world , weather in posit way or in neg way . i strongli believ that student should learn about fact .
