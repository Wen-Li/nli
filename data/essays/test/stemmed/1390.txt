i think that it is imprtant for student ti undarstand idea and concept than it is for them learn fact . nowaday student are said that they ca n't think logic , and ca n't use knowledg what learn even in elamentari school . whi to understand is imoprt ? if the peopl who doe n't understand idea , they ca n't use that idea in ani situat . i mean , if pepol who do n't know tha idea abou number , he ca n't count even . peopl who got the idea can use the idea at least hi life . on the other hand , the fact are just one thing . if studen learn one fact , they will just memor it . it ca n't be conect the other fact . becaus they do n't know that how should use it . when i wa in elementari sholl , i learn idea about how shoud i use tool in household class . so i can handl the idea and concept on my life . cook skill is realli use for me . in conclus , to understnd the ani area 's the idea and concept is useful for everyon in whole life . so , i think more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact
