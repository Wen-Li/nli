i strongli believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for the follow reason . first , advertis onli emphasis on the merit of product . when i wa in a junior in tokyo univers , a famou univers in japan , i bought a comput . the advertis of the comput claim that the specif of thi machin wa so high that ani applic softwar could work effici and the price is veri cheap . i wa veri satisfi with buy such a good machin with low price . howev , when i got back to my home , i found that ani applic softwar did not be instal . i must buy applic softwar in addit and it cost 2000 dollar . if the advertis had claim not onli their merit but also their defect , i could have save my money . thi exampl clearli show that advertis onli claim product ' merit . second , the cost of advertis is often more expens than the cost of product . when i work in a cosmet compani , i wa in charg of the product promot . the origin cost of the product wa onli 2 dollar . howev , the cost of the advertis wa 3 dollar a product . without advertis , we could not compet with other compani ' product . therefor , we invest much money on advertis to make our product seem much better than they realli were . as the abov exampl clearli show that advertis often cost much higher than the cost of product . thu , i definit believ that product are seem to be more better than they realli are with advertis .
