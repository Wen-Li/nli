nowday , more and more peopl will go travel dure their holiday . some of them will travel in a group by a guid . other will travel alon or onli with their friend . and in my opinion , travel with a tour guid mayb my first choic . among variou advantag that travel with a guid are comfort and conveni . becaus the tour guid often own lot of knowledg about the travel , if you travel with them , comfort is obviou . for instanc , when you want to travel in a foreign countri , the languag barrier is the most improt problem for you . i ca n't learn the whole languag in the world . but at thi time , if a tour guid is with you , the problem will solv easili . most of them have strong abil to use foregin languag . you can commun with local peopl through the guid 's translat . and you also do n't worri about you will cheat by the local peopl . becaus the guid often have respons to prevent their travel 's member cheat when they travel . and all of these will make you comfort . equal import advantag is it is veri conveni with a guid . first , the guid will book the room when you travel in some place of interest . you do n't worri about you ca n't live near the place which you will travel . sometim you ca n't find ani hotel to live in some famou place . and guid will solv the problem for you . futhermor , the guid will make a veri good plan for the travel and you can learn lot of inform by them . after the guid 's explaint , the understand of cultur , custom and histroy will increas greatli . and you do n't bring a veri heavi book which is introduc the place ' interest . and you will feel the trave is a veri conveni thing . and in fact , if you travel alon and do n't with a guid , you may feel freedom . you can go ani place that you want to go and get up at ani time that you want . in my opinion , everyon ha differ choic for the way to travel . if you like travel veri much and want to be more freedom , travel alon is good , but on the other hand , if you want to travel easili and comfort , let a tour guid with you is better .
