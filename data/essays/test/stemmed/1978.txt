i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my countri have good proverb for thi statement . that is `` peopl without challeng can not be success their life . '' i think thi is good proverb for explan my opinion . challeng alway come with some risk . after challeng , howev , person who do thi can get success . veri famou guy who is owner of appl campani is good exampl for thi statement . i think he ha enough money for spend hi whole life and he is alreadi in high posit in the societi and in the compani , but he everytim tri to make new thing and develop new sofewar . i think he doe not need to make a risk by himself , he dose not need to challeng for some new thing . without make new product and new softwar , he can spend money as he usual use and live well as befor . but he is challeng . he is make new product and sofrwar . thi is the key whi he ha so much money and ha world best seller product which is i pod . the success key in hi life is challeng , even the challeng ha risk . we can find one same thing from the success peopl . that is their challeng stori . they are do or did someth in their life , although their are some risk . it mean without risk peopl can not success in their life .
