there are sever way to becom successful . some peopl are alway do new thing other onli do what they know how to do well . in the text it is state that successful peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know . in my oppinion that is wrong . i think that if someon is successful he is do someth in which he is reali good . i want to point out sever exampl for that . if someon want to becom a successful soccerplay he need a lot of practic . onli if he learn certain abil he is abl to succeed in a compitit . it is not possibl for him to tri out sever new way of life becaus if he would do so he lack time he need for hi train . in all field of competit peopl need to have special qualiti which can onli be gain by stick to a certain goal . the second exampl is a great musician . a pianist need to start learn hi instrument while be a child . furthermor he ha to keep on go with play to becom better . if he would quit in order to do someth els he wouldn t be as good as if he ha kept on practac . what i tri to say is even if you know someth veri well you can becom better . and to becom successful you have to be perfect in what you are do . anoth reason whi i disagre with the statement is that peopl who stay in their fiel of compet get to know other peopl who can help each other . for exampl a if narrat talk to anoth it might rais hi creativ . the conclus can be made that know how to do someth perfect lead to success .
