the abov statement is complet true . advertis do make most product seem better than they are ; but what els do you expect ? advertis are made by compani to promot their product and convinc the consum to purchas them . if thi mean they have to bend the truth here and there , they do not hesit to do so . a prime exampl of thi is a commerci i recal from when i wa young . i wa watch tv one day when all of a sudden i saw the strongest man in the univers and my person hero , superman ; fli thorugh the air in hi signatur red and blue attir save the world . but what wa thi ? .. superman wa actual be beaten by an evil monster ! .. he wa ont he verg of death when he remov thi energi bar from hi pocket and take a bite of it . instantli re-energ he beat the monster to a bloodi pulp and save the world yet again from the claw of evil . on se that 1 minut commerci , i went into a frenzi ; i had to get that energi bar immedi . it had save the life of my life-long hero . i rush out to the nearest groceri shop , onli to find it fill with kid my age all there for that energi bar . when i final got my hand on it , i found that it wa no differ from everi other candi bar i had eaten . i wa angri at the time about thi incid but now that i look back at it , it wa not the compani 's fault ; but my own for believ everyth that came on tv . that is how advertis work ; they make peopl buy the item ; that is what they are meant to do , and now that one think about it , that advertis must have been one of the best ever made !
