i agre that advertis make product seem better than they are . usual the compani use advertis befor they releas the product into the market to introduc the product into the public and the public get attract to the new product and feel that the new product could do better than older one . but in mani of the case thi estim could be wrong . advertis indic 100 % result of the product . where as when they are realli use probabl the result could not be upto the expect . and there are mani exampl for thi which includ fair cream , slim centr and mani more . the advertis of fair cream is best exampl for my opinion . in these advertis the product when use complet chanc the complext of the person who is use it andthi realli doesnt happen . also the slim capsul or centr do not show the drastic chang when realli use . their are mani exampl for which advertis make the product seem better than they appear . henc advertis is one of the way for the compani to increas the profit of the product . in some case advertis cheat public by not show the best result as shown in it . advertis onli make profit to the compani but in no way to the public . accord my opinion advertis are no where good for the compani to spend huge amount of money on them . so they are just an adit expenditur for the compani . if advertis realli make profit to the compani it specifi that the public have cheat becaus no product give the result shown in the advertis . the product usual doe contain the qualiti shown or display in the advertis . adveris just make the street and news paper colour but nothelp in ani other manner to increas the profit . so accord to me compani shouldnt wast thier money and time on advertis .
