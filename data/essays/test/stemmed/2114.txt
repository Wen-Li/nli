i disagre with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a proup led by a tour guid for the three reason . first , travel in a group with the guid does'nt provid us much look . my famili often travel dure the vacat . we visit east europ last summer vacat , and we went in a group led by a tour guid . my parent and i want to see more thing than just go around well known place . we want to feel the cultur of the other countri . we want to do shop in the market which wa locat in the side of the road , and we also want to take a look of small shop and peopl ' life , but we had to move quickli to the next place where guid ask to us to go . it would be the better trip if we could walk around the alien countri street , i think . second , you can not get enough time when you move in a group . look all the thing that you want need planti of time . each person 's interest is differ , and there is a situat that someon want to spend more time in particular place , but the other one doe n't . when you travel alon , you do n't have to worri with thi kind of problem . you can take time enjoy the travel in the place where you want to be . final , you ca n't feel the real life of the place by just look the great sight of the import build of someth . sometim you can see more fantast thing without the map . but with the tour guid ? you can just visit famou place and build or sight , not the life of the countri or citi or whatev . if you are scare to go trip alon , and that 's the reason whi you went it in a group led by a tour guid , just bring it on . you sure can enjoy your trip feel the alien cultur with more time and look .
