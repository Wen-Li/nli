`` will we still be use car in twenti year from now ? '' . even with the rate of devolp in the field of sicns it hard to beliv that there will not be ani car in fifti year from thi day . mayb we can say that there will be fewer car in use at that time but to say that it will not exicst is onli a blind hope . there might be a deffrint kind of way of transport mayb like flying-vehicl or fli bycecl or somth we can not even imagen . what i beliv is that the mind of humen reach anoth level of think everi dozen of year becaus it found out a lot of thing that wa not avil at the past so it begin to creat a new way of think and sort thing that wa inspair from those invent . so if nowaday we have car we will sure will have less car by twenenti year from now or even ten year from now . these day we have a lot of way to cut down the number of traffic and car by buld railway for travel great distanc , for the peopl who can not affor to buy a plan tiecket which will cut down the traffic in the highway and to decreas the rate of the daili accsid in them . the perfect solut for the citi traffic would be to bulid a network of subway around the citi to provid it 's serivec to the whole puplic which in a lot of way more help then have a car , becaus i will not be burden by the cost of mainten or by the park spot that i got to park it in. most peopl doe not hav eani need in have a car but for the lake of anoth way of transportaion they find themselv fors to buy one . all that is onli the half of what there is to say but in my opinoin i surrund to the voic in my head that is tell me that there will be less car twenti year fronm now .
