car are importhat in life especi at work whether it novat or use . everi year new develop occur for instanc car , train , and helicopt . i certainli agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . ther are two reason that support the idea below . firstli , everi year new tecnolog develop appear that mean car sold are increas day by a day and no more use car are avail for sale inasmucha peopl feel exicit to look for a new car rather than old , cheap and use . what attract peopl the most after mani year are the name of the car , it 's color , and it 's size whether big or small that make a sens as a whole . secondli , use car may have problem that make mani peopl to refus buy it . for exampl the ga may not fix unless it 's taken to the car station ; therefor the person will spend more money to fix the ga problem rather than have a new car clean and well organ from outsid and insid and not pay so much money if a problem appear . that 's whi after mani year there will be fewer car in use and new car will be sold . in conclus , new car are more benefici and valuabl than use car . what i have shown below is veri essenti for now and and next year . at least new car are warrant for some year and that lower the percentag of pay money on the car . without a doubt i agre that use car will be less avail in sold .
