i beleiv that lear fact and understand concept & idea are correl , and all are import for student to learn . howev , thi import might vari among the differr level of studi . for exampl , while teach student in the veri earli year of school , studi should concentr more in teach fact , besid basic concept that would be easi for student to understand . on the other hand , for higher level of class , idea and concept should be studi more , sinc student ' mind will be more abl to analyz and understand the differr concept and idea . concept and idea are use to of analyz fact ; their reason , their viabil , develop of fact . . etc . basic , it 's too import for student to understand caus and reason of fact , but they should be fulli understand what is the fact all about . teach fact should be prior of teach concept . for exampl , it is import to teach student about graviti and emphas that they are fuli awar about it , then they should studi the concept of graviti law which wa made by newton . if studi wa onli concentr in teach concept and idea without illustr the fact , student will feel that they are lost . it is also to be notic that mani concept and idea can be avail for one certain fact . therefor , studi should start with illustr the fact , and then teach the variou concept and idea on it . it is too import for student to be awar of all concept and idea , to understand the principl & purpos of each . student will get a brilliant idea on how to think and analyz by studi the differr concept . thi will make their mind to work more and will help them to manag and organ their analysi in case they face in their futur . as a conclus , studi fact is too import to clarifi it to student , and teach concept & idea is also too import for mani major reason .
