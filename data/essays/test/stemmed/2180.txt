i agre with the statement . there are lot of advertis which mainli purpos of creat an illus on the eye . most of the advertis aim to creat a world of alic for everyon . i think there are three reason of that problem . first , the compani want to get all the effort spent on the item in kind of bulk of revenu immedi , in ani way possibl on profession life . thi is somehow about ethic . howev and unfortun , firm oper in a basic manner : ` to get the maximum profit` . after all the effort have been spent on a product befor come to shelv of store , the firm are at a no-way point . they start to think that they should make their product appear in a more shini way . thi is onli reachabl when you show some extra thing on your product , which may be total useless or though which may doe not exist . second , advertis profession are paid for that . they should say some fantast thing to crate an illus on the eye of custom in order to attract them . if they onli refer to normal specif of the item , they will not attract the custom , basicli . so the mad-men , how the adverties profession call in late of 50 's in usa , should find some extra thing other than normal peopl can see or can util . thi ha been a ethic problem sinc the industri day start . third , peopl tend to buy product which is total differ , fantast and specul . thi is the trend grow among all of the societi . therefor , the counter trend grow in advertis industri is not quit surpris . i think the solut lie on the qualiti of the educ . peopl must understand that they have to get what they paid for . thi will be onli be possibl if enough awar inject in the brain of young gener .
