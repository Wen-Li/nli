i disagre with the statement that it is more import for student to understatnd idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for the follow reason . for the first , it is necessari for the student to learn the fact to feel wonder and interestrd in the subject . when i wa a juninor high school student , i had mani experi in the chemic class . at first , i wa just surpris to find the each chemic reaction , like chnagin the color or make fiber from the liquid , becasu they were hardli seen in the daili life . after i had experi , i wa veri interest in the reason and learn them in the text book as what kind of the concept were . also , in the mathemat class , my teacher taught us mani fact and suggest the idea to lead the mathemat rule . instead of just teach the idea ot concept , i wa veri interest in the subject throught the fact in the experi , i could enjoy stude at the class and read the relat articl by myself . secondli , it is importnat for the student to think about whi and look for the answer by themselv . threfor , learn the fact will enabl student to feel wonder and interest in the subject . also , it enabel the student to think themselv . therefor , for the reason mention abov , i certainli disagre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
