the main issu of advertis , in my opinion , is two-fold . on one side there are the econom interest of the compani which is sell a specif product , on the other there are the interest of the consum which are to be grant . it result clear that a compani , in order to surviv within the market , ha to sell the grater possibl amount of it product . mani are the instrument that can be refer to , although the major one , and the more strictli link to the topic of thi essay , appear to be market . thi econom tool ha it main focu on how to improv sale by take into account consum prefer , the impact of the imag of the product , the price and so on . all of these factor must be consid and contribut to the creation of an advertis . it can be easili infer that an advertis will concentr more on the benefit that the product confer to the buyer , without draw too much attent to it drawback . that is whi , to me , advertis make product much more appeal than they realli are . there are some limit though . dure the past , the field of advertis wa a kind of a free zone , with no rule that regul it market . in modern day , instead , a grow awar of the risk of a mislead advertis ha trigger a counter-react which the naissanc of author that defend custom ' right is the result of . the behaviour of a compani is now strictli observ by such author which have , also , the right to impos precis standard requir for an adverties . all the detail of the product must be easili comprehend by the buyer . for exampl , follow a resolut by the european union , a product which doe not contain cocoa butter , can still be defin as chocol . the produc is to specifi , though , the ingredi enabl , in such way , the consum to evalu properli which kind of product he/sh is about to buy .
