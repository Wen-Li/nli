peopl who have choos to special in one specif academ subject think that generalist peopl are superfici and that their knowledg is just an illus . personli i do not agre with that idea . i am convinc that it is much better to have a larg academ knowledg than to be special for sever reson : generalist are open-mind , they will have no problem to find a job and to adapt to unexpectd situat . to begin with , i think it is better to interest in sever differ subject becaus it prrove that you are curiou and abov all open-mind . it is more pleasant to have a convers with a peopl who know few thing about a lot of subject than with a peopl who know a lot but onli about one topic . peopl who are special are often bore becaus they think they can not afford to talk about a subject they do n't know abo , so they are often not veri talk . then , the point is that it will certainli be easier for generalist peopl to find a job than for special peopl . employ expect more and more for job applic to be polyval . as an execut for exampl , you will be expect to control a lot of veri differ busi topic like account , market , manag skill , human resourc . .. final , it is realli better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it make you deal with differ way to see the world soon as you are a student . i mean that you will be far more flexibl than your special collegu and it is real additionn valu nowaday . the global world we are live in is instabl and the student must be awar of the fact that they probabl would have to chang job server time dure their work life . therefor , it ha becom necessari to be open-mind and flexibl . to conclud , i would say that have a broad knowledg in differ topic is worth it for personn and profession reason .
