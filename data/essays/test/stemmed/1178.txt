i agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use then there are today . the first argument for the support of statement is veri obviou . everybodi is awar of the present oil crisi . due to the deplet of the major oil field the cost of oil is rise at an ever increas rate . and there is no reason to believ whi thi trend should not continu . in a few year time access to petrol and diesel will be limit for onli the elit . and present , the technolog for drivivg car is base on the petrol and diesel engin . so if there is no oil , there would be no car . after some time onli the rich will have the priviledg of drive a car . car would soon be object of museum . of cours one may argu that by 20 year , technolog would have advanc and there would be no need for car to run on oil . we would have car which run on solar power . ye , technolog would have sure advanc a great deal by then . but if the tecnolog will advanc to an extent where we 'll have solar car , we can also argu that by then man would have produc solar plane which will be within reach of common man . and obvious solar plane will have mani distinct advantag over car . first , it will be a lot faster annd safer . it will also solv the traffic congest problem due to the avail of vast open sky . moreov it will aslo help to lessen the great problem of availa of space due to the popul explot . obvious , the vast amount of space use up for construct of road can be use for other purpos . therefor , if you believ that technolog will not develop then also we will see fewer car on road , and if you believ that technolog would advanc , then also we will see fewer car on roard .
