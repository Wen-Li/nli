sometim my friend from univeristi and me do have a discuss about the best way of learn . a frequent mention topic is the question if it is more import for a student to understand the gener idea and concept than it is for them to simpli learn fact . on view on thi topic is , that a student is onli abl to talk and think about a certain subject if he ha the necessari backgroung knowledg , which consist of basic fact . to give an exampl i could mention the histor topic of the second world war . how would a person talk about thi topic , if he lack complet the most import fact like who wa involv in the war , when it start , when it end . .. therefor one could argu that student first have to be taught about the basic detail of the subject they studi , befor they can go on and studi about the main idea and concept behind thi subject . anoth view on thi express rather the need of a student to understand the theoret concept and idea of hi field of studi becaus thi will provid him with an overal understand of the topic . in addit he will have a deeper understand of the whole subject , which he can later perfection by reduc hi lack of factual knowledg . the knowledg of the concept will also make him abl to analyz and calssifi new topic more easili , becaus he know the mechan and role of the overal subject and he know which detail have to be obeserv more care . a short look on student of polit scienc can contribut to thi point of view : polit scienc student first learn to classifi a polit system by learn about the most import element of polit system and the differ structur these system can have . after know about these differ stuctur a student is abl to analyz and categor everi singl polit system in the world even though he doe n't know the detail and all the fact about it . i person think that everybodi should get a adequ knowledg with the main fact of mani differ field in school so that he will be abl to first start hi studi by learn about the concept and idea behind a ceratin area and not ba learn fact . fact can later alway be ad by
