there is a debat on whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . some peopl say that learn fact is basic step of process such as studi . howev , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . first , if student understand anyth , student natur would know fact . second , learn fact is limit that fact is not absolut and changebl . i will explain these reason in detail . first , if student understand anyth , student natur would know fact . in gener , student is not understood the fact and they are not memor concept and not solv the problem . let me take my experi for exampl . when i wa first year of univers , i wa a member of club which is studi comput structur . natur , i understood comput idea and concept . my senior alway said `` do understand . '' so , i took the class of comput structur , i did not a lot of studi but my grade wa a+. for these reason , i think that understand idea and concept is veri import . second , learn fact is limit that fact is not absolut and changebl . the recent survey show that compar class of understand idea with class of learn fact . the 74 % of women and 85 % of men prefer understand class . after take the class , content of class is chang and take the class , again . result of second survey is chang . both of them , around 90 % , prefer to understand class than learn fact . thi is becaus peopl who take the understand concept and idea class not hesit fact . but , learn fact as a result , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for these reason . first , if student understand anyth , student natur would know fact . second , learn fact is limit that fact is not absolut and changebl .
