some peopl say that learn fact is more import than understatnd idea and concept . howev , it is more imporat to understand idea and concept . truli , student need to learn the basic fact . but there are more importatnt reason to understand the idea . first , they are more likli better understand what the text book say . second , it is help for student to organ and remerb what they stui . first of all , by understandind the idea student can appli that idea on other field . and it will make student better understand not onli their field but also other area . let me take my experi for exampl . when i wa in a first year of the univers , i took two elctiv cous . one wa art and philosophi and the other wa custom inth contemporari scieti . in the former class there are a lot of reqiur to undersandig the idea . at first it wa calleng but in the end i got valuabl inform . next , when student just learn about fact , they cram right befr the test . and after the exam they about what they studi . but understand idea take much longer time to understand . and that would be offer more chanc to think and imagin in variou manner . as a result , they can remeb well what tey stui . accord to recent studi releas by korean nation reserch center nineti percent of of survay student reveal much more high grade than thoe who just learn fact . thi show that understan idea is far more import .
