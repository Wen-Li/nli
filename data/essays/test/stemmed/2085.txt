in daili life , societi is divid on major issu involv konw the fact or the concept . as what ha been come up with , when you have been brought into the problem focu that which is more import between the concept and the fact . what is your opinion and what is your standpoint ? with all aspect taken into account , i disagre the statement that understand idea and concept is more essenti than learn fact . my reason are as follow . to begin with , an old say that acion speak louder than word , that mean fact in activ is much more import than think of concept on paper . give a specfic exampl for thi point , if student onli learn the concept of ice , which is a special stage of water when the tempertar below the zero , howev , they can not imag what is the shape and color of the ice , in other word , in their brain do not a specif form of the ice . so , fact is an indispens part of our studi , particularli in the scienc studi , thi is the reason whi we have the lab experi . for exampl , when we learn a new concept of work in physics , we know there are two major condit of work : energi and movement for a distanc . but , know thi is not satsifi , for we must get the fact of how work happen , and what can make energi , which is much more use than have the concept of work . anoth reason cn be seen by everyon is that learn fact is more use than have the idea in the daili life . as we know , in our life , we must maintain differ skill for live , such as cook , drive . i onc exper a real about my classmat in the high school . everi day , she read a cook book for a long time , becaus she want to cook delicu food for us when the new year come . in the end , she could not cook a meal , becaus she even though did not know what wa sugar or salt . thi is a good exampl in our life , for mani time we can the idea about one thing but we connot do becaus we do not get the fact of it . actual , we often ignor the import of the fact . everi coin ha two side . some peopl claim the concept of an object is quit essenti , becaus it ont onlycan provid a idea of one thing , but also can indic us to perform action . howev , as for me , when we get the right fact of one thing , then we can take action , otherwis it should be fail . from what i have discuss abov we can attain that learn fact is more import than have concept , becaus it make much sens in our life as a right indic , therefor i reinforc my standpoint as lear fact as my choic .
