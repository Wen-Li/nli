i must say that i agre with the statement . the student have to understand idea and concept when they studi someth . i have sever reason whi i agre with that . if you understand the idea and concept , you can expand your acknowleg , learn the true mean of the fact and memor longer . i will illustr about that in detail . first of all , you can expand your acknowleg if you understand idea and concept . for exampl , here is an word , ` outdoor ' . when i wa middl school , i just memor the mean of the fact . howev , if you understand the concept of each word. ` out ' and ` door ' , the word , ` out ' mean outsid of home and anoth word , ` door ' mean home or insid , you can expand the word outgo , outsid and someth like that . you just understand the each concept of word and then you can also understand other word that ha similar pattern . second , when you tri to understand idea and concept , you studi much more a lot . that will simpli be explain becaus just learn fact is easi . howev , it is realli hard to understand the insid mean of the fact . you have to look up the internet or book at the librari . that mean you should do researh more on that and also you can learn more . through the thi time , you can exactli know the fact . final , you can keep someth that you learn much longer in your brain . through do research on it , you may look the fact mani time and ponder on it . these thing make you think and last someth you learn . in conclus , i total agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . as i mention , the reason are that expand your knowleg , learn the true mean of the fact and keep the knowleg longer . i realli want student to studi and understand idea and concept when they studi . if you do that , i 'm sure you will be more logic person .
