tour guid provid a good organ and inform to the person ( or group ) that is travel , but it also ha it disadvantag . one is that a tour guid limit the option of place to visit to those that he/sh think are more import for the tourist to visit . it also limit the ammount of time that the individu ( or group ) can spend on a certain activ or place . i believ that if the group plan the travel it will be better . in term of the organ , i think that the group have more flexibl for variou reason . first of all , the schedul will suit the group desir in term of which place to visit and how much time to spend in each activ ( or place ) . for exampl , if a group is visit puerto rico , the group can decid wheather spend more time in the nation rainforest el yunqu or in the histor fort el morro . or the group can also decid not to go to ani of those place and spent the whole trip period in the beach . secondli , if the group plan it own trip , it can be less expens . the group will not have to pay to the tour guid . also , it will be abl to decid which place and which day of the week is less expens or econom favor to the whole group . rel simpl thing , such as where to eat or which ground transport to use , are factor that affect the total cost of the trip . if the group plan ahead of time , they also can adquir the inform resourc of the tour guid . in the present , there are mani book for travel . these book provid map and histor fact of the place , provid the travel ( in thi case , a group ) a good deal of cultur , demograph , and histor inform . so , in the present there is no need of have a tour guid if the group plan effect . and most importantli , i think it will be more fun .
