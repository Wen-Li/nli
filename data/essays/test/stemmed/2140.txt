i do believ that is far more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i studi psycholog and in thi field it is crucial to pursu undersatand about the concept and idea . if you do learn the fact but then outsid of the calssroom you are unabl to appli the concept and idea to the realiti you face , your capabl for act and modifi a problem or difficult siatuat will be realli limit . if all a student had to do wa learn fact , then no import chang or new discoveri will be possibl becaus he will be care about the veri basic onli . i know person that have pile up through their live , all sort of fact , they know everi singl of them over a specif topic . still , when you give them a scenario that wa not includ in the fact they learn , the might be unabl to conduct themselv on it . thi wil be rather opposit for a person that domin the concept and main idea , she would not have as much troubl becaus all she will need is to learn some of the fact and then she will be abl to make her own conclus and real understand would be achiev . mani peopl at field sucha as medicin or scienc , believ that leran the fact will allow them to succeed on what they are do . sadli for them thi is all wrong . for exampl , if a patient is die and the medicin student learn about how essenti it is to mantain the vital at certain level , but he doe not understood how thi fact should be integr along with the concept and main idea about thi topic , simpli he will have quit a hard time as he will know the patient will die and he can not stop it . our world and our thoght are made up of idea and concept , those are the basic compon which late guid us to fact . i beliv that is essenti to gain a domain over both learn the fact and understand the idea and concept . for contruct valuabl knowledg you will need to master both . the fact are import as well and you have to know them , still it is true that the fact by themselv will not lead to a deep and profund comprehens . in our psycholog depart there is an import statement ; `` psycholog not to interpret , but to transform '' . understand the concept and idea will enabl you to do so at ani given situat .
