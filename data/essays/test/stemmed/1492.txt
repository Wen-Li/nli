i do n't think i will choos the way travel in a group led by a tour guid . i perfer to go out with my friend accord to our own travel plan . i have at least two reason to reject group tour . first , i do n't like to follow the tour compani 's arreng . sinc no compani will run their busi without the intens of make profit , the arrang of tour compani offten tend to be tight . thu , the custom ha to travel for one place to anoth without stay longer at certain beati scene and take deep breath where the air is so fresh . if i travel with my freid , we can stop anywher , like the sea side , just enjoy the sun shine and the breez . by thi way we can find the true mean of travel itself , to lose our pressur in daili work and routin life and gain refresh . second , if we travel in a group led by a tour guid , there must be a lot of chanc to go shop someth we have no interest at all . becaus the guid will constantli recom to the group what are realli worth shop in that area . and , when some custom were persuad to go , we have no other choic but to follow them . i think it 's wast of time to shop those bore thing . all in all , i like to have my trip arrang by myself . of cour it 's also not bad to consult wth some friend . but i have to say that the perfect situat is that you happen to have good freid in the place you go to visit .
