in today , peopl are look too much the outer than the inner side . an ugli girl can be shown as one of the most beati girl by some makeup . the advertis are same as the make up use in the girl , it is not understood until it is clear or tast by some way . although some peopl can believ that most advertis are trusthworthi , show their product as they are , i disagre with that . i maintain that it is onli a finger in the hand in amount becaus of the competit between produc and social result . first of all , there is alway competit between the produc . in order to take a big slice in the correspond area , they should advertis them as if they are the best in their field . they need a better slogan , if you are in front of a tv and zap the channel , you can easili see that all firm claim that they produc the most power product , no one mention about the minus they have . the side affect of the product are not mention also . secondli , i wa confront too mani feed back in internet . the consum are applyin to the consum right . such as that she bought the hair cleaner becaus it protect the hair but her hair becom more unhealthi buy use . the ad are not correct . as a result , the advertis are not show how they are , in stead they act as how the consum expect from them .
