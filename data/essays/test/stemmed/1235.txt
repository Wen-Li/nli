it is not easi to say simpli that if travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way or not . becaus there are truli some advantag to travel in a group led by a tour guid , but person speak , i like to travel by myself . first , i am the kind of man who like to challeng themselv . so i want to someth with risk . if i go for a trip in a group with a guid , it will lost the chanc to enjoy the ventur . for exampl , as you know great wall is veri famou in china which is locat in the northern moutain part of beij citi . same part have been reconstruct by modern peopl just for the tour . for the safeti , all of the guid will show you to these part if you are in a tour group . but if you want to see the real ancient arcitectur of the great wall , you have to go alon to the danger part of the great wall which keep the old structur . it mustl be more interest . second , it will be cheaper by travel alon . mani guid will take you to some shop which have some secret econom relationship between them to encourag you to busi some gift . final , the shop owner will share the profit with guid . i quit do n't like thi , more exactlli speak , i hate thi behavior . i wa ever cheat by some bad guid , so from then i decied never to go with a guid again . in conclus , i think to travel in a group led by a tour guid may be a good choic for most peopl , becaus it safe and conveniet , but total is not the best way for me . i aslo suggest other : just to fli by yourself , you will see the real blue sky !
