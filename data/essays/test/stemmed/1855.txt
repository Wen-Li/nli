is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif topic ? well , as a matter of fact , it is . onc you have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject the way you think chang your idea open up . instead of be close mind and choos one topic , you can forc yourself to learn , then you will be a person of a wider span of knowledg . you look at life differ with mani other subject , it help you analyz thing differ . let say for exampl you didnt realli like math , but you learn it becaus thi subject help you think in differ way as you get older , it help you analyz problem and find solut . let say now for biolog . you studi thi subject you will be more awar of sick and you will at least have minor knowledg on thi subject which can help you until you get profession help . i think that all most subject should be studi in school , so you can have the basic of the knowledg in order to live your life in a balanc way instead of have knowledg of onli on topic , becaus unless your life evolv around it , it will not help whatsoev it will becom complet meaningless in all the other topic , yet it will help you alot on your main object , but life doe not load it self on that specif goal . i conclud that great knowledg for one purpos is not as use as minor knowleg for mani academ refer , also you can have someth to major in .
