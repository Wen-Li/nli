i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my opinion , peopl do feel bore by do the same thing what they alreay know . i alway tri to learn to do new thing and divert my knowledg in differ thing to improv my knowledg . for exampl scientist , alway tri to do new thing and implement new thougt to find out some thing new to thi world . i realli like their hard word and dure these process they also face mani risk but they wont give up their work and finallli they will acheiv their goal . if peopl go to scare becaus of the risk and if they follow the same thing that they alreadi know then they would not go ahead in their live . we have to think a bit forward in thi compet world and we have to prove our self , for thi we have to do some thing new without scare for the risk . at present we are in a success world and we are enjoy thi one becaus of mani peopl hard work . mani scientist and mani politian do their best and introduc mani thing and pollici which were help us to live comfort . after learn one thing perfectli peopl have to learn new thing without satisfi with the singl thing , then onli we can abl to elabor our knowledg in differ kind of field . final i conclud that peopl , in ani field have to learn the process of explor new thing without satisfi with their exist knowledg , and in hi process they could also face mani difficult situat , mani risk but they dont have to stop their work and final they must achiev their goal and becom success peopl .
