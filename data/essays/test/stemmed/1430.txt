learn knowledg ha two step of studi process - understand the idea and concept , and then learn fact . i disagre with the statement that to understand idea and concept is more import for our student than to learn fact . i think that they are both import in our learn field , such as scienc , art , phylosophi and so forth . the first step of studi is to understand idea and concept which includ the sagasi of our human be . when you are read a technolog textbook , for exampl , what you want to pursu ? what you want to get from the book , in main point , is that you want to know the principl and mechan of technolog in the book . in other word , you want to understand the idea and concept show in the materi . moreov , you want to , in some case , get the idea and concept and then use them to address or figur out the problem you face in ani field . after understand the idea and concept , you exploit to learn the fact includ in them . just understand them is not enough while you learn them . anoth aspect is that you should to learn the fact . how to and what to learn fact are the main domain in learn the fact . becaus of understand the idea and concept , you have to appli those to real world , object , and subject and so forth . though appli the knowledg you have studi , you can learn what the fact are , and also , you can revis the idea and concept which are of fault and foibl . then , you have learn the fact present in the idea and concept . in sum , we can not separ the two step of studi process . we can not decid which of the step is more import than the other . the one that we can confirm is that understand idea and concept beyond learn fact .
