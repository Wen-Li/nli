whether most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is difficult to evaluet . some peopl think that buy a particular product onli rele on it advertis it 's completli wrong but other peopl do n't think so and they trust in what advertis affirm . consequ if i ask someon if he/sh agre or not , the answer depend on differ factor such as the earlier experi . befor i decid i wuold like to consid both more close . first of all , when someon need to buy a new product he/sh should have consid the histori of the facori that have made it , in fact some facori are more valuabl than other . for exampl if i should have to buy a new car i restrict my choos onli on two or three noun of factori such as renault or merced , becaus they make me more sure of what i 'm go to buy . as a result advertis have onli a few part on my decis . on the other hand , advertis wa born in order to highlight the featur of a particular product especi posit one . furthermor it 's quit imposs they could suggest that the product wa wors than it real wa or they could affirm that it could have a neg aspect . howev advertis are veri import becaus they permit peopl to know when a new product is turn out ; besid they have the function to keep well inform all peopl about new procuct of usual interest . in brief in my opinion on one hand advertis are veri import and it 's just as well they exist but nevertheless , befor buy an object with particular featur that the advertis do n't mention , the most import thing to do is faconsid the factori 's product and which featur it have in detail , in order to avoid bad surpis when i have just bought the object .
