educ is the most import for the human be , becaus it take a lot of year to finish and you are get prepar to the life at thi period , nowaday , teacher of the new educ system teach their student that understand fact are more import than understand concept , howev , we can see that is not succes way to learn the issu . first of all , there is no type of student , who can understand the fact befor understand the idea , you can not requir the result , unless they have an opinion about the the concept , so that , you must teach the student main idea , thi will improv their knowledg and they can easili focu on fact , otherwis you can not requir them to learn detail . secondli , it is obviou that student can not creat solut and improv themselv on new idea and concept without the fact , it is essenti that the student learn the fact . thi debat will surviv for mani year becaus i think it depend on the student , some student can reach the idea from the fact , but some of them can not reach the idea from the fact , and we can see that idea and fact are combin to each other , you can not seper them , they are like a diffrent part of a same appl . in conclus , idea are the result of the fact , the fact mean noth onli with themselv , i think thi situat is not onli for student , thi is all about human be , teacher have to teach the idea deepli so they can find the answer for the fact .
