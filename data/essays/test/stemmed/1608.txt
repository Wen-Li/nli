i think peopl gener becom success when they tri new thing rather than oper on their current skill and inform . i quess it is basic depend on the economi principl that high risk bring high return . how doe the human can improv itself in the scope of think feel and live if they do n't take risk and tri new thing ? the answer of thi question seem to be clear for me . i believ that tri a new thing like enter a new busi , discov a new tool to do someth bring need inspir and it also bring inspir for other peopl to tri other thing . so even a person can not be sucees by try'ng a new thing , he \ she can be amodel for other peopl or a sourc of inspir to other entrepreneur . success init on the other hand give courag to new comer besid inspir . in short , peopl can improv and complet each other and can open new way for everi kind of develop by be'ng a first mover . from a soc'olog perspect , it is requir and beneficiari . if we look from an econom perspect , take initi , be the firt produc in a market bring enorm benefit in turn . becaus consum alway seek for better product ` in term of featur like speed , power and appear if we take an automobil as an exampl . produc have to invent new way or improv the way they use to creat better featur to differenti their good to attract more consum than their rival at the end . in today 's econom environ tri new thing is not an option but it is a must for brand and compani to surviv and flourish . henri ford and bill gate are two big exampl how tri new thing can bring success . it is complet valid for googl and e-bay case . we can observ in these exampl that higher the risk ( depend on how new the busi is ) the higher the return
