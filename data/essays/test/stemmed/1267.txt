the issu at hand is whether understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . it is a veri complic issu sinc most of the educ claim that via learn fact student can get the idea and concept relat to topic . i agre with the statement , sinc i believ that the main point of educ should be understand idea and concept in order to creat new idea rather than onli learn the fact and not to make student bore concern educ when they are constrain to learn lot of differ fact . firstli , i believ that idea are more import sinc when student learn the idea and concept initi thi will increas hi inspir about that subject . lot of scientist start their work onli by consid the idea not the fact found befor . and thi made them to be open to creat new idea . thi is becaus when a person know that quit number of peopl had work hard and could do noth he would be afraid of deal with that subject . for exampl , ramanujan who wa a veri famou mathematician start hi work about mathemat with a littl knowledg , but sinc he like the subject he work harder and harder and found lot of mani thing , and final reach to an astonish posit in mathemat histori . so by learn idea onli student can work effic . secondli , if the student do not have an interest in a particular area he do not want to learn fact about that subject and get bore and becam unsucces . as a result of thi he may lose hi interest in all other area . then he may stop work to anyth . thi situat is inevit sinc somebodi like one area while other like anoth . for instanc , einstein might have lost hi interest concern scienc when he becam unsucces in primari school becaus of some irrelev cours . to sum up , we can say that student should be made awar of firstli idea and concept then fact . sinc by teach fact firstli concern lot of differ area they can be made bore and can lose their interest .
