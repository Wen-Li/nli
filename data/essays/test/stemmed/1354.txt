advertis is the new industri rule our economi . the technolog advanc in the telecommun and media make the advertis avail to vast populatio , henc more effect . incred amount of money spent each and everi year to produc and publish advertis on newspap , televis , bilboard and so on . thi expans in the advertis industri is becaus it is understood by larg firm that how easi it is to chang the attitud or demand of the peolpl by use of color , interest slogan and pictur . unfortun , most of these color and entertain advertis are full of lie . first of all the effect of the product are exagr most of the time . we see on the tv that a deterg can wash away all kind of dirt and remnant with onli submerg the cloth in to the water . we get amaz by thi news , run to a super market , buy a packag of that deterg but eventu we are disappoint by the result stain on our cloth . we understand that it is no differ than other similiar deterg . ofcours , they are not . but the produc have to differanti their product somehow and make the custom choos their product rather than million of similiar product on the shelf of the supermarket . thi effort can be understand . in my opinion the custom have the respons to be awar of such possibl and be more conciou . on the other hand , the ingredi of the product are alter , too . thi is a much more import issu and veri danger for user . the effect can sometim be exagr but lie about the ingredi of a product can caus harm to user for exampl have alergi to certain food or product . final , legal restrict and strict rule must be appli about advertis by the govern to prevent the mislead inform about the product in media . the right of correct inform of the custom must be grant . in conclus , custom should be care about what they expect and what they will receiv while watch the advertis . they should be awar that noth in realiti would be as attract as on televis or magazin .
