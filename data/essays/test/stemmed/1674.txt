how to travel is controversi and complex issu . differ peopl have differ opinion about how to travel due their respect angl and exprienc . in one hand , mani peopl enjoy travel by themselv . on the other hand , mani peopl ibeliev to travel in a group led by a tour guid is best way . these two way both have their advantag . howev , as a old man , i prefer to travel in a group and think it is best way for old peopl . we should judg it on a case by case base . in the follow stament , i will provid my reason and evid to support the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in the first place , travel in a group is more conviniet . we all know befor we travel , we have to prepar a lot . we will search the relat inform from internet and book to know which are histor site and landmark of the citi we will visit ; we need book plane ticket , hotel . sometim , tourist also need to reserv the ticket of some veri hot view site . if you go aboard , you still need to deal with mani issu about visa . it requir a lot time and effort . i travel to maldiv in my honey moon last year . i spend almost a half month to find which island is best and arrang hotel , visa and transport . in the end , i onli spend seven day in maldiv while i spend much more time to prepar . it is a veri good case that demostr travel in a group led by a tour guid will help you to save a lot of effort . in the second place , travel in a group is also cheaper . becaus the huge demand from the travel agenc , the travel agenc alway have a good discount with mani hotel an airplan companis . the huge discount can gurante them to be profit even they offer you the more cheaper price on transpor and accomod . to travel in a group can realli help you save a lot money . last thing , i realli think travel in a group led by a tour guid is expeci benefici to the old peopl . for exampl , my parent are 60 year old . everytim , when they travel alon , i will be veri concern about their health . howev , if they travel in a group accompani with guid , i will feel much better becaus my parent can be taken care by the guid of the travel agent . there is no deni , sometim to travel along is also veri attract . but nowday , becaus there are more option and high qualiti travel servic , as far as i see , i will prefer to travel in a group .
