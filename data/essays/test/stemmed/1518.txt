in my opinion , the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' would n't be apt for all situat . becaus to tri out new thing one need to be dare enough , success or not doe n't count much . if tri out new thing wa reserv to peopl who were success , then in the first place there would be not even a singl person who would be elig to call themselv success . success come after tri new thing , and tri out new thing much rather depend on the person attitud rather than success , all these invent which are made till date are the result of a group of person tri out new thing over a period of time , it might not be a matter whether the peopl were success earlier or not . there are mani exampl to support the abov said statement , one of them be our own thoma alwa edison , who invent the bulb , befor discov the bulb , he had numer failur but all of those didnt stop him from tri out new thing and the result be we are not sit in dark anymor . and moreov success peopl dont necessarili tri new thing and take risk as they have the fear of lose it all , but wherea a person who ha noth to lose ha noth to fear about , and henc he would be readi to take more risk and tri out newer recip , if it work then it would be pen down in the success tip or otherwis are lost with the wind . there are mani success peopl who are afraid to take risk , for exampl a famou batsman in a game of cricket never goe for riski shot becaus if he is caught , it would tarnish hi reput and he would n't want that to happen . i would like to conclud base on the abov point that to take risk one need not be success , and most of the success peopl avoid take risk becaus they have a lot at stake if they fail .
