i tend to agre to the statement although i have doubt . of cours , when you think of great inventor or explor , they tri someth new and took their risk . but when you think again , what had gutenberg to loos when he invent the book print ? he wa success without take a huge risk . on the other side , christoph columbu took a great risk by land on a new world - without know that it is new . how would a map of today 's world look like if columbu and hi fellow explor did n't take the risk of get to know the unknown ? what contradict the statement are success peopl and compani that do n't take risk - and be success just becaus of that . mcdonald , for exampl , make the same burger everi day sinc about fourti year . thi compani doe n't experi with the tast of their product and so peopl know what they 'll tast when they buy a burger . that 's what make mcdonald success . peopl rather walk on path they alreadi know . sometim peopl are just not readi to adopt and so a great achiev can fail . for exampl the comput keyboard , as we know them , are not veri effici . there are way to sort the letter which would let peopl type faster . but no one would take the risk to chang that , becaus hi or her new keyboard would n't have a chanc , although it may be better than the one we know . what i want to say is that the realiti is more difficult than the statement pretend to be . not everi taken risk lead to success and sometim do it the common or known way ha more success than take a risk . in the end , i believ the most success peopl are those , who take risk , but know how much of a risk they can handl and know how much of a chang peopl can deal with .
