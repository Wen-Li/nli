i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than the realiti are. i have mani reason for that : first of all , what is wrettin in the labl of the product most like do n't mintion the disadvantag or side effect of the product , in the contrari we fine unaccurt inform about the compon 's qualiti , amout , tast . .. etc . the second thing that support my openion , like in the case of medicin or pesticid , we fine some word or inform that show the product as the magic solut for the dises or the pest , more and more they use some relig articl to support ther claim , for exampl , it is written in the labl of a particular pestci `` if water esist , then no need for tayamum '' which is a releg articl that impli that now need to use ani ather pestcid when thi pesticid is exsist the pictur which is use to be in the advertis or even in the labl of the oroiduct in maney way show the product in a non real show or at least not the same as the product is . i can say the produc use advertis to complet the miss valu of the product by the un realiti advertis
