it is disput whether it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or whether to special in one specif subject . both side do have their advantag and disadvantag , howev i think that special in one specif subject is better than accumul broad knowledg . thu i disagre with the statement . have a broad knowledg mean that one ha a lot of inform and educ cover a varieti of topic and that one is abl to talk and work about these variou subject . it allow to link variou subject to each other and henc discov relat between subject or even discov solut within other subject that are imposs to find when one special just on one subject . for exampl aircraft engin should have knowledg on how a bird fli and on how to convert thi inform into an actual airplan , so by not special on bird or just aircraft , engin found out how the bird is actual abl to fli and construct plane that are abl to do the same . howev broad knowledg obvious mean that one never realli get into the depth of a subject sinc there are just too mani other subject that requir attent . so one could say that a person actual ha a lot of knowledg but doe not know anyth complet . i prefer special even though it ha one major disadvantag , one get lost in one 's own subject and might easili lose contact to other topic and subject that might be either interest or import . nevertheless i 'd rather be an expert on one subject tri to realli get into it and complet understand all side of it . i would be abl to concentr on that one subject and might even be abl to discov new side to it that other did n't discov yet . in other word , special may allow for pioneer work , redefin a subject from it 's core . a good exampl for thi major advantag of special is research work which can onli work when peopl decid to special on subject and , onc they 've discov or develop someth new , share what they 've discov with those that work on other subject . as a conclus , special on one subject and publish inform and knowledg mean greater knowledg for all rather than just an averag knowledg for everybodi .
