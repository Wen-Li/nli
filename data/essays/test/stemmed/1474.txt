whether most advertis make the product much better than they realli are ? some peopl may hold the view that davertis realli do some exagger to the product , but other peopl may donot agre with . from my point of view , i realli agre with the statement that most advertis do make product much better than what they realli are . the reason for thi point are list as below . to begin with , the first reason for my hold thi argument ha do the fact that most of advertis just give some introdut to the good respect of the product , but never mention the side-funt of the product . for exampl , you can never find the defeat of the computur though the advertis of the leveno 's computur and you will be told that some kind of nutrion will do some benefit to your health , but you will regret until you bought them . so , thi kind of advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . anoth reason for my consid the adertis alway make product seem better than they realli are is that the advertis alway exagger the qualliti of the product and give us some fauls express on the product . an apt illustrion of thi point involv the car industri . some of the advertis make promis that their product will never have a question and the will alway give nice servic when there is some question . but what the fact is that mani bright brand of car ha question and they are not be found until the accid happen . admitt that the advertisemnt refect the real aspect of the product to some extend , especi for some famous componi but thi can not chang the natur of the advertis . as we all know the natur of the advertis is to encourag the consum to buy the product , so if the advertis can not chang the express of the peopl ' attitud to the product , thi mean the product are not secce . so , to achiev the ideal effect , most of the advertis broaden the adverantag of the product and diminish the disadvantig of the porduct just throuth the artif method , which alway make the product seem more better than they realli are . to sum up , from what we have dissuss abov , we can draw a conclut that most advertis make product much better than they realli are , not becaus they the natur of the davertis , but for the reason that most of the advertis just give some discrib of the good aspect of the product and to somewhat exagger them .
