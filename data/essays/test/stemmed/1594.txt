student studi in school just want to learn more and new knowledg and experi . some peopl think it is import to understand idea and concept while studi , howev , some peopl do not agre with it , they think it is more importan to learn fact . in my opinion , i prefer the first idea than last one . firstli , student understand idea and concept can imoprov their intellig . they can know the knowledg clearli . peopl who studi onli want to learn the fact , mybe , they do not know the profound of the concept that will preseven the student ' develop . secondli , student understand idea and concept will make they go on to futher educ more easi than some one who do not . becaus they can know the knowledg clearli and develop the it in a high lever . futhermor , they will advanc the some aspect in the word after they gratuat from the shool , such as industri , medic care system , secienc research and so on . lastli , student who understand idea and concept mean they know the essenti of the knowledg . thu , they can pass their knowledg and experi gener to gener . therefor , our cultur will be consev . all in all , student to understand idea and concept is more import than to learn fact . not onli in the peopl 's intellig but also in the futur of hunman 's develop . so , as my respect , it is impot to student to understand the idea and concept while studi the knowledg .
