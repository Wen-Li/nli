i person prefer go to a tour along with a tour guid . i person feel so becaus i have been on a number of tour and i have face a lot of problem without a guid . be accompani by a guid for your tour is veri essenti and accord to me is realli mandatori . firstli , i would like to say that if we go to a new place where we do n't know the nativ languag or the place , thi is where a tour guid come into exist . he is one person who help you with all the thing you need . for exampl , there wa a time two month ago when i went to china and i realli got lost without a guid . the languag wa an alien one for me . the write were realli like those box that i use draw as a kid . i realli got lost in that situat , and then i realis that how import a tour guid can be . secondli , a tour guid can help you with all the detail of everi histor monument or ani other place that we got to , which we could not even know without a guid . for exampl , a few month back my rel came to my home town to visit me and i had to take them on a local tour . i be a local could tell them all the import point and the differ event relat to a place or a monument which is veri essenti . thirdli , if we go with a tour guid then we can go to place that suit our budget . he can realli help us in tell which place or a restaur is expens or cheap or too lavish . thirdli , i would like to say that a guid take into consider the number of peopl in a group , and see to it that all of us are togeth and that we do not get lost . he is the one who keep all the peopl glu and maintain their saniti . final , i would like to say that with a guid we feel satisfi that we have seen the best of the place around and even feel good about the fact that we know more about the place now , that we could have not even known without the help of a guid . henc i would like to culmin by say that be accompani by a guid is the best way to go on a tour , rather than get lost and loos your enjoy to the alien land .
