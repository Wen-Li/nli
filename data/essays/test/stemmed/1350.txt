i agre with the follow statement that iti more import for student to understand idea and concept than iti for them to learn fact . the reason i thought that , thi is more easier than it is for them to leatn fact , and also that can be use time wise . first , it is more easier than it is for them to learn fact , becaus if i understood what teacher say , and after the school i come to my hous , and studi myself easili , when i wa kid i do not understand what teacher say and thi is hard to get what is teacher say . so i have to ask my parent and my fiend . if i got it befor thi , it wa easier than ask my parent and my friend . secondli , i can use time more wise . becaus we can get more time to studi for the other subject and also we have more free time than that . for exampl one of my friend , he wa alway get hundr and good at p.e. and i thought if i someth like him , i could get better grade . but he do everyth the other student doe he play and also studi . and i got he were understood teacher say and he just need littl time to memor them . in conclus , it is more import for studend to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus it is more easier than that and also we could spend the time more wise .
