do advertis make product much better than what they realli are ? ye of cours ! i agre with the statement . let me line up the reason and explan whi i agre with the issu at hand . advertis in fact influenc peopl to buy the product that are be advertis . moreov , these day in televis show or serial most of the time that is spent is for advertis the product . few channel are just for advertis . i do not realli say that advertis is someth wrong , but it should not exagger the real qualiti of the product . most of the peopl are unawar of thi exagger shown in advertis and would gener be tempt to tri out the product . but it is onc they use it then they will know the real qualiti of the product . by the time they realiz it , they must have spend lot of money on that . in case of rich peopl who just want to tri out variou upcom product it doe not matter , but in case of middl class famili it is quit a wast if they spend on worthless product which ha been exaggeratedli advertis as a veri good and use product . recent i saw one advertis which i can say is the maximum of the exagger i have ever seen . it is the advertis whish uabout a teeth whiten , which show the person who chew it can go in to the darker region without light , use their teeth as light and also they are show these person are use as street light . thi is the exagger of what it realli doe . it might help in whiten the teeth , but it can never be use as light as such . my niec wa ask me the next day to buy that product , so that we need not use light and can go to darker place with out the help of light . i struggl in explain her the fact as she is too young to understand . i can still rememb that day when a person in our coloni bought a juicer that have been advertis by some local compani at veri low price . it ha been advertis to have differ kind of aplic like cut veget , make juic with all kind of fruit with out even peel their skin etc . but onc he bought then onli they came to know that it 's not that worth to spend that much amount of money in buy that . they face difficulti in use that juicer and moreov it is not the way they exaggeratedli advertis it . so i strongli agre with the statement that most of the advertis make product seem much better and exagger than what they realli are .
