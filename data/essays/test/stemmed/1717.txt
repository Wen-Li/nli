i think that it is better to alway tri to take risk , risk make peopl succses becaus , for exampl when you risk someth and you loos the next time you do it you will know how to do it and you will do it good , like they say in my countri `` the peopl that doe n't risk doe n't win '' that is becaus even fail make you more experienc in what you did . the peopl that doe n't risk anyth have bore live becaus their live are alway the same , they live in a circl becaus they do the same thing everi day . in my opinion life should be fun , and where is the fun in do alway the same thing . all the big idea and busi are made by take risk . but take risk doe n't just appli to busi , it appli to everyth and everi day . for exampl i want to go to studi to a colleg in the us , but i could just stay in my countri and studi a carrer there . so i am take the risk to see if i can have a better life . the peopl that doe n't take risk in most of the case are peopl with problem becaus they think that their life could be wors and they could get to a bigger failur , but if instead they take the risk and they succeed they would feel better and they can be better peopl . i think that one of the best thing about take a risk is the feel that you tri to chang someth for the best even if you fail , take risk make your life more intens and interest , and that is a healthi way of live becaus you are make an effort to chang your life and not to keep it that way and just see the oportun pass by , and thath whi i think that take a risk is better and whi i alway tri to take risk .
