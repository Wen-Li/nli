in my opinion , i agre it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . fir of all , i think ani student should they have mani idea about how can he understand to learn . for exampel , about me when i wa studyb in high school i rememb alway i want get high score in all the subject , also , when i get alow scoer in some the subject ifeel by the shi from my self . second , shoud ani student he want the high score shoud studi hard and sugesst for ani student , shoud he studi hard befor the test or qui . third , ani student need understand veri well they should write ani thing write hi teacher , becaus they help him to remeb when he take test or qui , also , should on each student reviw ani lesson befor he start ani test or qui . in adit , in my opinion , ithink shoud on ani student you need pass from ani subject should continu with hi teacher to keep the inform in hi mind , also , in my opinion , should on ani student , he have parent should alway take some advic from them , becuas , the parent there have a lot of experienc in the life , also , they see some thing you will be do n't see . in the end i want say should on each the student studi hard studi hard for ani test or ani qui becau , if you bstudi hard you will take the high score in the most examin , also , i want say if you studi hard for the test they you will help you in ani thing in ani countri and i will say ihop take veri high scoer in thi test and iwant say if i take high scoer in thi test iwil put big big parti in my apart .
