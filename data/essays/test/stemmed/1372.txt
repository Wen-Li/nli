i strongli agre and recommend the statement that it is signific for the student to recogn basic concept and idea than to learn brutal fact . accordingli it is found that concept is import more than the fact , becaus the student have to first grasp the mean of the basi and better learn step by step . if a kid in a neighbor of your ha a vast knowledg of univer system and you give him a task of how to make the univers system differ from what he alreadi know , he will be relut to do so . becaus it is hard to break someon 's knowledg , fact . that ha alreadi proven true and let him to go beyond the fact and seek for imagin . if fact are import , it is onli import when they have to take examin to enter a certain school . howev , it is mislead sinc it is rare associ with the student 's life . if a student ha a great imagin toward everyth when he wa young , he will have posit mind and he will get to design a better world . if there are fact that the student learn , the student will not tri to give a defect to the truth sinc they will feel no oblig toward of elimin the truth . sometim our world , can be imrpov directli not onli by the fact and how it work , but risk of idea of what will occur accord to what we deed . usual , the fact tell the student of block their dream and develop himself or herself . it reduc the chanc of the child of abil to perform a certain action . with concept , the student know how to organ but the concept doe not erad the thingk of a student but requir a further thought of the student . by learn fact a student can be known to the world and can be known for the best person . on the other hand , we can simpli interpret thi person as a person who ha good memor skill . with idea , it is more valu sinc it is not emul from someonels , it is from hi or her own identif of thingk . idea give confid to the student that there are infint possibilit of do a particular activ . as a conclus , to summar my opinion , i repeat that the better idea the better to be suitabl to be social . if the fact are first than the idea or concept to a child , it is inept for a child to be global or social . as a result to grasp the idea and concept are more essenti than to valu the fact .
