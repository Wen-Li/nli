what is advertis ? a simpl way of sell one 's product wa what it use to be . today , the advertis world ha becom a competet jungl ; one that , i feel , ha lost sight of it origin purpos , and ha been reduc to a money-spin frenzi that attempt to make product seem larger than life . i , thu , strongli agre with the given statement . i come from mumbai , india 's commerci capit ; where everi road is a blaze of flash neon-lit advertis ; where familiar face of celebr , endors the most frivol product , jump out at you from everi hoard ; where brightli color advertis are plaster on everi spare inch of space in the citi ( buse , bu stop , wall , signpost , post box : you name it ! ) and where one third of the time you spend watch your favorit televis show is spent watch advertis . in the light of the abov situat , i do not think i can be blame for have such a strong viewpoint ! sinc when ha a toothpast been so effect , that the poor old teeth that are subject to other toothpast crumbl in comparison ? sinc when ha an energi drink been so vital , that it ha bestow upon it drinker the sudden magic abilti to win everi race that he perform so poorli in befor ? sinc when ha a shampoo been so nourish , that the light reflect from the hair of the lucki damsel who use it , ha been enough to blind a crowd ? sinc when ha a cologn been so allur , that a man who use it had a ladi swoon into hi arm on the veri same day ? these are all real exampl of the blatant exagger that the advertis industri make use of today in order to sell . it illustr the shock extent to which produc will go to make money , and is a depict of their merceneri approach to life . i do not mean to preach ; i mere feel that employ such ridicul hyperbol , just to make a buck , is absolut unnecessari . to say that advertis make product seem much better than they actual are would , in fact , be an understat ; for they endow these product with qualiti that , at time , defi the realm of realiti !
