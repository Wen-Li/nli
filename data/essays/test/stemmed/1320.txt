i disagre with the opinion . i think the best way to trvel is in a group with no tour guid . if one travel with a tour guid , one cannnot experi the true live the peopl there do . i think the peopl who live there know the best point there . nowaday , peopl watch travel program on tv , so , travel as the same way that peopl do in a tv program is not give peopl new experi and new sight , new curutur topic and new movement . peopl usual travel in great expenditur , so , i want to experi other thing peopl usual can not do in japan . for exampl , eat food which do not exsist in japan , and speak peopl who live there and want to know what peopl there think everyday . onc i had gone to borneo to dive and to see anim . we made friend with a man who live there , and he explaind to us where wa a danger place to go , and where wa a delici market and so on . our famili enjoy our trip , and we could make a new friend in borneo . trip with a tour guid is good for a man who onli want to see fasmou place , i think . but by such trip , peopl can not see the real figur what the countri is . to enjoy the countri fulli , i think it is the best way to travel without ani tour guid .
