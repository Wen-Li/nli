affirm that young peolpl do n't dedic much time to their commun may be a gener , becaus you will alway find some younger that are realli involv in their communitiy life , but i quit agre on thi statement . inde , i think that young peopl are sensit too late in life to the issu that touch their commun . in most case , they are onli concern by their hobbi , their friend and famili dure the first part oh their life . studi and enjoy are often the onli thing that matter to them dure their daili life . peopl begin to realis that their commuti encount issu and and are motiv to tri to help them onli when they are older and often when they are touch by some of these problem . in fact , thi problem is mayb relat to our educ system . even if chidren and then student are told that it 's realli import to take part in the social life of their commun and to adopt a civilian behaviour , these are just recommand . children are rare oblig to set up a project that could contribut to help their commun . young peopl are rare encourag to involv themselv in chariti . to illustr thi idea , i will give a personn exampl . i have been attend a busi school for one year and dure the past year we had to plan a tea ; project and to achiev it . we were free to choos the project which attract us . mani project which were launch fail and among those which have been realiz , mani were not interest . i think that the school should oblig student to chose project wich are relat to their commun are to a chariti in order to creat a work that could be use to everyon . it 's sure that so ;; e young peopl decid to involv one selv to project use to their co ;; uniti . they are too few . and educationsyst
