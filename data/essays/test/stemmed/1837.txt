as multimedia continu to increas , we can not neglect the great advertis it ha provid for a wide verieti of product . nowaday there are commerci everywher . product are now better advertis than ever befor through tv , radio , newspapr , magazin and even on the street . howev , the question aris here . are product `` that '' good ? advertis ha ofcours enabl manufactur to display their product , whatev they were , in the best possibl manner . let consid panten for instinct , a veri signific hair product that everybodi know . panten ha display mani tv commerci on how amaz it 's shampoo is . it commerci alway display a young woman with the most exquisit hair anybodi could ever encount . her hair in everi commerci is alway long , strong , healthi and shini . in a matter of fact , her hair is too perfect to be true ! i just often wonder if there is hair like that in our real world and in a matter of fact i doubt there is . that hair is most like , as i can imagin , visual hiar . it wa probabl visual thruogh a special comput program and then attach to the woman 's head in the commerci . whi am i say thi ? it is becaus i have brought the product and sever of my freind have , yet non of us ha seen a massiv chang . ofcours i do n't expect my hair to be just like the woman 's in the commerci , but i expect someth from what they state in the commerci to happen , like have a healthier hair for exampl , or tleast see some kind of chang to the better . as a result , i discov that the commerci of the shampoo ha realli noth to do with the actual product avail to the consum . here my argument begin . whi are commerci so fake ? whi are they too perfect ? ha it come to the point that manufactur are nowaday deciev peopl and lie to them just to get a product sold and success ? in a matter of fact , i do n't believ that commerci and advertis are make pruduct success , they onli give them the attent requird as peopl becom interest in discov the product . onc the consum tri the product and realiz it 's insignific , the consum will no longer think of buy it again . simpli , advertis have thi power of make product seem much better than they realli are but they certaintli do n't promis them success . it is a shame how far produc and maunfactur have reach to lie to the public by make their product seem extravag through advertis . all they are get in return is distrust form the public . peopl nowaday are becom awar of the great hypocrici lie about behind each and everi commerci . a simpl massag to all compani . be realist , you might gain more success out of it !
