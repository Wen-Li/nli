the main topic is that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre with thi statement . the first reason i agre with thi is that , if student understand the idea and concept it is much more easier for them to understand ani task or ani project they are handl . for exampl if they are do ani project , they should understand the concept of that project and come up with differ idea . so that it will be well organis and willb done accord to the requir . if you go accord to the fact we may not be abl to succeed in that project . becaus in realiti the similar project fail due to sever reason . anoth reason is that in ani type of activ they perform , if they understand the concept of that activ and get some new idea and proceed , it is easi to suce . if you realli look for fact you may not suce in mani occas . onoth thing is that , student alway have no real experi with mani thing and they look fact by read book and other journel . some time which is not true and give wrong judgement also . it is also import for student that if they understand the concept of ani activ it easi get some good idea base on their personnel experien or some thing that what they read in book . alway better idea give good result and it help student to perform anoth activ with more new concept . if they look into the fact they may not be abl to gain ani success but may get some inform which they dont think in similar concept . some case it will help student to undersand the reason for fail or success . final i understand that for student it is more import to understand the idea and conept than learnfact .
