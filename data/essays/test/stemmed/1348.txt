i agre to the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i can say from my own experi that i often tri to learn just the fact . it wa easi . i review the materi at home . i wa not veri activ at class . just had some day dream . i did not join class discuss . one day we wrote an exam . i got an veri low grate . we need to express our own idea and concept . i did not know thi i just knew all the fact . then a start to chang my behavior . i tri to understand the idea not onli of the teacher but of the other student as well . that reali made an big impact in my educ life . i start think by myself . it wa fantast . it wa not about leran fact , it wa about a higher understand of a tobic . i even join discuss in class . i could not beliv it , school start to be fun . i love to be there . i wa reali motiv . by the way , my next exam wa great ! a also like to motiv other peopl to concentrad on the understand of idea and concept . when my younger brother went to hi first school day i just explain these leasson to him . i said to him : tri to understand the idea of the teacher . my brother ask whi and i gave him differ reason . first , you will enjoy the school more . second , you will learn more . third , you will join discuss in class my brother did so . i also like school a lot . in concluss , i learnd that school is much more fun when i understand the fact . i love to debat with other . i love to understand there idea . i believ that understand of idea is not onli import in school but also in profession live . in my work as an sale man i need the abil to understand other peopl . i learnd it at school . i am veri grateful for thi expieri .
