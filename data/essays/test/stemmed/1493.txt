ye i agre the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid onlli . becaus we have went to the new place ever we have seen at that time we need a guid to tell us about that place and the import thing and the histori of that place and whi it got the name for it . for ex ampl i and my friend have went to mysor and we have ever seen the place till now and we want the detail about the palac and other detail and whi that palac had that much name so none of our fiend have no idea of that place and about that area . so we have ask a guid to tell about that palc and show us the citi which have been visit . use the guid we can learn more thing and we ca n't face ani problem . becaus the guid know about all the place in that citi and we can easili know all those and we wo n't miss the import place . for exampl i will take agra we know that there is an tajmah built by shajahan for hi wife as a gift . but the peopl who are uneduc will some time come for tour to visit at that time it is the best way to travel with the guid and even they do n't know how to travel also due to thi we have to need atour guid . ok it is no problem for the person who know about the place they go with out the guid . the guid will show us everi part in that place . even the guid some time will say lie but it is better with the guid . visit the tour with out the guid face so mani problem . for exampl we want to visit the state like us or canada ofcours we got an visitor vissa for 15 day or 1month upto the air port we can visit and after we ca n't vist ani other citi . and we have to return back from that airport onli . if we ask a tour guid with us mean we can visit all the place we want to see by not ask the tour guid mean we have to make an enquiri how to go to the place we want to visit and have to know about the local train and the buse we have to face so mani risk . so the better way i prefer is to travel in a group by a tour guid .
