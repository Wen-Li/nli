recent , there are mani tour compani . each tour guid is veri good and the qualiti becom veri high . if we have good chois , we can enjoy enogh . howev , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the reason whi i desagre are it cost too much , it is not real enjoy for me , and there is no free . first of all , a tour guid cost veri expens . basicali , if we use the tour compani , we have to pay more for the compani . howev , i do not like that . if we have money to pay the compani , we can use the money the other thing . for exampl , we can eat more delic food or we can buy more suivenir . i do not want to use money for empti thing like compani or tour or servis . it is not good way to use money . second , it is not excit becaus the trip alreadi decid a plan where will we go and what will we do . it is a littl bore for me . if we plan by ourselv , we can enjoy to decid where will we go , what will we do , and which hotel will we stay . i think it is realli excit to plan about that . if we use the guid , we do not have to do anyth by ourselv , but it is just lazi . i want to organ by myself . final , the most import reason is free . if we ask guid , we can not move freeli . if we go there and see variou thing , shop , or build , we may want to chang our plan to go the place . nobodi know the time when our mind will chang and i want to chang my plan at that time . therefor , i want freedom dure the trip . in conclus , i do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus i have three reason . for me , if i want to enjoy my travel realli , i want to use the money by smart way , i want to make the trip by myself , and i want to have freedom dure my trip . it is the best way to enjoy travel for me .
