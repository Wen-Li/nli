in most case , essay start with state that the answer for a discuss is not uniqu . thi is due to the fact that the life is not so simpl in most case and ani question may have more than a singl answer in most case . thi is true even for a simpl ye or no question like : do you agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ? the critic word in the question are : 1. young peopl 2. nowaday 3. enough time 4. help 5. commun so , i would like to review these critic concept first , in order to comment on the reason of the final answer . how will we defin the young peopl ? it will not help a lot if we defin onli by the correspond age categori . it is necessari to consid the social statu and occup . a student , an earli starter for the profession life and an unemploy young person will not feel the same even if they are at exactli the same age . how will we defin nowaday ? is it thi year ? the last decad ? or more ? what is the measur of enough time ? if one ha noth to do , spend a week for help the commuin may be veri normal for him . but a 10 minut spent by a hard worker of 60 hour per week can be more valuabl . what is help ? is it just give some money or go and work for some activ ? and final , how will we defin the commun ? is it correct to ask young peopl to accept the gener valu of the societi and exist commun without question ? i believ that the comment made abov alreadi have the answer in . i can not agre with thi statement . most of the young peopl i know are tri to find way to understand and express themselv . some of them are more lucki . they have good relat with some peopl who can help them to improv themselv in thi difficult period . they find plenti of way and spend much time to help their commun . some of the young peopl are not as lucki as the other . they can not even think about the problem of other . they have their own problem . but thi is not their problem and it is not a gener case . so i definit disagre with the statement given abov and say : `` young peopl give as much time as they can to help their commun !
