i prefer a travel led by a tour guid in my home countri . in contrast , i like travel that not led by ani tour guid , becaus i travel to foreign countri not onli to see the famou place or build , but to see and feel the real life of the foreign countri . when i 've been ital , at that earli morn , i saw an old woman walk along the street at the front of the hotel that i stay in , she had a veri big basket and a veri long french bread wa put into her basket . the air wa moisti , and the road wa spread by the stone panel . i feel like that i had ever seen such scene befor , becaus it wa fit to my streotyp of tge imag of old citi in europ . when i travel around japan , i do n't want to wast my time to look around the sightse spot , so i want to join some tour . but in a foreign countri , i want to eat food at the restraunt that not for the visit but for the home resid . i want to walk a road that ani japanes or chines not be seen . i want to be transport by a subway or taxi and to hear covers of the peopl that live there , rathar than a bu fill up a japanes travel . these are reason whi am i
