i do not agre with the statement , that in twenti year , there will be fewer car than nowaday . in my oppinion , it will be complet the opposit . i think they are get more import for the peopl . the human like to arriv everyth quickli and also if there are other possibl as train , buss or plain , they will probabl never reach everi place in your countri . you have also to pay attent to the develop of human behaviour , the peopl are use to get more and more as much comfort as they could have . mani peopl do not like to walk veri long , becaus they are alreadi too lazi for it , so that 's whi some peopl get also to short path by car . probabl , there will be some peopl who will not drive anymor a car , becaus of enviroment reason . but i think there will be much more , who do not care about such thing . also if the industri do not produc as much car as it use to be , there are other reason . for exampl financi aspect , becaus peopl often buy use car . car are also not onli practic for your movement , but also to transport thing , for exampl if someon want to buy food or furnitur . anoth reason is , that some peopl use the car to go to their work , becaus it is the fastest and most comfort way . it is also import to notic the develop in techniquesalway progress , that is whi there will alway be new , safer and better car and there will be a lot of peopl who would like to have them . i think the economi will alway support and influenc the peopl to buy car , becaus they also do not want to sell fewer car and to earn less money . in my oppinion , car are veri import for mani peopl in mani differ part of their life and so intergr in their do , that they will not miss or substitut it . that is whi i would not agre with thi statement .
