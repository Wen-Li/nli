in twent year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do not think it is realli possibl and henc , i complet disagre with thi statement . over the last decad the automobil engin ha definit made giant stride in term of advanc and to me it doe not seem to wither away so easili . a burn build can not be put off in one minut even by the fire brigad . in thi case i have observ that car machineri and technolog ha definit becom much better over the year owe to the burgeon need of the custom . if i talk of my countri , india , i have seen here mani number of multin pop up dure the last decad onli and manufactur car for sale in the market . thi definit indic that busi tycoon are not restrain from invest million in thi industri . the chief reason i feel that the number of car in use would not declin is we , the custom . it would be strang if i ask anyon that would he stop drive a car after twenti year ? he would give me a surpris look as the question sound absurd . peopl hope to buy new bigger better car in futur as provid by their financ , they never think of give away the old car and give up drive . thu it the custom that ha evok the need of better car , faster car and more and more technolog advanc car . with time the econom statu and level of the common man is also increas and thu allow him to harbour dream of buy a new car or a bigger and more novel car . anoth reason for me to support my opinion would be that if peopl wo n't travel by car then how will they travel . it is notic that train and aircraft do not reach each and everi place and henc we have to resort to car in ani case . it worth mention here that a recent survey conduct by the outlook magazin of india clearli illustr the view of the peopl that they enjoy car-driv much more than ani other mean of transport . even if i contempl , i realiz that there is noth as thrill and fun as go oyt in a car with my famili or friend . if we look around ourselv we will dicov that there are univers which are promot bachelor 's degre in automobil engin and score of student are undertak these cours . it doe not signifi a declin in the upcom year as these graduat are readili be employ in corpor hous . in india , the number of car have increas approxim tenfold in the last decad and so in other countri too more car are come on the road . in the conclus i would say that in present day circumst i see no evid to prompt me to support the view that there would be fewer car in the next twenti year .
