is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? i person believ that the answer to thi question is , ye . i agre that understand idea and concept in class is import and more help than rememb fact . as a young student as myself , i have experienc both method and found that understand the idea and concept more effect in the long run . dure a lesson , for exampl a geographi lesson , i would be more interest in the concept of glacier format and with interest i would be keen to understand the process rather than the fact . understand idea ha given me a better view in a wide rang of subject and help me rememb the process , for exampl the glacier format , easili . learn fact can be veri bore and quickli forgotten . i believ that be a good teacher , is to be abl to explain and intorduc new idea well . good explain and understand not onli help the student achiev better result in class but also help the student in the futur . everyth that you understand from the teacher or fellow classmat , will eventu connect with topic that will be taught later on in class or at univers . if a student just rememb the fact earli on , it will not help the student with the next topic that requir understand from the previou topic . for exampl in chemistri , i would n't be abl to understand acid-bas equilibrium today if i did n't understand the concept behind equilibrium which wa taught last year . in addict , student who just rememb fact in ani subject will have difficulti to impli them in everyday life and convers held between other student and professor . it is a shame to see how mani peopl do struggl with thi . i know mani peopl who would just rememb fact and be stuck in an awkward situat with other student as they did n't quit know exactli what they were talk about and could n't show hi or her interest . final , i conclu that understand idea and concept are more import for not onli exam but in the long run , as it give an advantag in futur studi and is kept in the memori for a longer period of time .
