a difficult moment for a professor , when he prepar hi lesson , is often to choos whether he will be more attent to teach hi student a particular fact or a gener idea . i am convic that the main point is for student to understand the idea and concept . first of all , a particular fact alway contain particular piec of inform that are not necessari to understand one fact , and risk to make troubl in a student 's thought . for exampl , to explain the concept of legitim defens , it is alway difficult to find a perfect exampl becaus fact can be interpret differ way . on the contrari , the idea itself contain the essenti that must be kept in mind , without perturb element . moreov , a concept allow a student to get a more gener knowledg ; free from particular circumst , he can use hi new concept and adapt them to what he see . a concept give a gener informafor exampl , he can recogn a case of legitim defens more easili while compar a precis event to the definit he learn , than while compar it to anoth particular event , that could have differ or similitud that have noth to do with the point . thi exampl can be gener not onli to justic , but also to mathemat and physic , that must be conceptu to be understood . of cours , a concept is less easi than a fact to understand , becaus it is more abstract . but a student should know how to use hi knowledg in differ circumst and how to adapt all he learn to what he is confront to . therefor , fact can be a good way to understand concept and idea , but they are not the most import to be rememb in the end : they are just a step in the learn of concept , that allow us to realli understand phenomena . onc understood , an idea is more power than a fact .
