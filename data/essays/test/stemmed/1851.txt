i agre to the statement that success peopl tri to continu seek the innov . i have two reason to support my idea as follow . firstli , the phylosophi of market ha big reason for the success peopl to tri new thing . in case the one compani success the busi by some busi scheme or busi method in one market . the other compani will , without doubt , tri to enter the market by mean of the similar busi scheme or method , which requir slight cheaper cost than the one requir by the origin scheme or method . then the follow compani will increas the share in the market . the compani success firstli in that market will be oblig to chang the method in order to surviv in the market . in such situat , the compani , which success firstli in the market , ha two choic . which contain the chang of the origin method and move to the differ market . the success peopl tri to chang their style constantli , though it ha the differ extent , sinc they understand the abov phylosophi of market or econom system . secondli , characterist of the success peopl may have the effect . the target of the manag of the compani is eventu to expand the businss opportun or busi volum as much as possibl . successful peopl who manag the compani ha the same target in their life . therefor , success peopl drive the compani to tri new thing and take risk to develop the comapni .
