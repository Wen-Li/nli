which one is more import for student ? to understand idea and concept or to learn fact ? accord to my experi as a student and my work experi . i will definit choos the second one of more import which is learn fact . first of all , we need to discuss what is the basic mission of the student ? for me , get more parit knowledg and inform is my basic mission . take my major as an exampl , my major is intern economi and trade , i need to learn a lot of method to handl intern busi in the real world . howev , almost all of the idea and concept in my major are not parit or out of date . on the other side , our professor gave me a lot of real stori which happend in the bussi world and it benifit to me . whi these stori and exampl are so use for me ? it is truth and fact . it gave me a best way to know about the bussi model and bussi method . secondli , whi i hold that learn fact is more import than understand idea and concept is that some of the idea and concept in the text book or told by teacher may not right . we can see a lot of idea and concept alreadi been approv as incorrect ot limlit . after the time pass by , there are mani new idea and concept will be creat and rais out . but the fact will not chang so easili . it ha more valu to be learn . thirdli , the process of understand the idea and concept is total differ from the process to learn fact . student will use of their brain to think , discuss , develop when they learn fact sinic it will bring them much more space . but when they tri to understand idea and concept , they just persuad them to believ someth belong to other peopl . they will lost some power of creation and innov which stdudent should have . base on below reason , i insist that learn fact is more impor than understand idea and concept .
