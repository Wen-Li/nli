i do not agre complet with thi statement . in my experi as a student and a profession busi woman , i have continu encount situat where understand concept , idea and fact is equal import . the import of each element can sometim increas or chang depend mostli on the pragmat perspect or end of these situat . as a student , sometim it wa difficult to discern between the import and precis differ between each of these element . then again , throughout my educ experi their differ and import becam clearer . i strongli believ that the import of each of these element lie within their applic throughout each student 's educ programm . for instanc , it is more import for student who major in exact and/or natur scienc such as chemistri and mathemat to priorit fact over concept or idea . on the other hand , for student who major in philosophi or psycholog , understand idea or concept is significantli relev to their studi and the implement of these in their work . howev thi comparison is not 100 % accur or true . what might be import to some student might not be import to other student , independet of their major , their interest and their academ abil . overal i think the import of these element depend mostli on each student and their academ and person object . nevertheless it is crucial to evalu whether the priorit of concept , idea or fact is inde an issu . in my opinion it is more import for student to achiev good grade and obtain a diploma to continu with their career . while some student might be in univers to learn other are invest their money and their time in prepar themselv to becom leader , lawyer , doctor , teacher or whatev they want to becom . what is most import is to becom eduact .
