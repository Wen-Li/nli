i do agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . '' i do agre becaus i know some peopl that are great in their job , but they are not satisfi with the thing they have becaus they know that they are abl to have or get more and they take risk in order to success in other area . it would be veri easi to those person to keep do what they know they do well , but they want more , they are not complet satisfi , so they decid to take risk . i think it is veri import to take risk in order to success . the best exampl i can give is myself . i am a lawyer , i have been work in a great law firm sinc 11 year . i think i am a good lawyer , so i could maintain the thing exactli the way they are , but no , i want to be a better lawyer , i want to succeed so i need to take risk . that is whi i have been work veri hard in order to save the enough money so i can pay an ll . m in the unit state . i want to studi an ll . m becaus is a great opportun to increas my legal knowledg , also i will be abl to meet peopl of differ countri and , it is the better way to practic my english . studi a master repres a risk , becaus i will leav back my famili , my home , my friend and , of cours , my job . but i am conciu that i need to take thi risk if i want to succeed . of cours it will not be an easi task , sincer , i am a littl affraid , but also i am sure that it will be the best experi of my entir life . it is one of my greatest dream and i have been work veri hard in order to make it possibl . some day a good friend of mine told me that the harder one work , the luckier one get , so i am work veri hard each day in order to make my dream possibl . that is whi i do agre that is import to take risk if someon want to be success .
