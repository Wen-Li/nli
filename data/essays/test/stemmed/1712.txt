i do not agre with thi statement for the follow reason : first of all , there are region and countri in the world today , most of all china and india but also other third world countri and region , that have start to develop a rapidli grow economi . these nation as a whole and also local compani in these countri start to establish themselv as major contributor to the worldwid economi . although the third world economi are domin by the produc industri at the moment and thu the annual per head incom is still veri low , there ha been a remark increas in thi area ( annual incom per person ) in the last few year . as mani studi suggest that the econom upris of these countri is go to continu and that these societi will turn into well develop commun veri similar to those in the usa and western europ , thi trend of rise salari will most probabl continu . there are go to be more and more servic relat busi and the annual salari of most work peopl will increas . thi will enabl more peopl in these countri to access good that have been unavail to them until now . hous will be made more comfort , technolog product such as comput , mp3 player and the like will be access to a greater number of peopl and , of cours , car will becom more wide spread . mani inhabit of these third world countri are just wait for the day , when they will be abl to purchas their own car . if you now combin thi idea with the fact that more than two billion peopl live alon in china and india combin and mani of those do not yet own a car , thi may show to you the probabl increas in car sale in these region . in fact , nearli all of the car produc compani worldwid are alreadi plan and/or establish product perfectli suit for the market in china , india and the rest of the upris third world countri . given these fact , a drop in the number of sold and use car worldwid seem veri unrealist . in addit to that , i do not believ anymor in a decreas of use automobil in the western world , name western europ and the usa . although there have been initi to enhanc the qualiti of the public transport system in the past , there are recent develop that undermin these initi . formerli state-own railway compani are be sold to privat investor , and the first step these businessmen take is to decreas the number of offer line and connect . an effici railway system that could compet with the street both on the sector of privat car user as well as on the transport sector is just too expens to be highli competit . all that said , i definit come to the conclus that there will not be fewer car around in twenti year from now . there will be even more car .
