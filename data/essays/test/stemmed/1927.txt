i disagre with thi opinion . my opinion is there is the subject the student should studi the concept and fact and should not studi the concept . i have sever reason to support my opinion . the first reason is if the student onli lean the fact without idea or concept , the student may abl to rememb the fact and they can use their fact in the exam , but they onli can use shortli their fact , in order to pass through the time of cousres the student will forget . howev , if the student learn the idea or concept they can use the idea or the concept to solv the question or the problem even though they forgot the fact . the second reason is if the student onli learn the fact , when the student have to do the new type of question and problem , they can not do it , becaus they had not experienc those question , but if the student leran the idea and concept they can understand the mean of the qustion , they may not answer the question complet but they can still process to thier answer . on the other hand , i think there is the subject or thing onli need to studi thier fact . for exampl some simpl algebra mathmat fomula , i do not think the student need to learn the concept or the idea . i think the idea of the fomula are to complic , the idea onli cofus the student and make the student less interest on mathmat , but the student realli want be mathmatician or scientist , the teacher at the school should teach them individuali .
