it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre with the opinion state abov for two reason : first . if you understand veri well the idea and the concept then you will learn fact . if they are talk about behavior and whi we behav thi way , first , they have to understand the concept and the idea of what is behavior and know the process to make a respons and evalu the behavior . then they will have exampl and will know how we react in societi , in school , in hous , at a fight , and whi we have thi behavior , what is behind of our act and where it is come from . second . more concept and more idea will take you to research more about the topic that you are on and then have a full list of concept and research about same thing and have a bigger criteria at the time of learn and interpret fact . it is like the free opinion of the peopl about a car ; peopl know what is a car , what doe the car do , and what a car ha to have to be a car . then they investig about more thing like the motor , the type of wheel , if the car ha featur like air condition , electr window . etc . when you know all thi and you have your answer which you think it is correct or uniqu , and you start to ask more peopl their opinion and what they know or what they want for the car , you can see that there a lot of differ opinion about what is a car or how doe a car function , or what they want to have the car . you understood the idea and the concept , you want to know more and then you learn fact . it is hard to explain and put exampl but one can onli learn by live and listen what is happen around us . it the base for a good criteria .
