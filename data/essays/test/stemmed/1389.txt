grow with the technolog and the need of human , product are increas day by day with tremend rate . so in order to stand in the market the compani start advertis their product in which they highlight their product special qualiti to attract the user . in my view it is accept to certai extent but not the whole . by the increas number of product now a day compani have to compet with their oppon so they give advertis in order to attract more and more custom . in thi they display their special qualiti of product so they tri to put lot of thing which is the qualiti of the product and some qualiti which is not in their product so as to attract user . let take an exampl of the earli 18th centuri when the popul is lesser as a reason need is lesser and the product are also lesser at that time but with the grow popul need of human increas tremend and to fullfil that need product are increas . when their is onli one soap avail peopl go for that soap onli but now a day with differ advertis they go for the soap which hi role model like . now a day peopl are not look about the qualiti of the materi but look who support that product . so it total a worthwhil . secondli as the media technolog is increas day by day now a day most of the peopl have televis at home and they alway spend sometim time in that so peopl got through new product their and think that if the advertis is good they will prefer that product instead of concern about the qualiti of the product . by thi advertis the cost of the product also increas in larg term as the compani have to spend alot of money in advertis . as for the televis advertis , newspap advertis , and on hoard . now a day compani make brand ambassodor of the product in order to bolster their product so they too spend alot of money in all of thi . the person who is popular in the recent time , all the compani approach to the person and offer brand ambassodership for their product and the famou person demand a good amount of money to do all thi . so by all thi thing i discuss abov result in the increas on the product but the peopl are not concern about that . but on the hand when we look at the posit of thi advertis that if the advertis is not their how the peopl came to know about the variou product , whtat new in market , what to buy or not . in order to flourish compani growth the compani start give advertis to attract peopl , thi seem to be a well groom reason to give advertis of the product and bolster their product in order to strenghten it posit in market . thi is truelli a bussissen task to flourish their bussiss . in the end ye i agre about the statement that most advertis make product seem much better thatn they realli are , inspit of some posit area to it . now the peopl have to becom smart enough to go for the product or not to go with it .
