from my point of view it is more import to understand idear and concept , becous what can we do , if we do not understand thing . first , understand is veri import , becaus without understand you can not put a fact in anouth problemat situat . like in the biologi , there you must lern the mendelschen rool . if you do not unterstand the rool you can not find a answer of question in witch the teacher want to combin rool and situat . if you onli learn the rool , you do not know how to comin the situat . you onli know that you need for exampl rool 4 , but whi do you not know and that is not good . second , it is importend to combin situat . with the learn of fact you can not write and essay , becaus you must combin it . you must write a logic structur . so that the reader understand what you are want to say . fact after fact is not interest to read . you must modor the fact and if you do not unterstand it is veri difficult to do that . you need a reason to write about . third , in your life you will have new situat and if you can understand what is to do , you will find your way . peopl who onli lerrn fact less the abil to handel situat . like the light who show that you can walk across the steet . you lern if it is green you can walk , but what is to do , if the light is defect and you can not see a light . that are a simpl exampl , but it show what mean with new situat and the understand what to do . so i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to unterstand idear and concept that it is for them to learn fact .
