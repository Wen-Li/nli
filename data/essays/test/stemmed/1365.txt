nowaday , in mani school the student gain their knowledg just by mani practic , person i think thi is not a good idea . when we are studi what we should know first is the method and the idea that lead to the result . when student are learn , they must first understand whi will it be like thi or that , it is not onli becaus it can encourag the student to discov the real core of the knowledg , but can also make the studi effieci and enterpris , while modifi their knowledg with flexibl and usag in a wider rang . first , the student can realli get what they have been told and , no doubt be smarter . the way of learn english for non-english speaker , for exampl , is to learn from abc and use it , if the learner never have an idea of what is a bibl or what is the greek mytholog , he or she will not know the way the english is use , do n't even mention about the magnific of thi languag . second , if he doe n't know the whi or the how the studi object act , that will make the process of studi bore for the learner . in contrast , if the student understand it , he will have a will to control it and the will of know more . the base of the knowledg will tell the student whi or how it act and make them have the abil of insight thing . you will say , yeah , a reserch or a specialist will need it of cous , but let me tel you , well , normal peopl also need it in their daili life . famili member must understand idea to keep their relationship goe on well . if we just learn fact that will be veri fast , ye but not prounc .
