i am not veri sure that it will be realli so . it depenc a lot even by the area that we consider . if we look at the citi , thi statement could be true , becaus sever peopl that in past prefer to move by their car , today tri to use more autobu , train , ecc . .. thi is possibl nowaday thank to the new technolog avail that make train , plane and autobu faster and more secur . mani citi have spent a lot of money to power their servic of public transport . in other area where we can see a less densiti of peopl , and where train and autobu line are not veri effici , the number of car is not decreas for my experi . with a car anyon is abl to arriv in the right place without the risk of rain or traffic that he can meet on foot from the station to the right place . we must consider too , for my person think , that the rate of young peopl who becom abl to drive is greater than the rate of ancient peopl who lose their abil . the modern cultur , and probabl more money avail today , bring a father to buy a car for everi son . so , probabl , in same case the number of car on the street is increas , a behaviour that i see everyday on my town . even if i hope that it wa onli a my own impress , becaus i think that 99 % of our citi ca n't satisfi the increas request of servic from the driver .
