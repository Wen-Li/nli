i agre with the previou statement sinc dure my high school year i have notic that it is extrem import to understand certain idea and concept , but mostli understand how to appli them to our life . onc you understand a concept , it is easier to get an entir pictur of what you are be taught and it is also faster and easier to understand ani follow explan on these same concept . when it come to an exam , it is easier to discuss an idea and agre or disagre with it by use a reason argument . on the other hand , it is also import for student to learn some fact becaus some academ aspect of subject such as histori and scienc can onli be absorb with our memori , and thi is done by just rememb date , name or number . there is no understand involv in thi process , which mean that to a certain extent i also disagre with thi statement . some area such as econom requir that student realli get to understand some theori and idea , an exampl of thi could be the understand of the keynesian or monetarist theori , but at the same time it is import that in thi same subject some fact learn is also implement ; an exampl of thi could be the learn of econom definit such as `` ceteri paribu '' or `` mutati mutandi '' . i decid to bring up thi scenario due to the complex of some area within a student 's studi , but most importantli to the fact that sometim it is import to combin both reason and memori in our daili learn task . i actual believ that the most import of these two concept be brought up in the passag is to understand idea and concept . some of the most capabl and intelig be in the world have reach their social , econom and it can be also argu that spiritu posit by understand life and it 's process , but also by learn to listen to other and understand the human behaviour . base on these thought , i would argu that understand idea and concept is most import than learn fact .
