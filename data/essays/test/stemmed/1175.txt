some peopl think that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun , but other peopl think that young peopl give enough time to help their commun . i think that mani young peopl do not give enouth time to help the other becaus they tell that they have n't mani time to spend for the commun . it is not true , becaus if a person want to do someth for the societi he can do it . the time is onli an excus . mani young peopl prefer to use their free time play or do differ activ that they like most . for exampl , in my school there are a lot of boy that , after the lesson , go to join theirselv . they do not give ani time to help their commun . after the school , i take the train ; i go to milan all the day and i arriv at home veri tire , but i do differ activ to help my commun . i help the old men and women ; i go to play with the children and i go with them to school to do the homework . the peopl do not pay me : i am a volunt . i also teach cathol religion to children and i veri happi to do someth for my commun . i agre with the statement : in my small town there are onli few peopl that do give their time to help the other . the time that the young peopl use for other is not enough and i think that we could do more for our commun : in the futur time , we will want that some peopl will do give time to help us .
