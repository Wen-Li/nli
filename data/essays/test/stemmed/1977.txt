i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well as the follow reason . first , tri new thing and take risk give us new oppotun to success . for exampl , when i wa a senior student in waseda univers , a privat univers in tokyo , japan , i went to yeons univers , a privat univers in seoul , south korea for studi for a year . at that time , economi in tokyo wa not so bad and i had some chanc to get job instead of fli to oversea . but i did not enter the compani in japan and visit korea becaus i want to learn korean languag and cultur veri much and expand my horizen . actual , that wa veri riski for me , becaus i did not have ani prepar after i graduat from korean univers . howev , i have never lose my job sinc i graduat from the univers . addit , i found my wife in korea too . if i would have not been to korea , i could not have gotten such a happi life . so i believ that tri new thing and take risk is import for be success peopl . second , tri new thing and take risk can be a chanc to find peopl 's own prefer . for exampl , i have chang my job three time . thi is not a commen in my counti , japan , at my age 30 . but , final i can say with confid that i could find my best job that i would do thi job until i would be abl to work . so , i believ that if peopl want to success , they need to tri new thing and take risk . in conclus , i strongli believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i will tri to enter mba cours next year . thi would be a risk .
