i think that the progress made by techonolog develop and the need for more power mean of transport will lead our societi to use less and less car to go from one place to anoth . govern of lot of countri tri to prompt the public transport ; for exampl in itali there are a lot of advantag if you take ticket for buse and underground that last for month or at least two week the compani that manag the transport make you pay less than the ticket bought everi day . but not onli he conveni make you use the public transport : the fact that in larg citi ( and in the futur there will be more and more larger citi ) you can move from one side of the citi to other stay onli minut on the underground ; you can imagin how mani peopl will be around in the futur ( we are 6 billion today ) and you can imagin what if everyon would take the car to go somewher : everyon would be stuck in traffic all the ay long ! so it is reason that more and more peopl will use public transport to move rapidli . anoth import problem connect with the use of car by everyon is that the pollut would becam a menac for our health , what if billion of car would be around in a world that even today suffer from enviroment problem ; even today we experiec the consequ of air pollut : increas of diseas and lumb cancer . some intitut tri to overcom thi problem by stop the traffic for one or two day but thi is a remedi that is not suffici . the problem must be solv from the insid with drastic remedi . the third reason is the thechnolog develop which in the last year ha made giant footstep : engin will develop a fast , econom and respet of the environ mean of transport to meet the need of the grow societi and replac the use of car . so to summar i think that futur will be character by highi effici mean od transport like high veloc train or someth like that to move rapidli from one place to anoth respect the enviro .
