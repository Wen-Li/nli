within the past decad , i have had the privilag of be abl to travel to a wide varieti of place . some of my travel have been in a group with a tour guid , while other have been just my famili and i . the deciss rest sole on the purpos of the trip and , of cours , on what you expect to take with you from the experi . i have found that when travel in a group with a tour guid , one is constrain by a specif schedul alreadi plan out and by the speed the group is will to move . although thi might be a littl anoy and exhaust at time , it is suitabl if one is look forward to be enrich by the inform the tour guid priovid from the point of interest . usual , the tour guid is vastli learn in the differ cultur , languag and custom of the place one is to visit . thi will defenitli be an advantag , not just for the learnig aspect of it , but becaus it will enabl the group to comun much more acur in a fore countri . yet , if the reason for travel is just visit a place to experi it as the day go by , then have a tour guid would not make much sens . but , i have found that combin both way of travel can be as gratifi . thi could be done in a cruis ship . in my honeymoon , i whent to differ countri in the mediteranean includ itali , spain , franc , and greec . in the cruis , there are sever choic to explor these countri which includ differ guid tour to point of interest or just get off the ship and explor what the countri ha to give . my wife and i decid that we would go on tour in the countri which we had not alreadi visit and get off the ship and explor in the one we alreadi knew our way around . in some case , after the tour were over , we still had time to roam around the fore citi and villag . so , thi way , we got to experi the best of both world . the ideal way to travel is by have in mind what one is look for in a specif trip and then decid if have a tour is worth it or not .
