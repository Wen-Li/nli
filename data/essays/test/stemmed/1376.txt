the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . ye , i agre with it . just becaus if you travel to some new place where you have never gone befor , you dont even know where to go and you will be spend most of the time think where to go , find out the place where it is , and to organis those thing . when you have a tour guid he or she will take u to the place where all to go , becaus they alway have organ shedul the thime will be save and it can be use to go and watch some other place . ye , if at all unless peopl need privaci to go around with , it better opt to have a tour guid when you are travel . becaus the tour guid will be know the histori of those place where all you visit , so it not onli visit those place even you can know about the histori . even when you go to some new place , you dont realli know anyon over there , you wont feel that safe to go over all the place , so when there is someon to take you to all place you realli dare to visit all of them . that too when you go with travel guid he will be have hi own vehic and all of hi own , so there wont be ani sort of problem . the main thing is that you have mani peopl in the group , most offten they wont be from the same place , so you come to know about mani peopl and their cultur . you will be have much more fun in a group than when you are seper . unless or other wise you realli want privaci to go around with , you can go all alon ani of the day , it not realli that u have go onli with guid if you hire him . the other day you can again join them . so , i realli think that the best way to travel is in gropup led by a tour guid .
