some peopl argu that understand idea and concept is more import for studentsthan than learn fact . in my opinion , both understand idea and concept and learn fact are of great import . in the follow discuss , i will illustr my point in detail . there is no escap the fact that understand idea and concept is veri import for student . fact are fact , and they are not self-explainori . one of the purpos of learn is to teach idea and concept to student in order to make these fact more obviou to them . for exampl , whi these thing happen ? how will they evolv ? how will they come to an end ? whether could make predict about thing ? so , understand these concept and ideasi veri import . howev , learn fact is also import becaus it can help student better understand the idea and concept that they have learn . i have such experi that if content of the class are all about idea and concept , student will have great troubl understand them . first , idea and concept are quit bore . it is extrem hard for them to concentr on the learn of idea and concept . second , idea and concept are usual too abstract to understand . they may not well understand what these thing are about . so , they need some some relat fact to help them to understand . what is more , accord to my experi , learn fact is quit interest . fact and phenomena can easili attract student ' attent . first , they are concret and easi to understand . student will alway be glad to learn someth easi , perhap the reason is their confid may be destroy by difficult thing easili . second , student will be happi to see that what they have learn are use and can explain some fact . if what they have learn are not use , it must be quit frustrat . in sum , i think both understand idea and concept and learn fact are indispens in the learn process , and combin them will benefit student a lot when they are lear .
