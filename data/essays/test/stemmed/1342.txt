some peopl agre that most advertis make product seem much better than their realiti . howev , i strongli disagre that product are advertais with emphasi for the follow reason . first , mani compani have to inform realiti for custom . if they emphas their product through advertis , they should pernish by not onli law but also societi . for exampl , there are mani incid about unfair compani . to lie about mani thing where their product made in , when their product made , what they use in their product , and so on . these behavior destroy their credit from custom and client . after incid , almost compani could not recov their credit and drop out . in addit , mani custom understand what product wiht high qualiti . advertis give custom onli first impress about product . it is import that custom buy product repeatli . for exampl , in my compani , oil compani in japan , we do not have mani advertis . we think that advertis are not larg influenc for custom . we strongli believ that the qualiti of product and servic are more import . mani competit use much cost for their product use famou person . in my opinion , they have to use their cost for develop their new product or qualiti of product . in conclus , i definit believ that most advertas make product better than they realli are .
