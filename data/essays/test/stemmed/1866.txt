i will becom a manag , i 've decid to work in mani differ structur , with differ peopl , so i agre with thi statement for a lot of reason . first i 'm young and i do n't know what i will like to do in twenti year for exempl . i do n't reckon we can kept the same passion dure hi all life . so i prefer be generalist than a specialist , becaus i want to be abl to chang my job when i desir . have the choic of our futur is essenti to my mind . moreov in my point of view the societi is veri complex now . befor we could be a specialist and sudi a probem with onli one academ subject . but now evri situat requir differ compet . when i learn sociolog , we learn polit and psycholog too . when a student today want to becom a scientif special in biolog for exempl , in fact he must learn mathemat and other academi subject . the real question would be abl to be : what is a specialist now ? are specialist exist realli ? i think not . besid the work in team , that increas now , demonstr the fact that we ca n't be onli a specialist . i would ad that i reckon the special is an ennemi for the democraci . in my point of view it can decreas the link between everi citizen . becaus everyon close himself in a specif subject and forget other citizen . furthermor i think that we can forget the valu of the other scienc , so we would criticis the work of the other . in a world where the racism is so import , the link between each citizen is a veri huge goal for our futur .
