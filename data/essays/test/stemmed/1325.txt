when it come to the advertis , there is a controversi over the issu that how reliabl they realli are . inspit of show the qualiti and featur of the product , the major of the advertis make the product seem better and not so reliabl to custom . admittedli , advertis play an import role of show the product to custom . they introduc the new product to the peopl who are not familiar with the product . advertis can show the shape , the color , the textil vividli to the peopl in front of the tv or comput , give inform and make a link between the product and the custom . howev , what ha mention abov is a one-sid statement . usual the inform from advertis is not so reliabl . advertis sometim show the advantag that the product do not have . for instanc , tea is good for human health , but some advertis say their tea can also help peopl to lose weight , which will not affect the custom when they drink it . the advertis alway show too mani advantag of their produt to be reliabl . furthermor , the advertis often emphas too much on one good aspect and do not say the bad aspect of the product . the produt may have that advantag to other product , but it can not be supprem , and it must ha some disadvantag . for exampl , when you by a car of toyota , it advertis is alway about the save of ga , while the advertis never say the speed disadvantag to other brand like ford . so the advertis si less reliabl becaus they onli show the good aspect and emphas too much on good aspect . to sum up , as far as i am concern , the advertis make the product too good to be consum .
