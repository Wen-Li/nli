i do agre with the abov statement and at the same do not complet disagre with it . advertis do make much better than they realli are . for exampl a great industri with veri good fame and heavi background advertis their product with heavi public . when the item is be releas in the market with great starcast they bring an impact on the public that the produt is veri good even though if it is not that good and thi is onli due to the public given by them through advertis . public is go to be final affect by the see the advertis . mani product are be releas in the market everday , but everi product is not such worth and that use to the public . most of them are worthless , they are onli good for advertis and not for usag . for exampl the a wire shown in an advertis may be veri strong to say , but when come to the gener usag it might not have that impact as advertis . come to the posit side of it , whenev there is an introduct of ani new product then without ani knowledg of the product no costum is go to buy it . so advertis doe not alway mislead us , but may even give us the knowledg about the product . treat everi advertis to be the same might again mislead us . as everi outcom ha two result and the end result depend onli on the way way we take it , the work of an individu is to get knowledg about the product not onli from the advertis . gather knowledg onli through advertis is the worst procedur of gain knowledg . cosid an item to be the best is not final by the advertis but done by the end user .
