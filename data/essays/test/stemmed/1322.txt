i believ that most advertis do realli make product seem much better , handi , and necessari for daili use , than they realli are . it should not be surpris to say that ; sinc the ultim goal of the advertis is to convinc you to buy thing , whether you need them or not . first of all we need to be specif on the type of the advertis we are discuss about . some product need to be advertis , some other do not becaus you may alreadi know what you actual need . for instanc an advertis of a new car if it 's a unknown brand serv well for the product sale sinc an ordinari custom doe not consid buy that specif brand . first he or she need to be convinc by the advertis to chang hi or her car . second they need to be convinc to buy that brand , so it 's a two level process . the same logic appli for everi item that is rare bought and mayb expens as well . the actual problem is to spread the messag that even a person is happi with hi car , advertis have the power to illustr the situat otherwis , present an option that there are be better and cheaper car to be bought . thu the role of the advertis can be understood better if we consid the subject from thi perspect . the other type of advertis are of some type of brand which do n't need to spend larg amount of money for advertis . veri good qualiti brand , brand that target a specif type of custom ( incom , social statu etc ) , or product that are for use of onli one gender do not need strike advertis . you can not be deceiv by an advertis of a toy as an adult . you are not interest in make-up apparel if you are a man or without a wife . similar to that exampl if you are a passion bmw driver , the ad of merced do not atrract your desir . therefor such brand have less intent to make their product look better on ad . to conclud it would be better to say that it is true for an advertis to be convinc . but it is up to you from which one you would be attract most .
