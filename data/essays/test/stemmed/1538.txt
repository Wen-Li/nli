i agre with the statement that say that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . in thi essay i will explain my opinion briefli . first , i believ that ani success man is creativ . a person who take the oppotun come hi way and chang it to the form that is use for him . for exampl , i have a friend who is veri creativ and good worker . she wa emploey in a clinic build , and she wa not happi about her job . she tri to open a restaur without have ani knowledg in that field . she work for a while in a restaur , and then she open her . she wa veri success in her busi . she improv her incom to a big extent . second reason that hold my opinion is that mani peopl who do not tri new thing remain stuck to their condit . for exampl , my cousin ha been work as a cook for more than 20 year , and he will never chang becaus he doe not like to experi new thing . third , life is veri short but it give the desir for the peopl who work dilig . if anyon doe not take chanc in hi life , hi life will be bore and he will not be abl to improv it . if a person work hard in hi field without chang or tri new thing , he will end up as a failur . in conclus . if you want to be success in your life , you should take chanc an tri new thing in your life . otherwis you will end up with the same man who never chang .
