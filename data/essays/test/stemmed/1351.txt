i live in a countri where we have to learn a lot of differ subject until we are 18 or 19 year old . i realli think we can have differ point of view on thi subject . let 's write down the good and the bad point of each proposit befor make a conclus . have a broad knowledg is veri import as it is a basi . you ca n't make a realli good specif without ani core knowledg . that is whi you have to studi variou subject befor specialz . you also can improv your personn cultur by learn a lot of subject , which will creat a strong basi veri import to be adapt and even open-mind , on topics-of scienc for exampl - . moreov , when you are young you often do n't want to know what you want to do in the futur . in that case , learn a lot of differ thing on differ subject can keep all solut possibl for you . it close at least no door . learn realli specif thing permit you to have a great compet on a subject . it may permit you to work faster with shorter studi which can obvious be a great thing . then , when you special a lot , you can make realli long studi and mayb get a good job . when you realli hate certain subject or realli love other , their is no hesit to make : just special . if you realli enjoy biolog , stop learn litteratur . thi kind of educ permit you to be a real champion on a subject , it 's certain , but i hope you realli , realli love it . i think that it is realli import to have a certain number of core compet that you must learn as long as possibl . it 's a difficult thing to choos between math and geographi , or litteratur and biolog , so it can be a good thing to be abl to have a high knowledg in all those subject . as a matter of fact , i had big problem to choos what subject or main field i realli want to studi after have left high school and it might be hard to think that you are studi a subject instead of anoth .
