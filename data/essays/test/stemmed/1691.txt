i agre with the statement given as `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . the reason for hold such an opinion are given below . first one is , if a person succe in do a thing newli for the first time , he is call success for the first time . but if he repeat the same thing for mani time , he may not get recognit or appreci as he got for the first time becaus it is usual for that person to be success in that respect . for exampl , take cricket . rahul dravid is a good technic batsmen . when he first arriv and display hi skill in bat , he got huge recognit and appreci from the great of the cricket world . it becam casual and veri normal when he bat nice becaus it is the same thing he ha been do from first . second one is that we must keep tri new thing to be call success by all the peopl everi time we succeed . succeed in do a new thing instead of usual one bring a huge reput , recognit and admir . for exampl , take the abov exampl of cricket . rahul is a batsmen . it common for him to bat nice everi time . but when he decid to keep wicket and succeed in do it , he gain a lot of admir and recognit from the entir cricket world . one more reason for support abov argument is that even though , a success person doe n't becom success when he tri a new thing , he gain some recognit from the world for atleast tri a new thing differ from routin . he may be appreci for the effort he put into in do a new thing . thi may not happen if the person fail do a same old thing everi time . for exampl take movi . if a director fail in bring a new view of an alreadi known point or a new point , he get recognit from the peopl for hi effort . but he fail in do the same old thing , hi posit will be veri advers .
