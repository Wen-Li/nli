i complet agre with the fact that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . .. onc a person becom succes , a level of confid develop in him . thi self-confid inspir him to go ahead and to tri someth innov . the present success elimin the fear of be failur in hi innov . i want to support my claim with one of the recent exampl happen in indian automobil industri . the name of tata ( a giant compani in the field of automobil , servic sector and metal industri in india ) is well known . the credit of success gow to the ceo of the co . mr. ratan tata . be a success person in hi field he thought to give a cheap but technic advanc car to lower middl class peopl of india . he announc the price of car month back onli $ 2500 . everybodi in automobil industri amus him that it will not possibl to launch a car in just $ 2500 . he took it as a challang and state work on hi innov idea with hi select team member . after one year of complet dedic , vision and self-confid he final launch the car name nano . whole world surpris to see the tecnic expert and the cost of such a car . thi thi quit new and innov thing can be done by a success person onli . a commonman struggl for hi first success can not think beyond hi day to day do well . alway the new thing do not work . sometim there is risk involv in innov . suppos the concept of the car , what tata had creat would not came true , then also the tata compani and mr. ratan tata continu to surviv . onli thing is that thi risk can be taken by succes person and they continu to take . world is full of innov thing and materi . how they evolv ? how they came into exist ? at some or other point of time some person had taken risk to innov quit new thing and in my opinion they are success person . if at some stage peopl will satisfi with hi achiev and stop tri new thing then invent and develop will stop . exampl of `` thoma alwa edis '' is with us . one after other invent he made and did not stop until hi bodi allow him to work . if he had stop after hi first invent we would not get the electr bulb or gramophon today . if after discoveri of `` photo-electr effect '' albert einstein had stop think on new idea , the world of physic would not be heard about the `` theori of rel '' even till today . these are onli some exampl from the lot all over wold , when a success person tri new thing and he/sh gave someth new to thi world .
