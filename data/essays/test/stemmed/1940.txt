the issu at hand is wheather or not advertis make product seem better than they realli are . thi issu is import becaus advertis have great influenc on the consum . i agre with the statement becaus i think that advertis make promiss that the product ca n't fullfil . the first reason whi i think my choic is right is that especi young peopl do n't realiz how they are influenc . for exampl a ten year old boy or girl are not abl to recogn that the product in the commerci seem much better than they realli are . they see onli realli fantast and cute thing and want to bay thi stuff right know . but when they have for exampl the toy they saw in the commerci children are often unhappi becaus the toy is smaller or broke up realli fast . so i think kid need parent who understand what advertis do to product . anoth reason whi i believ that advertis make product better than they are is that food seemt often better in the advertis or commerci than they are . i tri a lot of food which look delici but when i bay it or tast it it wa n't realli good . for thi reason i think that peopl need a lot of compet to be not influenc by advertis . the last reason whi i think that advertis make product look better than they are is my use of cosmet in the past , influenc by advertis . a lot of cosmet , especi make up seem much better than they realli are . so for exampl women in the commerci look absolut fantast , have great eye , lip and skin . but the product do n't fullfil what peopl expect when they bay thi stuff . in conclus , thi are the reason whi i think that the statement abov is truth .
