i disagre with the statement ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' . although a tour guid is help in some case and it is true that thi save a lot of time and avoid common mistak which peopl often make dure the trip , i believ that travel alon is a better choic which give more freedom to peopl and is easier to get involv into the local enviro . firstli , it would be cheaper to travel alon . one of my friend , who work in a travel agent , told me that they charg differ to peopl in order to retain their profit at a signic level . he ha calcul the cost for me onc , the basic cost is less than fifti percent of what a custom actual paid ! what can you say more about that ? secondli , travel individu can lead you to place where you desir to go , not place with full of junk . tour guid alway take travel to place where are cheap or where they can share dividend from . regardless ani mean of the place , they often recommend travel to buy some soverni or local product which is to be fake and much more expens than anywher els , just simpli they can share a percentag . thirdli , an import issu of travel is to see what peopl 's life like in the other side of the world , travel alon ha the benefit that where you go is where you have chosen . for instanc , you can walk to anywher in a small town to see how peopl 's life is without ani time limit , it give much more freedom to you . in gener , although travel alon ha some disadvang such as need more time for prepar . i still believ it is the most effici way of know the world .
