nowaday media play a more and more import role in our daili life , as we are expos to it almost all day long , whereev we go . the economi of cours make use of thi by tri to influenc us with advertis . thi howev rais the question , whether the product advertis are actual as good as they are promis to be . one might think that the qualiti of an advertis reflect the qualiti of the product , becaus if the compani ha much money to spend on the advertis , their product sell well and thu need to be good . thi howev doe not necessarili need to be true , as one soon discov a loophol in thi theori : if a compani for whatev reason ha a lot of money in the first place and can spend much of it on an advertis , peopl might think that the product is good when it actual is not . and yet the compani make profit and can now spend even more money for advertis for bad product . the sole intent of an advertis is to influenc the consum to believ that the product is good by prais it and hide ani fact which might hinder thi effect . but i think it is veri well known that ad tend to lie . comput anim and special effect can easili be use to make a car appear shini , fast and power , drive in a beautil landscap to creat the illus that thi car is good . there are mani way how advertis can creat desir in us or let us think that a product is good . for instanc the usag of color when advertis medicin : one would rather buy medicin advertis with white and blue color , which make us think that it is clean and steril , than one advertis with dark color such as brown , which one associ with dirt . thi howev doe not give ani inform about how well the medicin work and yet one prefer the first one just becaus of the better advertis . so in conclus , i believ that the statement that advertis make product seem better than they realli are is true becaus of the mani way to incfuenc the consum without him notic it .
