some peopl agre that the travel led by a tour guid is more effect than self-paln tour . howev , i firmli believ that if you studi yourselv a lot of inform about the tour site , you can enjoy a joy trip , . besid , if you travel with a guid , it can be harm for your joy and he/sh can interven in your trip . first of all , travel is the optim opporttun to think myself and develop myself by learn a lot of thing such as indep . that is , if you can prepar for the trip suffici , you do n't need a tour guid . for exampl , when i have travel in europ last year , i had to prepar thoroughli and studi a lage amount of the site where i would visit . it wa veri impress experi me becaus i can go through a lot of hardship such as a miss of road . if i had travel in a group led by guid , i could not learn a live knowledg and improv my indep . in addit , if i can go om a trip with familiar friend without a guid , wh can enjoy whatev we want , it mean that tour guid can interrupt our liberti of the tour schedul . in my experi , when i wa travel in a thiwan with my friend , i had to follow the guid schedul , it wa veri exhaust and i could nor enjoy my trip as weel as concontr on ani beauti scene sinc we have to move all over the site plan by schedul . therefor , my familiy came dome with a sick after the trip . if it had not bene for the tour guid we can enjoy more leisur and comfort , consequ , i sincer believ that a group led by a tour guid can not be a best way to travel . not onli peopl can not have a opportun to develop their indep and their own time , but they can also interrupt their comfort trip by a guid . therefor , the best way to travel is studi yourselv a lot of thing about your tour area and plan on your own . then , it can be a more fruit and comfort trip .
