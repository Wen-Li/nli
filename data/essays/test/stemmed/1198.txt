while some peopl say that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , i strongli believ that success peopl do not alway tri new thing or take risk . to begin with , some peopl succeed becaus they have creativ or imagin a littl differ from everyon els . for instanc , 10 year ago , there were a lot of social network servic compani in japan . in that situat , no one could predict which compani would succeed becaus there were not ani differ in their busi . among them , a compani , mixci , becam onli on success compani in japan becaus it advertis way wa a littl differ from other competitor . it target onli young japanes peopl . there wa not ani drastic differ between the compani 's ad way and that of competitor . the differ wa in it target . in view of thi , i believ creativ a littl differ from other are the most import factor to succeed . furthermor , some peopl succeed by util risk share method . to illustr , in busi some entrepreneur begin and succeed their busi by the help of ventur capitalist . accord to the survey conduct by a famou japanes newspap compani , about 80 percent of the start-up compani list in tokyo stock exchang were help by ventur capit or other investor when they start their busi . in view of thi , take risk doe not alway lead busi to succeed . in conclus , i strongli support the thought that success peopl do not alway tri new thing and take risk . i believ that success peopl have creativ and imagin a littl differ from other ordinari peopl .
