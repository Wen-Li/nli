i complet agre with thi statement sinc mani product never prove what they promis . everyon know how compani advertis their product , you can hear them on the radio , see the in magazin , newspap or simpli open your eye when you are walk along the street . our daili life is full with advertis - some are more notic for us , some are less . but they all share the same idea of their produc , - to get into our mind and remind us in case we need a product . sinc our ecomomi is so overload with compani offer the same product , everyon is tri to sell at most . everi compani is invest more and more money in the product of a sucessful advertis rather than they invest in research or for the product itself . for a low valu product , with no research expens they can fulli invest in the advertis , sinc thi is the fact that make consum buy the product . initi we dont care about the materi use creat thi product or how much time and effort wa invest in research . sinc childhood we are train to listen to advertis , therefor everi compani is tri their best to make their product on the advertis as much appeal to us as possibl , if we need thi product or not , we still listen are see the advertis . for sure advertis are not alway tell the truth or prove the test they have undergon to success lead in their rang among all other product . thi is the way compani are compet among each other and everyon is ad more fact which are not true . that whi peopl know mani product do n't prove what they promis in their advertis . the simpl reason whi well known compani are lie to us is in order to increas their sale to make the consum buy thi product expect result they never can get . i see the situat is chang , compani want to be seen as thrustworthi and therefor start to invest more money in genuin research , test , to prove the expect of a product .
