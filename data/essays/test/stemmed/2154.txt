the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are is convinc to me . when i think about main purpos of advertis , that is to maximis profit , i can get clearer pictur as a whole . these are two reason that support my opinion . firstli , advertis use ` quot ' but do not use it as a simpl way . in other word , advertis do not tell whole truth about the product that compani tri to sell . for exampl , movi produc often quot some critic ' review of their movi like - `` funni and thrill , but no more - xxx news '' . in thi sentenc , advertis use onli part it need like thi - `` funni and thrill '' . in part it is still true but the advertis is not give potenti custom the whole truth about it movi . the advertis make the movi seem better through quot critic 's review in a distort way . secondli , advertis use exagger to maxis an impact of their messag to cusom . for exampl , in the advertis of car insur , a car accid occur to mother and daughter in the middl of the night where are no passign car . thi advertis make view , who have a car , worri and scare . howev , when peopl care think about the situat it is not convinc becaus there is no explan whi the accid happen and whi the mom and daughter in that danger situat . the advertis express onli extrem situat which we might never meet in life time . in conclut , becaus main goal of the advertis is make profit most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . quot and exaggert are two main solut of advertisemet .
