the idea and concept and fact are both import tool that will be use to in educ . sometim , these two teach method are integret in the class teach , sometim , the teacher will more emphas one tool than anoth in some particular subject . which one is impor is a controversi and complex issu , differ teacher have differ view from their respect angl . as is well know and often be advoc by mani peopl , mani peopl start to start from the concept . mani other insist that fact and exampl are more effect in teach . i believ that in some subject , fact will be much more effecit to help the student to undertand what the teach want to expess . for exampl , when i studi in busi manag in busi school , the teacher tell us that constant innov is the most import factor to maintain success for a compani . to illustr thi point of view and ideal , he find a exampl of ibm . the teacher told us , although ibm invent pc in 1981 , which is the first invet of person comput in the world . howev , becaus ibm do n't continu to put effort in innov on design and technolog for pc , ibm quicli loos the lead posit in thi market . as we all known , ibm had to sell thi busi in 2003 to lenovo . from thi exampl , all the classmat is veri easliy to underst that constant inov is veri import . becaus from the stori and fact that ibm fail in pc busi clearli show that even ibm is a huge and lead compani in the world , but becaus they did not keep it up to constantli innov , the big blue giant also will be deafet . in thi instanc , we can see , fact are more interest , clear , impress when you want to express a veri complext idea and concept , expeci the concept and idea in busi manag , human behavior , histori and mani subject that peopl learn knowledg from observ and experi . but in some subject , which is more abstract and need to use a lot of concept , then use t be conlud . mayb , the first thing is to help the student to set up a deep and clear understand about the concept and ideal . i rememb , in the math class at colleg , at the begin , we must underst , what is the real number , what is the absolut valu , what is decim , and mani other concept firstli . then we can use these concept to conlud some more complex conclusiont . in thi kind of subject , all the concept are creat by human be , it is we creat the theori of algebra , geograpi and logic . if we do n't understanf the basic concept , you can not understand the more deep conhes theori in the futur . all in all , n my point of view , i think thi complex issu should be access under a case by case basi . which is the best way to decid which teach method should be use is highli relat what the content of teach is .
