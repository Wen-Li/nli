i agre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' becaus i realli tast it . not onli advertis , but also spot on tv make believ that . not all spot are true . they show the product as they want the product is seen by peopl . thi is a terribl and huge mistak by the publicitarian becaus peopl go to the shop , buy th product and then client are not satisfi by the product itself . for exampl thi mistak can be relat to the bought of a pair of jean , like in my case . after i saw a paper public of a pair of jean , last week i went to rinascent in monza to buy that pair of jean . onc i wa arriv , i went to the first floor look for the jean and when i found them i wa realli surprais becaus they were not seem to be like the one 's on the paper advertis . when i saw that , i did not buy the jean and i went to anoth shop in which i found a pair of pant that i realli enjoy . anoth exampl is what is non-ment in and an advertis : pherap the product can seem beauti but it can be veri and much expens . it is all a question of languag use for show product . there are differ type of languag and it is necesseri find out the most appropriet to show a product . nobodi say that is necesseri follow fashion , rather than advertis . it stay at each person judg if a spot is true or not . fortun there are differ way of think e so everyon can make hi chois independ by other . everyon ha freedom of think and it is veri , veri import to make one 's chois .
