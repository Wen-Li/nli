i disagre with the statement . inde , advertis make product seem better than they realli are becaus it is the purpos of the advertis , but i think , for most peopl , they do n't seem `` much '' better than the realiti . first , advertis today emphas more on their good imag than the capac or function themselv . for exampl , an avertis of shampoo which show that a famou actress use it improv their imag but do n't indic the function is much better than other one . an dvertis of soft drink show just imag of cool feel but it do n't say it is much better . secondli , most advertis ca n't make product much better than they realli are becaus most poepl know that most advertis includ exagger . for exampl , even if an advertis of an airlin show that a man on a first class seat sleep well , poepl do n't mislead becaus peopl know that the nois of airplan and the fact that few peopl can afford to buy ticket of first class . for exampl of shampoo abov , most ladi know they can not be as beauti and charm as the actress even if they use the shampoo . moreov , consum can get more inform on the internet directli from other consum nowaday . they are no longer rip off . third , here in japan , the law forbid fals advertis includ too much exagger and too mislead express . i think it is the same in mani other countri . the japanes govern becam more concern about protect consum . recent , the director of the compani which make the fals advertis show that everyon can easili their weight by their suppliment . the peopl demand compani moral about advertis more rigor than the past . that ' whi i disagre the statement .
