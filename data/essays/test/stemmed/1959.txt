i hope that thi statement will come true , but honestli i do n't believ it . there are a lot of good invent on the go now , for exampl car drive with solar energi or with oil made out of plant - but still the oil industri is too power . in my opinion the oil industri is do everyth to block altern invent like that . they want the peopl to be depend on oil , so that they can make money . so they encourag the automobil industri to build car who make a lot of environ pollut . anoth point is the grow popul in the rich countri . peopl are get older so they are abl to drive longer . the result are more car in the street . anoth reason is that peopl have to be flexibl becaus of their job nowaday . they want to live in a peac littl cottag in a quiet rural area but the work place is in the next citi , so they often have to drive hundr of kilometr to work and are on the street for hour . everyth ha to be conveni and comfort . nobodi want to make compromis . i 'm sorri if i sound kind of bitter and disappoint , but that 's my point of view . i 's one of my biggest wish that one day there is an invent that make movement without pollut possibl .
