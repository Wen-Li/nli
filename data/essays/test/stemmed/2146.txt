advertis are so common in modern time that most peopl are guid by them . as a shop-hunt , when i go to shoppl , i alway pay much attent to the good whcih have lot of advertis . howev , i wa mislead onc and onc again . in my opioion , the advertis make product seem much better than realli are . sometim the differ between the product and them in advertis are just result of misunderstand of languag . the purpos for the compani to advertis is to introduc their product and attract custom to buy . to reach the goal , they need to use attact word and explan . howev , sometim we chang the mean of those word . a famou product in china , which call brain gold , ha some advertis say that it make peopl to have a good sleep . peopl get the idea that it may improv sleep condit as a medicin and have a good impress on it . howev , the real function for the product is that it contain some organ materi which can help peopl sleep but not have last influenc . also , somem product look better than it realli is becaus of the comfort light in the advertis . onc i saw a beauti hat on tv and thought it wa realli suit for me , bright and open . howev , when i saw it in the supermarket , i found it wa not as well as on tv . it contribut to the light in the advertis which make the hat much bright and good-look . our eye lie to us and give us some wrong informaiton . on some other case , the advertis alway use method of phycolog to give us wrong detail of the product . when we sit togeth and have a lunch , there is some product on the tv , for exampl , an video . the advertis is about what great view and happi time of a famili that the video can catch . all of us will feel comfort and make an good imprees of the product , even though sometim the video doe not act as well as on tv . in sum , i realli think that the advertis alway mislead us and make product seem much better . the compani catch our attent by use languag skill , light and the phycolog .
