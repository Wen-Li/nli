as to me , i prefer travel alon to travel in a group led by a tour guid . the reason is that i can enjoy the travel without restrict and also can experi foreign cultur themselv . first , if i travel alon , i can enjoy my leisur time fulli freeli . the most frequent complaint of peopl who are travel in a group is that they have littl time for their free activ . howev , travel alon can guarante that you can go around anywher you want to go and can stay there until you want to stay . thi is somth that group travel can not offer . second , travel alon provid more opportun for travel to experi other cultur . if you have guid who can help everyth you need , there is few chanc to experi the region you are travel . on the other hand , if you do n't have such guid , it is you who have to commun with the nativ peopl . through thi interact , you can realli learn about the area and peopl in there . all in all , i would like to choos travel alon rather than travel in a group with guid . not onli can i enjoy the time freeli , but also trueli experi other cultur .
