i realli agre with thi statement . nowaday young peopl are mostli tend to care about themselv . the develop of the technolog ha a critic role for that . teenag are mostli spend time by play video game and watch tv and they are isol when they spend time on these thing . becaus of that they lose their social abil . therefor they do not have feel like help their commun . they mostli live in their isol world and think about their problem . anoth big reason for that is the competit atmospher in all area . for exampl univers accept exam in turkey : everi student tri to do better than other student . and meanwhil they do n't care about other peopl . anoth good exampl would be the job . everybodi is tri to get in a higher posit at work . young peopl are so ambiti that they can do everyth to get a better posit . they do n't wish anyth good for other . of cours there are alway except . there are some peopl , who are be happi and satisfi when they help their commun . but i do not get to know peopl like that veri often . anoth simpl daily-lif exampl can be seen in public transport vehicl . it is an ethic rule that you should give your seat to an older man/woman if he/sh can not find a seat to sit . but most of the young peopl pretend to be asleep when they see elderli peopl or they pretend as if they did n't see them . even onc my friend pretend to be a foreign when an old man ask , if he could sit on my friend 's seat . and my friend did as if he wa not understand him . shame on him . . i hope we tri to teach the new gener that they should help and respect their commun . thi is a big problem for the futur . we live on the world togeth . we share the world . we should tri to help each other . i think young peopl would see their mistak if they tast the satisfact they get , when you help other .
