in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . accord to me , that would be a dream becom true becaus i think that we live in a way too much pollut world . to stick back to the subject , i think that there will be less car in the futur . in pari , drive drive peopl crazi , especi sinc our mayor creat corridor for the buse . our mayor , bertrand delano , ha also accru the number of buse for the day and amelior the night bu servic which are both realli good thing . so more peopl are use the buse than befor and are leav their car in their car park . also , when you live in big citi , at certain time , it take you less time to go somewher when you use the bu or the subway than if you had taken your car . traffic-jam are horribl in pari , everybodi yell at everybodi ; everybodi is be rude and impolit also it is realli stress and get on everybodi 's nerv . if you want to go to the countrysid , you can take the train , and while , you are travel , you can do whatev you want , you can read , phone , listen to music , sleep , eat . . but when you are drive , you can not do all these thing , no , you have to watch the road with attent , you can not fall asleep . drive is realli stress , you can not enjoy the view or the landscap , but onli look at the black asphalt of the road . i wa think of someth els also : in franc , everi year , we have mani car accid caus by alcohol abus . mayb these accid fear peopl and now they are less reluct to drive . for exampl : i know that if i am go to a parti with my friend and that i will drink overther , i would not feel secur to drive back my friend . an other element that can reduc the number of car on the road is the fact that now , some firm and compani ask their employe to share their car , to do what we call in franc ` co-driv ' . also , when i think of it , i know that sometim my mum feel lazi after work , and that she ha not got the courag to drive back home . so she take the subway and leav the car on the car-park of the compani , poor littl car , all alon in the dark , at night instead of be in the heaten car-park nearbi our hous !!!! sincer , i hope that in the futur , there will realli be less car , that peopl will more often use the public mean of transport or their bicycl . i would realli like our citi pari to be like one of these citi in china where everybodi travel with it bike .
