as we live in the era of inform , the chanc of learn thing becam easi . becaus of thi , we have to choos between just memor or to understand from the basic , in my opinion , it 's more import for studnet to understand basic idea and concept than just listen and memor the fact . becaus we can forget easili , and ca n't develop fact in the realiti , first , i think learn is not just memor fact . becaus fact are result came from a varieti of experi and test . so it 's realli import for student to redo that process onc again to learn the basic way how the fact were find out . as a result , they can truli understand and memor more effect . in my opionion , i fail my test becaus i just learn and memor fact . so i tri to understand how the fact were find out , then i could memor more effect and get higher grade , second , if we just learn the fact , we ca n't actual use them in the societi . for exampl , if we just learn the fact , `` two plu two is four '' we ca n't develop anymor like multipl or divin . which mean we ca n't use the fact effect . in my experi , when i wa in the elementri , i wa onli memor the answer from the book . i alway got perfect . but when i get test given by the school i go , i alway get 0 % . so i thought that i need to understand idea and concept by learn how to solv the problem that wa given throughout the test . in conclus , i think that understand idea is the most import than just learn and memor basic fact . if we have learn mind to understand idea not just memor fact , we will abl to memor more effect and can develop the basic fact to make it more logic and complic .
