about the question whether to prefer broad-bas educ over specialis in a specif subject , i firstli want to mention that it is not a question of strictli decid for one of the two option . actual , it is rather a question on how much one should tend to one option . and i also think that the answer of question can not be refer to as a gener solut for everi person , becaus each person is differ and ha other attribut make it better for him or her to obtain a broad educ or to concentr on a singl subject . my person point of view is that i rather prefer achiev a wide-spread educ in mani differ subject and aspect of these subject . thi is becaus i am convinc that thi method is most effect . onc one ha reach a certain level of knowledg in mani educ direct , it is much easier to learn new thing . for exampl , if you want to learn a languag , it is much easier if one alreadi know thing about the relat cultur and histor background . learn english for exampl , becom much more convini if one know , that it emerg from french and german and origin from latin , presum that one speak one of those languag . the second reason for me , person , ha to do with the attitud toward learn . i believ that learn doe not onli target on the gather of inform for the sake of their function recal in adequ situat , but that it is also an consider import instrument for form onc charact and the person evolv . thi mean , that if zou educ yourself in variou area , your person gain from thi knowledg is then also increas with to the same extent . relat to my introduct statement , it is also import to have at least one specif subject , which you are especi interest in . in my opinion , a broad educ can be imagin as the person base on which one can build and accumul great knowledg of a certain subject . i think that thi knowledg about one certain subject is ultim necessari for one 's person , becaus one can identifi with it and have a subject , that is realli belong to oneself , on which one realli know more than most other peopl . anoth reason speak for the emerg of outstand knowledg in at least one specif subject is in mz opinion as simpl as the expect one is confront by societi . a person can do so much more for societi , if it ha a so-cal profess , a word which fit the mean of thi describ specif subject veri well . without a profess , a person can probabl do mani thing quit well but noth veri well , so that there are scarc ani other peopl , that would be better in do it . all in all , i think that on one hand one should alway be readi to learn new thing and alway will to continu one person develop , which includ a broad educ . but on the other hand it is definet also import to find one specif subject suitabl for becom profession in it . the balanc between both of them ha to be determin by everi individu by itself .
