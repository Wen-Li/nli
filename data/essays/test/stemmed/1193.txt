that ' s a veri interest statement . i think that 's a problem we have to solv in our nowday life . but i do n't agre with the statement when it say that young peopl do n't give enough time to help their commun : i think they do n't give their time at all !! today young peopl are not involv in the problem of their commun becaus they do n't have time to realiz what 's wrong near them . they are too much occupi by follow the last music trend or to mimic one of the `` televis hero '' . they are just worri about how to be trendi ; how to be fashon and they don ' t care about anyth around them . i think thi phenomenon is veri common in the big citi : in thi kind of realiti is more easi to be fashon by advertis and all the materi stuff that everyday keep bomb in our head . when peopl grow in thi atmospher is veri difficult to make chang their point of view dure their life . i think the situat is differ in a littl citi where you live more close to the societi . in thi kind of realiti i think there are less way to escap from the everyday problem . so peopl are much involv to help their commun and to get interest in what they are surround by . the `` tragedi '' is that the big citi have more problem than the small one so they need more peopl to get involv ! they need more peopl to be motiv to solv some condit . i think thi is one of the problem of our era : to be too much far from the societi we live in and not to realiz that if everyon of us give just an hour of our time to help our commun thi societi could be better and our life too .
