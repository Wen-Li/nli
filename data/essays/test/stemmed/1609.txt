i do n't agre with the statement , in my opionion , the travel by myself is better than travel in group led by a tour guid . becaus i could be more freeabl , i do n't need to pay more money and i may increas the abil of self-control . first of all , if i travl by myself , i could have a more better plan , i think that is the most import reason for peopl to choos thi way to travel . in thi way , firstli i could choos how to go to the place and where place to go to , i also could when to leav . other , i do not need to go shop be the led . in mani travel group , they often take the peopl to buy some unus thing , and then the guid will get the benefit from the shop . secondli , if i am not with the guid , i do n't need to pay for them . in fact , we can buy some book to understand the histori of the famou place , we do not have to ask the guid . i believ the book will be more use . in the other hand , we could use the money to buy some other thing . i think it is better than give money to guid . thu , i prefer to travel by myself . the most import reason is i can improv the abil of self-control , it mean i need to kown a lot of the inform about the place i will go , i need to understand the purper of the travel , i need to plan all of the travel an i need to control the spend of money . i think these are veri crucial for myself . thi way also indic i will be a manag to decis someth . if i do it well , i must have more confid to face the life in futur . so , thi way of travel carri more weight than anoth one . to conclud , i think the travel by myself ha more adventag than those of led by guide.l could have own plan , i do not lose more money and i can get more abil , so i think that is my best choic to travel .
