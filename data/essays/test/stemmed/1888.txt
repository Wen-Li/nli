i agre with the statement . when we particip in a tour , we do n't need to get a lot of inform by ourselv . it is n't necessari for us to buy guidebook sinc the guid will teach us about the histori of the place or tell us what kind of food is good . so we can consentr on enjoy . in addit , we do n't need care about food . i mean when we do n't have ani idea about where we should buy food , we will be uneasi . but of cours the tour guid know where to eat and how to order . i give you an exampl . i am a japanes and when i went to canada by myself , i had a lot of difficulti in order at a restaur . it wa not onli becaus i am not a nativ speaker of english and they could n't understand what i wa tri to say , but also becaus i did n't know the way peopl live there pay . the way they pay wa realli differ from the way of japanes . it is realli difficult for us to know the custom the peopl live in the place we visit first . so it is import for us to be abl to depend on the tour guid who know almost everyth about the place . and , by particip in a tour , we can make friend with peopl who also particip in the tour . we may send e-mail each other after return to our own hous . my mother keep in touch with an elderli ladi who particip in the same tour . their relationship is realli good . moreov , particip in a tour is much safer for travelor than travel by themselv . it is often said that travelor are thought to have a lot of money and they are like to get robberd . for me , be abl to have onli a good memori dure trip is most import . if i get rob , i wo n't feel go there again . i am plan to visit itali thi spring . peopl often say that there are a lot of robber in itali . i want to enjoy visit beauti build there and eat delici pizza . so i will travel ib a group led by a tour guid . then i wo n't need to take a danger train or taxi .
