it is not easi to say if in twenti year there will be fewer car in use becaus main reason will be the develop of the differ societi and the economi . in thi time you need a higher mobil for work , i know mani peopl which have to drive a long trip to their work place and ticket for buss or train are still too expens , so it would make no differ for them at the moment . and of cours it is more comfort to ride the own car . but the natur ressourc get less and so we have to look for other and better possibl . i think in high econom standard region like europ or the usa will be fewer car in use in twenti year , but in other region where the birth rate is much higher and the economi is not so develop at all , there will be veri veri much potenti car driver in futur . one exampl is africa , there are so much peopl without anyth , but when the economi will boom , they want their own car . so even if the number of car is reduc in some nation , there will be more car over the world . for discuss the reduc of the car twenti year is a too small time period , perhab in fifti year thi will be the case . but then perhab natur friendli method have been develop , we have to see . so i do not think that we will have fewer car in twenti year .
