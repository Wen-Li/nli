we live in a time where valu chang or even get lost . the young gener is more focus on entertain and other selfish wish . therefor it would not be unusu that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . but inde , thi is not the case . we just believ thi becaus we do not realiz how mani yought attempt to help their commun . certainli , there are young peopl who are not interest in help their commun as well , but those yought are except . now i am go to explain whi we have the feel that young peopl are not social enough . in fact , mani peopl do not like that the common valu chang in their societi , me too . most of the elder peopl think that the young gener caus these chang . thu it is absolut understand that the young popul is associ with the new valu , which accur instead of the common valu . in fact the new gener get more individu . they even are suppos to get individu . the problem is thaht mani peopl do not know what get individu accuretli mean . in fac , it doe not mean that everybodi think selfish . get individu mean that everybodi ha to choos hi or her own way of life . and that is where the misunderstand start . mani elder peopl get more distant to the youth and thu do not see that new valu mostli refer to the way of life but not to the relat between an individu and the societi . inde , a person can like heavi metal and be social in the same time . the relationship between an individu person and the commun doe depend on the socialis , but the way of life depend on educ and on the decis the young person take . therefor it can not be said that the youth gener doe not help the societi , but it vari from person to person .
