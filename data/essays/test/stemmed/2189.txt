i love to traval , therefor , i posit agre that the best way to trvael is in a group led by a tour guid . becaus when travelingl in the foreign countri , we might not familiar with the local cultur or custom and that might caus risk . furthermor , some place mayb too danger to visit , and by advis by the tour guid , it might decreas the danger . for these reason , i believ that join the travel group led by a tour guid is the best wat to have a wonder travel memori . when i have the chanc to visit foreign countri , i alway love to attend the travel group . the reason is not onli it might cheaper than travel along , but aslo the travel agenc can arrang the traffic and stay problem . besid , when i travel to a place in which i have not been befor , the tour guid will introduc the cultur and custom for the me . therefor i can save more time to do reasearch . take myself for exampl , i visit bali island by myse last year . i spend a lot of time to do the reaserch . howev when i arriv the island , and becaus i can not speak the local languag , i do not even know how to rent a car , and it took a long time to arriv my hotel . in the second day of my travel , i went to visit a tempel , and i do not know that the templ is not allow to take pictru insid . as a result , i have to hand out all of my film and i lose my good memori in the island . i think if i attend the travel group and there is a tour guid , then the tragidi would not happend . though peopl might think that arrang the travel schedul is more flexibl and fun , howev , my person experi told me that trvael in a group with a tour guid is more effienc . not onli we will not wast time and money on arrang the traffic stuff , but aslo we can obsorb the knowledg from the tour guid , and meet more friend in the group . to sum up , i do believ that the best way to travel is in a group led by the tour guid .
