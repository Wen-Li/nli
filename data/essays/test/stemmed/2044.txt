risk take and creativ are consid among the most pivot qualiti that make a manag or an enterpreneur succes . i complet agre with the statement that succes peopl should tri to do new thing and take risk rather than do someth alreadi well known for two main reason . first of all the world is chang , peopl chang tast rapidli and fashon is alway develop . for thi reason one should emphasis on do new thing rather than the same thing to achiev success . thi assum that one should take some risk . the biggest exampl that come to my mind is steve job , the ceo of appl who took the risk of invest a larg ammount of money on the i pod project , that later turn to be a great busi . if he had continu simpli to do comput he would have not invent thi new success product . secondli , the success is someth difficult to control . one need also a larg part of luck to reach the success . but if one do not expos himself to new project or new idea , he or she will hardli catch the moment that might chang hi or her life . for exampl in china , after mao period a lot of peopl found themselv without a job , so they had to tri to do someth for surviv . those same peopl that tri to do someth new , think about the need of a countri that is develop so quickli are the same that now have the great busi of the countri . one need determin , luck and a sort of talent to achiev success , but the most import thing is to be brave enough to take some risk and tri to introduc someth new . in conclus i think that sinc the environ that surround all of us is alway chang and do alway the same thing take risk and introduc new idea to the world are the most import element that need to becom a success person .
