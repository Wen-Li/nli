i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are three reason . first , travel do n't know the detail of place where they visit . they ca n't visit all the famou place becaus they spend time to decid the place they go . but , in the tour they do n't need to choos the place where they go . theremor , the place where is decid by a tour guid are standard and famou place for sightse . we can ask a tour guid if we have place where we want to go . secondli , the travel in a group keep the cost cheaper then the travel individu . we can discount the cherg , for exampl , hotel , plane , entranc fee and so on . in gener , it is cheaper to take a lot of tiket than to take a tiket . thirdli , in a group trip , peopl do n't concern about everyth . for exampl , in parson trip , peopl must search the way to place they want to go . until they arraiv at goal , they worri the way is correct . in a group trip , a tour guid lead us to the goal . we onli enjoy sightse , eat or play at the goal . we do n't wast the time for concern . therefor , the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid .
