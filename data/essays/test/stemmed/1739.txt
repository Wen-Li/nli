whi do peopl agre with student to understand than to learn fact ? if these student learn fact instead of to under stand the lectur in class , they will get bad grade and fail . for exampl when a student studi the word of the lectur by fact it wont help him or her with their test . first student who are listen to the lectur and understand the concept they will be succesful with their grade and make their parent proud . when a student realli want to make their parent proud of them they should studi well and understand the note that they wrote in class . on the other hand , if student just want to learn fact they will get lower grade than the student who under stand the idea of the subject . student whom doo thi instead of take fact in stead of understand they will be weak in their subject , in their school subject , and in the whole school year . to sum up what i have just said is that student should listen and at the same time to understand the concept of the subject in school or in univers .
