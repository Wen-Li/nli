i agre with the statement becaus i am a young person too and i know that i am not give enough time to help my commun . nowaday the young peopl is busi with their school work and entertain . in the old time the peopl did n't have much thing to do so they can give time for help commun even though they do n't want to give . in old time , movi did n't exist . there were restaur but it wa n't like today . there were not so mani music group and concert or luxeri hotel to go . there were no tv and comput . without these thing there is not much thing to the in a day . becaus of thi empty peopl improv their relationship with other peopl and with their enviro , becaus of that they want to help their commun . in old day the neighboorhood were more import than it is today . nowaday peopl have no need to talk with the peopl who live in their commun . we have got comput , televis , mobil phone . we are alway in touch with peopl we love . when we go outsid there are lot of thing to the with our friend , becaus of that we are not interest in our commun . for exampl our school ha a commun servic to help some undevelop villag . it would be veri good to help those villag but nobodi wa intrest in help the villag becaus everyon had their own job to do with their friend or famili . young peopl decid to their hous rather than help commun becaus there are so mani thing to do . to conclud , lot of thing chang in the world . the peopl doe n't need to be in touch with each other . they can spend their time by do anyth . these are the reason whi i agre with the statement .
