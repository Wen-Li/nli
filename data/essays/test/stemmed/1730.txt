in my opinion , i agre with the statement ` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . ' first and the foremost , fact sometim chang over time , but the basic theroi do n't . for exampl , in the past , accord to the classic physic , the earth is the center of the space ; howev , scientist discov that the earth is a part of solar system and is not the center of it . likewis , mani observ and technolog current teach in school will chang . for instanc , the appliact of comput in two decad ago is so differ from today . yet , the basic theori are the same . so , understand idea and concept can train student 's abil to adapt the futur . in the like manner , reason and critic think are the essenti skill for student to succeed in futur career . the real world have so mani unexpect thing , that can not be learnt from the lesson . without the understand of the basic concept of the surround , it seem not possibl to deal with the chang in the real world as well as futur career . in particular , the busi world , nobodi can tell the best way to do thing . there is no book can teach the fact for solv problem , becaus everi problem is uniqu . student have to appli the skill they develp in school . last but not least , basic theori and concept are the root of knowledg , they are imper for develop and invent for the new techolog . for exampl , no medic and biolog concept , peopl can not invent new drug . in short , understand of the basic theori and concept not onli can train citic think and reason skill of student , but also can help them to prepar their futur career . so understand the idea and concept are more import in the educ .
