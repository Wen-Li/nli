i would definietley agre with it that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what alreadi know how to do well '' success is defin by each individu as a goal or an ambit to themselv . ani successful peopl who have reach the top , would have definit face so mani failur and risk . after be success in reach their goal , there is no mean in do the same thing again and again , we would reach a state where we want to tri out new thing either in differ field or in same field eventhough we know it would involv risk . it is onli when we tri out new thing we do learn new thing and the mistak we commit . famou scientist like edison who discov light didnt stop with that invent he further help in the invent of current . similarli tesla who discov altern current , in the beggin discov direct current ( dc ) could have stop with that but sinc he want to tri out new thing and found out altern current ( ac ) which we depend more on today for our daili need . success keep chang accord to the person and the situat . when we consid the world as a whole pictur , we human start our life from cave and stone but today live in a veri comfort world of sophist machin . the way peopl use to commun with each other ha chang . we use email , telephon and other mode . we introduc internet , satel . we dont stop with a particular success , we do look for a better advanc and tri new thing . thu , success vari from person to person and we all have to rememb that success is not a destin and it is a journey that never end .
