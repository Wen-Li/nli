i strongli agre with the abov statement that is true that most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are if the product came into the light with more advertis that enrich the quantiti and qualiti firstli a normal product or a cheap product came in to the market , the cheap product mean it ha some flavour ad which are not better purifi so it will not be applic to all the peopl that mean that mani not work effect that product also will come with littl influenc . for an exampl consider an axe deodrant and a local or home made scent , when the govern issu licenc to them onli they will fix the rate to it becaus as they made which type of flavour which is worth etc . so the most of the peopl use the axe deodrent rather than local scent becaus of it effect not onli is effect but also it is realli seem better than advertis . so it is also true that the advertis also move to the better product ofcours to fulfil their pocket also anoth reason . secondli a better brand and a worth brand onli come to the market with highli influenci it is true that the static alway vote to the advertis brand onli i feel that is noth go to one favour , if it is so whi mani peopl turn toward the influenci product it is not onli for their advertis they are turn toward their qualiti . for an exampl colgat past we can see the number of advertis regard about that past a day the most of the peopl in the countri use thisbrand onli apart of numer advertis thi product is the better exampl to suggest that they are much better than realli are , mani past came into the light with as influenc as colgat past but all can not stand befor it . and final i conclud that most of product seem much better than realli are .
