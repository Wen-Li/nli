i am agre with the statement caus i think that all the new tecnolog and new discov around the world are be made for peopl who tri new thing and take risk . as a good exampl some of the cure to a disseas as malaria were invet for a great colombian investig whose name is mauel elkin patarroyo thi doctor with limit resourc and a lot of critic ahd the abil of discov a vacun against the malaria , thi desseas appear most comon in african peopl caus they style of life . thank to thi discov peopl in africa could be abl to have a solut to that terribl desseas . after thi manuel elkin patarroyo becom a great scienti and move on in new researh for desseas . other intrepid person wa cristob colon who wa the discov of america , he tougth that it wa arriv to africa but as resolt of tri to find anoth way to get there he dicov a new continet . mani peopl tougth he wa crazi but at the end he got a lot of excel reword as gold and a new cultur . peopl who do not want to take risk are person that thik that everyth is done and that it is noth new to invent o discov , thi peopl are go to be unsuccess caus they do not work for the progress of their counti or ther own life . they expect that peopl who tri new thing do their job , then they can enjoy the new discov without an effort . some peopl tought taht if they tri to do new thing they are go to fall down , but if you do not take a risk you are not be sure if you work is good . it coulb as good as you can win a nobel price for it . so take risk and discov a wreat world full of fantasi .
