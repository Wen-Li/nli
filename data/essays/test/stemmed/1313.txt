the discuss of most advertis make product seem much better than tey realli are is a controversi one . one one hand , some say that advertis is an illus of show product much better than they realli are . on the other hand , some say that advertis is art of introduc a product or servic and make consum awar of it . i disagre with the statement given becaus the regul on the advertis , penalti that compani paid , and consum get more involv and demand make thi argument invalid in today 's media environ . it is not pretti unfair to say that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . we have seen mani exampl in the past , howev the current regul do not let such misguid of advertis . when we look at the advertis world , we see that it develop without ani regul and regul were made usual after a problem occur . when the consum complain about that problem , then the industri need to solv it via regul in order to protect the industri and consum . it is not allow to give fals inform in current regul and the penalti is pretti heavi . you may argu that regul may not enough . howev , we see big compani pay astronom penalti when they make fals claim . therefor , they have intern mechan to control everi singl advertis they show to the consum . in thi way , they do not onli protect themselv from huge penalti , they also protect their reputaion . i think anoth import reason whi thi statement can not be true is about the consum gett'ng more involv , demand , and smart about their chice . in today competit environ , consum have the power of chang their choic veri easili . therefor , if a compani make an advertis that make it product much better than it is , consum simpli do not buy it next time as their expect can not be met . so , compani know thi veri well and they do not make such advertis . as a conclus , i believ that the argument of most adveris make product seem much more better than they realli are 's not true . in media histori , we may see soem exampl support thi argument . howev , the current regul , penalti that compani should pay in such case , and today 's more demand and powerful consum make thi argument invalid .
