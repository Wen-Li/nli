i am not agre at all with the statement ! onli a person who had never visit big citi such as milan or rome - stay simpli in itali for the exampl - could say these thing ! in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? ! is crazi . . and what solut will be suggest ? what radic chang will take place ? mayb to travel in the space or at least in the sky . . i do n't think so at all i 'm afraid . for absurd , the onli way to do n't see a growth in the number of car of our citi is to impos extrem hard tax for the owner of vehicl , but i realli hope that the govern wo n't take thi decis in the futur ! i am a posit person and i think that we are in a period of well in almost everi field of life ! everi year , more and more peopl will be abl to buy a car if they have n't befor or to chang their own buy a new one . moreov , mani other strateg market will be avaiabl and the number of place where sell car will be increas not decreas ! the exampl of cina i 'm sure that is a clear one ; the most popol state in the world is forget bycicl in order to travel by car and to get the chang of a new and power econom boom .
