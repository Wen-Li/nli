sure , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . but is not that the intens ? advertis are there to attract peopl and get their attent to a new product . if they were not exager they would just summar the featur of a product and everyon know what a wash powder , for exampl , is good for . it is import that the product advert ha to appear to be someth special compar to all the other product of the same type . how would you do that if they all look similar and have the same purpos ? you can choos a specif featur of the product and say that in thi featur it is better than all the other similar product . for exampl , an advertis for a wash powder of brand x could say that it make your cloth softer than ani other brand 's powder in addit to it power to clean and remov dirt . but a product doe not onli need to appear special regard competit in the same type of product . what about newer version of an old product ? sometim new product do not have a big improv regard the old product but in order to make peopl buy the new one instead of further use the old one , advertis have to be exager . of cours , that might not be the golden way to make peopl buy product but i must admit that it work with me and exager advertis make me tri someth new and differ and everi now and then those convinc me in their qualiti . peopl might complain that know that advertis are overr a product make it hard to see which product are realli the best . but you can figur that out by yourself . after tri the product you alway have the choic to either stick with it becaus you like it or return to use your old or tradit product .
