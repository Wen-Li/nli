some peopl tend to emphsi the import of learn idea and concept wherea the other like to appreci fact better . in my opinion , i disagre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . sever reason can be seen vividli below . the most import propens of my opinion is that ani idea or concept all around the globe come from realiti and fact in peopl 's daili life . onli after fter a long and hard period of research and discov time could the human race gain the essenti idea from what they are realli exprinc . for instanc , all of math fomula peopl use today come from million of research ' constanci hardwork and continu prove . without the close attent and appreci of fact , may no one of us can learn the mysteri of ani apart of scienc . so , fact are the main sourc of peopl 's idea and concept . in addit , we can say idea is a mirror befor the real world . the mean of what i say is that idea and concept accuratli reflect the appear of the fact . if peopl also onli addict in learn idea and concept , they may lose the chace to appreci the right way to make a senc on the natur realiti . in other word , peopl may regard the right situat of the fact in a wrong way onli affect by the neg of the limit of made-idea and concept . for exampl , a great modern chines physic resaerch wang-chufei , which addict in mani idea of solv space graviti problem , state sevral wrong and redicul solut to peopl 's viewpoint toward scienc . that wa a seriou situat ! of cours , a close appreci about peopl 's idea and concept is usual help to our understand toward live and learn , in my tend of propens , it is more import and advantag to purchas a care apprecist about the fact . in conclus , although both understand idea and concept and to learn fact are the way to guid peopl 's live and learn , i tend to agre that to learn fact is more import and meaning .
