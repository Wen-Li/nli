i studi law and i think that in thi kind of studi it 's more import for the student to understand and assimil idea and concept than learn fact onli by one reason : the fact can be modifi . it 's a simpl reason but not easi to understand , so i tri to explain it well . in my point of view if you understand and assimil an idea or a concept you can understand what is the essenc of the idea and then you can creat in your mind a gener structur of thi idea . if you do it , you have the main idea , the gener idea , and you can chang the element structur if it 's neccessari for the situat , becaus the situat can chang , but if you have the gener idea , the basic knowledg to solv the new situat , you can do it . and to have thi gener idea , first of all , you must understand the problem , the idea and understand too the basic concept . i think that is worst to learn fact by one reason , it 's imposs than one fact will be repeat , it could be similar , or veri similar if you want , but the fact wo n't be the same fact , and in thi case , when you find someth veri similar but not the same as you know , you can be block becaus all is not the same as you know , and then , you have a new problem , similar than the other that you know , but not the same , and you ca n't resolv it if you do n't open your mind to the idea or concept , so in thi point , it 's better or easier to start understand the idea and the concept than start learn the fact . as a resum , thi is my idea and my princip reason to think that it 's better to understand idea and concept than learn fact becaus it permit you to have an open mind and more point of view about one problem , and if you have the base , you can see a situat , think about it and solv the problem , in the other case , you will see a situat , but it 's not the situat that you know so it 's probabl that you will be block and ca n't solv and hipothetyc problem .
