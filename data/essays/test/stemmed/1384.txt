i agre with the statement . it 's reason to think young peopl have no time to help their commun or they spend a lot of time in a bad manner . a lot of peopl ca n't think to spend own import day life without learn money . it 's so becaus our societi oblig to us to learn money as you can and have a good work which you can permit everyth with . thi is the biggest problem , usual you do n't do anyth without a materi scope . i 'm convinc by anoth import thing . a lot of time our societi , i love defin as the western societi , oblig to us to be physic in a certain way , so young peolp prefer to put our attent on theirself . they prefer spend much time in gym , or other place like that to improv their physic aspect . there is the idea that i come befor all the other thing or peopl . at the beginniong i have to improv my way of life then , if there is more time , i can think that i 'm not alon . it 's import to underlin how peopl are oblig from thi kind of societi , they accept thi condit without can do anyth . in thi contest , anoth impost thing we have to underlin is how a day is shortest than a day of some year ago . nowday a young peopl spend a lot of time at school or work and sometim is imposs to think to do other activ dure tha day .
