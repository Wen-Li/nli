do you believ that there is a seriou problem in our educ that student are taught to the test ? unfortun , sinc our societi ha becam so test-ori , student nowaday are busi rememb fact instead of give their own opinion and idea , wors , they lack of the abil of critic think . as far as i am concern , i support the idea that it is more crucial for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact , and the follow are the reason whi . first of all , i think that learn fact alon doe not do ani good for student , becaus student tend to forget those trivial detail as soon as they leav school . i remeb when i wa a high school student , i cram a lot date of histori event and content in my textbook in order to get good score on exam . howev , i realiz how useless those fact were when i found myself no longer rememb them sinc i graduat and it doe not affect my life . secondli , i think student should tri to figur out solut to problem on their own . develop such abil requir them to understand thing from differ perspect . sometim the idea can be so difficult that they have to work in group and it becom a great opportun for them to learn how to cooper which teamwork is greatli appreci in today 's societi . all in all , i conclud that learn fact alon would kill the creativ of student and restrict their think . the success educ should teach student how to think not how to cram fact for test .
