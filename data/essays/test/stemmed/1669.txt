ye , i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertisemnt are a great mode of propaganda of thing of variou kind , rang from food stuff to high technolog machin , like plasma tv . with the ever increas competit in the market , the manufactur have divert to option of advertis . but not everyth shown in the advertis are true . thi is true becaus everi manufactur tri to lure the consum by brand his/her own product as the best in the market . but a small market survey and a small studi on the product would reveal that there are in fact mani better product avail . also the advertis alway depict the product veri differ and in a grace manner , as if it wa the onli `` rose in the garden '' . thi is done to make the product more and more attract . the advertis also fail to indic in what way that product wa differ from the other one in the same categori . for exampl the content and ingredi of a particular drink , or even it nutrit content are not clearli express . and even if they are express they are exagger to a veri high level . while advertis , there is a lot of technolog assist implement . for exampl a tv advertis clip can be process to increas the appear and contrast of the clip . use variou tool the satur level of colour of the clip and it contrast can be chang to make the product look more colour and more attract . nowaday , there is a trend of have popular person in the advertis appeal and recommend , the consum to buy the product he or she is endors . movi star , sport start are commonli found in the advertis . these are sever of the way of advertis and an attempt to lure a person into buy that product . i would like to recommend to buy onli after true examin of the product and compar them with the other product of that particular class . also sinc the manufactur invest heavili on advertis , thi add to the sell price of the commod increas it valu and becom more expens . so we should go for qualiti of the product and not for the qualiti of advertis . the consum should realiz that it is alway better to person view the product and buy rather than to watch the product in the advertis and go for it .
