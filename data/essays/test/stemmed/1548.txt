i agre with the follow statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they know how to do well '' . firstli accord to my opinion success peopl are those peopl who have becam success by not just do the same thing which they had alreadi done or known to them earlier but by do differ , challang and creativ thing which ha made them success . sucess peopl alway keep on chang their atitud and sens of work as per the situat , their decess are not rigid they are veri inspirast , use and motiv . secondli succes peopl alway have the thirst of do new thing and readi to take the task no matter the amount of risk involv in it becaus they alway have an posit attitud toward do new thing and challang task , they alway come up with new idea and thing that can be use to be more famou and success , they alway keep on think of get new idea and startegi in do a new task which will not onli help other in mani way but also also help them in get recognisit and more successl . thirdli success peopl are intellig and smart they think differ from other and are alway readi to take up challang that come in their way and alway keep a postiv attitud in order to acheiv them which help them to becom more success , they are alway readi to accept new and challang task with an aim to achiv it , they never use the same old strategi or idea which they had alreadi use but rather keep on get new idea and strategi that can use to complet the task . one of the exampl is the late mr. dhirubhai ambani pioneer of relianc industri and one of the richest and success person in india the main goal of the success person is to keep on search new thing and idea rather then consid the same old pattern which the had known earlier becaus consid new thing and idea will not onli help them in variou mean but also to other which again in turn benfit themselv in return . thu accorind to me succes peopl are alway in a huger for search new thing idea and readi to take risk to becom more and more success .
