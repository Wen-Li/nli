well , `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' , i am gree with thi statement for the fallow reasson : some compani tri to sell the product mayb give a impact in the client , like pute a powerful color , mayb the brand 's name will be tag from a popular person , and make such a expens comerci and even pay peopl to talk about how good the product is . well thi can have a good impress in the poepl but what about when thi product ha a while in the market place and everybodi is use them ? if the product doe not satisfid the client the prestigi of the product and the demand of the product will decreas . wich mean lost of money ( for the comerci ) and expensi and the product soon wont have demand at all becaus of the unsatisfi client which were consum them . but if the product is as good as the advertis , so thi product will last longer term in the market bacaus in the beguin peopl will be atract by the propagand or the nice of the product , peopl will start consum or buy it becaus look veri good , and when they start use them one after anoth they will see how good it is and they will keed adquir them becaus thi product it is use . so compani wich realli want to invest in bussin and growit in they schould think about it . compani schould think farthermor . if a make a defici product the client will consum but just at the beguin and later on they wont be satissfied with it . i think most of the poepl will agre as me in how advertis make product look like . becaus of mani thing that pepl adquir but they are not satisfi with it . and do you know what they will do next time ? ... they will not get the same stuff or thing . so thi should be a warn for compani befor they put their product in the market .
