nowaday , there are a lot of type of educ . some school teach and give their student so gener educ without deep the subject . some other school give so specif educ to their student . i believ that student can be more success with specif educ . becaus of thi , i disagre with that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact with two reason . my first reason is that if student learn fact in their school they can learn easier becaus the fact provid real thing and the their class may be more logic and the most import thing in thi point , if student learnd fact they do not need to memor anyth . for exampl , if we explain everyth to student , he or she will not have a question mark in hi or her mind . moreov , he or she never forget thi idea . thu , learn fact are more import . my second reason is that if we teach student just idea and concept , these thing may shape hi or her life style . he or she may start think everyth so gener . it can effect hi or her life . for instanc , if a student learn just gener thing he may start look at peopl like that without think deep about them . it is not good becaus peopl have emmot . to sum up , student can understand idea and concept easli but for them the most import thing is that understand idea correctli with all of point . without that , student can not think deepli and they can not critic their world . understand idea and concept are easi way for student . they can not improv their selv in their futur , if we teach them with these way .
