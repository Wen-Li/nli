though it is appeal that the increas amount of car will strengthen the burden of both the societi and the environ , in my opinion , it is quit imposs to have fewer car in the twenti year . my reason will be mention as follow . the pursu of a safer life stimul the growth of the car . the horribl situat of that preval diseas are deepli impress by the whole countri . at that time , the most effect way to pass the diseas is pass by public . the public transport form as underway , taxi , bu are frighten peopl by the potenti diseas they poss . as a result , the hot trend to buy car start from that period . it is becaus that major believ that they can stay in a much safer condit in their own car , at least have less opportun to contact the public . sinc futur is unpredict , how the enthasium to buy car for sake of safeti will decreas ? besid , the better condit of live contribut a lot to the phenomenon . peopl are gener get rich , henc it is reason for them to enjoy a better life . whi not buy a car on the condit that peopl can afford them ? to those who have career , be squeez in the buse dure the rush-our can be a nightmar . if possibl , wo n't it be a good choic for them to have their own car if afford , both be effect and comfort ? futhermor , the product abil ha an incred influenc on the huge amount of car . sinc the polici releas by the govern that automobil industri is list as the most pow one in our countri , a soar increas of car compani began to invest in our countri . accord to the latest statist , china will exceed germani to be the third largest car produc countri in the world . at that time , so mani inventori will sure be a headach to those compani . to promot the sale , they will use a lot of measur to attract consum . who wo n't take action under that condion as car are cheaper and cheaper . in brief , the situat is not so posit now . car are expect to be fewer but the fact contradict it . henc , to keep a better condit of live , the decreas of the car is the trend in the futur . to achiev that , it need the action from both the govern and individu .
