i disagre with the statement , and think travel without tour guid is better . i have travel with my friend a lot , and i wa in a group led by a tour guid for sever time , and it have a number of weak point , while travel without tour guid have strong point . there are two notic weak point of travel with tour guid . first of all , the qualiti of explan of tour guid is not good . i compar the explan of tour guid with the explan of a local person , and the explant of the local person wa more interest and had more detail . second , tour guid have strict plan . while travel , we may have some spot that we want to visit . howev , the tour guid onli visit some landmark of the area , and we may miss some spot we want to visit . in contrast to travel with tour guid , travel without tour guid have two strong point . first , we may visit where we want . for exampl , we may visit place that no tour guid visit . next , travel without tour guid is more like to have our own experi . if we use tour guid , the experi that we have may have sever similar to other peopl who have use the tour guid . howev , if we travel without them , we may have our own uniqu experi . in conclus , i travel with tour guid , and they have have two weak point , while the opposit case have two strong point . if we travel with tour guid , we have to listen to low qualiti explan , compar to explant of a local person , and we may miss where we want to visit . in contrast , if in the opposit case , we may visit where we want , and we may have our own experi . i disagre to the statement for the reason abov .
