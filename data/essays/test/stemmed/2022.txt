i do not agre with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledg than to special in one specif subject . on the one hand , it is realli use and reason to know someth about everyth . we live in a societi and an environ that we can not neglect . thu , everyon should have an idea of what goe on today , for exampl in polit or econom , but also what happen in the past , becaus that directli effect one 's person life . furthermor , it depend on the particular person and hi profess . if you are a politician for instanc , you are suppos to have good knowledg about everyth , just to be abl to have an opinion and to be abl to find the right decis for differ problem with a good background knowledg . on the other hand , you can not say that it is better to have a broad than a specif knowledg . the reason for that are abviou : first , dure your life you are confront with differ problem and you automat build up knowledg about the subject that are associ with them . you have to special to be abl to cope with these problem . second , to becom profession in a particular job you have to focu on a subject . it doe not matter if you are familiar with histori when you stand in a laboratori and want to find out how a cell function . third , i am of the opinion that peopl should concentr on what they like and love to deal with . they should not find out thing just to know much about everyth . you have to enjoy what you do . besid , if you special on one subject , you have the abil to improv and get to know more and more and that is what make life so interest . as a conclus i can say that peopl should have both broad knowledg and deeper knowledg in specif subject .
