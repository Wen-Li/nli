advertis ha taken an import role in modern societi . nowaday you are confront with advertis in all kind of media : you hear it on the radio and you see in the newspap , magazin , on tv , the internet or just if you are walk around in the street . there is advertis everywher and for exampl some tv-compani are financ themselv onli by advertis . but are those color shine product which we see on tv also the one we get for our money ? or make advertis product seem better than they realli are ? in my opinion , in most case , the actual do . first of all the modern mean of technolog give the creator of advertis huge possibl . for exampl all advertis pictur in magazin or newspap are correct by comput program and it is the same with advertis film shown on tv . sometim even advertis for food are complet produc with the comput . a second reason whi i am think that prdouct in advertis are shown better than they are in real life , is that you need to overemphas when you want to draw peopl 's attent to someth . for exampl if you want to sell your newest car model you will not say : `` thi car is cheap , but you do not get the standard comfort . '' you will alway tri to make your product look as great as possibl . so in the given exampl you would therefor say : `` besid all the comfort you expect an automobil to have , you save the most of your money if you choos thi one ! '' so you can see that everi sellsman will alway tri to point out what make hi particular product so special and whi you would have to buy it . moreov i think that a lot of peopl even like it the way it goe . becaus peopl do not want to see just the realist life sometim ; they want to see a littl bit of a more glamor and better world .
