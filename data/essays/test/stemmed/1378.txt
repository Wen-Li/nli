i agre . agress on market have develop differ technic or method use by publicist that may confus the consum and lead them to a wrong purchas decis . although they might be legal , not all consum sector are the same and big part of them can misunderstood the messag of the advertis . a way how can consum get confus by advertis is by provid them uncomplet inform , which i believ is the most common type of mislead buyer decis . a clear exampl are the credit card , which at the time they are promot do not explain all their disadvantag or restrict . anoth type of advertis that i am sure confus most of peopl is the one that take a simpl inform as a fact or make a wrong statement , like say the `` the best '' , `` the biggest '' , `` the cheapest '' , etc. or simpli highlight an inform , like an award got on a specif circumst or by a specif group to label the product at thr seller ' best conveni . an exampl for me are the car or automobil . on the other hand , commun are now special in modern method , like photo , video , sound , that `` complement '' the real fact on which a purchas should be base on , but that i realli consid as a distors or an intent divers of realiti in order to creat `` other attribut '' to the product that want to be sold , like fashion . i believ everi peopl ha to make some research befor buy someth . thi research should be as long and deep as the product valu or is go to cost us , or realli how import is for us . i would promot the consum organ and regularli publish buyer opinion , special of those who have tri the product alreadi . i would also promot a constant review of the law on advertis and gener market method , enforc seller to provid complet inform on their product to the end consum .
