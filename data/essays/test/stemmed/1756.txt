nowaday , with even more peopl decid to studi instead of work , it is essenti to know how your studi should look like . is it better to gain a broad knowledg of variou subject or should one special in one specif subject ? in my opinion , it depend on your statu of your studi . if you are still an undergradu student i would agre with the statement abov . at the begin you should get a broad impress of the possibl the univers offer . you should take as much class , from veri differ subject , as you can to find out which is the best for you . thi broaden your experi , basic knowledg and make you mayb more matur . i am studi busi in the 4th semest and dure my basic studi i can choos between 14 subject , like account , data process or market . you have to pass all of them to further your studi . but after finish your basic studi you reach the point to focu on one specif subject out of these 14 . now i do not agre ani longer with the statement abov becaus you have to deepen your knowledg of your favourit singl subject . thi make sens becaus thi is the point when you have t decid about your futur profess . it is quit obviou that if you want to work in a bank you should choos a subject like account or financ instead of market or tourism . you certainli will not benefit from your knowledg about the clima in itali or how to improv your sale of trouser . therfor you will need your specif knowledg . to sum up , there are probabl some exampl that do not support my opinion , but i am sure that a mixtur between the knowledg of mani subject and special in one subject is the best way to be prepar for your career after univers .
