if it is import for student to learn fact , i agre to the statement say that it is more import for them to understand idea . fact can not be discuss or rebuttel . learn fact is the most easi thing that anyon can do . by contrast , idea and concept have to be discuss and demand work to understand them . it is not alway easi to `` catch '' the idea and concept . thu , student should spend more time to understand them in order to understand the field they are studi . while be in class , it appear that spend more time to explain idea and concept is more use than focus on teach fact . inde , the valu ad that a professor provid to hi student is hi explan ; it is someth that student could not get elsewher than in the classroom . student can easili learn fact at home , by read the support materi . my own experi shew me that it is more use learn in thi way . a professor who onli or mostli focus on fact is `` useless '' ; it would be prefer to stay at home , at least it would not make ani differ . on the contrari , a professor who spend the most of hi teach time to express and discuss the differ concept and idea make hi class veri interest and anim due to the increas in particip of student and the interact with the professor . i do not argu that learn fact is useless . sometim , some fact are also use to understand idea and concept . fact should be taught in class when they are use to understand idea and concept . the way of teach should be focus on the most import thing and the main idea and concept . fact have to be studi at home , but taught in class onli when they support the understand of idea and concept .
