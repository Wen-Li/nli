in japan , where i live , some peopl believ that best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus it is easier to travel . howev , i person disagre with the statement for the follow reason . first , travel with a tour guid will limit time for free activ . for exampl , in 1995 , when i wa a tenth grader in keio high school , a privat high school in japan , i went to korea on a field trip . sinc it wa a trip schedul by the school , and we had to move in a group , the trip wa guid by a tour guid and all the schedul on the trip wa fix . there were no free time and as a result , i did not have chanc to go to some museum i want to go . if the trip had not been guid by a tour guid , i would have had chanc to visit place i want to go . as the abov exampl illustr , i trueli believ that travel with a tour guid will limit time for free activ . second , there are not much supris in a trip guid by a tour guid compar to a trip on our own . for exampl , last year , i went to itali and franc on our honeymoon . sinc we want to travel freeli , we travel on our own . befor the trip , we incid not decid what to do or where to go on some day . in those day we went to some place where some peopl usual do not go and found mani beauti place . also , dure the trip i found new featur about my wife becaus the trip wa not all guid and we had to decid everyth . if we had not travel on our own , i would not have found these new thing . as the abov exampl demonstr , i person believ that there are not much supris in a trip guid by a tour compar to a trip on our own . therefor , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
