i agre with that statement . the ozon layer is get wors everyday and nobodi is do somth import about it yet . the talk for solar power ha been go around for so long now but still i do n't see a differ in our ozon . everyon know that the main problem for the ozon layer be that way is becaus of air pollut . air pollut mostli come from automobil and factori , especi chemic factori , and to tell you the truth we have n't been do a great job over the past year . if scientist found out an easier way for the peopl to use solar energi i would'nt even be writ thi essay for you guy . unfortunatli there is n't but that still dose n't mean i 'm give up hope . so ye i believ there will be fewer car in the futur or in twenti year . oil as a busi ha ruiend the world with greed , power , and selfish . if our machin ran on solar power there would be no money envolv and in that case there will be no problem . peopl do n't understand what kind of problem money bring to them , and when i say peopl i realli mean the peopl who have alot of money and no problem and do n't care about anyth around them . i 'm not say that there will be no car in twenti year , im just say that if solar power is a big success in year to come then it is true , there will be much fewer car later then there are today . i 'm guess that in a good thirti to forti year the whole earth will consist of solar power , and i do n't just mean car i 'm talk everyth we use with patrol . so most like i we all should go with thi theori of mine .
