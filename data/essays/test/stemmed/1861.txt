can thi statement allow student to do n't studi histori ? or can it allow them to studi just sciec which is more made up of concept ? as i could think about thi question , other can do it and if the answer are afferm , the school 's educ can make a danger turn . i do n't agre with the statement abov , becaus studyng just idea and concept without fact , student can not see how peopl use them in the histori and they becom more expos to make the same mistak of the past . at the same time stude fact each student can also improv hi gener cultur which is veri import to take import decis in the futur and make your awar stronger . moreov , i beliv that the studi of concept , idea and fact ha the equal import for a student 's mind : the flexibl of a young mind can improv thank to differ kind of studi . we can easli see that stude alwa the same kind of thing the mind take an it own way to work about problem : for exampl everyon can see the differ between the mind of an architect and the mind of a person who make scientif resourc . give the same problem to both we can have two complet differ way to solv it correctli . so , for student is equal import to studi idea , concept and fact to do n't make old mistak , to do n't close their mind to a better flexibl and to improv your person cultur , which is veri import for the futer career and life .
