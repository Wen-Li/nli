in my opinion success peopl tri new thing and take risk in deed rather than remain at their use thing and behaviour . there are sever reason for thi view . first of all , those peopl have earn enough money becaus of their success and so provid the main condit to tri someth new . the most peopl can not afford to specul becaus they often have to care for a famili which depend on a regul incom . so there is usual no space for creat new and revolutionari idea and make those real . that doe not mean that less success peopl are not interest in altern thing , but they often have not the possibl to live like they want becaus of differ duti . secondli , it may be decis that peopl who have experienc a great career onli becam success in thi manner sinc they tri new thing or took a risk . without that behaviour in our time there is almost no chanc to achiev your aim and final succeed . perhap it is a way of life they had choosen in young year and which help them to reach their goal , therefor it is now one of their characterist reaction to tri someth new . other peopl did not get thi chanc to experi the advantag of risk by their own so they are more frighten toward them . last but not least , success peopl have alreadi reach what they have dream of all the year . so these peopl may come to a point where they have to decid about go on . becaus of enough money and their posit knowledg about those risk and new chanc they will probabl take them and set a new target to their own for what they can work more hardli than ever . there are so mani career men and women who can not live without work and put everyth behind that aim .
