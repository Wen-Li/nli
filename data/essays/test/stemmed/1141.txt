some peopl tend to beliv that advertis and advertis make product exact how they are . in support their idea they might say that there is no reason to show the product much better than it is or lie to the custom . howev i am not in agreement with thi stanc . in my opinion most of the adveris and advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . in the essay below i will explor some sever exampl from technolog and person experi to support my point of view . first of all it is difficult to deni that ani of the advertismen make the prduct seem much better than they realli are . the exampl of ` iphon ' realli sit there . the compani appl start to the advertisemnt of their new up com product iphon 2 year befor than it came . they were realli good at advertis , i can not deni it . they encoureg peopl with the new amaiz cell phone to buy it . and than they said that it will be on sale in our store at the august 2007 . peopl made line for that produckt and wait week long at the door step of the appl store . they sold 80 precent of product they produc . what happend next ? after a month they discoverd a softwar mistak and collect all devic that they have sold . thi exampl of the compani appl will deffinit demonstr my point of view and agre that advertis lie to the client . in addit to the iphon there is also an other exampl fron an other differ cloth compani which will also support my point of view . secondli , there wa a compani , which allway proud of their trouser . they say that a person can wear our product for a life time . i wa realli impress from their tv advertis and went that shop to puy a pair of trouser . it wa quit expens for a trouser but i thought it will worth that money . after the first time i wor it i put it into the wash machin to wash it alon . after i took it aoutto dri it it got 5 size smaler to me . ti wa not my mistak i wash it exactli with the direct bu it got smaller . thi exampl is also show that a person should not beliv in what the advertisei are say . in conclus , the exampl abov of appl and cloath compani will deffinit demonstr my point of view about advertisor and advertis . there might still counter argument abut advertis but i still beliv that they make product seem uch better than they realli are .
