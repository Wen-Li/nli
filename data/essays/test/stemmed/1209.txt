the given statement it self indic that the person is success alreadi in hi carrer or in hi profess . i agre with the statement becaus the person is alreadi got success in hi profess he mite learn new thing defin . if a person is satisfi with hi success and remain calm mean no use he is alreadi succed that whi he should go for new thing relat to hi profess and relat to hi view and etc . if he doe regularli what he know is the worst thing , in the given statement explain that success person tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what alreadi know how to do well i agre with thi statement . for exampl if scientist launch a new rocket call agni it target or it cover a distanc of 100mile then it got success . next time if he doe the same rocket to launch no use , alreadi he got success in that then he should go for better than that thi time if hi rocket tri to cover a distanc of 150 mile it well and gud . but these type of risk taken when he had suffici amount of materi then he may go to take risk to do the risk and tri for the better product than the previou . but if in some case if he fail he will get or the entir unit may get loss but the thing is he tri for the new thing that more better if if got failur also take some risk and do the thing is better . in other case a person is a big industrialist hi busi are wide rang if he stop work from that point then no success will gain if he run same busi for some time in the futur he may get loss becaus of increas technolog , if he dont go for a new thing or tri to place other busi it a veri gud option . alreadi that man had a wide rang of busi if he invent on other busi or launch new product in to the markt take some risk rather than onli do the same old busi if get success in new busi it is more use . if at all if if got loss also he can recov by the old busi becaus it alreadyi n wide rang . success is obtain in ani case or in ani field is more difficult task becaus lose or invent money on other thing is easi but not sure to got that back if a person is success in hi porofess then he should go for new thing and new idea , to work on the same field in mani other way and tri to take some risk on that thing is a good option . tri the new thing is veri big task if a person or peopl who are not success in their profess they may not have a chanc to take are risk the thing or go for new thing . they may not risk are not go for the the new thing . then they lag by the peopl who got success . success itself is the achiv then we can go for new thing . it a veri gud option to do or tri for new thing .
