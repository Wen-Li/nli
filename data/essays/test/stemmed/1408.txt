i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . one of the reason whi i believ thi statement is true is the fact that although you might do well with one thing , tri out someth new could get you result even greater than what you are do right now . if you are e.g. good at bake cooki as an employe at a bakeri , you can continu what you are do and you will alway do the same thing and probabl earn the same salari . howev , if you decid to let somebodi els bake the cooki and you start your own bakeri , do the admininstr , advertis , figur out the logist , etc. you can realiz that you 're even as good as with the bake part or even better and you can increas your profit and be more success . and later on you could start a cater servic which use your skill of coordin a food busi in order to diversifi and get even more success . anoth reason whi i support thi statement is that take risk can provid you with more success than if you are do the same thing you are good at all over again . if you take risk you have the possibl of a great outcom , which is especi true in the stock market . if you are will to invest your money in high risk portfolio , the risk of lose your money is great , but so is your chanc of get a veri profit return . thi way you have higher profit margin and are way more success than conserv investor who alway reli on `` safe '' altern , with which they are do well , but not as well as the first group of investor mention abov . tri out a lot of new thing leav peopl more flexibl and get them more success thi way . thi way they can figur out how to best use their abil . so if somebodi is good at teach , but after be burn out after sever year of stress teach , she or he decid to becom a children 's psychologist , thi can be a veri succes switch in their career . so thi person stay success by tri out someth new and take the risk of the career switch . the same is true when tri out new thing peopl can be veri success as thi allow them to adapt to market chang . one decad internet start-up are veri lucr , but by be flexibl and take risk peopl can switch their career to a differ field after a coupl of year and so escap the possibl financi disast right on time dure the dotcom bubbl . these are 4 valid reason whi i believ that the abov mention statement is true .
