gener speak , there are two approach to the learn process , detail memor of fact , and understand of the idea , concept , relationship and consequ behind the fact . although both or valid learn method , and even requir method , the most valuabl learn experi , in my opinion , is the latter . there are mani reason to support thi statement . first , understand idea and concept requir the knowledg of the fact . in other word , the second approach includ the first approach , although the emphasi might not be on the memor . inde , in mani case the detail are import to draw gener conclus , thu , the abil to retain import fact is implicit requir and develop . secondli , it impli a broader use of intellig , or the use of all the differ type of intellig . inde , thi method encourag critic analysi , creativ , assert and sinthesi skill . ali thi skill are relev not onli for the subject studi , but for ani subject , in ani environ , and in ani stage of life . thirdli , simpl memor of fact is often a short term learn experi , becaus the fact are often forgotten within a veri short period of time . that is special true in these day , were inform is so acces through differ sourc . the understand of idea and concept , on the contrari , is usual less precari in time . final , i can think on one addit veri import , advantag of the learn process base on understand idea . it is more fun for the student , and even more fun ( although more demand ) for the teacher . not onli the subject are more interest , also the teach method can be more creativ and adapt than a lectur aim at memor fact . in conclus , learn through the understand of idea and concept allow a much broader understand of the subject , a long last knowledg of it , and the develop of import skill that will be need not onli for a final exam , but throughout life .
