i strongli agre with thi statement . i have been think about that dure studi ani subject . idea and concept are what i consid most when i face on someth first time . so i absolut know how import they are . to demonstr , i should be a good exampl . becuas i have a lot of experiec about that . i have been alway confus in ani idea and concept for a long time . actual , i wa not veri good at studi or understand someth when i wa littl . i thought i wa stupid . i did not know how to learn and understand . no one taught me how to do . even my parent did not . i ha been alway taught just fact , not idea or concept . for instanc , i did know about '' + '' and '' - '' . oneday , i got 20 point at my math test when i wa in the first grade . i did not know what they are . i wa so confus between those two . i did all of them wrongli . i did not know the concept or principl of that . in my opinion , fact are just fact . they do not show ani idea or concept . they do not includ ani valu . studi about fact is just know rather than knowleg . in order to get more complet knowleg , student must understand idea and concept better . that way can reduc the likelihood to misunderstand or to be confus . to sum up , understand fact can be sometim import . understand idea and concept , howev , must be a lot more signific than that . especi for student , that is veri import .
