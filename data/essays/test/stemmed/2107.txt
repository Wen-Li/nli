i fulli agre with the statement that most advertis make the product they are suppos to sell much better than they are in realiti . my opinion is not onli base on some person experi , but it also make senc if you tri to understand the posit of the one who are tri to sell their particular product . the first reason whi i belief it is inevit for ani advertis to make the product much better than they are is that you must consid that these product have to be sold not onli in order to make money , but also to achiev the amount of money that you had to invest for the product of these good . thi invest make it necessari to point out onli the posit aspect of the product and not to mention anz of the neg or even bad aspect about them . the second reason whi i belief thi is that you must consid the amount of competitor a product ha on today 's market . sinc there is hardli ani product on the market that can sell without similar or likewis product that are compet against each other in the same meket segment , they therefor adress the same custom . thi make it necessari for ani produc to advertis hi or her product , so that they can be distinguish from the other product on the shelv . anoth arguement whi i belief thi is that it is obviou how much custom are depend on imag and myth when it come to spend money on the best product . and sinc those imag or reput are unlik to creat themselv or at least need too much time if they are suppos to develop natur , it must be the task of advertis to creat what peopl want to or are suppos to belief about the product their are buy . so in consequ i think that the need to sell the product in order to make profit , the competit between the differ produc that are sell similar good and the need to creat imag are the main reason whi it can be argu that advertis creat a better product than the one that is actual be sold .
