i agre with the statement that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think so becaus i feel that idea and concept play a more import role in further educ than learn fact without understand the underli fact . concept play a veri import role in build up the futur of a student . know the concept from each level of educ help the student understand the complex idea which are built up these basic concept and idea . if a student doe not have an understand of the basic concept and idea he will not be abl to go ani further in learn the subject . onli with the understand of the concept and idea will the student be abl to think of hi own idea base on them . for exampl , if an electr engin student doesnot understand the basic concept on which the kirchoff 's law are state he will not be abl to understand or solv ani of the circuit , whose analysi is veri import for design and sythes an electr network which the student will have to do later in hi cours . although learn the fact is also as import as understand the idea and concept , learn the fact will be of no use or the student may not be abl to retain what he ha learn if the student doesnot have a good idea of how these fact are establish and what are the underli concept that led to the confirm of these fact . without know the concept the student may not be abl do dani further research to improv the exist model of the idea . henc for all the abov state reason i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
