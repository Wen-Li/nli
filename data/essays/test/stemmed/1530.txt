most of us have probabl seen the kid ask their mom for a candi or chocol of which they 've seen the commerci on tv . how about adult be cheat by the advertis either on tv or somewher els ? in fact , most of the advertis we see might not be reflect the truth but tri to hook consum in order to sell more . the truth is ; advertis do not reflect the truth becaus they are not control by the govern , they onli show the benefit of a product and they are produc bias commun method to reach vast amount of peopl . first of all , the govern doe not control the commerci use appropri method . in fact it can not do that . in a small countri of a coupl of million , there are more than thousand of compani most of which are activ and chose to use commerci to reach their consum . on tv , newspap , big board , flyer and use mani other way that can onli depend on the creativ of the advertis , they reach million of peopl everyday . just the tv , for exampl , ha more than a hundr differ channel all of which earn their money of commerci . therefor it is imposs to check all method of advertis whether they are accur or not . secondli , ani commerci would onli reflect the product advantag but not the disadvantag . even if you are advertis a veri expens product , you would say `` it 's cheaper now ! '' . you would n't probabl say `` coca-cola is unhealthi and result addict to itself ! '' but instead you would say `` it 's delici , it 's cool '' . the purpos of a commerci is not to indic how useless a product is but to indic how useful it is . therefor , in mental , if someth is that harmful , the advertis just ignor the harm and emphas whi peopl should buy that product , like the exampl of cigarett . no commerci ever indic that harmful effect of cigarett but they show cool peopl smoke to show their product cool . final , in fact a commerci is a bias method of commun . everi commerci , either on tv or on newspap is be produc or appli by some produc or manag . sinc the purpos of the advertis is to convinc the peopl to buy the product , they would reflect their bia at the commerci . howev , even if they were tri to be complet honest , everi person ha hi opinion and peopl would reflect their opinion even if they do n't want to like a piec of art they are work on . in summari , advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . they can not reflect the truth . they are not control by the govern whether they are reflect the truth becaus it is imposs to check all advertis . besid an advertis onli reflect the adventag of the product be advertis becaus of the purpos of the advertis is to convinc peopl to buy . final even if advertis want to be honest , it would not be possibl becaus an advertis would onli reflect the opinion of the produc of it .
