advertis is an art . how do you get peopl to buy a specif product rather than the other one next to it ? you onli emphazis the best aspect of the item , and more importantli you `` claim '' . advertis often mislead buyer on the real valu of what they are sell to them . thi is whi i strongli believ that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . and to support my opinion , i will use exempl base on my personn experi and observ . i never forgot the day when in the u. for a month i decid to call a televis market channel to buy a set of kitchen knive . i wa probabl onli 8 or 9 year old but i wa mesmer by what wa promis to me. `` it will cut right through the bone of your chicken like if it wa a tomato '' the sellsman claim . after convinc my older brother to call and buy the knive , i wa more impati than ever . but when they final arriv , my decept wa huge . the knive did n't look at all like the steel one i 'd seen on tv , nor did they cut veri well , even through soft and tender ingredi . in fact i had n't look at the bottom of the tv screen , where a littl star state that the product aspect could differ , and it effici too . even last year in europ , a law wa pass to ban mislead advertis in the food industri , becaus consum start to complain that they had bought morn cereal that were suppos to lower their level of stress , and that sadli , it did n't work the way they had expect it to . the truth wa there wa noth , not even a singl ingrdient that wa known to reduc stress level . while it may be true that you do have certain product that offer what they promis , the vast major doe n't , and it is all becaus of one thing : profit . they have to sell as much as they can and find everi way and mean to convinc a consum to consum . so do n't believ that advertis state you can loos 60 pound in 7 week , or the one claim you can grow back new hair without surgeri if you are bold , becaus they are simpli irrealist .
