i agre to the qestion which is `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . learn the fact is just memor someth and they do n't get the caus of the fact . also it can be forget faster . howev understand the idea learn the caus of the fact or problem . i know understand someth is veri hard thing to do . but that doe n't mean they do n't have to understand what they are learn . just learn the fact is easi and they can learn more faster howev they will have a problem later . for exampl , one student is learn a math . if he just learn the fact which is math formula , he can finish faster and he just need to memor the formula . but when he get differ question that use same formula , he is go to confus about the question that where to put the formula in it . howev the student understand how it work , he can be readi for ani question that use same formula . it also caus a problem when student are grown up . anoth exampl that the student learn that do n't throw garbag everi where . later if he get face on thi problem , he doe n't know whi he ca n't throw the garbag everywher becaus he did n't learn whi . but one who learn and understand whi in thi problem , he will know that throw garbag everywher caus a polut . like the exampleabov , just learn is good for now but caus a problem late so student need to understand idea and concept .
