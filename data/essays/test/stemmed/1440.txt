i genar agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . specif , when i evalu the new product rather than well-known one . the idea of advertis deriv from the need to promot the product . therefor , the basic goal when advertis the product is to announc to the broader number of peopl the brand , qualiti , price and adventag result of the use . when a product is new in the market it need a thorough promot , otherwis peopl will not have an idea on what actual it is . in thi context , peopl in the market section of the firm , tri to increas the number of custom of the product and might consid each way as applic . advertis onli the good part of the product or tri to display them much better than they are in real , may be the instrument to challang the other product in the market . to give an exampl , i had bought a `` magic-knif '' follow to a tv advertis . in fact , it broke up after a few month when cut a solid bone of a chicken . the produc refus to refund it as cut a chicken bone wa not appropri for the knife . on the other hand , while watch the advertis , one can easili believ that the knife would cut everyth , even a stone . as the economi is base on make high profit , compani may appli these strategi in order to sell their product to a wider rang of peopl . it is understand that they have to make better advertis than their rival , howev , consum must be cautiou when buy a new product that they do not know . have acknowledg the statement as `` gener '' , i also believ that well-known brand can not appli falsifi or mislead advertis , as the imag of the brand will be affect serious . in the modern time , the associ of consum and state institut are endeavour against mislead inform or advertis about the product . in addit , gain inform about product is easier on internet . therefor , consum should be encourag to use internet for their complaint and learn more about the experi of the other . in conclus , i believ that mislead consum about a product is more difficult than it use to be in the past but due to the increas number of new product in the market and measur taken by the author can not be adequ so it is not easi to state that firm do not appli thi method .
