public ha a huge impact on human , yet it work for mani compani that work on ti and creat it . a lot of thing are offer thoughout advertis and sometim they are not what they seem . those `` ad '' often manipul million of peopl and persuad them into spend money into gener , useless stuff . most product , such as `` weight-loss pill '' or a `` multi-functional-frying-lif makeover-pan '' , are realli expens and their `` ad '' often show effect that may not be real or the function that , later on , may vari or fail . so it is somehow unfair and scame for the reciev , or the one that get and absorb the advertis . mayb those pill have side effect , and as the ad doe not mention them , someon can be sever affect or sick by just consum them . or mayb the innov pan doe n't expos the risk or warn on the reciept , and someon decid to leav it , or to expos to innapropi heat - becaus they forgot or someth - and that thing expot . .. what happen then ] the advertisor will not respond for what happen to you nor will they give your money back . so that is whi the publish product can result veri riski or danger without us know about it . if someon like to consum the product as much as the `` ad '' then that person will be probabl satisfi with the result - if the product actual work - . if not , then that someon would probabl like to think about what he \ she actual need , instead of throw money away for a long time - if pay with credit - or suffer possibl harm consequ . advertis simpli do their job , becaus for me , it all depend on the level of cosum we may have . so i believ that most of those compani should not sell and offer all of those lousi thing that may be broke in a coupl of week after-purchas , or that cost a lot but have technic low qualiti result . noth is what it seem and neither is someth that we do n't know and just get becaus we want to . so let not face the risk , neither wast our money or time .
