peopl can go to the trip with a guid or go alon . in my case i would like to travel with guid . becasu we can get lost and can not comun with other peopl if we travel to the forgin place . most of all , we could get lost in the unfamil place . we can get lost easili without guid . thu we could not goe to the place that we plane befor . for exampl let say that a group of gird goe trip to the america . they plane to go to the statu of liberti . but they had troubl get a right bu . they miss the right bu so they had to spend time and money for that . and anoth problem wa that they do not know way to back . so , they had to spend whole day walk the street . in addit we could have comun problem with other without of the guid when we travel to the forgin contri . furthermor , sinc we have differ costum and cultur , both us and nativ could misunderstand . for exampl with comun problem , we can not even buy the thing . buy a small drink of can would make us cost lot of energi . the guid who is abl to speek their languag will help us process some work such as buy stuff , hotel check in . and hit softli between friend is no big deal in korea , but in japen , polic might get you becaus of your violenc . guid can give advic to us what to do and warn to us the thing we should not to do . to sum up i strongli support that it is better to travel with the guid , becaus we could get lost , and reduc comun problem .
