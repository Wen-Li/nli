thi is an import topic , and i suppos it ha been discuss for year and that will be discuss for year to come by professor and all the peopl involv in the teach and learn system . but , in my opinion , there could be no doubt of which is best for student . i am sure that is far more import for student to understand concept and idea , rather than simpl fact . that way , they not onli learn new thing , but also learn to think and to develop their imagin and ceativ . take for instanc the exampl of a student in the secondari school that is prepar a histori exam . if he onli learn the fact of what he is read , say for instanc , the french revolut , he probabl wo n't understand the develop of event and the effect that they have in modern histori . by think about the idea and concept that are the basement of the revolut , he would be abl to get a more use pictur of the topic , he will probabl rememb more thing , and abov all it will be use for hi life . talk about imagin , i can say that is also anoth desir effect of understand idea . take for exampl the graviti law : if a student onli focus hi attent in the unit use to express the acceler of graviti , and such technic detail , he will probabl miss the core of the thing . graviti is someth that involv everyh in our world , and is most import to understand it effect and implic than if it is express in foot or meter . and imagin come there to help understand all of thi . when talk about creativ , i can give an illustr exampl that clarifi it . think about great inventor , like benjamin franklin . by understand idea and put them toghet in new way , he wa abl to achiev veri relav invent and technic advanc that are today still use . on the whole , i would say that we should pay more attent to thi topic , and focu our effort to give the student the tool they need to understand thing , not onli rememb them like a robot could do .
