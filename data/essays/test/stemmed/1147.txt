some peopl prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid rather than travel individu without a tour guid . i strongli disagre with their opinion , and i have some reason to support my opinion of whi i prefer travel individu without a tour guid . at first , i dislik travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus then i would have to follow the tour schedul . if there is a tour guid , i would not be abl to travel in my own pace and look over the place where i want to visit . the place where i could go would be veri limit . secondli , i know that the inform i could get would also be veri limit if i am with a tour guid . for that reason , i have experienc travel with my famili and a tour guid onc befor when i visit thailand . befor i went to thailand i wa so excit of listen to what a tour guid would teach or tell us about the place we go . i thought a tour guid would tell us someth we do not know , or someth which is veri hard to know . howev , when i wa travel in thailand , a tour guid onli talk about the histori and the current situat about the place . she talk like if she ha memor all the phrase in a textbook or the booklet , and the booklet woult be easili gain if i go to the travel offic . i thought a tour guid 's lead wa so bore , becaus the fact or inform she said were the onc i alreadi knew . to conclud , i strongli suggest that if a person want to realli explor the place he goe , he should enjoy travel by either himself or famili , never with a tour guid . by travel with a tour guid , the inform we could know is veri limit and it is sometim what we are abl to find in the booklet or in the internet . also , the place we can go is veri limit if we are with a tour guid . therefor , to realli enjoy the travel and explor the place visit , i think it is best to travel by myself , without a tour guid .
