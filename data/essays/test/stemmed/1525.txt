there is a controversi wheher student agre that it is more signific for them to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . the major of student agre the idea . they think that understand idea and concept will make them understand better in the text . but opposit peopl think that learn fact is more import . and they claim that if they learn a lot of the fact can make them know a lot of detail in the text , also it can make them easier confer the idea when they know the fact . in my opinion , i agre the both two student ' idea . i think we can not separat the idea abov . firsti , i think that if we onli know the idea and the concept , we will be nervou and confus in mani question . for instanc , we learn comput , the teacher will tell us that the keyboard is use to input the imform to comput . just imagin , if we onli know the idea abov , can we use the comput quickli or effieci ? the answer may be imposs . so the import of the fact and detain can not be deniabl . secondli , the import of the concept is also exsit in mani field . mani peopl will say that the detain and fact can confer the idea and concept . in mani place , it may not work . so we must tri our best to learn the concept . as the old say `` concept is the soul of text ! '' we know that there are no peopl can live without the soul . from thi , we can total know that the idea and concept in the text are veri veri signific . final , we can not deni that the combin of concept and fact can work effici and quickli to solv academ problem . consequ , i totali hold the opinon that the combin of the two thing which is mention abov .
