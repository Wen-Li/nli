first of all i want to say that i strongli disagre with the statement . there are mani exempl of young peopl activ involv in the support of their commun . the first exempl i want to provid is in the environ protect in my citi . my citi is near the cost and so young peopl are realli concern about the problem of the pollut of the sea . there are an associ in my citi in which young and less young peopl spend a lot of their time to promot the respect for the sea . each year the associ organ the clean of the beach and young peopl partecip alway in alrg number . an other exempl of young peopl activ involv in the life of the commun is the men and the women that everi even and everi night give their support to peopl in a difficult situat . i person have a sister and a friend that two time a week serv the dinner for poor peopl in the cafeteria of the local . an other exempl is myself . in my univers there is an associ involv in a program for the develop of poor countri . thi organ is compos mainli by student or young engin that dure the year organ event to promot the activ of the organ and to collect the money . the money is use to financ the construct of bridg and shool directli in africa . i realli do n't believ that young peopl do not give enough time in help thier commun . in our societi is realli hard to find the time for other but i think that my gener ha made a great job in balanc its/self and other .
