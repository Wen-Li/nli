if i were to answer to thi question befor i attend the univers , i would definit have answer ye . howev , in cours of time , my judgement of advertis becam more strict and as my understand of advertis have chang in consider amount . back then , i assum that advertis , no matter what their level of qualiti and sophist are , could warrant that a product would look better and be sold immedi . think about it ! at the time , you see the product be advertis , you get influenc and are convinc to buy it . howev , what if the way the product is made look better than it actual is , is total silli ? would it not fail to now that i think about my previou thought and tri to answer the question abov , i realiz how wrong they are . as a more critic consum , i believ that the advertis aim to fool consum by show the product better than they are , do not go unnot by the consum . in other word , consum can easili recogn when advertis are exagerr the featur of a product . then , the reaction to the advertos would be : how silli is that ! in order to prevent such reaction , the advertis , especi the one that are expilicitli tri to fool the consumer , should take the consum ' intellectu level into consider . mayb , they manag to make the product seem better , but they forget to pay attent to the attidut of consum . as a counter reaction they might reject to buy the product not anymor . to sum up , my insight into the advertis is that they tri to make he product look better than is but most of of them fail to succeed to convinc the consciou consum . as a result , the product would seem exagerr and some consum could reject to buy it .
