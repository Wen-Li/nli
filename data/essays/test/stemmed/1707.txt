throughout their schooltim , student have to gain a huge amount of new knowledg . there are two differ type of deal with new materi . one is focus on understand idea and concept and the other one is just learn fact . howev , what is the more import method ? to begin with , it is veri import that student are abl to understand what they have to studi . therefor , they need to understand certain idea and concept . for instanc , if they know about the background of some theme and can rememb them for a long time , instead of forget them right after an exam . thi is more often the case when learn about idea and concept . on the other hand , learn about fact is not avoid . in some subject , student have to learn about mani fact and it is difficult to alway introduc concept . one subject where there are mani fact to learn is histori . as that time ha alreadi pass by it is often imposs to , for exampl , know the exact reason whi some invent happen and the idea and concept that were taken into consider . in conclus , student have to use both method in order to learn about new topic . the more import one , in my opinion , is understand idea and concept as to learn fact is just learn by heart and often doe not stay veri long in student mind .
