the issu whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , is controversi . on the one hand , idea and concept are built upon fact , therefor it is import to learn fact not onli for the sake of learn fact , but also for have the abil to better understand idea and concept . on the other hand , that is idea and concept that matter . therefor , i agre with the statement ; it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept for the follow reason . first , if a student just learn raw fact without understand what lie beneath or without construct ani idea on the fact to discuss or even better understand the fact , it doe not mean anyth but number or word . for exampl , if a student just know that there occur an econom crisi in europ after the second world war without understand the econom , social and polit reason behind the crisi , she will lack import understand about how and whi econom crisi occur . second , student should not just tought of fact but also be equip with the pertin methodolog to acquir fact when it is need . if the student are just tought some fact without understand how to interpret those fact , they could just answer the simpl question on the fact and it is all , educ will be inadequ and student will lack way to surviv on their feet . third , the technolog is improv so fast that the major fact of today may be obsolet tomorrow . so even if a student know all of the fact of today , he might end up know noth but obsolet data if he doe not understand the idea that is built upon the fact . but if the student understand the idea and concept , he is well awar of the overal pictur and he know how to interpret the fact even if the fact chang . in a nutshel , i believ to understand idea and concept is more import than to learn fact .
