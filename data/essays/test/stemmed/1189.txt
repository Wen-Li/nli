the world that we live in today is full of advertis . for a young man like me it is sometim difficult to deal with all these imag and messag that are tri to tell me `` buy thi , buy that ! '' . but we are now so use of see them that we are sceptic about all these ad . that whi i think that product seem much better than they realli are . first , the fact that advertis put the product in a scpecif situat will make the product more attract . for exampl , when you see a televis advertis that show someon eat an icecream on a beati beach with clear water , nice sand and blue sky . the viewer will associ the ice cream with the dream of be on a tropic island on the beach and relax . in thi sens i consid that place an ice/cream in a specif context make the product more attract . anoth way to make product look more atract than they realli are is to improv the way a product look like on a televis ad . for exampl , when you see a televis advertis for a fruit yoghurt you alway see the fresh fruit go into the yoghurt and they are alway stay nice and firm . but when you open a fruit yoghurt in real life , the fruit chunk are alway a bit spungi and ugli . we also can see thi phenomenon in fast-food restaur , when you order a hamburg you alway see on the pictur that it look delici . in fact , the hamburg look a lot less attract in realiti . i think it is normal that advertis alway make product seem much better than they realli are . the goal of advertis is to sell bigger amount of a product so they have to show the best aspect of there product without lie about it . it is the job of lot of peopl to make a product more attract . to illustr the way advertis work , i recommend a french book wich is translat in english call `` 99 franc '' written by frederiqu beigbed .
