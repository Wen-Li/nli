advertis these day are the main sourc by which a seller could attract the maximum intent of the consumer.a seller could grab the interest of the consum through avertis . i agre with thi statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . seller these day spend huge amount of money in order to launch their product in the market in which their product imag increas so they find advertis as the best sourc . as million of peopl watch telivis daili so it the best way . but gener most advertis make a fals imag in front of the consum . they will tell us about it posit effect but will exclud it side effect as their poppular of the product will decreas . for exampl the advertis of fair cream . they will present their product in thi form that it is the best of all the product and ha no side effect . they will not even tell us about the harm chemic which are ad in it . so by thi meathod a consum is cheat . but some advertis do form a true imag in front of the public . for exampl renoun brand such as nike , reebok , they have their reputit for their qualiti product . they will exclud make fals statement . but most of the compani today dont care about the qualiti of the product and will tend make low qualiti product and sell them by make fals imag of their product through advertis . anoth good exampl of fals advertis is variou scheme launch by the compani with thier product such as if one buy thier product he or she will get a free scratch card by which one could win a handful amount of money . but all these scheme are shown in the advertis in order to make thier product differ and to increas the sale of their product . so from the abov exampl i conclud that advertis are gener preferd by the seller to make it product differ and attract in front of the public .
