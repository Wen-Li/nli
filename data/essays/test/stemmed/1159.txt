are most of the peopl live nowaday success ? are they struggl to success ? peopl , nowaday , are help not onli themselv but also other peopl they , actual , do not know . therefor , success peopl usual tri new thing and take a risk . to my mind , peopl , whom are success should tri to do new thing even though sometim it is a risk . thu , i agre with the statement abov . success peopl will feel bore sometim if they continu as the same routin they do daili , whi ? with tri new thing he or she might get an advantag by do it . what are those advantag ? first , intelleignc student , for instanc , will alway studi the same way they usual do ; howev , if they chang the way they studi , they will , for sure , an advantag for thi chang . for exampl , i talk onc with a smart student and ask him , `` do you studi the same way all the time ? '' he repli , `` no ! i usual chang my studi style for enetertain . '' i ask , `` is studi have an entertain ? '' he answer , `` ye , becaus without enetertain you will not studi will . in other ward , chang the studi style help you concentr on your studi . '' for that reason , we may say that have a risk in studi give peopl an advantag . second , have a risk in the stock market , which is veri seriou . if a person alway profit money from the stock market that mean have a risk onc will not affect him or her . for instanc , i wa talk with a bank manag onc , and i ask him , `` about peopl , whom have a lot of money in their account ? and the money they use for the stock market ? '' he answer , `` those peopl are have a high think ; in other ward , they think about which stock are they go to buy ; even though they have a lot of money . '' i ask , `` but do not they have some risk with their money ? '' he repli , `` ye they do . we have onc a man had a risk and bought stock with all hi money ; after that , he got an advantag by doubl the amount of money he have . final , businessmen alway do the same thing daili . if businessmen chang the way they speak or deal with peopl by have hi employe as a friend of him . thi could be danger becaus he might give them some of the compani secret . but they could help him by not onli new idea , but new project . therefor , businessmen could get an advantag from hi employe . peopl most of the time success in thing they usual do , but in thing they do not usual do they think they will fail . without risk in peopl life they will not learn new thing . to sum up , peopl have to have risk in their life to go for the better .
