`` i 'm love it '' that wa the slogan for the mcdonald . on tv , in magazin , on billboard all they show wa thi slogan and how tastey the food look like . how yellow the fri were , and how clean there kitchen wa . but , what they do n't show is what ggoe on behind the scens . what they do n't show is that the chicken burger is not just pure chicken from a breast or a thigh of a chicken but actual her beek and finger and skin all mix in togeth . mcdonald is a worldwid commun that make million of dollar each year . the advertis that are made about it show it to be the most delciou , most water drop meal ever ! it make the person look at the advertis rush to the restraunt and order all the best ! one of the most import figur thatn help with thier advertismnt with children is there famou clown . children can certanilli not read . but , when they see a clown , like the one in mcdonald with color hair and a yellow jumpsuit , they get all excit hope and wish that he would be proud of them if they eat a meal . anoth product that make you want to rush to the supermarket after watch the advertis on tv is the pepsi commerci . it make it seem like when a person drink pepsi he suddenli is god ! with the energi he gest after drink it , and the celbriti he meet after drink , it certanilli make it worhtwhil . so , as i state befor those two exampl clearli show and prove that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . unfortuantley , that is the whole point of advertis . if a product look exactli like the way it is on tv and in real life no noe will get juicci up to buy it !
