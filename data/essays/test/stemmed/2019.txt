in my opinion , most advertis or commerci give a better imag of the product than what they realli are . it is normal , becaus the aim of a advertis is to sell the product , to creat a desir among the popul to buy them . more the product will look fabul , advantag to the consum , more the popul will want to have and buy them . it is particularli true , for instanc , for wash powder , everi advertis say that their powder can wash cleaner than the other , and that all the dirt will go away easili . thi phenomenum increas becaus everi compani want the best advertis for their product , therefor will add some advantag to the product , that the product doe not have in realiti . to answer to it , the other competitor will add new advantag . therefor , it is like a race between competitor to have the best advertis . but there have to be limit to thi race , compani should not be abl to say everth they want about the product they sell , becaus then the advertis becom a fals statement of fact and no more just emphas of the realiti . then there is misrepresent and the advertis becom lie , and peopl without a lot of inform or knowledg about the product will beliv the advertis . that is the reason whi i think some rule have to be settl in order to give a legal frame for the creation of advertis . the rule should be written by the parliament , becaus it is a nation matter , and the parliament should receiv advic from special comite , which have more skill to appreci the `` advertis world '' . in franc , for exampl , there are a lot of regul in thi topic . firstli , it defin an advertis , compar to a fals statement . secondli , it establish differ action in justic to claim for damag for the loss suffer by buy product at a veri high price for a veri low qualiti . to conclud , i total agre with the statement and becaus it is a realiti , rule should provid way to frame it , so the advertis of the product remain close to the real qualiti of the product .
