i do not agre with the statement becuas there is no specif formula for success in everyth what ever one like to do . a person success on a particular thing need not be success in all the thing that he doe . i know a person who is a good teacher , he start an academ institut , becaus he is a teacher he know the need of the student and plan the cours accordingli , hi train class and materi were veri success , he could attract somani student to hi institut . he earn lot of money and reput . after a while realest busi start pick up in hi citi , he start ventur hi hand into it , as he is not experiencd in that busi , he fail miser . may the proverb a bird in hand is better than two inth bush is more opt for him . a success news paper owner known to me in my state enter into bank sector . loke at the success of hi news paper peol start inves into hi bank , after see the success again here , he divert the fund to movi make where he ha fail miser , peopl who invest in hi bank are troubl as he is not in a posit to pay the money back . good plan and good domain knowledg can onli make the peopl succcess but not evri boy who tri at new ventur without do a good risk analisi . a teacher should not be made a soldier there by we may be get a bad soldier and lose a good teacher . so i strongli feel peopl should continu in the field where they are realli expert , and should not keep move to everyth that come on their way and start experimentng .
