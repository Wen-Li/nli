although some peopl may say that have onli one special knowledg is help , i believ that have broad knowledg is better . it is becaus that the wide knowledg can be use on peopl 's job and even creat a new field . the first reason is that peopl may adapt the broad knowledg into their own work , so the work can be done effect . for exampl , one of cousin had graduat from a medic shool . howev , after the graduat , he realiz that the one thing he trueli want to learn wa music . therefor , he reenter the univers as a music major . he enjoy the music for the campu life , and when about to graduat the univers again , he worri about hi career . everi musician close to him suggest him not to be a just musician becaus musician do not earn much money in a realiti . therefor , he decid to be a doctor again . other friend said to him that he wast time on music . howev , he becam a doctor who work in music clinic . no other doctor could know about music better than he could . thu , he is a number one doctor in music clinic now in my countri , korea . the music which is veri differ from medicin help the diffent job . as i explain , much knowledg can be significantli use in ani other field . the second reason is that even a new field can be creat by a person who ha broad academ knowledg . mr.dalson is a famou artist . howev , even 20 year ago from now , he wa a mechan . he alway want to becom an artist , but realiti doe not let him be . one day , he quit hi machan job and start hi art work . accord to what he had done for hi whole life , machan , he combin those two work , art and machan . no one support him and said the creatur are wield . howev , now , he is consid as a artist who creat a new artform `` machan art '' . as mr.dalson did , differ academ subject can combin and be a novel subject . have broad knowledg is not onli use on one 's work , but also creat a new field .
