i think that thi statement is onli partial true . if we look at survey and poll about thi topic may be we should agre with it but i know a lot of peopl who tri to help the commun as often as they can . actual survey analyz wider sampl of peopl and for thi reason it might be more accur than my `` survey '' but i prefer to believ that the person interview were the wrong one ! i believ that young peopl today are veri sensit toward the problem of their commun especi becaus the mass media broadcast a lot of inform about it . to me young peopl are not the `` bad person '' they are deem to be by adult but , at least in small town , the major of them dedic a lot of their free time to the commun . in my town , for exampl , on sunday , instead of go out , my friend and i organ event for poor kid , as for exampl karaok or drama . from time to time we go to clean park around the town and we dedic to old peopl who are alon and need someon who goe to take medicin or food for them . i know a lot of boy and girl who do it , in other town too . thi is not an attempt to elogi myself and my friend but i want to demonstr that young peopl take care of the commun and care about the way it work cooper to improv it . anoth way in wich young peopl spend their time in help their commun is work as volunt for the local health assist . i have to admit that it take a lot of time and i ca n't join it but there are a lot of young peopl who go there on saturday night instead of go to club with friend , onli to help the commun . in conclus , in spite of the fact that survey show that nowaday young peopl are careless toward the commun my experi tell me someth differ . thi is the reason whi i can disagre with it without admit that survey can be right .
