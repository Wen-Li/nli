i would not favorit a travel in a group with a guid . onc in my trip to austrailia , i had hard time tour . i could not look around the place i want to visit . the guid also made me to spend money . i would never go on such a travel again . i did not feel free dure the visit in the austrailia . in the zoo , i wa not allow to see anim except koala and kangeroo . we also spent onli an hour and half in the zoo . it wa a littl annoy that the guid tell us what to do or how to do . move in group wa also uncomfort . i could not talk person in the bu . i need to be quiet too . most of the adult were asleep while move . the sight of the austrailia wa beauti and all . howev , i could not enjoy myself dure the vacat due to the group led by a tour guid . the expens of the travel also increas . accord to a research done by korean journalist in josun ilbo , the amount of money spent increas when travel with the guid . the reason is that the guid alway temp the guest to by gift or decor thing that are useless . about 82 percent of the peopl respond that they bought a gift that wa unneccesari . thi is all becaus of the travel guid , who is tri to gain good by sell the gift to the guest . i had experienc onc , and spent 50 dollar on a useless decor . so i did not travel with a guid while the visit in new york citi . and thi time , i did not consum anyth unneccesari . travel is to relax and enjoy themselv . the vacat should not be interrupt . travel in group may feel realli uneasi . i can not enjoy my privat time . also , i do not need ani travel guid that alway requir money , and temp me to spend some . i would like a vacat for myself , that is not bother by anyth or anybodi .
