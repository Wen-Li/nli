i realli do agre with the statement . it tell that ` idea and concept ' - so the matrix of an subject-ar more import to be understood than learn detail , number and fact . my agreement is easi and logic to be explain . if a student understand the structur , the base or the pattern of a problem he will fairli can develop hi own idea and thought about it which actual wil help him to understand the world in it complet . sure he will get a better mark for write down all fact and number in an testpap but thi is onli a veri short last success . a long reward success would be hi comprehend of the content of all the number and fact . let me give you one exampl : a student learn about the govern . he studi all the name of meber in the parliament but doe neither ask himself nor the teacher for backround inform . for hidden connect which can reveal veri interest or even worri aspect of our democrazi . if there were not those peopl who alway ask for more inform , for the sourc and of cours the concept behind everyth case like the nixon-affair would have never been uncov . let 's come back to the student who unfourtanetli ha got other motiv for hi act . to be curiou is one part of the learn progress and thi curious bring differ way of make thing memor . fact and detail sure will make someon know about someth but it wo n't make him understand it . for me it is much more import to get the idea of someth becaus with that idea you are abl to think about it yourself . i will shortli explain what i mean by that . if you for exampl copi an idea directli into your mind and you realli understand everi thought behind it you will be abl to convert or make use of it concern topic that differ from the origin one . thi mean you may will find better fit area which for exampl can be more profit . mayb you will find aspect that can proov and idea at anoth time or anoth place on earth . imagin a simpl constel : someon somewher found out that wood can be use to build boat . he found that while be in europ but you life in the us . you and a friend hear about the find of thi person . your friend just save the fact in hi mind that you can use wood to build boat . you yourself are a bit more curiou than your friend and you ask yourself some question about the principl that stand behind the fact . you-at the speed of light-find out that wood in it natur state is abl to swim . now you are abl to use your knowledg about the idea of the other guy in addit to the concept you learn and you-at least theoretical-ar abl to build up your own boat compani . so after write thi essay my opinion remain the same > learn the concept and ( main - ) idea of someth is better than just keep fact and detail in mind for a long time with no practis use of it-except know them .
