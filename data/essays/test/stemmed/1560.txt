i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . one of the reason that i think it is is becaus peopl can be sccuess onli after you start new thing . when you tri to do someth new , it can end be sccess , or can end not be . but how could you get a sccess withought even start it ? the point is that if you want to get a sccess , you first tri to start someth . anoth thing is that take risk can lead you to be a success person in the end . when you take risk , that is when you will face some problem do it . i think those time are when you learn to do someth , becaus you will be deal with problem , and after a while , you will have grown . when you have grown , i think you have scceed in your life . we can see whi you have to take risk from some peopl , too , like hiker . some peopl go into mountain with onli a bag , tri to go somewher they have never been to . they are risk their life , but when they make it , you can alway see their face full of smile which show you their huge sccess . if you do what you alreadi know all the time , you can not never go ahead . onc you start new thing , and take risk , you can go forward . be sccess is not that easi to be , becaus there is alway `` not sccess '' on the other hand . howev , without even start the new thing , you will not be abl to learn anyth .
