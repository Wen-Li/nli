`` eat dr. andr slim pill and loos 10 kg of weight in a matter of 10 day '' . doe that claim seem familiar ? . i am sure most of us are use to readin such trite advertis in the daili , magazin , hoarding-almost everywher . but how mani of the claim made in these advertis realli true ? a miser small percntag in my opinion . i firmli support the topic of thi discuss . i feel , that to attract a vast custom base , compai issu advertis which not onli dismiss the side effect or disadvantag of their product but also exager the advntag . due to the competit natur of the market , most compani tend to spend a lot on advertis which glorifi their product . for eg. slim product or techniqu , as i mention befor , are advertis almost everyeher , but nowher will custom find out about their side-effect until they themslev encount these ! a similar examl is of the never end advertis of the suppos `` fair '' cream avail in the indian market . when such product are actual use by the cutom , they dont genreal fullfil their claim and instead expos their disadvantag or side effect , enc caus a feel of everincres dissatisfact among the custom . the custom feel cheat and exploit wherea the compani salescontinu increas due to more cutom be fool by the `` glorifi advertis '' . a feel of prpetual distrust harm other genuin product and their advertis too . i strongli feel that the govern should do someth about thi issu . i feel that each product befor enter the market should be test by a govern organ to ascertain it advantag and list it disadvantag and side effect . the compani should be permit to list onli the confirm advantag in it advertisemnt and also includ the side effect it may caus . thi way the custom will be abl to bank on the advertis of the product . thi , i feel , is the onli plausibl solut to thi problem .
