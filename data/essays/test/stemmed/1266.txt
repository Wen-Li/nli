whether most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ? there is much debat over thi question . some peopl claim that advertis are respons for provid some engag and wonder pictur of product to most audienc for entertain , while ani other peopl hold the oppist opinion that these advertis would confus the decis of peopl and make peopl purchas some useless good . in my opinion , i think i would side with the latter opinion and the good appear in most advertis are actual not real . first of all , usual the main purpos of most design of advertis is make the good or servic design by them seem like perfect and they also want to see the result that everyon who after look thi advertis is will to buy the good and servic they want to public . in a word , all of these delic design are readi for own the prefer of most peopl and earn the more commerci benefit . secondli , under the strong competit , which advertis could stand out is the key point of get the success in the field of busi . so i believ that all of these larg advertis compani would tri their best and make the biggest effort to produc the exagger appear of the good and servic for attract peopl . what is the result ? the avail advertis turn out to be more and more out of real situat . at last , we must admit peopl prefer view some beauti and attract pictur . that is to say , if advertis are not engag enough to grasp the eyebal of audienc , their advertis would not make sens as well as the product they will introduc . so see from thi angl , make unreal advertis are unavoid . all in all , there is no doubt that more and more peopl would come to arriv at the same conclus with me and begin to realiz the real situat of advertis . all the point discuss in the abov argument demonstr that the real advertis with loyal introduct of good ' funtion or effect are not exist .
