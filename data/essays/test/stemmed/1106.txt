nowaday , mani peopl think the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guid becaus thi way is veri convini . but in my opinion , i disagre with the idea . i prefer to travel by myself . the last year , i travel to the yunnan provinc with the group by a tour guid . befor the trip , i wa veri excit becaus i would have a wonder trip and visit so beauti place . but i wa disappoint . the agent wa not respons for the trip . in some place , i did n't have enough time to visit and to have some photo becaus the guid bring me to some store and lost much time . so i think that if we have a consider plan we are not necessari to travel with the group by a tour guid . firstli , thi way to travel lost a lot of money . the guid may take you to some store . if you ca n't buy the good , the guid may not have a good attitud to you in the fellow trip becaus the guid lost the award from the store owner . moreov , if you enter the group , you must pay for the trip which mayb more expens than the tip by individu . secondli , travel with the group lost a lot of time . the reason is that there are a lot of peopl in the grop , not just onli you , so you must wait for the other peopl when you go to the next place . also , the guid spend a lot of time in the shop so that you do n't have enough time to learn more knowleg of the next place . thirdli , you ca n't feel the freedom when you travel in a group by a guid . the travel plan is unchang in the process of the trip . when you konw a new interest place and want to visit it in the trip , the guid must n't agre with you . in a word , the trip by individu is more free and cheaper than the travel in the group by a tour guid . so i suggest that if you want to travel , you can tri to go with yourself . mayb you have a differ and wonder trip .
