although some peopl think that is more import for student to have knowledg base on fact , i think that is more valuabl for them to understand idea and concept . i support thi becaus in thi way , student know a varieti of topic , can use thi knowledg in order to develop their own point of view and also use thi idea they can develop their own concept . in the follow paragraph i am go to explain thi benefit and also give some exampl in order to explain my posit . first of all , understand idea and concept is use becaus student can discuss a varieti of topic that their teacher have transmit to them in class . for exampl , i rememb one opportun , i wa in my work and i had to discuss about market and by use my knowledg about a theori that my teacher explain me i culd support my opinion . anoth benefit is that when you know concept , you can build up your own point of view , thi mean that you evalu differ idea that you have recib and decid what is your posit . for exampl , when an student is learn about the differ among a varieti of religion . they leanr about the philosopi of each religion and they can decid which one is better for them . moreov , use idea and concept student can develop their own concept . so , they not onli evalu inform , but also creat new inform . thi is what happen in mani chemestri lab , they have the knowledg and discov new theori . as a conclus , in my opinion is more import for learnear to understand idea an concept than learn about fact , due to the reason that i explain befor . i think in the futur mani school will follow thi method becaus student learn better than learn by fact .
