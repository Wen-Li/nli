it is quit a widespread opinion that our western societi are becom more and more self-cent . that thesi of cours extend to the youth , make it neccesari to ask oneself whether it is true or not that young peopl are not engag enough in help their commun . it is possibl to find some evid that the comit of young peopl to their commun significantli diminush over the past decad , but that thi may be due to a shift in the definit young peopl have of `` their '' commun . it can not be deni that young peopl seem to be less integr in the commun than they use to . young peopl , at least in the european countri i know , are not often to be seen in religi manifest : that is an evid that the feel of membership in a religi commun is way weaker than he wa for 50 year , lead to a reduc amount of time given to support thi commun . moreov , it seem to me that peopl , especi young peopl , valu more an more the time they have for them own , so they are more and more reluct to give him , for ani caus . thi could be seen as a consequ of our way of live , that give an huge valu to leisur , but it could also be link that a larg proport of young peopl are do studi that requir a signific amount of work time at home . even if those fact tend to argu in favour of a desafect of young peopl from their commun , it can not be overseen that young peopl sometim give larg amount of time for none tradit `` commun '' , that absorb the time that would have been devot to other commun for a few decad . for exampl , the non-profit humanitari organ have a larg prportion of young member ; the student associ are more activ than ever . thi trend to chose one 's `` commun '' rather than to adher to a tradit one can be quit danger : it is an explan of the recent increas in number and power of the gang . to put it in a nutshel , it 's not true that young peopl do n't want to spend time for a commun , but they do it for a commun they have chosen rather than the tradit one
