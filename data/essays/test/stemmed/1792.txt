i can say that i am the person who travel mani time . sinc 1999 , i visit the itali , england , egypt , austrailia , and thailand , etc to broaden my perspect . i think that the most import thing that i learn from these trip is that be with the group and a tour guid is the best way to travel . the reason are as follow . first of all , we can enjoy the systemat plan trip . in my case , i went on england without ani group member nor tour guid . i rememb that it wa the most terribl trip that i have ever experienc . at that time , i could not ask for help to anyon , as i wa not good at english . so , i just stay all seven day at the hotel . what i could do at that time wa just look englishmen who look much happier than me over the hotel window . on the other hand , when i went the austrailia with mani group member and a tour guid , i could enjoy a happi trip . the tour guid assign the time for trip effect , so i could visit a lot of tourist attract , which might be unnot if i went alon . i felt that the tour guid is a indispens element for the great trip . furthermor , i can definit say that we do not need to feel loneli if we go on a travel with other peopl . as i impli abov , i wa veri lone when i went to england alon . there wa nobodi i could commun with . howev , i could enjoy the trip better with a lot of peopl when i went to egypt . in addit , the group member who accompani with me were all korean , like me . we were veri happi to meet peopl who were abl to commun with . i think that it wa also veri excit experi to listen other peopl 's stori dure commun with other , not onli to look around famou place of foreign countri . in conclus , i am convinc that it is better to be with group member and a tour guid when we go on a travel . they enabl us to enjoy well-plan tour altogeth .
