i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . three reason will be explain for thi agreement . firstli , everyth is chang at ani time and ani place . the fact that student learn at thi time may be differ after a certain time , or if the condit are chang . a good exampl will be weigh an object . as we know , the mass of an object will not chang , while the weight will be differ at differ place as the differ effect of graviti . assum one weigh himself or herself in egypt and finland , the result can be surpris . if he or she know the differ effect factor of graviti , it will no longer be a surpris to `` chang the weight so much at differ place '' . moreov , the idea and concept are the basic principl that we can appli to mani other system or condit . for instanc , the copper-aluminum alloy with the same composit vari much from each other in their properti of hard under differ treatment , but the strengthen principl is the same . the hard of one alloy can reach as high as 120 after anneal at 600k for 10 hour , which is taught by a teacher in the class . then , what will be the situat if the temperatur chang to 400k ? obvious , it will not be 120 . the student can onli use the idea or concept of strengthen to solv thi problem and get the right answer . addit , it is much easier for us to rememb the knowledg by understand their idea and concept than by just recit the fact . as our brain can onli stor limit contain , there will be too mani thing for us to rememb . if we can tell how one thing work , we can also tell how other thing work , which mean we can rememb a seri of fact instead of one . for all these three reason , i strongli recommand that everi student need to understand the idea and concept that you learn from your professor or classmat or other resourc , rather than just to repeat what you get .
