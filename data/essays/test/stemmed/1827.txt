basic i am not in accord with the opinion . such kind of generalis is not possibl . becaus there are lot of evid which prove that young peopl are still serious awar of their commun . there are lot of club which are realli veri help . and also there are charit group and ofcours still there are lot of blood donat camp . and in those camp most of the donar are young boy and girl . still we see that yong peopl show their respect by offer their own seat to age and weak person . lot of cultur programm are still held in local to entertain the common peopl by young peopl which difut the opinion state by the speaker . but it is realli true that peopl now a day are much more busi thn earlier . due to the increas competit peopl are engag more in their person life . but it is not their own fault . if we compar the activ of young peopl of nowaday with the past then we see that now peopl are more con cern to their career and their studi . but it is not true that they are not concern of thair commun atal . still now if there ani flaw aris in our societi young peopl are those who come first to solv the problem . few day ago i heard about a club of young peopl who took the all respons when a small boy just fall down from a build . and the most amaz fact is that there were a lot of peopl who were age but they did not take the respons of the boy to carri him to the near by hospit . but the club member when came to know about the incidend they just rush to the spot and carri the boy to the hospit without care about the polic and all other risk . actual there are a lot of incid which prove that the statement is a realli flaw and baseless . so from yhe state explan we can simpli conclud that young peopl are still as much activ as past regard the time they spend for their communiti
