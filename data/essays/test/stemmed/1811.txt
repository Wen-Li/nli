be a student is not a profession situat sinc ani student can not earn money from hi or her knowedg . becaus of thi , student sometim ca n't concentr on what to emphasis in their live . howev in time they realis what is the most import thing about their educt life . but thi awar may occur late and that will ruin the person 's life badli . i definet beliv that , it is more import for student to learn fact rather than understand idea and concept . i observ peopl around me and see that peopl use their knowledg in their busi and daili life . in addit a person without an expertis and full of idea doe n't mean anyth to peopl . first of all , be a student is the first step into busi life and in busi life you are noth without fact and scientif reason . i see that busi life is full of stress and difficulti and the onli way to beat these difficulti is the fact that learnt in the school life . as an employe or a manag a person should show all the sign of hi or her expertis , in order to handl thing properli . i am sure that idea and concept are not enough to maintain your posit in a compani , hovew fact will bring you the way of succed . i have involv a number of compani as a tranie and saw that all the peopl work as manag are the peopl that know everyth that they should know . secondli be full with fact is an import issu in daili life too . rather than be worker ; peopl becam mother , father , neigbour and etc . and peopl around you will look for the fact that you can give to them . for instanc a mother can not grow her child with idea and concept , nonetheless she will use certain fact of life to make her child more interest . it is not imagin that a mother is prevent her littl child from the stove by tell him concept about heat , she show the result of the heat , she show the fact . or doe it make ani sens to talk about idea on a convers between a neighbour about the apart water channel ? in conclus , life is the art of handl the harsh condit and the onli way to do is the fact you have . so i think a student should get concentr on the fact that present in their educ life . that will bring happi in both busi and daili life .
