everyday we are remind of the fact that we head toward a cleaner futur , a better futur . a futur wherein there will be less pollut . thi would be attribut to the assumpt of less car in the futur . howev , in my opinion , not onli will it take us a long time to reach our goal for a `` cleaner futur '' , but there will be a mark increas in car over time . there are variou reason for my support of thi stanc . popul growth , as alway continu to be a problem . on the one hand it mean an increas in poverti . on the other hand it also mean an increas in more middl incom peopl , increas employ , etc . these type of peopl consid a car a necess without which they can not surviv . thi will creat a persist , consist increas in the number of car we see on the road . howev , it is not onli the middl class that will creat an increas in thi . everi type of incom earner would caus an increas in car , some , by just be born . as famili becom progress bigger it is imper to have more than one car . for exampl , in a famili where both the husband and the wife are work there will be atleast two car . most govern over the world are face a popul `` explos '' of sort in their countri . due to thi , public transport system have to be establish and grown progress , while it is true that thi doe solv the problem of less car on the road , it is also true that some , like high incom earner will not avail of these type of transport system . annual increas in some public transport system like public buse also contribut in a small way to increas vehicl on the road . thi also lead me to my next point - car are , in today world consid , like mani other product , to be a symbol for statu . for exampl , a wealthi famili would not be content with have just one car , or even two . it is not uncommon to see five or six car in come peopl 's garag , espesci the rich one . anoth possibl increas in the amount of car on the road is the possibl of have `` enviroment safe '' car in the futur . if these car , like the honda privia , is made public , then mani peopl would buy these car and , as such caus an increas in the number of automobil we see on the road . in conclus , it is my opinion that there will not be fewer car in the futur .
