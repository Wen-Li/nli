the statement is not complet true that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . i am a veri respons person toward the societi . i agre that there are irrespons peopl toward thier societi . like for exampl , i am a member of a blood group camp which is held monthli . i go to differr place with the camp and serv mani peopl who are in need . and i donat my blood everi month due to lack of aval of blood . mainli , student should feel respons toward there countri by help peopl . due to lack of commun between the societi and student , they are ignor and unabl to find the right need for the societi . there are differ communti by which peopl can serv there nation . like join blood bank , keep there surround clean and tidi , follow traffic rule by prevent accid . and peopl dont want to come by themselv , someon have to start someth . who will thi someon ? that someon have to be everi individu in the societi . some peopl want to help the societi they dont care whether they get ani money or not . but some are so concern but there person life , they forget the duiti of a citizen . everi citizen have to feel respons and have to think in a postiv way toward there societi . for exampl , in india peopl are not at all worri about the problem happen in and around us . they think whi should we care for them , as they are not my famili member . and peopl get corrupt for do wrong thing and they hurt the peopl live in the societi and even they can kill a preson for the money . so i conclud that young peopl are respons but they have to be remind by the societi . and the respons for the young peopl toward the societi should not go down and they have the right to protest , if anyth goe wrong and encourag the societi for form more commun to serv there countri much better .
