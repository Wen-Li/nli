i believ that the statement is true . the purpos of advertis are to foster peopl to buy their product , and so it is understand that the compani are make the product seem much better than they realli are . take as an exampl , there are mani advertis about cigarett . mani of them use young and beauti model who are smoke and beauti place like paradis . these imag make us feel that smoke cigarret make the person seem cool and feel good . but the cigarett have bad effect on bodi and even if you smoke one , you would not feel that you are cool or good and smoke it doe not put you in a beauti place . anoth exampl is advertis on food . in the commerci on tv , the model are eat the food as if it is the most delici food in the world , and they are decor in a veri organ and beauti way . but when you buy the food in the real life , it doe not look as good as when it wa on tv and it could tast normal or even bad . as a conclus , we are attract by the imag of advertis which seem better than the real one , and these make us buy the product . i sometim feel that it is deciev when the compani make them seem much better than they realli are .
