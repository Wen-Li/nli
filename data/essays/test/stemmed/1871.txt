i agre with the opinion that most advertis make product much more better than thay realli are for the follow reason . first , thi '' believ '' sound quit logic beacus the firm that creat the product want to have the biggest benefit as possibl , therefor it accept to '' tell lie '' to peopl to achiev thi goal . second , by adopt thi method the firm doe n't violat ani legal rule , at least for mani kind of product . in fact there is no rule state that what you tell about a product need to be proov , except in case of pharmaceut on other product of thi type . for exampl , to creat e commercialis an advertis show that a perfum can render a man irresist you do n't need to make a resarch and obtain certain find to proov it , you can simpli tell it . that 's a good point for firm to adopt thi method . third , there is a lot of present research focus on find the best way to control mind . these area of research is call '' commerci neurosci '' and it is tri to find out how to manipul the brain of peopl and to convinc them that a certain product is good and is valuabl to buy it . final , the firm doe n't risk anyth by present the product better than it realli is . in fact the nice and posit imag given will increas the number of peopl that are curiou and want to tri it and if it will work , mean peopl will continu to buy it , it is good . on the other hand , if peopl ar enot happi onc test the product , they will just stop to buy it but noth dramat wil happen to the firm .
