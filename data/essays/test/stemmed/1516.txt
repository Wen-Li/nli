human be have never compromis with innov , from the stone age to present modern life , the societi ha work for the better and develop as a whole . one of the finest exampl could be a the steam engin , that drive mani countri for almost half centuri , the best use of steam engin wa for locomot purpos , and one of the most seen locomot is a car . car on the cours of develop ha reach to such a perfect stand that it ha becom necess for each individu . with the advanc of the machin and other faccil it ha becom the most help invent for the mankind and sinc then there ha been a gradual increas in the number of car on the road . and i still beliv that though there could be mani reason whi one can think of fewer number of car in the nxt twenti year i do not agre to the point . to begin with i shall tri to give some reason whi one can think that there would be fewer number of car on the road . car requir fuel , such as petrol or diesel or some other form of energi provid fossil . the number of car on the road depend a lot on the suppli of fuel which defin will finish on our earth but then the reservoir have enough fuel to last for nest ten decad and the explor are in search of new oil feild , moreov we have also shift from the basic fuel to altern fuel such as the car driven by electr suppli . henc , i dont think thi could be one of the reason whi there would be fewer car in use after twenti year then now . then other reason could be that peopl might opt for other mode such as person plane which are far more effici and save time , but they are not veri econom and doe not fit to the pocket of mani ! other resason could be that peopl might shift to public transport becaus the present number of car can be seen as the satur in the big citi like washington or newyork , but there are mani other countri where the satur is still not reach , in fact the larger portion of the societi in develop countri wa not so suffici to buy car as they are now and henc , the market expect a larger rowth may be in next twenti year these market would also satur and to save time peopl might switch to public transport but then too the number of car would be much more then present . moreov public transport can alway be opt at the cost of independ . in gener one opt for anoth option if the present condit is not abl to satisfi the need , or is heavi on pocket or some sort of hidden advantag , but i see no other option give so mani advantag as a normal car doe atleast when compar to the option we have . unless their is a better altern that i can not see of in present futur i can not agre to the point that there would be fewer number of car after twenti year .
