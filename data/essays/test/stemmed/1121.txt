my countri is knowen by peopl live in there . becos peopl in my countri are veri hot and helpful . nowaday there is a common question , ' do young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun ' . i believ that our peopl are chang by day by . nowaday young peopl becom less helpful for their commun . firt of all , young peopl must behav more helpful in their commun becaus , they must know that one day they will be old . last week , i saw an old women in the street and she ha lot of laggug . her laggug were veri heavi for her , there were lot of young peopl in the street howev none of them ha not help her . thi was'nt good behaviour for me , i do not appreci thi kind of behaviour when i saw that occur my think had exactli chang . befor that occur i wa think that our young peopl are veri helpful but after that my opinion chang . now i think our societi is go on a bad way . whi young peopl think onli their benefit is veri import and it answer must be search . in a commun , peopl ' s behaviour develop as an earli age . young peopl in commun mus't be helpful all the time . we must not teach young person when they were young . if we do n't teach them such kind of thing in earli age , they will not be good citizen for their countri . to some up , our peopl 's behaviour are chang nowaday . we should do some thing for thi situat . we must educ our children in a right way and teach them not to think onli their benefit .
