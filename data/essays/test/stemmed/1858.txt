the issu state that will their be fewer car in come twenti year from now . i disagre with the staement . i believ their will be an increas in the car densiti on the road twenti year from now . the first reason whi do i believ in thi is that increas in the employ oppurun in the countri . as the countri is progress or develop there are lot mulitn compani come into the feild which give lot employ , make person sound financi , as a consequ peopl can easili afford car which will further increas the car popul on the raod in near futur . secondlli i think competit between the bank , which provid loan for the car on easi instal that will also encourag the peopl to buy more car . thridli i think the peopl densiti is increas in the metreopolitan citi therefor peopl donnot get job in the vicin of their home and the job that are avail are far from the home , therefor they requir their own privat vehicl like car to reach on time and cover up distanc from the home to the work place . final reason for my belief for increas in the car densiti in come twenti year is the competit between car manufactur . to promot the sale of their compani car , they are current come with slash down rate . thi tempt peopl to buy more car . as i look back over the decad the car densiti ha increas ten time and accord to the news report these compani are come with new straegi to promat their sale in come few decad . i conclud my opinion on the abov statement by state that the car densiti will rise becaus of easi loan facil , for convienc of peopl and come uf strong copetit in car maufactur market .
