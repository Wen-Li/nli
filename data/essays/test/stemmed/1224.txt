i total agre with the statement becaus , to begin with , it is not use to learn fact if you do not understand them . you would not be abl to appli these concept when you need them , for exampl , a theori or a mathemat formula store in your head would not be use if you do not understand how to use it . i believ that for appli a concept in a real life case , it a must to know how to develop that concept and get the most out of it . i will support my view the follow - social environ . talk about ethic in school , if a student do not know complet understand the valu and the content of the cours he will not be abl to respect and toler differ point of view or idea of peopl in the real world that can be join with differ background and experi . - profession environ . it is import for a profession that he appli all what he learnt in hi career and practic everi day to improv in those area need to success in whatev respons that demand hi full perform . for exampl , it is not use to learn all the economi principl if you do not know how to appli them in both the busi environ and the nation environ . furthermor , thi comprehens of a whole subject or theori will give the student more confid of what he is capabl of do ; thu , improv hi perform in everi aspect of hi life . if a student want to enrich hi educ in all aspect he must know how to use these concept by understand them . i think that the best way for an student to achiev thi is not onli learn the fundament of the theori , but also practic them in in real life .
