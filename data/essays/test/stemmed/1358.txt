in my opinion it is import to take risk in order to be a success person . i therefor agre with the statement that success peopl more often tri new thing . in order to be a success person you need to risk chanc and tri thing out . ( it also matter that if you are financi success person and the cushion you land on by fail is softer . ) as long as you do onli what you know how to do there is less chanc of failur , but also limit chanc to reach a new level of busi , understand or even a new contin . if christoph columbu would n't have risk hi health , the money of hi king and a lot of time , he would n't have found america . and in thi exampl the failur of the contract wa a stori of success in itself . therefor the tale of success is often a stori of take chanc whose outcom is not clear . a person will be even more success if enter space that no one ha enter befor - take the road less travel - , it doe n't matter if it is a contin or a new invent in a laboratori . anoth reason for the conherit of success and risk-tak is that success peopl are more self-confid . a good confid in yourself and the world is extrem import to take chanc , but also to win peopl over with your idea . if columbu would n't have been self-confid he would n't have persuad the spanish king in give him money and ship . the stori of success , be self-confid and take risk therefor is link .
