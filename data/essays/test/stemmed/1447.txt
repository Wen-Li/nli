i believ the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' to be true for the follow reason . first of all , attempt to do new thing can expand one 's percept of thing , and bring new idea to perform better at it task . for exampl , diesel engin power train overtak the coal power train for it better effici . mani stay skeptic about the diesel as new energi carrier becaus it wa new and human mind tend to stick to one they are familiar with . some compani suffer after domin of diesel take place , wherea one that read the trend and took risk of go out of busi suceed and surviv . second of all , rate of the technolog improv and replac the one that becom obsolet is not linear , but exponenti . it mean the world is continu chang . in thi fast chang world , to be abl to be competet , one ha to step ahead of everyon els which requir take one step further than what is alreadi out , that can be riski yet benefici . third of all , i , as a person who enjoy mani form of art , evalu creativ highli as the primari goal of art . human mind make us feel comfort to one we are familiar with , but often boresom . howev , differ and new materi excit human brain which manipul sens of happi . tri new , foreign materi is though often riski in art world . critic might see it as too differ and not be satisfi . without attempt someth differ , art would have not suceed to spread , it might have die out as peopl seek for excit . to be success , there are certain sacrific that have to be made . tri new thing sometim seem insan , and too riski . but as the histori prove , it is better to take risk .
