it happen to me a lot of time to tast food or to tri a product that reveal to be not as good as shown in the advertis . the mass media can do miracl in show item to be put on the market in a differ way . they use the imag , which can modifi a lot the real consist of the item to be advertis . for instanc , what you look through the televis or on a poster on the street is slightli differ from the realiti becaus of the use of colour and light when photograf the product . the advertis use market strategi , abouv all in show you the product with the perfect background : right word and slogan . they use the tool of commun to attract you . in addit they tri to make a good use of time ( usual they have realli short time ) and imag , a good combin of both of them make an advert veri success . they also know to whom address their porpous , usual they use target group , in which children and elederli are most common . as far as food is concern , i think that advertis can be a sours of attract for the buyer becaus they onli see the product without tast it . but i think that you can do a wrong choic the first time then you know that for the follow time you will be not buy the same product even if it is good advertis . i prefer to watch a product with my eye than let me convic by the advert , even if sometim they are realli well done and a kind of art .
