`` move fast everyon ! we have to hurri for the next cours to see . '' it is common situat when we travel in a group with tour guid in the popular place . in my opinion , travel in a group led by a tour guid is not the best way to travel . first reason is that it is time consum . in addit i can experi adventuru travel when travel alon , not led by a tour guid . first of all , when we travel with other peopl in a group , it is time comsum . everytim we move to other place to see , we have to wait for other peopl who did not arriv at bu from the first place . i had a bad experic when i travel to china in a group led by tour guid . the first spot we visit wa great wall and next cours wa tri some tradit chines food . howev , there were some peopl who lost their way in the great wall and did not come to the place we promis to meet . almost one and half hour past , they final arriv at the meet place and we could not take the next cours and mess up whole valuabl day for travel . moreov , i can have great opportun to experi the uniqu and adventur thing at unfamilar place . when we travel with a tour guid , they alway offer us the perfect schedul for travel . howev , there are mani peopl who want to experi special thing and take some risk when they travel , not the formal cours that travel agenc offer . i went to japan twice , the first time wa travel in a group led by tour guid and the second time wa travel alon , the first time wa realli conveni becaus i had to just simpli follow my tour guid but it wa not that interst . howev , when i travel to tokyo for myself , i have to find my way with map and direct to get to the popular place . it took more time to get there , but it gave me a lot of valuabl experinc and i saw and heard much more tradit thing in japan dure the travel . to sum up , i think it is not best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid . it can be time consum to wait other peopl to move to next place . moreov , with the tour guid i can not have make my travel cours freeli and can not get some valuabl experi from difficulti or hard in travel . i think travel have to give us feel of free , and great experi of that countri or place .
