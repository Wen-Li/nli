i agre with the statement that in twenti year time there will be rel fewer car as compar to today . the reason for my agreement to thi statement are discuss below . first and most import reason is the diwndl petroleum resourc . human are alreadi usurp up all the avail natur resourc at alarm pace and it pretti much possibl that within twenti year we will exhaust most , if not all , of the avail petroleum reserv . the increas cost of petroleum product reinforc it . thi will lead to a situat where we will not be have fuel to run the car . thi automat will result in fewer car . second reason for fewer car in futur is that in futur there will be develop of mani medium size citi instead of growth of alreadi disproportion big metropolitian citi . for exampl citi like new york , london and tokyo are alreadi so huge that it take too much time to reach citi center from suburb . sinc medium size citi will be rel smaller in size , time to commut within it will also be small . thu peopl would prefer to use public mode of transport to commut then drive car becaus of lower cost and lesser time requir to commut . third reason is relat to ecolog and environemt issu . as we know car are major sourc of pollut , govern and other law enforc agenc would find it prudent to limit the number of car in a citi to avoid further detori to our alreadi wretch environ . last reason for possibl fewer car in futur is due to increas popul we might have to resort to pedestrian way to commut becaus for such larg popul car for all peopl cant be accomod even when fuel is avail . for exampl , alreadi such a model is in place in few european citi like amestradam . the avail space for ani new construct includ park is decreas all the time . thu govern agenc might choos to enforc legisl limit the number of car in a citi to free up more space for hous . thu i think there are number of reason to believ that number of car is go to decreas in time to come .
