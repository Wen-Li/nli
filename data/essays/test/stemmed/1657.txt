i think tha the are more young peopl that do not give a enough time to help their commun . for instanc i beliv that depend of cultur tnan your live . in my cultur , for exampl , my parent learn me to help my friend , my famili or the commun . but i beliv in thi when i young , when i grow i help onli my famili and my friend , becaus the societi chanch in few time and i do n't understaind everythingh . for thi reason i think than other young peopl do n't help their commun . but if i tell thi , i hope thah there are more peapl more interest to sociti and to understai their proplem and help their . as a consegu that the peopl live togeth and everi men can help yuorcommun . if the peopl learn an your children an import good idea than peac and help , the new world will the best , but now more yuong peopl are n't interest to the futur of yuor world becaus they think onli work , freetim , and take more mopney for holiday , for new dress , for a less interest reason . the peopl dure the day work and chave n't a more freetim to spend . they prefer spend it for shop , for meet friend , go to cinema or restaur , or to sleopp . everi thingh the young peopl think insta t help their commun . for lucki there are a young or not peopl to interest to their commun , they work for their . more peopl help to peopl need . ther are in everi citi a person to help and person to help . i think that the person to help have a beauti temperatur becaus she take yourselv to hand that other . they do a divers work to help , yuo go to the specif comun , to go in street , to go in ither countri for take a smile in person less lucki . final i think that the peopl are vari and everi person can help or no , but if yuo help yuo are more happi . beliv me .
