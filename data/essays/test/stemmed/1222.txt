my person opinion is not support by scientif topic , i think it is not onli import the quantiti , but the qualiti of the advertis . then i also think that if the product are not qualiti product then peopl will not be attract by them . if we watch an advertis and it is well done and we watch it mani time too the consum is sure tempt to buy the item and with the new modern technic some item can appear veri charm . i talk about comput technic , with them everi defect can be fix and it is realli difficult to understand the differ between the real world from the virtual one . special effect and beauty appear can present the product much better than they realli are . for exampl if we look at food item then they can be present veri well but if they are not good then peopl will not buy them again , but if it is a car to be advertis then if it seem better than it is , then the advertis work veri well and the goal of the advertis wa correct even if it use mystiph to advertis the product . i rememb a my person situat when i had to buy a new comput i wa attract from mani brand and i wa veri confus and i did n't know what i had to buy . i start to read advertis on the newspap and by televis and i must tell that iidecid not onli for the technic qualiti of the item i wa go to buy but i like to have a product that look well in my hous in combin with my fornitur and for thi i choos by the best advertis abl to give me what i wa look for . so the advertis must speack to differ segment o
