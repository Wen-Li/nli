i serious doubt the statement as we alreadi have had probabl the worst oil crisi behind us thirti year ago and we are despit all polit effort still reli on car . as everyon know resourc are limit but i believ thi depend upon the car will just go on and on as it ha - sinc the widespread usag of the automobil start . and individu would be will to pay a much higher prize as the car is the one and onli way to travel that is complet independ from ani other interact like schedul or book . even if we would invent new mean to travel there would be still develop nation behind us which would want to make the leap toward the automobil . china consist of 1/6 of the world popul but the bicycl is still the preval way to travel . so we can expect china to start get a car densiti like in western europ as wealth is go to be spread due to the more and more evolv economi . car can be an object of prestig in western societi , too , and few peopl will want to consid get rid of a car for ration reason like environment issu . especi not in the upper econom class that own expens car as they would care less about polit incent like fuel get more expens for plitic and environment reason . whatev we would invent in futur may it be a car run by hydrogen or electr it would still resembl the design of our today `` s automobil and therefor still be consid a car . so the number of car is definet not go down , but almost certain due to increas .
