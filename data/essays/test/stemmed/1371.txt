in my opinio , i prefer have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to specil in one specif subject becaus of import of academ age . there are sever reason . first , a narrow knowledg field may occur of narrow seesight . the man who know onli one field call `` l '' type human . vertic section of `` l '' show variou field , and horizon field show are amount of knowledg . becaus the `` l '' type human doe not know anoth area , they cound not work anoth area . it may be a extrem penalti . i recommand `` a '' type human or `` h '' type human have two or more special skill or ha not onli specifi skill but also relat skill . these tyo human can adopt everi posit , and may found their new potenti . for exampl , i major comput scienc , but i alwal ha a question about anoth potenti . i studi variou subject , as a result i could cook , actor and master of takwondo . second , as you would like to becom a specialist , you should know about all the field relat to your subject . for instanc , if you like to becom a best network engin , it is imposs to know about the network . for the effici transmit/rec mechan , you should know the hardwar architectur ; for the reduc of problem such as bottl neck , you should understand not onli memori architectur but also oper system ; if you get a softwar show gool perform you doe not know about network , you should know softwar engin . in addit , if you would like a good project conclus , you need to know the activ as a team manag . if you doe not variou field , you could not lead your team compos pseson have variou skill . all clue written on upper thesi must studi at a academ age . in academ age , it is a best age to studi abroad , so all student in a univers doe not lazi to studi an abroad subject . you had better have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
