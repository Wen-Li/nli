there are two kind of studi befor highschool . you can go to the univers or to specif higher institut . these two solut offer differ way of studi . inde at univers you studi more specif academ subject than in highschool but you still have mani subject . on the contrari in specif institut you learn more about veri specif subject . in my mind univers can appear to be better and i am go to explain whi by explain the advantag and disadvantag to be specifi or not . first , i think that to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can help you more than studi a specif subject . if you onli studi scienc you are not consciou of what happenig in the econom world and it can be use to rais money . besid when you are awar about a lot of subject you are more open-mind in my opinion . inde you learn differ cultur in histori , differ languag , differ theori in mathemat . .. then when you are special on one specif subject you can be more precis about thi . student are univers know a lot of thing about differ academ subject but they can not describ with a lot of detail one point of one subject . for exampl an econom student studi mathemat but he doe not know some mathemat point particularli becaus he also have to stuy histori , law . .. in addit with the great chang in scienc or technolog subject the work world seem to look for more student who have studi specif subject than student who have studi a lot of subject . to sum up i realiz that both kind of higher studi have differ advantag and disadvantag . to studi a specif subjet appear to be more use if you zant to a work in a veri precis kind of job such as research in scienc or chemistri . in the other part have a knowledg concern a llot og subject seem to be good if you want to have a job where you are go to use a lot knowledg such as market job or teacher in primari school .
