i prefer the travel by myself to the one in a group led by a tour guid . i have three reason to suport my opinion . firstli , i can visit the place in a citi that match more to my tast in a travel by myself . if i travel in a group , i may not be abl to visit all the site i want to see . sinc i am especi inerest in art and music , i would choos to visit museum and go to live hous rather than to see histor build like old church . of courc i understand the import of such build and there are mani peopl who want to see them , but if i go to a foreign countri , i want to go the place which attract me more . secondli , i can make my scheul more flexibl . if i feel comfort to be in a museum and want to spend a day there , i can do thi . it happen when i visit new york citi . i first schedul to see moma for a half of the day . but after i start to look the fantast pictur in the museum , i wa fascin by them . i quit the afternoon schedul and spent a whole day there . it becam the best day in that trip . lastli , travel by alon offer mani chanc to commun with the peopl who live in the citi . i often ask how to get the destin where i want to go , and mani of them friendli taught me the way . when i visit thailand , i ask the woman the delici restaur around there . she not onli nice told me the name of the restaur , but also took me there and had dinner togeth . she said she is also had interest in japan , where i live . we had veri nice time in that restaur with nice food and valuabl conversaion . i think it is not so often the case with the group tour with a tour guid .
