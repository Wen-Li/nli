one may think that bee special in one specif subject may be better for our own person and futur profesion life . as far as i am concern , i would say that one must keep a broad acadm knowledg in order to succeed in hi futur . first of all we must remind that the true cultur is not a lot on a veri specif subject but a littl about as must subject as possibl . that is just becaus we wo n't have to stay enclos within our ivori tower in the futur . today 's world is made of commun , travel and foreign peopl . that is whi today 's peopl will have to be prepar to face a world which is evolv faster than ever . as an exempl i would talk about the peopl work within the british or french mine . when they had to close for econom reason , that peopl veri special could not find a job elsewher . we must remind that a structur of an ecoonomi may chang and that some sector could disapear and other rise . if someon is prepar from the begin to face a world and a profession life which could alway evolv , he would have to be effect and moreov have a descent life . that is a way to get a purshas power by be flexibl in our work . an other point is that if someon want to get a better job within a car compani , know everyth about car and tell it to hi superior wo n't be a way . profesion relationship are also made of human qualiti , passion and cultur . by know sever knowledg about variou subject , one can easili build good relationship at work and mayb , as 25 % of men , meet their futur wife at the offic . to put it in a nutshel , i would say that obvious , have mani academ knowledg and human qualiti is a main adventag in today 's world , when flexibl is a key .
