in my oppinion each success person is differ . on the one hand there are a lot of sucess peopl who tri new thing , take risk , invent someth uniqu and get famou . on the other hand there are mani peopl who tri the same thing and turn out not to be sucess . be sucess is not just a matter of who you are what you exactli do it is also a lot about have luck . luck could mean you have fortun relationship like rel that are in high posit and can help you to get in an import posit as well . that would be the opposit side of the statement becaus that would be an exampl for a person who might becom success but ha never step out of hi comfort zone . there are peopl who have certain talent but these talent will never be discov becaus they do not get the chanc to get into the need posit . there might be a woman in india with the most beauti voic . she might be hundert time better then mani success popstar but she will never get the chanc to show that . mayb she is poor and ha to nurtur her 4 children . it doe not matter how riski she would be : chanc are veri low she could ever leav her countri . she is simpli in the wrong time at the wrong place . i can not agre or disagre with that stament . i have seen peopl who have been success becaus they took risk but then i have also seen peopl who have taken risk to becom success and have poorli fail . befor a person make a decis he should consid if he can life with all possibl consequ and if the success is worth take these risk .
