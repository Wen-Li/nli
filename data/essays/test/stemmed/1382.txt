sometim young peopl nowaday do not give time to help their commun becaus our societi do not learn to the young peopl to stay with the other . mani yeard ago the famili wa veri import in the young life of a boy , with all the norm and the respons , but there wa alway a famili to teach the trou and fals of the life . today in the big citi a young need to bild up him person faster , when he is onli a child , becaus the citi have not time for him problem . alway there is not a meet point , where the young can meet and do onli the teenag . the young peopl need more attencion , becaus our societi is more busi for mani problem but noth think to our young peopl . to contrast thi phenomeno the young peopl take more distanc from their commun . for me is true that they have not time to take attencion to their commun , becaus there are mani respons and noth who ask treir problem . it is onli a problem of organizz , in my opinion , if a young peopl learn who can ask to the peopl , so he can take more time for them . in my opinion there are two point of wiew , the young peopl who need more attencion to the peopl becaus are the futur , and the other the peopl who think than the young peopl never can take time for them . if the two point of wiew stay in their corner , they can never resolv the problem . they need to spik abaut the proplem and take some decis for the common futur . some possibl soluct are the use of school time for learn to the young peopl who can help the other , or creat a space in the commun build for the young peopl , for speak to their problem . in my opinion there is the soluct and onli with the dialogu young and the other peopl can take a key to live togeth .
