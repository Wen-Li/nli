i agre the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' there are two reason , safeti and the satisfact of watch spot . if we travel in foreign countri , we may be in not safe conditon , becaus we can not understand foreign languag veri much . be in foreign countri make you much more danger than be your own countri . the thirf who get onli foreign ' purs insist . futhermor , we regularli be correct our passport by the guid for our safeti . and at the one more other point , when we shop foreign countri ' shop , we often would be shope at unsuit price . the last one , becaus we do not know the way much , we often get our way lost there . howev , if a tour guid is by us , he/sh would save us by these thing . second , we would be abl to visit mani watch spot if the tour guid teach us . if we travel alon , we do not know where we realli should visit . if you had search where to go by book or internet , there are no one that can be better than the real voic . they alway lead us whare we realli want to go or experi . if we want to talk and make friend with the peopl who live there , it is difficult for us to make it real when you travel alon . in addit , there are some place where just onli foreifn can visit all the time in japan . for exampl , kyoto gosho doe not allow the peopl who do not have ani paper that can show who thay are . howev , becaus foreign alway have passport , thir foreign tour member can visit there ani time . besid , we can ask our histor or cultur question to the guid , and he/sh ha much amount of knowledg . by these point , i think the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
