in the follow i am go to discuss if jung peopl nowerday are give enough time to help their commun . i think that thi is a difficult question but i would definetli answer it with `` no '' . in my oppinion jung peopl nowerday often just care about themself . they are not realli interesst in their commun and in other peopl around them . to give you an exampl : i am speaker for the student in our school and we often have new idea which could make our school better and our build nicer . but most of the peopl around me never care . they like to have longer break and coulor wall but they would never do someth to chang the situat . they alway think that there will be other to work for them - and most time they are right . i think that is one of the reason jung peopl chang , becaus they know that there will be no follow if they do not care about their commun . and they know that there are alway other who will care . i red an articl in the newspap `` die welt '' yesterday . there it said that jung peopl have not learn to help other and to be respons . parent simpli do not teach it them . so they grow up without care about anyon els , they seem to have their own problem . so i might have a veri neg oppinion , but i think that mani jung peopl nowerday are veri egoist and there are often just a few who care about other . in germani there are some organis to care for the commun , they clean up , help old or disabl peopl and they tri to get money for that . the number of jung member decreas a lot dure the last ten year . it is the same in churchprogram . there are a lot of jung peopl who are not interest in make work without bee pai . a reason for that might be , that everyth is get more and more expens and live is not that easi . so jung peopl habe no time or no money to care for other . but i think that is a veri unimport reason . year ago when peopl had less than we have today they also care about their commun . i think the vallu of the peopl had chang and what is import in life . so as a conclus i would say that jung peopl nowerday do not give enough time to help their commun and i think that should chang .
