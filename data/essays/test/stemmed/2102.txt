i agre with the the say that success peopl tri new thing rather than do what they alreadi know . becou in my opinion do usual thing is quit bore and no fun on that , also by do the same thing again and again i cant learn so mani thing in my life also i cant get alot of experi in ather thing . first of all let talk about get bore from thing that we use to do it without tri to take risk and tri new thing . when i do the same thing so mani time i get bore from it , it true that i get the experi from that but when you get bore from s , me thing you tri to get rune from it . whi dont i tri to take risk and tri do some thing new , like ad some fun in the same thing that i use to do it , or tri ti do it in a differ way , or also i can tri do it with my friend or my famili . secon , have experi in so mani thing in life . how could i get the good and the resen amuont of experi if i didnt tri alot of thinga in my life ?? . i should take risk and gat readi for the chang in my life and tri to collect as much as experi that i could in my hole life . '' the more thing you do the more experi you get '' , thi what my teacher use to tell us about the life style . final , in my opinion i should tri tafe risk in life and never stop practis in the thing that i use to do but in a new and model way , becuos if i use to do it in the sane way i might get bore from that and never do it again , so it better to thing in differ way from not do it at all .
