life is full with risk and we often face differ kind of risk dure our life time . i agre with the statement . i think success peopl alway take risk to do new thing . there are a lot of reason to be success by take risk . firstli , i think the person who is afraid of to chang hi life doe n't tri to new thing . so , he can not meet to right opportun to chang hi life . perhap , he ha a perfect talent for music , but when he doe n't tri , nobodi can know thi . as a result , he lost the oppotun which can chang hi life . i alway believ that if i had n't take risk , i could n't improv my mine . when i graduat high school , i wa a nurs and i had a good salari for a person who wa 17 year old . i did n't need to take risk to chang my life , but i thought that i could be better . so i resign from hospit , then i got into univers . after i graduat to univers , i took some exam in my countri and past them . my gover chose me as a student who would go to the usa for master degre . now i am here , 10 year later than the graduat from high school . sometim take risk cahang our all live and make us success . on the other hand , take risk make us brave and we can make new decis without be afraid . so it provid to think logicli , becaus when we are afrait to be fail , we can not think well . i think take risk improv our abil for make good decisi . for exampl , the success peopl who tri tnew think usual becom more success in the futur , becaus they can think clearli without be afraid . in summari , in my experi , although there are some except , take some risk can make peopl success . becaus they play for big praze , if they win , their benefit are bigger than other peopl who choos to be same . in addit , if we do n't tri , we can not know what is wait for us on the unknown part of life .
