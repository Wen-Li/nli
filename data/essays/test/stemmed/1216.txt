i agre with thi statement that success peopl take risk and tri new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . then whi onli success peopl ? i think thi is the point i want to discuss on as a main reason . what make peopl possibl to tri new thing and take risk ? my answer is the capabl . for exampl , if you are a poor casher at a grosseri store and have limit money for live expens even though you keep work hour and hour everyday , you would have no time to even think about do someth new or creativ becaus of the everyday 's routin and also financi you would not be allow to take ani risk becaus it is not afford for you . therefor , to make peopl tri new thing and take risk requir the person 's afford financi situat , the person 's flexibl to be creativ to tri new thing and the person 's success background to be brave enough to do someth his/her do n't know . the success background here mean by the area of cultual and academ educ becaus otherwis you would not be abl to imagin that someth worth to take risk will exsist in our unknown world . consid these reason , i will agre with thi statement .
