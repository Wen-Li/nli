i 'm total agre with the statement express . in fact , i truli think that peopl that do well someth could do it better if they onli do n't suppos the way known is the best one . what i ' tri to explain is that who is satisfai about , for exampl a job or an activ , in gener use known and common method to reach hi satisfact . otherwis who use experiment way to do thing is usual a person that get in discuss current method becaus he beliv himself to be abl to find a better one . these kind of peopl alway take the risk of their choic , often realli discov better way to do thiink and so they have success . i think that no one can ha success if doe n't beliv in himself and doe n't refus way to do thing learn from other peopl . if you uniform yourself to what is commonli consid as well , you will never go beyond the limit of mass think and exploit whole your capac in order to outstand the mass and so reach success . for exampl , in art , impressionist style wa veri uncommon for it age in wich realist style wa consid the best . impressionist artist , trust in themselv and completli unlink from the common use of color and paint , demonstr us a definitli better way to show human feel and natur . they took the risk and the win the challang with other painter of that period becaus they deepli trust in themselv and did n't give attenct to critic . in definit success depend by self trust
