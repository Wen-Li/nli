for mani peopl , especi parent , children or young peopl play a rather signific role in their life . but how high is the contribut of young peopl ? in the ensu essay i would like to deal with the topic if young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . my answer is simpl : i agre with the statement . now i would like to give reason which support my point of view . nowaday mani young peopl spend a log of time in play comput , use the internet or watch tv ; therefor they have n't suffici time to concentr on their commun . a few centuri ago young peopl had anoth role in their commun . they had to work hard in their commun becaus there wa an interdepend between each member of the commun . it wa inevit to interact with everyon . nowaday the commun ha a differ organ and structur . it ha the semblanc that interact doe n't play such an import role like in the 18th centuri . that is whi young peopl doe n't see the sens of help their commun becaus other peopl can do thi job . anoth argument which strengthen my viewpoint is the lack of interest in interact with other peopl especi peopl from the own commun . young peopl have no interest to help other peopl becaus they concentr on their own . as a result of my argument you can record the fact that young children doe n't spend suffici time to help their commun becaus they are sidetrack by the media . the media like tv , internet or the comput are more attract than than the commun . the problem can be solv if the societi concentr on tradit valu like respect , affect and loyal . thi valu should be maintain over centuri .
