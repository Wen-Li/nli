now-a-day peopl are show much interest in travel to new place and explor new thing dure their leisur time . the peopl enjoy travel in group , particularli the colleg and univers student . in my opinion , it 's alway better to have a tour guid along with you when you travel to new place . first thing when we travel in group , we will find someon to organis and host the team . it would be much easier to make the plan of the trip if we have a person who is familiar with the go destin . so , when we are go to an unknown place it 's advis to take a guid along with you . by take a guid along with us we have mani advantag . firstli , as the guid is familiar with the place he will make all prior arrang like accomod , site see and travel direct . he will give a perfect tour itinerari . secondli , we could abl to save lot of time in visit place , where we will not face ani difficulti in locat the spot . he will describ all the histori , about the cultur and import of the place while sight see . he will also guid us the do 's and dont 's while travel to a new place . to my person experi when i wa in my colleg , we plan to a hill station in group . after take all pain stake effort , somehow we have reach our destin . there we felt lot of difficulti in find a better accomod . we have no idea about the place which we have visit becaus it a remot place , where peol are veri few . we could not even find someon even to go to the particular spot . we did not much enjoy the trip as we have wast a lot of time in find thing in our short period tour . consid the abov point i feel that it 's better to have a guid along with u when you are travel in a group , so that your trip will be more joyabl and interest .
