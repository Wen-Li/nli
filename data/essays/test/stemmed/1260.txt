the easier way to be success is to use test way and tactic which the success peopl give . on the other hand , thi is the easier way to be usual . i prefer to creat my own style to be success . the first reason to choic is person improv . the second is that want to get new thing . the last one is about be uni first of all , all the thing we do for improv ourselv and get new expereinc day by day . if i want to learn how the success peopl had their success , i could figur them out in these peopl life stori . and then i can use their strategi when creat my own style which is occur as a mix of them . secondli , if i walk the street which wa walk by anoth , i will get same rout and arriv same place . but i want to discov new place and get new success about what i am interest in . the last reason to prefer to tri new thing and take risk is about be uniqu and unusu . until keep the key point of be success , peopl use usual way . by the way , he fail becaus of these fals tacti but do n't feel sorri about it . he know it is the experinc and pattern of the success . after the all fail , he should ask what the problem about the problem and how he will solv thi problem . in end , all thi fals and other success peopl experinc come togeth and the uniqu style will apper . in conclus , i prefer to get risk rather than do someth which alreadi known . it is about my person improv in use other ' experi and creat my own style . after the year , onli uniqi will be rememb .
