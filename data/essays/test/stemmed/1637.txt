nowaday , there is a big and import controversi center on which is more import for student , to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . a larg proport of peopl contend that the emphas shoul be put on the idea and concept . other peopl , on the other hand , argu that fact are more eccenti . befor render my opinion , i think it is more prudent and circumspect to take a look on the arguement on both side . peopl who advoc that idea and concept are more critic believ that without idea and concept noth can go ani further correctli and advancingli . as we may rememb , our test book abound with a great mani idea and concept which help us greatli in our futur studi or even career , such as the defenit in our physic book . in the construct , a bridg or build is built accord to the defenit in the book . peopl who are in favor of the idea that fact are much more indispens think that if a idea or concept goe without a fact is total nonsenc , so peopl have to pay a great attent to learn fact . it is true , the use of thing alway come the first . so sometim the fact is in the first place . fact are the import basic of ani idea or concept . statist report ha shown that sometim a fact give birth to a idea or concept . if you can see that , you will have no problem to understand that fact have their own import . consequ , take into account of all the reason discuss abov , we may safe draw the conclus that both the idea or concept and the fact are both of great import , without ani of them , noth could be achiev . so student should learn the conbin of both idea or concept and fact .
