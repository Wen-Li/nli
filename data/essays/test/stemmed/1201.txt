i agre with the statement that `` most advertis make product product seem much better that they realli are '' . apart from make the product look attract and good there is no point in a advertis . the purpos of advertis is to promot and market the product . in thi process mani advertis requir that they dramatac the properti of the product to catch the attent of the viewer effect . thi dramatac almost alway make the product look better than they actual are . for exampl consid the case of junk food advertis . though they are not as use and benifici as their advertis make them look but they are portray that way to attract the attent of the viewer . if these advertis were to project the true natur of the product no person with a sane mind would go for it . also consid the case of a fuel compani which advertis that with that particular brand of fuel , as low as a coupl of litr in the automobil is suffici energi for it to run hundr of kilomet . although everybodi know that thi cant be true it help the advertis deliv a point and help them market their product . it is a well establish pshycolog prinicipl that the common and uninterest event attract less attent when compar to the uncommon and excit event . to take advantag of thi prinicipl the advertis tend to creat the advertis as uncommon and interest as possibl . in thi process they end up showcas their product as much better than it actual is though it might not be their primari intent . if thi is not done there is the risk of the advertis not serv it purpos and there would be no point in make it .
