i disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understabnd idea and consept than it is for them to learn fact . there are three major reason for thi . first , learn fact is the first step of studi and idea or consept are base on these fact . thu , if student did not learn fact well , they can not develop theoir thought . for exampl , we can not understand histor context without histor fact . after studi histor fact and memor them , student bare start to notic the signific of histor event . basic import concept are base on fact discov by earli scholar . after learn fact well , it make easier for student to understand idea and consept . second , student are in the process of learn , so it is difficult for most of them to understand idea and concept . even if they can , they tend to go wrong direct . fact are easi to teach and learn for both teacher and student . as a matter of fact , teach idea by low-level educ is a harm becaus student believ wrong thing . although understand idea and consept are signific , fact are more import in term of level of educ . third , the present educ system work well teachin fact for student in the first place . accord to the psycholog studi conduct by the unesco , the most import thing for children to develop their abil to studi fact by reach the level of memor . it is natur step to develop each student abil , so current educ system consid it import for them to teach fact . we do not chang thi system and jump onto abstract idea . to sum up , i consid learn fact to be more import than understand idea . learn fact are benefici for student to .
