recent , it is said that young peopl do not spend enough time to help their commun . especi , in the big citi such as tokyo , not onli young peopl but also older peopl do not even care other in a public place . when i use to commut to the offic by train , there wa a pregnant woman stand becuas there wa no seat , peopl who got seat did not give her seat and just ignor her . i wa shock by thi event and felt that thi is not just a matter of young peopl but it is a problem of whole commun . on the contrari , when i went to some of the rural area in japan , peopl were veri friendli and help . in fact , i wa unfamiliar with that area and got lost sever time . surprisingli , when i get lost , peopl work in the field kindli took me to the destin . it wa not just one incid but everi time i get in troubl , everybodi help me so kindli in the rural area . i felt it wa a cultur of that commun . as a human , you have to care about other who live in the same commun . nobodi can live alon forev . by help other , you will be also help in the futur and that 's how you also enjoy relationship with other . your life is connect to the other member of the commun in the everi aspect of life such as go to school , rase children , take care of older parent . so , it is vital that you care about other peopl and help each other . today , thi basic concept ha been somehow forgotten , especi in the big citi . i think it would be better if the older peopl in the commun can teach such concept to young member of the commun
