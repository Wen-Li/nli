nowaday we live in the era of the commun , and the advertis are an import element in the commun . sure i agre with the statement purpos in the question : i think that it is true that mani advertis present product better than they realli are ; nevertheless , i would like to underlin that , in my opinion , peopl know thi process , and they do n't believ that the advertis present the product exactli as they realli are . i would like to discuss thi point to explain adequ my point of view . accord to my experi , there is no doubt that dure a normal day we read , or listen , or watch mani advertis ; in fact , they are everywher . sure mani advertis improv the imagin or the qualiti of their product : howev , i would like to say that it is normal . everybodi know that the aim of the advertis is to increas the number of peopl that will buy a specif product . therefor , an advertis must be interest , becaus it goal is to catch our attent . therefor , on one hand i think that it is not import if an advertis present a product not as it realli is , but , on the other hand , i also think that there are limit that must be respect . in particular , i think that it is not correct if an advertis deliber present prize or payment condit that are not true . thu , i consid neg an advertis if it tend to do n't respect the law . for exampl , usual the bank present their purpos not adequ , and it is a problem , becaus peopl can sign contract where the financi condit are written ambigu . on the basi of these consider , i think that my point of view is clear : everi advertis make product seem better than they realli are , but , in my opinion it is a problem onli if thi process tend to not respect the law . howev , today we live in the era of the commun , and we have to consid thi risk and be care about the content of the adverttis .
