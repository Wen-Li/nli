i definit agre with the statement that advertis usual make product seem better than they realli are . advertis are produc with the sole purpos of increas the number of sale of a product and make the biggest profit out of that product . pretend that their product is the best out of it leagu is probabl the best method of sell it . i frequent wit exampl of thi issu in my daili life . for exampl , a coupl of week ago i saw the advertis of a hairdryer on tv . it had an attach shape like a fork at the end where the air blow out , and with the help of that attach , the girl in the commerci were abl to shape their hair into ani style they want to - within second ! i wa so amaz by how multifunct the product wa , it could straighthen , curl , or add wave to your hair via the same apparatu . i wa convinc that i had to buy it ; and within the week i saw the commerci of thi `` perfect '' hair product , i bought one from their local store . although i did n't need a new hair dryer sinc i had other one at home , i bought thi one simpli becaus i wa attact to it advertis . when i got home , i quickli wash my hair and took out by new product from it box to give it a test drive . at that moment , i think i had the biggest dissapoint of my entir life . it wa noth like what i had seen on the tv commerci . it wa much smaller and less ornat than what i had imagin , and one of the part of it attach wa miss ! i turn it on and tri it on my hair anyway , but the machin kept on stop in everi ten second . decid that thi product wa obvious not worth my money or my time , i promptli return it back to the shop , feel deceiv and mislead . i promis myself that no advertis would ever be abl to beguil and trick me into wast my money for noth .
