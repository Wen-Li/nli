as we all know and see in our daili live , some peopl are somehow more success than other in variou thing . thi fact ha mani reason such as studi more , concentr and focus to the right point , search freeli and intens and investig with full energi and time . but should n't we also consid that they tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ? accord to some point of view , success peopl are the one , who achiev thing well , which are familiar to them . in that way , they could get profession and special in one subject and get more and more practic each time . as an exampl , we can consid a baker who bake the same kind of bread everi morn . it ca n't be deni that he could becom better in it , in comparison to other baker , who bake differ cooki or cake each day . although there are view that peopl should often tri what they alreadi know , in my opinion thi wo n't contribut to real success . if peopl tri new thing , face with differ altern problem and situat each time , thi make him/her more experienc . sometim there may be few difficulti in find out new inform or do unfamiliar thing , but soon thi can be got over . it is import to mention that peopl who take risk , adjust to the variou altern and situat more easili . so , thi could help in urgent situat . let 's assum a firm that is in bankruptci situat . it could n't go on with it current goal and strategi . so , it need to continu with new plan and orient . for thi , open mind and success peopl are reqir and these peopl should be abl to get risk and becom use to find new way . what can be conclud from these fact is that success peopl are the one , who are open to new altern and tri , becaus the real success , as they know , is to confront with changeabl and unstabl variat instead of stick to one familiar point . in retrospect to what i said , i agre that success peopl tri new thing without frustrat , even if some riski event may occur from time to time .
