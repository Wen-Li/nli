in modern societi , student are requir to understand concept and learn fact as well when they studi . the two method are both essenti in master knowledg ; howev , in my opinion , the former is more import than the later one . the first reason to support my view is that conceiv the concept is alway the first step and the base to learn ani type of subject . without the correct understand of the idea of what the subject is describ , the further action toward analysi of the fact will be meaningless . take the studi of advanc math for exampl . if a student new to thi knowledg of advanc math , he/sh will be total lost if he/sh is instruct to learn the facts-th stactic and data at the begin . the usual procedur is that the teacher explain the model of thi class , teach student how to use thi model and then ask the student to studi the fact . second , student are more subject to put bia on fact if they do n't understand idea and concept , which will distort the fact revers , especi when the student are not experienc with the knowledg . for exampl , one of my classmat misunderstood the mean of human resourc modern the professor taught us in a hr strategi class . he miss the first class about the methodolog and onli caught the one when we began to analyz the case . the result wa obvious-h misinterpret the strategi adopt in a certain manufactur compani in the case base on the `` fact '' he assum . while the other student saw the fact that thi compani fail to execut it organ behavior and cultur after we studi care accord the idea and concept the professor deliv ( and it wa prove a mistak after the develop of compani ) , he thought the compani ran veri well becaus he onli focus on the fact itself . to sum up , student should pay greater attent to understand idea and concept to find more in-depth messag reveal in the fact .
