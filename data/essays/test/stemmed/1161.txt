in korea , there is say that neigbor is closest causin . it mean that everi commun have close bandag for themselev and easili cooper each other , and it is not except to young peopl . howev , thing are chang as time goe by , and i firmli agre that young peopl nowday have less concern to their commun . i suport my idea by two main reason which is the matter of individu and qualiti of commun . to begin with , i strongli beilev that the reason of less concern to commun is high individu . as industri develop , mani peopl start to concentr on their own time and life , not on their communiti . they even do not recogn what their commun are do . for exampl , my friend ha no concern and doe not want to involv in her commun . she ha her own job as a univers student , and there are so mani thing to do . she even ignor the thing that need her help . secondli , i confirm that it is becaus of the commun ' miswork . they underestim the import of young peopl 's concern beacaus they are interest in onli benefit of welfar to elder peopl who usual concern with them . in that sens , commun are obsess to get elder 's high reput and concern . these make young peopl to be sick of do someth for their commun and no advantag for help commun . those event that commun hold are not attract and even bore . thi is the major reason whi young peopl do not give concern and help their commun . consequ , i agre that young peopl nowaday have no concertn to help commun in the name of high individu and the qualiti of commun .
