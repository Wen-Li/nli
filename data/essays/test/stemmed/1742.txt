i grew up in a citi in the north of itali . in my citi there is an highli effici system of transport base on buse and underground that enabl peopl to commut without use the car . for that reason i agre with the propos statement and i 'm well awar that in the futur there will be fewer car in use than there are today . but , in particular condit , i can imagin a grow number of car in the futur , for exempl in small citi . i think that car in the futur will reduc for three main reason . first , car are respons for the pollut of the big citi and gouvern seem to care more and more to environement problem by restrict the access to urban area to car . second , car are expens and need a constant mainten . third , the trafic jam is resapons for mani hour spent in commut . as a result the onli way i see to solv the three problem i 've just explain is an effici transport system . the gouvern of my citi decid mani year ago that it wa necessari to develop a commut system abl to allow the peopl to left the car at home and to commut with the bu or the underground . thi decis had a big impact on the car sale evolut . sinc 2001 , start year for the undergroud , the number of car in my citi is decreas . for that region i believ that in the futur the number of car in my citi will continu to reduc . i imagin that in small citi , where it 's not present an underground or an effici system of buse the increas necess to move will lead to an increas number of car . at the end if i consid my experi i 'm well awar that in the futur there will be fewer car in use than there are today , at least in big citi .
