as ypu know , peopl can work in a group becaus they can make it more wonder , but travel is not by togeth to make it wonder or safe . if you fell great , the trip is success . that 's whi i do n't agre with that the best way to travel is in a group by a tour guid . some year befor , my parent and i get into a group to visit australia . we visit mani beauti place , but we ca n't get time to visit the place where we like . when you get into a group to somewher to visit . you have to listen to the guid , what he say are almost busi thing sound like where can by some gift and mani more inform that we can do noth . in then next , when one come to another citi or countri , the first thing he will do is learn about local cutur . you can not to buy someth or just walk and walk , becaus you want to learn about it . you must not to get there to eat fastfood for learn local cultur . in the third , you need to rest in yout trip , and not to get busi in your trip . travel in a group led by a tour guid can also make you to feel your trip is too short and too busi to enjoy your trip . not onli can it make you unhappi , but also it can make you tire . if you travel by yourself or by a group which onli are your friend , you can feel relax , and taht maje you put more metion to your next work . that 's all of my opinion , nejoy yout trip in yourselv life , how fun you can get is onli by yourself . i am love in thi travel style , what about you ? let it to be .
