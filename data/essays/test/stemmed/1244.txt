knowledg is power and it 's play an effect role among the world . without knowledg you can not think , learn and creat . in my opinion it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani subject which make you more open mind and well done . some peopl prefer to special in one subject and some do n't like it depend on the field . some field need to special and some no need . the person who ha broad knowledg and more experirnc , he is most want and accept . for exampl , the gener manag who ha mpa degre he know everyth about the busi and administr he can control hi the organa unless it ha mani section such as market , manag qauliti , advertis and other . so the wide knowledg make the person to be more creativ and good decsion maker in hi person and work life . broad knowledg is give you more background and idea about your work and your life . other thing we have to invest our knowledg in develop and improv our countri and sociti to be the best among the world . knowledg is great thing we can consid it as the langagu of the world and the progress of ani countri .
