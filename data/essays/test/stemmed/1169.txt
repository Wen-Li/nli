i 'm alway amaz when hear peopl claim the significat advantag of travel in group . even one did not know much concret unpleasur stuff accompani by such way of travel from hi or her own experi , he or she could have deduc it from common sens . just take a glimps at those peopl in goup , you may find all the defect relat to thi way of travel -- terribl limit , constant shop and , inevit , a higher cost . i first went to london in a tour goup at the age of 9 , which wa organ my school . the trip wa inde excit for a young boy . howev , there were still some unpleas thing which i 'll never forget . everi morn , we were suppos to get up at 7 o'clock and get to the design place in order to attend a ` tour goup ' even if we kid usual play late at night and hardli had ani sleep . but ani concern for our preciou ` sleep time ' were neglect , simpli for the reason , said the grown-up , ` keep up with the schedul ' . what a terribl thing it would be to ` keep up with the schedul ' when you were right enjoy the vast sight on the london eye ? what a vex thing it would be to leav the westminst church onli stay for minut in order to ` keep up the schedul which is often requir when travel in a goup . i could have enjoy more if i had travel by myself . in addit , travel may usual get afflic by the tour guid ' endless ` amiabl ' suggest to buy some ` uniqu ' and ` worthi ' souvenior which are ubiqut meaningless and expens . motiv by their word , you may easili begin the process that chang you should-be-happi trip into a shop mall ! i do still remembl how mani useless thing i bought in manchest and leed which almost got me crazi . moreov , it seem that the cost of a tour guid will never be cheap . regardless of the possibl that you 're deciev , usual a tour guid will still cost a lot . on the other hand , travel by you self would help you to save up thi cost and spend it where you like . as the doubt of ` individu tour ' ha claim , we travel can hardli enjoy those tourist point without the lead of an experienc guid . howev , they have neglect the pre-eminet use of the book and internet . have read the map and inroduct about the destin , one can boldli go to where he want . perhap the guider may even know less than the book can tell ! now , start a trip of your own , after have a nice search on ` googl map ' ?
