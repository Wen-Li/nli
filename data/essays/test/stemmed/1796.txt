now , i am think that the young peopl do not spend enought time to help their commun . rerali the young peopl work for upper the livel of their commun . what is the rison i do n't have a veri concret idea . there is so much time to spend but the they prefer to stay at home to do nath ( to spend time for play wich comput of on the internet not alway is good spend time ) . mayb the question is `` where are the paren ? '' . often the kind competid ingor the problem . it 's the parent . nawaday all the familiar are have time onli for their job ( one or more ) and the kid problem are not interest . same parent have onli one problem , the sport activ . father or mother are tire onli the fisic educ of their children . give time to halp their commun , is my opinion , is a upper educ . it is n't easi but to learn than their commun is import . an a possibl exampl to support my answer is the teac all the religion , halp their commun . all us forgotten that is jast to do when we live wich
