almost everi one like travel . someon prefer to travel alon becaus they feel more independ and free , while other prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid . as for me , i think when peopl are go out for a trip , they should alway be in a group and led by a tour guid . first , have a tour guid can save tourist time and money . everi one ha experi that when one is in a total new place where he ha never been befor , he may feel confus and do not know what to do and where to go . it is the same for peopl who are on a trip without tour guid . though the place ha attract view , such as old templ or beauti beach , one may still can not find the right way to get there . for instanc , i onc went to cambridg in england and want to see triniti school , but i just get lost on the way . i spent 4 hour in ask peopl . take bu , and final reach there at 5 p.m . it is realli exhuast . one can imagin if there is tour guid besid me , the situat will definit chang . furthermor , stay in a group led by a tour guid will save one 's money . in some sight , the ticket are much cheaper for group visit . and stay with more peopl , most importantli with a tour guid , will make bargin easier . moreov , one can make friend when travel in a group . sometim , there are some interest peopl in the group that one can talk to and make friend with . i rememb on my last journey to beij , there wa a realli humor guy in the group and told so mani joke that made the trip relax and full of fun . and we all becam good friend after thi trip . besid , one can alway find some peopl in the trip who share the same interest with him . dure the trip , they could discuss movi they like , sport game they enjoy . thi kind of friendship will make trip never bore . by contrast , if one travel alon , or just by sever close friend , he can never have such excit . admittedli , there are some advantag for peopl travel without a tour guid , such as freedom and independc they can get , and he may schedul hi time more flexibl , howev , i still think travel in a group and led by a tour guid is good choic . to sum up , travel in a group led by a tour guid will save one 's money and time , and add the chanc to meet new friend dure the trip . therefor , if i am go out for a trip , i certainli go with a group of peopl and have a tour guid .
