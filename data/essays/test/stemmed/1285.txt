some might agre to the statement that in 20 year time there would be less car than are today . they may say that the technolog advanc could have far reach effect such as develop of more sophist mean of travel , thu car would reduc in number . other might argu say that car infact will becom an essenti comod . the own of a car would be a necess rather than a just a mean to travel . henc the number of car instead of reduc would probabl multipli . howev in my view point i believ that the number of car in the comung year might just reduc . there are variou reason for my belief . firstli 20 year down the line probabl the technolog would have advanc such a great deal . thi advanc in technolog could caus scientist and engin to come up with anoth mean of travel , not necessari the road alon . probabl we could have small jet fli around in air make use of the lower layer of earth atmospher therebi reduc the number of car . peopl could simpli sit in the small privat jet and fli to their destin . all thi might seem to be out of the box , but the rate at which technolog is advanc there might just be a distinct possibl that thi might becom true . also the alreadi tremend increas in number of car ha satur the mean of travel by road . the amount of time taken , furtherd by traffic jam have alreadi made peopl to move out and look for other mean of travel . further by the time constraint alreadi altern soluton such as use of speed boat and hover-craft have come into effect caus peopl to make use of these rather than travel by road . thi reluct to travel by road will also disuad the peopl further from invest money in buy a car thu reduc the number of car present . apart from thi the space constraint 20 year down the line would discourag peopl from use car as there would be less or no park place left . peopl of today are util all possibl land and 20 yer henc the scene could be just wors . thi would reduc the number of car user automat caus fewer car to be in use . thu in my view the number of car are bound to reduc in the near futur . owe to advanc in technolog and time factor , peopl will explor other mean of travel , other than by car , which may lead to the car becom obsolet .
