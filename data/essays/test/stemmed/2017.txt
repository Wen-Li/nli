mani peopl claim that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . i think it is not the case for mani reason like reliabl , valid , even from the theori . for gener , most idea and concept we learn come from the book and newspap , so most of the inform is record as theori which could not provid us reliabl infom . and student would not cofirm the reliabl until they saw the fact . for exampl , we heard about the theori about the market strategi from the textbook , but we could not be sure that the theori work in the real world , and we have to appli those theori in our job or volunt career to see it reliabl . secondli the idea and concept in the book could sometim be out of date , the student could hardli find a book talk about most fashion design for now in the librari and they have to go onlin and check the websit , see the pictur and had a clear idea with the valid inform . and the real world now provid us for conveni way to learn fact , from the tv program , internet , even from other 's experi . furthermor , techniqu speak , from mani test in the lab we confim the fact that pictur imag and fact could bring more fresh memori rather than the understand of idea and concept . that mean it would be more impress for us when we saw the fact . in a word , we could gain our understad of idea and concept form the fact we learn , the proce of analysis those fact could impress our understand . so i claim that it is more import for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept .
