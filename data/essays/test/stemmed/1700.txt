i agre with thi statement becaus we all should know some of the academ subject even if it is a littl know . from there we can be a broad-mind person with a know of differ type academ ( from mathemat through histori ) . in my case , i don t like at all scienc but i am alway look for scientif magazin about the new technolog whose come out or look at he survey about differ diseas whose inceas or decreas each year . it help me to get inform of what is go on around me , how it is evolu . i n gener i am a divers person , i mean that i don t have a specif subject that i like most but in contrari i am tri the best that i can to learnn a lot a thing , becaus everyth is interest . that s whi mayb i am still undecid in major for the univers becaus i am split with the commun field and the ace program but i also want to studi spanish and italian and i want to have a knowledg in the american histori which i have never studi . as you can see i am in a dilemma . but it don t restrain me at all to studi through book or through peopl by travel . i n my opinion special in one specif subject is like withdraw oneself . it is not interest to have a talk with a person who is alway talk of the same topic isnt it ? in fact to special in onli one subject mean to me that the person is confin himself in some area and might to get ani acquaint with other person . final to have broad knowledg mean also to have more intelig and guet more knowledg help me to talk to differ type of person . i can debat about a burn issu becaus i have inform myself of the actualti . in fact know a lot of thing is realli enrich for me and i can fulfil in life .
