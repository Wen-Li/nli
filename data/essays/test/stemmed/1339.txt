the memori can be a strong and useful instrument if you use it correctli , although if a student onli memor fact hi knwoledg would never be as strong , as if it would be if he understood the main idea of what he is learn . i one hundr per cent agre with the statement that not onli a student , but everi person that want to learn someth , should understand the idea and concept that he is be thought , becaus when you learn and actual get to know the main idea of what you are learn it doe not matter if the caractherist around it chang , you would be abl to understand the idea or the concept . an exampl probabl would help us to understand thi : if you learn the main idea of what a tabl is , it would not be a problem if a differ color , or shape tabl is present to you , you alway would be abl to recogn what a tabl is . on these day , we are attack for lot of inform , that in most case we want to keep them in mind , but while we are just receiveng inform and not go beyond it , we are not have a strong knowled , instead we are onli reciev fact . thi sometim could be useful to fake that we know about anyth that we are ask about , but thi can be danger , becaus if a convers of a particular toppic beggin , and it goe a littl profound , our lack of knowledg , would appear . consid thi statement , i prefer to know less , but in a complet way , than just know a bunch of unsusful fact .
