is it more import to understand idea or concept or learn by fact ? . more peopl often do both , but how can we know what is more import . i definet agre that student get more understand by real fact . as a matter of fact , we have been realiz that the experinc come from real fact that have been happen to us . student are get knowledg base on their experi and assig that proffesor assign them in order to get the knowledg they can get from their brain and then suc . student get more by learn with real fact . anoth reason , is that theori about life nowaday do not get that import in teenag , becaus time consequ ha been chang and goe over and over again in order to chang method as a form of studi . as technolog goe , the student want to get the conveni way to to get their chore easi . in additt , student that most of them are teenag that are in the middl of adulthood and childhood , get more confus and they want to learn real fact for themselv . onli few of them want to follow that rule of ancient method that are idea and concept . nobodi want to follow an idea or concept that ha been impli by other person , at the end the student is who realli learn that those fact are experiec they have been trought and have lead to some person problem that in futur can help them to grow as a person or whatev would be that specif goal . thu , i think that understand by learn fact is more interenst and fun for student to learn rather than idea and concept .
