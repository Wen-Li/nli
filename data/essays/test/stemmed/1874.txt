i complet agre with the fact that most advertis are deceiv and give a complet distort imag of the product they are tri to sell . in fact the purpos of advertis is not that of show a product for what it is but rather to creat the need for that particular item in a possibl custom . in an advertis , it 's not just the product that 's decev but also the context in which it is place and the sensat that it tri to arous . when i look at advertis about car i ask myself : how come are they alway pictur complet alon on a road set in an incontamin landscap ? advertis show you the bright side and do n't warn you that the increas of the number of car enhanc problem about traffic and pollut . in an advertis you never see all the featur of the product , the adverti 's scope , in fact , is to enhanc all the good qualiti the item might have disguis all the bad one . i onc read an articl about mcdonald 's which show how the hamburg look like on the advertis and when you actual got them . it wa realli hard to recogn they were suppos to be relat in some way . the worst advertis are the one for children . they pictur toy so greatli that it seem that one could n't live whithout them ! and children , of cours , do n't have the experi to understand that they are fall in a trap and that 's exactli the purpos of the advertis . anoth techniqu use in advertis is that they make you beleiv that if you have that particular item , a cell phone for exampl , than you will be the coolest person around . everi bodi will be look at you and envi you . advertis make you believ that you can by happi . that happi come from what you have and what other peopl think of you rather than what you are . advertis play with emot , often you can hardli see the product they are tri to sell , you do n't get ani infom about them . .. but somehow they make you feel like you will not be satisfi until you have what they are pictur .
