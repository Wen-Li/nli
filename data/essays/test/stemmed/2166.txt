i agre with the statement say about `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' i think that some one who know about succ , will be not happi in do someth alreadi know how to do well . we are human . in everi one , i think there is someth in mind , witch want stronglli a succ . if we got a succ in certain categori and do that work for 15 year , one day , i 'm sure that we will have a mind that we want to see more far and high and will start to tri to get anoth succ in other categori . for exampl there is a competit like an olymp . one player won man 's 100m . he got a succ . but he will not say that `` i 'm veri happi to win so it 's finish to me. '' if the player is me i 'll resist for 100m huddl , 200m and 400m mayb for a maraton too . to get anoth succ and to be more famou in thi categori . second reson is if we know about succ , we ca n't stop to go on . we can do everyth even we fail . becaus it 's so good . the sansat is undiscript when you got a succ more than when you fail . have a succ , is a dream of everybodi . for thi reason i think that peopl live to get a succ becaus with succ we can live with out mani problem . ido n't said that we do n't have problem when we got a succ but we can control more easli the problem becaus somebodi with succ will be more cool than somebodi who is run to get a succ . for these two reason i'am agre with the statement and i hope strongli , one day i 'll know about sansat of succ .
