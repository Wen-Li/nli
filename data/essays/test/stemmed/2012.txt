actual , i agre with thi idea becaus mani reason . first , i think when the student understand the idea and concept the subject he will abl to work well . for exampl , the chemist , if he understand the idea he could explain the chemistri . on the other hand if he just learn fact about the chemistri he will not be abl to explain . second , if anybodi understand anyth he will never forget it whatev time long but if he learn fact that will make him may forget it after long time . and even if the one who understand forget , he wo n't take long time to rememmb what he understand . for instanc , you can see the scientest who veri old can remmeb , explain and express mani thing which young peopl ca n't mention it . learn fact look like momer . if there is ani exption you will not be abl to figur or distinguish it . understand idea make you abl to solv or obsorv ani quistion or problem you will face even it exption . for exampl of thi tow case , we can take the mathmat as exampl for subject . even you know all fact about it , and if you did n't understand it you will fail by ani treki quistion . final , i think learn fact is old method to studi . when the peopl did n't have the abil to understand thing and mani phenomna over the world may they have to learn fact as it as . but today , i think we have the abil to understand and we have the book and mani recoc we can us it to explain thing . so , understand is demand in thi time and learn fact will not help pepl to prduce
