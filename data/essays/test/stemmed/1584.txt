i disagre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are mainli two reason describ below . first , good thing for travel to me are know more about the place or the countri and know more about peopl from there . for exampl . i want to know what they usual do , eat and think about someth . second , when traval in a group , peopl are like to talk in a group , not talk to peopl from the place where they travel except for onli need commun . when travel led by a tour guid , we can not go to place we want to go to . noth we can do if we spend more time on the specif place and if we want to go anywher tour usual do not select . for exampl , i usual rent a car when i travel . drive around the citi is such a fun and veri good for know peopl from the citi and even drive law in citi . for exampl , there is a round intersect in australia and kind of difficult for peopl from other countri to drive through the intersect , but onc you get use to it , it is such a conveni intersect . i never felt like that if i did not rent a car . and also , when i have a problem , i have to deal with it by myself like ask someon for a help . thi is also a good exampl that i can not get someth that i can never do from group tour . but , travel alon is sometim danger for some peopl , so be careful to choos the way to travel . i think that the best way to travel in a small group by themselv for maxim their experi . than
