it is almost imposs to disagre that the advertis make their product seem much better than they realli are . there may be a lot of reason list to agre thi statement , but the fact that they grant imposs thing happen is more than enough to prove the point . furthermor , the import compani put on and the percent of budget they spare for the advertis depart also show that they might not manag to come up with a veri good product , but they can still compet within the market by effect advertis . the temptat of the shini product on most peopl is yet anoth thing to strengthen the statement . first , there is the issu of imposs of some of the advertis . one advertis of nike air state that it make you jump higher and stay in the air longer than it competitor , use michael jordan slam dunk from outsid of the three-point area . the physic explan to the ` stay longer in the air ' can not be explain by the power of the shoe , but it can be explain by the muscl power that is train through year by the athlet . despit thi fact , the exist of michael jordan in the advertis made most peopl think that they can do the same in hi shoe . moreov , anoth advertis of a car manufactur show peopl that are not in possess of that brand were asham of their car onc the car of that brand wa in the street , and tie balloon to their car to make them go away becaus of their shame . thi situat is imposs from mani differ angl , two of them be ( a ) peopl would not give away ten thousand of dollar just becaus their shame for their car , ( b ) it is not possibl to fli a car with a few balloon . howev , especi the car of brand be too shini and glamor and other car dirti and overus , the car seem a lot better than the other . the car wa not the best in hors power , safeti regul , look or comfort , but the advertis made it sell the most within the market . second , the budget spare for the advertis in most of the compani strenghten the statement . one studi show that statist more than one third of the budget of the compani in the top 100 list show the most profit wa spare for the advertis depart . thi collabor agre to the idea that when these compani are unabl to compet with the qualiti of the product of their rival , they tri to sell it with effect advertis . last , but certainli not the least , peopl buy some product just becaus they are attract by the advertis - even when they do not need the product . the first item that come to mind is the technolog product . when someth is new or in sale , there is more emphasi put on it advertis . when one think of the ipod or iphon , the situat is clearer . in my countri of resid , it is shown by a reliabl studi that more than half of the ipod sold were to peopl that either bare appreci listen to music , or the one that are too busi to spare time to use to ipod . howev , they bought the item , inasmuch they saw it on tv or newspap , probabl either too shini , or in sale . as a conclus , consid the budget spare for the advertis depart , imposs of some of the advertis and the easi of peopl to be tempt to buy product they might not need or use at all , i concur and claim that most product are overr by their advertis .
