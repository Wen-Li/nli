in my opinion in twenti year there wo n't be fewer car in use , becaus of the societi . with the phrase `` societi '' i mean all of us , no matter in which countri . i think we now get use to car for a long time and i think it would be veri hard to give up such a import `` helper '' . mani peopl ca n't imag life without a car . a car make mani thing in life much easier , or should i say more comfort . you do n't have to care about buse or train and their sometim chaotic schedul . the onli thing you have to do is , sit in the car and drive where you want . mani peopl may argu that drive will be to expens in twenti year , becaus of the declin petrol resourc on earth and the increas petrol price . but i think the onli solut for thi problem could be car with other engin . i mean there are sever new techniqu like ga or solar for exampl . mani of these techniqu are alreadi use . i think in twenti year we will have not fewer car as nowaday , i think there will be more . but the car will run from differ fuel resourc . mani peopl in the `` western world '' alreadi have car . in mani famili there are more than onli one car , often two , three or mayb four . but in the eastern world , like china , not everyon or even everi famili have alreadi a car . but they will have a car . the same will happen in mani of the african countri . everi year the wealth increas there in a high rate . mani peopl there will be abl to buy a car in some year . i think thi will be the reason for a increas number of car , in the next year . i think nobodi want to use the bu or someth els instead of the own car , me too . ..
