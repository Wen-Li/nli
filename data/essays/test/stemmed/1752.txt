i do not think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today , twenti year henc . the number of car in everi countri ha been steadili increas sinc the time car came into use : thi scenario is certainli unlik to chang . one might consid the current state of the environ , as as a major reason as to whi car may becom obsolet . the pollut caus by the emiss of the exhaust fume from the petrol and diesel driven car is sure a major caus for concern . moreov , concern ctizen may also say that the loud honk of the car horn increas nois pollut . howev , in keep with these consider , car manufactur compani have start make car which run on electr , solar energi or chemic energi ( batteri oper car ) . these car , though still small in number , are gradual gain popular among the concern citizen . the have been prove effect in reduc air pollut to a great extent . also , car with softer horn are be manufactur and law prohibit blare horn would definit reduc nois pollut . though one may argu that with increas develop , most citi and town in mani countri are get better connect by well-develop and technolog effici transport system such as railway and airplan and thi could be a reason lead to fewer car be use in the next twenti year , i fail to agre . in my opinion , these day , everyon want independ and space . everyon prefer to plan accord to hi or her own conveni . henc , the usag of car will not declin . if a person own a car , he can live by hi own time . a car would provid flexibl in term of time . it definit would provid more comfort and person space . keep these view in mind , i think that though the number of car may not decreas in the next twenti year , howev , the type of car may chang . the car produc then , would definit be more environ friendli and technolog advanc and cater to the comfort of the individu .
