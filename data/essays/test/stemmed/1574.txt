nowaday we are expos to advertis dure the whole day . we listen to them on the radio when we wake up , we read them in the newspap , we watch them on televis or while drive our car . advertis campa are an essenti part of the market of everi product and compani invest a lot of money in them , sometim much more of what they invest for the manufactur of a product . in all modern countri governa and parliament had introduc specif rule in order to regul advertis and give a littl proctect to consum . of cours , in advertis all product seem nicer and more use . it must be so , sinc the advertis are made to sell the them and the success of an advertis campaign depend on the sale result of these product . i usual do not give much attent to advertis and i tri to buy just what i need . howev , i rememb that i bought a pair of shoe just becaus i had been convinc by the advertis . accord to it , thi particular shoe had a rubber sole with a special membran , which allow the sweat to go out through small hole in the sole while let the water outsid . it seem a good idea to me , becaus it match the advantag of a leather sole , which is natur breathabl but not water-proof , and the advantag of a rubber sole , which is water-proof but not breathabl . unfortun , realiti wa veri differ from theori . the first time i use these shoe in the rain i came home with my feet soak in water . sinc that day i listen to advertis with more suspect and i alway think that they are tri to cheat me somehow . of cours it is not alway so . mani good product are advertis and may advertis are correct and fair .
