i agre that certain advertis make product look much better than they actual are . in my opinion the basic aspect of the advertis is to show what the product realli is in a reason manner but there are mani ad exaggar the product they repres . deterg advertis on t.v. set good exampl for thi case . in most of them the potenti buyer see an extrem dirti shirt that is perfectli clean after a singl wash with the product of the concern . there can be other claim in the ad as well , such as that it doe not wear the cloth out , caus pale colour or it clean ani kind of dirt on the cloth . i person feel suspici upon see such an ad , as mani other watcher do probabl . anoth exampl lie in cosmet commerci . a shampoo or a make-up ad includ much more than the effect of the product and thi is alway untold . the watcher can not estim the contribut of the product in what they see on t.v or on a magazin . the light condit , shoot process and the prepar of the model in the ad add consider much on the effect of the product . unless it repres itself reason or unless the claim are support by a legal record who ha observ and confirm them , it is quit difficult to fulli believ what is told in an advertis .
