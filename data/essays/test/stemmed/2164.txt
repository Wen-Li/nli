i agre with statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . for exampl , you went to egypt to explor the beauti of the pyramid . and with you , you have a book which contain the inform about the pyramid and the histori of them . and you go and explor the whole place all alon . now you are miss veri import inform like where all the mummi are buri and exactli the whole stori . even though they are state in the book unless shown in real you can not have a nice experi . take a real life exampl , i onc went to see the belaum cave in india with a friend of mine and began to explor the cave and we began our tour all alon and saw what ever came in our way and kept admir the beauti of the cave and after seven hour we complet saw the cave and return to our room in a hotel and i accident overheard peopl talk about the interest thing about the cave like the miracl that happen in the cave due to the constant flow of water and the mark done on the wall by the water and then i dont rememb see all that told by them . and the next day i again went to the cave with the rest of the tourist led by a tour guid . as the guid wa tell all the import thing about that place then i began to notic all the thing and also saw the mark done by water and a huge stone cut beauti in a nice shape which i thought wa done by a man when i went with my friend but wa actual cut by the constant flow of water as told by the guid . if i had no tour guid accompani me i would have definit thought that those mark and beauti cut rock wa human made . and the whole place wa shown to us in just four hour which ha previous taken me seven hour . from then onward when ever i go to explor a new place i would hire a tour guid and make him lead my way . after all , the expert know everyth . so , it is alway good to have a tour guid guid you in a new place instead you lead your own way so that you will never miss out the beauti of the place and get to know the amaz thing about that place as the tour guid know much about that place and can guid you through place or thing which otherwis you would have miss out .
