some peopl believ that onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is suffici for success . in my opinion , howev , the opposit is true . to be abl to success in life we must tri new thing , take risk and have knowledg about so mani thing . if we want to be success , we must tri new thing . in the bussi life , we alway do regular thing . so , we earn same money . i am electron engin . when i start my new job , we wa buy some rudimentari electron board . they were veri simpl , on the other hand , veri expens . i told to boss about design our own board . he permit me , and i succeed it . now , we make much money than befor . we must take risk to be success . risk is the most import part of success . i went to boss to talk to him about design our own board . thi wa veri riski for me , becaus if i could not achiv to produc thi board , i may be fire from my job . we bought new machin to produc them . in addit , i spend my time for onli thi work . these were veri suffici reason to be fire . but i had taken all these risk , and i achiv it . the last action of the way of success is that we have to improv ourselv in mani way . if we have good knowledg about our major , we can tri new thing , and take risk . i mean these go hand in hand . if we ignor one of them , it is imposs to be successful . in conclus , i believ that there are three main compon of succeess . these are to tri new thing , take risk , and have good knowledg . howev , everybodi ha a differ opinion about thi issu , and i respect all of our view .
