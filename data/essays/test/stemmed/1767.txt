altough there are some peopl woh beleiv that learn fact is more import , i agre with the statement that it is more valuabl for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact for the follow reason . first , we can get a lot of inform not onli by read book , but also check web site through internet . on the other hand , when we tri to understand idea and concept , we have to check the fact and then consid it veri serious , which mean everyon can learn fact and it is not valuabl . i am now work for a trade compani . my respons is trade gold with futur price . i can check the fact , current gold price , with internet , but can not predict the futur price easili . howev , i learn the concept , how to predict such price , when i wa a graduat student . i can trade gold with the concept , which is make much profit for our compani . therefor , understand of the concept is more import than the fact , the current gold price . also , we can appli our understand of idea and concept in a certain field to anoth field , even though fact are just fact . for exampl , my elder brother is a enginn who design laptop at soni , the largest manufactur compani in japan . when he wa a univers student , he learn physic , math , comput enginn , and elect enginn . now he understand how to manufactur soni comput use idea and concept of these subject . if he were not a seriou student , and just rememb the fact , such as the answer in term test and some formula in math or physic , he could not be a soni engin . therefor , learn fact is less import to learn concept . in conclus , i strongli believ that it is more import to understand idea and concept .
