there is an argument concernign about whether product seem much better that they realli are is made by most advertis . although it is true that advertis can help to peopl who buy some product , i believ that most advertis is not alway as advanteg as our live . most of all , mani peopl have damag becaus some advertis are not true . some advertis deciev their client inord to sell more their product . for exampl , when i wa a freshman in univers , i bought a mp3 player that is advertis mani place . by the advertis , the mp3 player should get 1000 music . howev , i wa abl to get 800 music , instead of 1000 music . so , i complain the mp3 player to the compani . they said that the advertis is not true . in thi respect , most peopl can get damag from not true advertis . moreov , most peopl spend more money becaus of advertis . after most peopl see the advertis , they feel the buy impetu . so , they sometim regret their spend . for intanc , my girl griend like shop and her hobbi is shop . when she had a bad feel , she saw some advertis by televis , so she went to the depart store and spend all of her money buy the product that is advertis by tv . later a month , she regret about her behavior . in thi regard , some advertis can give damag to peopl becaus of over spend . in summari , i disgre with that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . thi is becaus most peopl can get damag from not true advertis as well as over spend .
