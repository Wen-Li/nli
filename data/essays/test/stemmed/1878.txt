i disagre that to travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way for a person to tavel . there are mani reason to whi i have thi oppinion . first of it depend on who the group is and if i feel good travel with them . i need to know the peopl i am travel with and like them , if i dont know them or if it is a random group , i would not travel . second , if i travel with a tour guid he would have set up our trip and where we go each and everi day , so mayb i would not like some of the place that we are go to but i have to be with my group , some peopl would like where we are go but i might not . anoth reason is that if you want to do someth you need to ask the group and take their oppinion and most importantli ask the tour guid . it is better to travel on you own becaus of mani reason . first you get to chose who you want to travel with and to where you are go and you set up your trip and what you are go to do everi day in your trip . when a person travel alon without a guid most importantli he get to have hi freedom in hi trip . in conclusin , i do not recommend anyon to travel in a group led by a tour guid , and i tell them that it is much better to travel on your own and you choos what you want to do everyday and where to go . you also do not have to take anybodi 's vote on anyth or ask a leader if you want to do someth , you just take you own vote and do anyht you want .
