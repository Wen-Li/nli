i total agre that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . infact make the product more attract is the main goal of a spot . i am consciou about that becaus i 've spent few mounth in the market area of a firm and i know how it work . first of all there are lot of research beyond an advertis ; they tri to gain as mani inform as possibl about consum 's attitud in order to find an attract way to present their product . after that , they tri to highlight the best qualiti of the product , sometim tell lie , and to hide the neg one . for exampl in a spot for an ice-cream you 'll never hear : `` the more you eat thi ice-cream the more you put on weight '' ; it could be quit strang if it happen . second , sometim big celebrieti are engag as testimoni for a particular product . you could consid a product better than anoth onli becaus georg clooney is spot it . let 's think about cosmet ; how mani time we have heard : '' do you want to be like . .. tri our product !! '' . it is clear that there is no relat between who sponsor the product and the qualiti of it . so it can be conclud that we should not base our opinion of a product on it 's advertis while we have to consid it characterist and if it is worthvalu . as we all know : it is not all what shine !
