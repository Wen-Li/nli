i agre with the statement but i do not think that thi is a neg fact at all . when a compani advertis a product it aim is that as mani peopl as possibl afterward want to have the product . to reach thi aim the compani need to show and describ the product in the most posit way possibl . therefor it is absolut legal to them when they tri to make the product look better than it realli is . the peopl that are look at an advertis on the other hand need to reflect what they see . adult are abl do so . over the year they have learn that not everyth told in the televis or in newspap is directli the truth . children may sometim need their parent to figur that out . the compani tri to make up as mani new surpris advertis as possibl to convinc the peopl so that they run into the store to buy the product . when the compani extand the abili of a product too much in the advertis the consum will be angri and will not buy the product again . therefor the compani need to find a middl way between lie and tell the truth so that the consum will not be disappoint and start to buy is product regulari . thi lead into a daili fight and there are even rule made up by the gover tell how far the compani can go with their advertis to make sure that some truth about the product appear in it advertis . sometim it is even nice for the consum to look at an advertis when the compani ha made up beauti place or funni situat to attract the product to the consum . all togeth it is quit normal and import for the product that it advertis make it seem better than it realli is and the consum learn fast how to handl the wrong fact made up by the compani .
