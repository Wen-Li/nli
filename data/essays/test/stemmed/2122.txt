thi spring festiv , i spent almost a week in sanya with my parent , and also a tour guid . fortunatlli , i had a good time there , sinc the tour guid arrang our scheldul and fix everyth . what i should do wa just to enjoy the trip ! consequ , i prefer to hire a tour guid dure a group-travel . when you visit somewher you do not familiar with , if you hire a guid , he would provid you with car , tell you the histori of the citi , show you interest of place . firstli , when you travel outsid , where is far from your hometown , commonli , you will not drive your own car . thu it is obviou that you will be much easier and cheaper if you hire a guid who can provid a car . for instanc , thi time we went to sanya , we call a guid to pick up us and took us to the place we want to visit . if we , three person to take a taxi , the cost will be doubl . moreov , the guid know the citi better than you do . he not onli know the histori of the histori inher , but also manag to tell you where is the most beauti place in the area . such as what a guid did when iwa in xiamen last year , she show us a place you will never find by your own ! there , the combin of the sun , the sea , the beach is fantast ! final , which i think it is import tome , the tour guid will take you to a much cheap hotel . as you know , the cost is rise thse day . when i am in sanya , the hotel charg us 6000 yuan per day . howev , the guid show up , he bargin for us . at last , we just spent 1700 yuan per day . to sum up , i will choos a guid to lead my travel , not onli for the money stuff , but also for the convieneint .
