i am agre with the statement as follow : in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . nowaday , there are more and more car than befor . there are two reason that i think support thi situat . one is becaus of the prise of car are decreas , mani peopl can afford a car . the car are becom a most common transport everi where . the other is that oil and ga are cheaper and cheaper than ever befor . that make the car market more poverish . when henri ford made the car came into vogu in the earli 20 centuri . peopl no longer take the car as a dream that can never be reach . howev , as the popul of car increas day by day . peopl have also awar of the bad side that the car bring along with . the most seriou problem is air pollut . air pollut caus lot of diseas on human , which is endang to health . take myself for exampl , when i wa young , i live in a small countri where there are fewer car than in a big citi . afterward , i move to a big citi and found my lung wa not as healthi as when i live in a small countri . in spite of air pollut , the use of natur resourc are limit . if we do not cherish them , they will be run out in near futur . seen these two seriou problem , scientist have done research on develop other kind of transport . for instanc , mass rapid transport system in most of the big citi around the world . thi transport includ two kind of type , one is subway , the other is skytrain . also the high speed railroad is also underconstruct . we can expect it in the near futur . evaluationg to the con of the car and the develop in mass transport system , i thu inclin to say that in twenti even fifteen year there must will be fewer car in use than there are today . after all , all human be are hope a better life in the futur .
