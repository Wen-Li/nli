some peopl think that to understand idea is better than to learn fact for the student , howev , i do n't agre with their 's opinion . idea base on person experi , it come from our brain rather than the realiti . on the contrari , fact are what realli happen , and it is more real than idea . therefor , it is alway true that learn fact help peopl make futher develop . as a human , we curiou about whi thing happen and how it work . like the sun rise everyday and then disappear in the night , therefor , peopl make guess about what is happen . for exampl , the myth . ancient peopl in greec make up stori about the natur phenomenon . the stori are all about god and goddess who live in the heaven . they think that god and godd build the world . actulli , the fact is that it can onli be explain by a scentif theoti . howev , what the ancient propl think are idea . so , we can see that idea are not alway right , just like the stori or hypothesi . if student understand and believ what the stori say , it may becom a roadblock for their life . anoth reason whi is not improt for student to understand idea than it is for them to learn fact is that peopl are more like to experi and to find the truth , fact are all truth that we can trust and use in mani area . if we just simpli learn the fact , it is not enough for our develop . so , we have to use our knowledg to anaylsi thing , in short , understand it . if we onli know what the fact is , how will we use it ? the fact is that , idea are differ opinion . through both the view of other and the realiti of an event , we can better understand the thing aroud us . all in all , learn thing not onli by understand idea , but also by learn fact will certainli help student , not just student , develop their own skill and make a differ in the whole world ,
