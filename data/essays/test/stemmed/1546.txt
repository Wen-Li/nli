in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i think it essenti to understand and evolv in our current societi . actual , it appear to me that it could help them to feel better with themselv and the other . firtstli , the best school all over the world provid knowledg of mani differ academ subject to their student . it show that it is the best way to find a good job . secondli , studi are more interest . by do alway the same thing , you get bore veri quickli . and by the way , you could discov news passion and unexpect skill . for instanc , i realiz how import it wa for me to write by learn literatur . if i had onli studi mathemat , i would never be abl to express myself and to write such good novel . moreov , peopl consid that it could be hard a jod without a special in one specif area . but , i total desagre with them . i do believ that the best way to learn and to understand all the topic of a subject is to be abl to have a broader view . you can learn the detail by the practic of the subject . furthermor , a larg knowledg help peopl to be more open mind . for exampl , you understand the differ behavior when you know the differ religion and belief . if everybodi had a larger knowledg , they would no longer make war . final , peopl have to learn the more they could . up to me , they have to be curiou and interest on everyth they could met in their life . becaus if they did not , they would be afraid for the rest of their life . it is well-known that peopl are scare of the unknown thing .
