the educ system or educ board in most of the countri encourag ( most of the time without want to ) student to learn fact instead of understand idea and concept . i strongli dissagre with that method of teach student . the student should be abbl after graduat to use their brain to look at situat from anoth perspect and reason find a solut to a problem in the work enviro or how i will call it `` the real world '' . in the academ world with the educ system of the countri have the promot the student to learn fact of just memor answer to pass the the test and the forget it all . a person that it is capabl to reason a topic instead of just memoraz fact about it , will have to studi fewer time or prepar for a test in a more calmli way , wherea the one who just memor the subject ha to studi a larg ammount of time so hi brain can storag the inform . besid that employ will rather hire a employe whose grade were not that good but he can solv problem just by think throught it , that have a employe whose grade were excel but he can not solv a problem as simpli as the other one . the real world it is much more than just fact , is use the brain and feed it with idea and concept and think about it through . that is way i think the educ board on each countri should prepar and give the student 's brain tool to realli think and face the real world . a chang need to be made if we want to have success peopl and reason person in our everi day enviro and it all bege whit the tipe of educ we give them .
