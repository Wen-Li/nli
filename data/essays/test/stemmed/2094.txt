i will first discuss both interest of broad knowledg and specil and will then give my personn opinion . to have a good broad knowledg requir a lot of work and interest in mani subject such as math , english literatur , polit , foreign languag , etc . .. broad knowledg of academ subject sure can be use and is even requir if you are plan on teach . it could also be conveni to posess that kind of knowledg dure a convers with a friend , or a repres , or at a dinner . that way you will not feel lost and will be abl to discuss the subject even if you do n't know everyth about it . and thi point will lead us to the special into one specif subject . to special in a specif subject doe n't mean that you do n't have pre-requir in other field of interest . it just mean that you are will to learn more about a subject more than anoth plu it mean that you are passion about someth , and to be passion is often the key to sucsess . becaus you are eager to learn everyth on thi particular topic , it may ask a lot of work , but what becom work thank to passion ? amus ! i 'm sure everyon experienc thi phenomenon at least onc in hi or her life . i will take my own experi as an exampl . i use to detest english and i 'm now studi it . i rememb that what trigger everyth wa my first experi of watch a movi in it 's origin version - sinc , french dub on a foreign movi realli annoy me . a coupl of year ago , if i told anyon that i would becom an english major they would have laugh so loud . and i am today pass the toefl in order to candid to an isep program . so my opinion , strictli person and again onli base on my person life experi tend to disagre with thi statement
