i complet agre with the statement shown bellow . it is quit true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i will continu give my explan and person opinion of thi agreement . usual , the place were you find the advertis of these product are in the street shown on billboard , the televis , magazin and news paper . each and everi add ha the intent of give the best impress to the societi , or better known , the shoper , the consum . in some case the advertis exager the appear of the product . it is obvious their way of sell and catch inmens the buyer attent . it is true that it 's their way of sell , howev it is n't the right one . after buy a product that seemd much better on the add than in the realiti , the person aquir a differ view toward it . for exampl , if you buy a shampoo in the supermarket , believ that it will suppos help to nourish your hair and to give more volum to it , and you do n't observ ani differ or improv , you will obvious stop buy it . ly with the function of the product may help the fact that peopl will buy it . howev , it wont bring an econom progress for the compani . thi may provoqu a problem with the consum , becaus peopl nowaday are not sure if they buy the product or not . by natur the human be is unconfid and thi may caus a problem with the consum . peopl are no longer buy what they see on the televis for exampl becaus ther are afraid that the product wont work as good as it look on the tv set . i person believ , that the societi ha to chang , so that thi vision or belief that peopl have , becom differ , that is to say in a more posit aspect . the function of the product should n't be a lie . it defenit wo n't help the compani . they should expos what is real to their project . if it is n't quit good enough , then they sould simpli work harder to make it better .
