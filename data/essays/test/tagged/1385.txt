I_PRP will_MD be_VB discussing_VBG the_DT statement_NN under_IN the_DT business_NN 's_POS umberlla_NN ._.
I_PRP ,_, personally_RB ,_, agree_VBP with_IN the_DT stated_VBN statement_NN which_WDT says_VBZ that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ experiences_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN not_RB all_DT successful_JJ people_NNS are_VBP risk_NN takers_NNS ,_, but_CC taking_VBG risky_JJ things_NNS might_MD be_VB a_DT very_RB good_JJ idea_NN to_TO start_VB businesses_NNS ._.
No_DT one_NN knows_VBZ for_IN sure_JJ that_IN his_PRP$ or_CC her_PRP$ business_NN will_MD be_VB a_DT successful_JJ one_CD ,_, but_CC a_DT person_NN ,_, of_IN course_NN ,_, will_MD know_VB after_IN being_VBG involved_VBN in_IN business_NN world_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN businesspoeple_NN had_VBD encounter_NN difficulties_NNS at_IN the_DT beginning_NN of_IN their_PRP$ businesses_NNS ._.
They_PRP would_MD not_RB be_VB successful_JJ if_IN they_PRP had_VBD not_RB take_VB the_DT advantage_NN of_IN taking_VBG risks_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, as_IN a_DT personal_JJ one_CD ,_, my_PRP$ father_NN started_VBD his_PRP$ work_NN in_IN the_DT field_NN of_IN real_JJ state_NN eventhough_VBZ his_PRP$ expertise_NN was_VBD in_IN software_NN programming_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, he_PRP took_VBD the_DT risk_NN and_CC made_VBD his_PRP$ personal_JJ dream_NN to_TO be_VB a_DT business_NN person_NN ._.
He_PRP has_VBZ been_VBN working_VBG in_IN real_JJ state_NN for_IN thirty_CD years_NNS and_CC he_PRP owns_VBZ some_DT houses_NNS and_CC lands_NNS ._.
Trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS is_VBZ also_RB a_DT very_RB beneficial_JJ in_IN business_NN world_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, the_DT YouTube_NNP founders_NNS were_VBD not_RB sure_JJ that_IN their_PRP$ web_NN page_NN would_MD be_VB that_IN success_NN ._.
At_IN first_RB ,_, they_PRP thought_VBD that_IN the_DT web_NN page_NN would_MD not_RB grap_VB people_NNS 's_POS attention_NN because_IN it_PRP was_VBD a_DT new_JJ idea_NN in_IN that_DT time_NN ._.
After_IN its_PRP$ using_VBG growth_NN among_IN people_NNS ,_, Google_NNP Corp._NNP paid_VBD more_JJR than_IN $_$ 1_CD billion_CD dollars_NNS to_TO the_DT founders_NNS ._.
This_DT proves_VBZ that_IN trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS might_MD be_VB a_DT key_JJ to_TO be_VB a_DT successful_JJ person_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS in_IN busniess_NN world_NN are_VBP sometimes_RB a_DT very_RB winning_JJ equation_NN ._.
