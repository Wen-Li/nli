While_IN some_DT people_NNS say_VBP that_IN successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS rather_RB than_IN only_RB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB always_RB try_VB new_JJ things_NNS or_CC take_VB risks_NNS ._.
To_TO begin_VB with_IN ,_, some_DT people_NNS succeed_VBP because_IN they_PRP have_VBP creativity_NN or_CC imagination_NN a_DT little_JJ different_JJ from_IN everyone_NN else_RB ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, 10_CD years_NNS ago_RB ,_, there_EX were_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN social_JJ networking_NN service_NN companies_NNS in_IN Japan_NNP ._.
In_IN that_DT situation_NN ,_, no_DT one_NN could_MD predict_VB which_WDT company_NN would_MD succeed_VB because_IN there_EX were_VBD not_RB any_DT difference_NN in_IN their_PRP$ business_NN ._.
Among_IN them_PRP ,_, a_DT company_NN ,_, Mixci_NNP ,_, became_VBD only_RB on_IN successful_JJ company_NN in_IN Japan_NNP because_IN its_PRP$ advertisements_NNS way_NN was_VBD a_DT little_JJ different_JJ from_IN other_JJ competitors_NNS ._.
It_PRP targeted_VBD only_RB young_JJ Japanese_JJ people_NNS ._.
There_EX was_VBD not_RB any_DT drastic_JJ difference_NN between_IN the_DT company_NN 's_POS ad_NN way_NN and_CC that_IN of_IN competitors_NNS ._.
The_DT difference_NN was_VBD in_IN its_PRP$ target_NN ._.
In_IN view_NN of_IN this_DT ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP creativity_NN a_DT little_JJ different_JJ from_IN others_NNS are_VBP the_DT most_RBS important_JJ factors_NNS to_TO succeed_VB ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, some_DT people_NNS succeed_VBP by_IN utilizing_VBG risk_NN sharing_VBG methods_NNS ._.
To_TO illustrate_VB ,_, in_IN business_NN some_DT entrepreneurs_NNS begin_VB and_CC succeed_VB their_PRP$ business_NN by_IN the_DT help_NN of_IN venturer_NN capitalists_NNS ._.
According_VBG to_TO the_DT survey_NN conducted_VBN by_IN a_DT famous_JJ Japanese_JJ newspaper_NN company_NN ,_, about_IN 80_CD percent_NN of_IN the_DT start-up_JJ companies_NNS listed_VBN in_IN Tokyo_NNP stock_NN exchange_NN were_VBD helped_VBN by_IN venturer_NN capitals_NNS or_CC other_JJ investors_NNS when_WRB they_PRP started_VBD their_PRP$ business_NN ._.
In_IN view_NN of_IN this_DT ,_, taking_VBG risk_NN does_VBZ not_RB always_RB lead_VB business_NN to_TO succeed_VB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB support_VBP the_DT thought_NN that_WDT successful_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB always_RB try_VB new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS have_VBP creativity_NN and_CC imagination_NN a_DT little_JJ different_JJ from_IN other_JJ ordinary_JJ people_NNS ._.
