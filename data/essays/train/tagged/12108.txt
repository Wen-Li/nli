Since_IN most_JJS of_IN our_PRP$ neighbours_NNS are_VBP pretty_RB old_JJ people_NNS and_CC since_IN I_PRP did_VBD one_CD year_NN of_IN social_JJ service_NN in_IN a_DT home_NN for_IN the_DT elderly_JJ ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN I_PRP have_VBP worked_VBN with_IN enough_JJ old_JJ people_NNS in_IN my_PRP$ life_NN to_TO state_NN that_IN I_PRP totally_RB disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_WDT says_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP think_VBP older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN in_IN a_DT different_JJ way_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
So_RB if_IN one_CD compares_VBZ activities_NNS young_JJ people_NNS prefer_VBP to_TO do_VB in_IN their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN to_TO activities_NNS that_IN older_JJR people_NNS like_IN to_TO do_VB during_IN their_PRP$ spare_JJ time_NN ,_, one_PRP can_MD easily_RB see_VB that_DT old_JJ people_NNS most_RBS probably_RB enjoy_VB life_NN just_RB as_RB much_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO bars_NNS or_CC discos_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, for_IN example_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP going_VBG to_TO a_DT restaurant_NN with_IN good_JJ friends_NNS or_CC like_IN to_TO see_VB an_DT opera_NN or_CC a_DT thatre_NN play_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN this_DT is_VBZ not_RB that_DT much_JJ of_IN a_DT difference_NN in_IN joy_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ only_RB the_DT type_NN of_IN activities_NNS they_PRP prefer_VBP that_IN marks_VBZ a_DT difference_NN ._.
I_PRP would_MD even_RB dare_VB to_TO say_VB that_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP better_JJR chances_NNS and_CC possibilities_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Since_IN older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB more_RBR experienced_JJ and_CC therefore_RB time-effective_JJ than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS in_IN many_JJ different_JJ areas_NNS such_JJ as_IN cooking_NN ,_, housework_NN ,_, or_CC even_RB tasks_NNS at_IN work_NN ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP more_JJR time_NN to_TO spare_JJ and_CC for_IN this_DT reason_NN more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN (_NN if_IN one_CD suspects_VBZ that_IN working_VBG can_MD not_RB be_VB any_DT kind_NN of_IN joy_NN )_NN ._.
After_IN retiring_VBG they_PRP also_RB have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP like_VBP or_CC maybe_RB even_RB make_VB dreams_NNS come_VB true_JJ ._.
Take_VB some_DT of_IN my_PRP$ neighbours_NNS ,_, for_IN example_NN ._.
After_IN retiring_VBG they_PRP went_VBD on_IN a_DT trip_NN around_IN the_DT world_NN to_TO see_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN famous_JJ places_NNS and_CC to_TO experience_VB different_JJ cultures_NNS for_IN about_IN eight_CD months_NNS ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS could_MD not_RB afford_VB such_PDT an_DT activity_NN ._.
They_PRP usually_RB have_VBP n't_RB saved_VBN enogh_JJ money_NN and_CC they_PRP usually_RB have_VBP a_DT job_NN that_WDT wo_MD n't_RB allow_VB an_DT absence_NN of_IN eight_CD months_NNS ._.
To_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, one_PRP can_MD see_VB that_IN even_RB when_WRB only_RB having_VBG a_DT rather_RB ``_`` time-based_JJ ''_'' look_NN at_IN the_DT statement_NN that_WDT was_VBD made_VBN ,_, there_EX is_VBZ no_DT chance_NN of_IN agreeing_VBG with_IN it_PRP at_IN all_DT ._.
It_PRP would_MD even_RB be_VB unfair_JJ to_TO say_VB something_NN like_IN that_DT because_IN it_PRP implies_VBZ that_IN activities_NNS younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP are_VBP more_RBR enjoyable_JJ than_IN the_DT ones_NNS of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
But_CC this_DT is_VBZ and_CC always_RB will_MD be_VB subject_JJ to_TO personal_JJ bias_NN and_CC opinion_NN ._.
