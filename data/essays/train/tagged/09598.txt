People_NNS do_VBP many_JJ different_JJ things_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS like_IN travelling_VBG ,_, playing_VBG sports_NNS ,_, and_CC ._.
I_PRP totally_RB agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, at_IN least_JJS this_DT is_VBZ true_JJ in_IN the_DT community_NN where_WRB I_PRP grew_VBD up_RP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP good_JJ health_NN ,_, take_VB risk_NN ,_, want_VBP to_TO explore_VB new_JJ things_NNS ._.
