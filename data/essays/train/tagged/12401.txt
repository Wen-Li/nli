I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Altough_JJ young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP physically_RB more_RBR active_JJ and_CC healthier_JJR then_RB the_DT older_JJR ,_, thus_RB ,_, may_MD have_VB more_RBR energy_NN to_TO engage_VB in_IN enjoyable_JJ activities_NNS ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP also_RB some_DT advantges_NNS of_IN the_DT old_JJ ages_NNS provide_VBP them_PRP ._.
Young_JJ poeple_NN are_VBP energetic_JJ and_CC active_JJ ,_, hence_RB ,_, often_RB dominate_VB most_JJS of_IN the_DT daily_JJ life_NN activities_NNS we_PRP see_VBP around_RB ._.
However_RB ,_, when_WRB compared_VBN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ,_, younger_JJR ones_NNS have_VBP more_JJR responsibilty_NN ,_, which_WDT hinders_VBZ their_PRP$ opportunity_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, I_PRP and_CC my_PRP$ sister_NN are_VBP working_VBG in_IN full_JJ time_NN jobs_NNS ,_, which_WDT make_VBP us_PRP to_TO spend_VB all_DT day_NN in_IN work_NN ._.
Besides_IN that_DT ,_, we_PRP are_VBP studying_VBG for_IN graduate_JJ degrees_NNS and_CC this_DT takes_VBZ most_JJS of_IN our_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, my_PRP$ granparents_NNS who_WP are_VBP now_RB enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ retirement_NN years_NNS ,_, spend_VBP their_PRP$ days_NNS with_IN shopping_NN ,_, wandering_VBG around_RB ,_, travelling_VBG and_CC hosting_VBG family_NN members_NNS in_IN the_DT weekends_NNS ._.
Another_DT advantage_NN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP have_VBP been_VBN cared_VBN by_IN other_JJ family_NN members_NNS more_RBR than_IN the_DT younger_JJR ones_NNS have_VBP been_VBN ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ culture_NN ,_, senior_JJ people_NNS are_VBP highly_RB respected_VBN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP been_VBN consulted_VBN for_IN experiences_NNS they_PRP have_VBP and_CC for_IN the_DT knowledge_NN they_PRP acquired_VBD throughout_IN their_PRP$ life_NN span_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ ,_, they_PRP are_VBP often_RB visited_VBN by_IN familty_NN members_NNS ,_, by_IN relatives_NNS ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ giving_VBG them_PRP opportunity_NN to_TO interact_VB socially_RB even_RB sometimes_RB more_RBR then_RB young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
One_CD other_JJ point_NN is_VBZ that_IN having_VBG developed_VBN a_DT mature_JJ taste_NN of_IN preferences_NNS ,_, older_JJR poeple_NN do_VBP not_RB spend_VB time_NN trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS spend_VBP their_PRP$ times_NNS in_IN a_DT more_RBR quality_JJ way_NN ._.
Yet_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS generally_RB like_IN trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS as_IN if_IN they_PRP have_VBP not_RB developed_VBN permanent_JJ life_NN preferences_NNS ._.
In_IN other_JJ words_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD be_VB thought_VBN as_IN they_PRP are_VBP still_RB in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN cycle_NN ,_, which_WDT can_MD be_VB characterized_VBN by_IN flcutuations_NNS in_IN tastes_NNS and_CC preferences_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP can_MD not_RB agree_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Both_DT age_NN groups_NNS have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ advantages_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS ._.
While_IN young_JJ people_NNS may_MD be_VB healthier_JJR and_CC more_RBR active_JJ than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB many_JJ different_JJ aspects_NNS of_IN life_NN ._.
The_DT more_RBR important_JJ thing_NN is_VBZ that_IN regardless_RB of_IN the_DT age_NN you_PRP are_VBP in_IN ,_, one_CD should_MD know_VB how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
