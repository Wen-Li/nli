With_IN the_DT different_JJ state_NN between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS ,_, the_DT style_NN they_PRP choose_VBP to_TO live_VB in_IN is_VBZ significantly_RB varied_VBN ._.
Compared_VBN to_TO the_DT difference_NN ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
As_IN all_DT known_VBN well_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN than_IN the_DT old_JJ ,_, and_CC they_PRP are_VBP full_JJ of_IN imagination_NN and_CC creation_NN ._.
They_PRP regard_VBP life_NN as_IN a_DT more_RBR colorfull_JJ way_NN than_IN the_DT older_JJR do_VBP ._.
Take_VB school_NN teachers_NNS for_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT large_JJ quantities_NNS of_IN them_PRP says_VBZ they_PRP love_VBP thier_JJR vocation_NN as_IN teaching_NN ._.
A_DT main_JJ reason_NN for_IN this_DT is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP are_VBP exposed_VBN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ,_, whose_WP$ thoughts_NNS are_VBP fresh_JJ and_CC lives_NNS are_VBP lively_JJ ._.
Teachers_NNPS are_VBP obsessed_VBN by_IN the_DT joyness_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
By_IN living_VBG with_IN them_PRP ,_, teachers_NNS are_VBP sometimes_RB find_VB themselves_PRP back_RB in_IN thier_JJR young_JJ pirod_NN ._.
Besides_IN ,_, when_WRB off_RP campus_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR purchasing_NN ability_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, so_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN money_NN they_PRP spend_VBP in_IN varied_JJ typed_VBN of_IN recreation_NN are_VBP larger_JJR than_IN order_NN people_NNS spend_VBP ._.
For_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, they_PRP are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ to_TO obtain_VB the_DT happiness_NN through_IN buying_VBG new_JJ clothes_NNS ,_, shoes_NNS ,_, movies_NNS as_RB well_RB as_IN eating_VBG out_RP in_IN fine_JJ restaurant_NN with_IN friends_NNS ._.
With_IN the_DT supplying_VBG of_IN money_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD realise_VB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN such_JJ ways_NNS ._.
What_WP 's_VBZ more_JJR ,_, the_DT internet_NN seems_VBZ more_RBR attractive_JJ to_TO young_JJ people_NNS than_IN the_DT older_JJR ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP sufing_VBG in_IN the_DT internet_NN including_VBG chating_VBG with_IN thier_JJR friends_NNS and_CC even_RB by_IN web-camara_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT way_NN they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Last_JJ but_CC not_RB the_DT least_JJS ,_, the_DT society_NN gives_VBZ more_RBR oppurtunities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS often_RB go_VBP to_TO sing_VB songs_NNS in_IN such_JJ places_NNS that_WDT older_JJR people_NNS seldom_RB go_VBP ._.
Along_IN this_DT ,_, facilities_NNS like_IN instant_JJ shoting_VBG with_IN many_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN backgroud_NN in_IN the_DT picture_NN that_IN older_JJR poeple_NN nearly_RB never_RB do_VBP ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS '_POS lives_NNS are_VBP more_RBR interesting_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
With_IN curiosity_NN and_CC energy_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD always_RB find_VB their_PRP$ life_NN enjoyable_JJ through_IN kinds_NNS of_IN methods_NNS ._.
