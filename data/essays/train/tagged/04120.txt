I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, as_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN myself_PRP ,_, I_PRP can_MD state_VB that_IN we_PRP experience_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN stress_NN during_IN our_PRP$ teenages_NNS ._.
We_PRP have_VBP to_TO make_VB all_PDT the_DT choices_NNS on_IN which_WDT will_MD depend_VB our_PRP$ future_NN ,_, therefore_RB we_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB time_NN to_TO fool_VB around_RB and_CC enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
From_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN five_CD until_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN twenty_CD ,_, approximatively_RB as_IN it_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN the_DT country_NN we_PRP study_VBP in_IN ,_, we_PRP spend_VBP our_PRP$ time_NN learning_VBG ,_, studying_VBG ,_, thinking_VBG of_IN our_PRP$ future_NN and_CC it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB leave_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB much_JJ of_IN what_WP life_NN is_VBZ ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, when_WRB we_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ,_, we_PRP have_VBP seen_VBN and_CC experienced_VBN so_RB much_RB ,_, that_IN when_WRB the_DT time_NN for_IN retirement_NN comes_VBZ ,_, our_PRP$ head_NN is_VBZ full_JJ of_IN ideas_NNS of_IN what_WP we_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB or_CC what_WP we_PRP want_VBP to_TO see_VB ._.
And_CC the_DT major_JJ fact_NN is_VBZ that_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP time_NN to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ,_, moreover_RB the_DT life_NN time_NN have_VBP so_RB much_RB increased_VBD that_IN nowadays_RB when_WRB people_NNS retire_VBP ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT full_JJ twenty_CD years_NNS ahead_RB of_IN them_PRP in_IN France_NNP ._.
In_IN other_JJ countries_NNS ,_, it_PRP might_MD not_RB be_VB the_DT same_JJ ;_: for_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN the_DT United_NNP -_: State_NNP ,_, executives_NNS retire_VBP after_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN sixty-five_CD ._.
So_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ a_DT common_JJ knowledge_NN that_IN as_IN we_PRP get_VBP old_JJ we_PRP tend_VBP to_TO be_VB a_DT child_NN again_RB ._.
So_RB much_JJ old_JJ people_NNS discover_VBP themselves_PRP new_JJ passions_NNS as_IN sight-seeing_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, once_RB I_PRP was_VBD at_IN the_DT opera_NN and_CC the_DT old_JJ woman_NN sitting_VBG next_JJ to_TO me_PRP told_VBD me_PRP that_IN going_VBG at_IN the_DT opera_NN or_CC to_TO the_DT theater_NN were_VBD her_PRP$ new_JJ passions_NNS since_IN she_PRP was_VBD retired_VBN ._.
She_PRP also_RB told_VBD me_PRP that_IN before_RB ,_, it_PRP would_MD have_VB never_RB occured_VBD her_PRP$ that_IN she_PRP would_MD become_VB passionate_JJ by_IN it_PRP ._.
Futhermore_RB ,_, how_WRB much_JJ old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP we_PRP see_VB sight-seeing_JJ or_CC in_IN the_DT museums_NNS comparatively_RB to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ?_.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR life_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS though_IN the_DT quotation_NN ``_`` carpe_FW diem_FW ''_'' ._.
