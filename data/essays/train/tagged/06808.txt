As_IN far_RB as_IN I_PRP am_VBP concerned_JJ ,_, I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN seniors_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS to_TO support_VB this_DT idea_NN -_: health_NN ,_, and_CC society_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP passionate_JJ and_CC healthy_JJ ._.
Since_IN they_PRP are_VBP healthier_RBR than_IN older_JJR peole_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD more_RBR travel_VB or_CC do_VB activites_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS get_VBP easily_RB tired_VBN and_CC need_VB the_DT rest_NN ,_, because_IN of_IN that_DT ,_, it_PRP takes_VBZ much_RB more_JJR time_NN for_IN seniors_NNS to_TO travel_VB or_CC do_VB activites_NNS while_IN healthy_JJ young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP much_RB more_RBR activities_NNS ._.
Also_RB there_EX are_VBP many_JJ activites_NNS that_WDT require_VBP a_DT good_JJ health_NN such_JJ as_IN sky_NN diving_NN ,_, soccer_NN ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
Since_IN these_DT activities_NNS are_VBP difficult_JJ for_IN old_JJ people_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB do_VB or_CC enjoy_VB these_DT activities_NNS even_RB though_IN they_PRP really_RB want_VBP to_TO do_VB those_DT ._.
So_RB there_EX are_VBP many_JJ limitations_NNS to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS with_IN a_DT great_JJ tenacity_NN can_MD enjoy_VB aggresive_JJ activities_NNS and_CC can_MD do_VB in_IN a_DT long_JJ period_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
The_DT other_JJ reason_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP is_VBZ society_NN ._.
In_IN society_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ businesses_NNS making_VBG many_JJ entertainments_NNS ._.
The_DT problem_NN is_VBZ that_IN their_PRP$ targets_NNS are_VBP mostly_RB young_JJ people_NNS ,_, teenagers_NNS or_CC ages_NNS of_IN twenty_CD to_TO forty_CD ._.
The_DT reason_NN is_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB make_VBP money_NN ,_, however_RB old_JJ people_NNS usually_RB retired_VBN from_IN their_PRP$ jobs_NNS and_CC became_VBD unemployed_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, movie_NN theaters_NNS ,_, or_CC amsement_NN parks_NNS are_VBP usually_RB noisy_JJ and_CC are_VBP packed_VBN with_IN a_DT huge_JJ number_NN of_IN people_NNS which_WDT are_VBP the_DT exact_JJ conditions_NNS that_IN many_JJ old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB like_VB ._.
By_IN time_NN goes_VBZ by_IN ,_, many_JJ companies_NNS emerges_VBZ to_TO the_DT society_NN and_CC they_PRP produce_VBP many_JJ entertainments_NNS for_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, not_RB old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP getting_VBG less_JJR things_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB for_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Some_DT people_NNS may_MD think_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC young_JJ people_NNS equally_RB have_VBP chances_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, due_JJ to_TO the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP healthier_RBR and_CC more_RBR make_VB money_NN and_CC society_NN does_VBZ not_RB care_VB for_IN older_JJR people_NNS in_IN entertaiments_NNS field_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO live_VB in_IN enjoyable_JJ lives_NNS ._.
