A_DT lot_NN of_IN my_PRP$ friends_NNS complain_VBP that_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS are_VBP too_RB boring_JJ ._.
They_PRP tell_VBP that_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS are_VBP not_RB interested_JJ in_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ leisure_NN times_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS wants_VBZ that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjopy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS becausethey_NN have_VBP already_RB experienced_VBN a_DT lot_NN of_IN enjoyments_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS encourage_VBP younger_JJR people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
I_PRP agree_VBP definitely_RB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP enthousiastic_JJ and_CC vital_JJ to_TO live_VB an_DT exciting_JJ life_NN ._.
They_PRP tend_VBP to_TO use_VB opportunities_NNS to_TO travel_VB ;_: and_CC they_PRP want_VBP to_TO experience_VB different_JJ things_NNS ._.
They_PRP want_VBP to_TO know_VB everything_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, they_PRP tend_VBP to_TO get_VB quickly_RB bored_VBN so_IN they_PRP go_VBP to_TO parties_NNS ._.
And_CC they_PRP dance_VBP and_CC go_VBP to_TO concerts_NNS ._.
I_PRP am_VBP not_RB different_JJ ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN ,_, I_PRP like_VBP to_TO meet_VB my_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, go_VB to_TO restaurants_NNS ,_, and_CC more_RBR over_IN ._.
To_TO enjoy_VB life_NN means_NNS for_IN the_DT youth_NN that_IN they_PRP can_MD experiment_NN and_CC try_VB different_JJ ways_NNS of_IN life_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP now_RB much_RB slower_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO act_VB more_JJR than_IN it_PRP is_VBZ necessary_JJ but_CC I_PRP can_MD understand_VB this_DT ._.
I_PRP think_VBP when_WRB I_PRP get_VBP older_JJR I_PRP will_MD become_VB more_RBR inactive_JJ because_IN I_PRP will_MD have_VB a_DT family_NN ,_, one_CD or_CC two_CD children_NNS ._.
I_PRP will_MD want_VB that_IN my_PRP$ children_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, I_PRP will_MD them_PRP give_VB the_DT possibilities_NNS ,_, so_RB that_IN they_PRP can_MD do_VB more_JJR things_NNS ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_IN I_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB that_IN they_PRP say_VBP later_RB that_IN they_PRP could_MD not_RB feel_VB happy_JJ with_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
It_PRP would_MD be_VB terrible_JJ for_IN me_PRP ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ interesting_JJ how_WRB young_JJ people_NNS combine_VBP a_DT free_JJ happy_JJ leisure_NN time_NN with_IN businees_NNS ._.
They_PRP become_VBP even_RB more_RBR successful_JJ because_IN they_PRP are_VBP limited_VBN in_IN their_PRP$ activities_NNS like_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
My_PRP$ friends_NNS are_VBP all_DT perfect_JJ examples_NNS ._.
A_DT lot_NN of_IN them_PRP are_VBP succesful_JJ in_IN their_PRP$ careers_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP happy_JJ and_CC agile_JJ ._.
Enjoying_VBG life_NN leads_VBZ to_TO satisfaction_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP ,_, because_IN older_JJR people_NNS stop_VB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN they_PRP become_VBP more_RBR and_CC more_RBR dissatisfied_JJ ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS for_IN me_PRP why_WRB I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
One_CD reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO see_VB and_CC experience_VB everything_NN ._.
Another_DT reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP become_VBP more_RBR succesful_JJ with_IN this_DT attitude_NN ._.
Now_RB ,_, I_PRP enjoy_VBP my_PRP$ life_NN ,_, too_RB ,_, but_CC I_PRP know_VBP that_IN this_DT attitude_NN will_MD end_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN not_RB only_RB because_IN of_IN some_DT changes_NNS in_IN my_PRP$ life_NN but_CC also_RB some_DT changes_NNS in_IN my_PRP$ attitude_NN toward_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
