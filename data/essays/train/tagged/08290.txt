In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN the_DT enjoymanet_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR than_IN thats_NNS for_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, because_IN young_JJ people_NNS dont_VBP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN ressponsibilities_NNS during_IN the_DT youth_NN period_NN such_JJ as_IN that_DT upon_IN older_JJR people_NNS which_WDT include_VBP home_NN loans_NNS ,_, taxes_NNS ,_, bills_NNS ._. .._SYM
etc_NN ._.
Also_RB youth_NN always_RB appear_VBP interested_JJ in_IN parties_NNS and_CC week_NN end_NN journies_VBZ done_VBN by_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ,_, On_IN other_JJ hand_NN old_JJ people_NNS prefer_VBP stability_NN ,_, comfort_NN and_CC money_NN savings_NNS ._.
The_DT youth_NN always_RB like_IN traveling_VBG and_CC changing_VBG its_PRP$ life_NN routine_NN which_WDT he_PRP assume_VB a_DT killing_NN factor_NN for_IN his_PRP$ social_JJ relations_NNS that_WDT spent_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN producing_VBG them_PRP ._.
while_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS prefer_VBP routine_JJ and_CC reacts_VBZ against_IN changes_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN style_NN what_WDT ever_RB it_PRP was_VBD ._.
According_VBG to_TO the_DT long_JJ experince_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, their_PRP$ are_VBP more_RBR many_JJ things_NNS in_IN life_NN than_IN enjoy_VB ,_, for_IN example_NN health_NN ,_, security_NN which_WDT appears_VBZ meanless_JJ for_IN the_DT youth_NN ._.

Finally_RB ,_, according_VBG to_TO the_DT prementioned_JJ factors_NNS ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_RBR enjoy_VB than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, and_CC thats_NNS clear_JJ from_IN the_DT saying_VBG (_CD eat_VBP to_TO live_VB or_CC live_VB to_TO eat_VB )_CD which_WDT best_JJS illustrate_VBP the_DT difference_NN between_IN this_DT two_CD kind_NN of_IN human_JJ beings_NNS ._.
