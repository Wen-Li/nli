I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS for_IN this_DT ;_: healthy_JJ and_CC changing_VBG the_DT life_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR health_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
If_IN young_JJ people_NNS feel_VBP that_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO climb_VB up_RP the_DT Mt_NN ,_, Fuji_NNP ,_, they_PRP can_MD climb_VB up_RP ._.
However_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS could_MD n't_RB ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_RB ,_, most_RBS older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP bad_JJ health_NN ._.
Another_DT thing_NN is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP may_MD have_VB not_RB energy_NN to_TO move_VB ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB go_VB abroad_RB ._.
They_PRP will_MD feel_VB that_IN own_JJ country_NN is_VBZ more_RBR confortable_JJ than_IN ather_JJ countries_NNS ._.
Second_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP longer_JJR life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
By_IN trying_VBG a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS will_MD change_VB their_PRP$ life_NN and_CC the_DT way_NN of_IN thinking_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP hardly_RB to_TO change_VB the_DT life_NN by_IN trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB young_JJ people_NNS listen_VBP to_TO the_DT music_NN of_IN an_DT artist_NN ,_, they_PRP may_MD change_VB the_DT thinkig_NN ._.
Then_RB they_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB artist_NN may_MD be_VB ._.
For_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
