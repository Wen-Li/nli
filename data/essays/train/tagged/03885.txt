Most_JJS people_NNS would_MD tend_VB to_TO consider_VB that_DT youth_NN is_VBZ the_DT best_JJS part_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Unlike_IN them_PRP ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN the_DT older_JJR days_NNS are_VBP often_RB much_RB more_RBR enjoyed_VBN than_IN the_DT ``_`` golden_JJ age_NN ''_'' of_IN youth_NN ,_, which_WDT always_RB runs_VBZ to_TO fast_RB ._.
As_IN we_PRP become_VBP older_JJR ,_, we_PRP learn_VBP to_TO become_VB more_RBR aware_JJ of_IN our_PRP$ environment_NN and_CC our_PRP$ being_VBG so_RB that_IN we_PRP can_MD tste_VB bbetter_NN the_DT flavour_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
The_DT main_JJ advantage_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP on_IN younger_JJR ones_NNS is_VBZ maturity_NN ._.
With_IN a_DT proper_JJ education_NN ,_, one_CD learns_VBZ to_TO see_VB and_CC enjoy_VB things_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS would_MD no_RB even_RB notice_VB ._.
Most_JJS children_NNS do_VBP not_RB understand_VB why_WRB the_DT elderly_JJ take_NN so_RB many_JJ time_NN in_IN their_PRP$ garden_NN takin_NN care_NN of_IN flowers_NNS which_WDT may_MD not_RB be_VB there_RB the_DT following_JJ year_NN ._.
When_WRB one_CD gets_VBZ mature_JJ ,_, he_PRP or_CC she_PRP also_RB learn_VBP a_DT lot_NN about_IN himself_PRP or_CC herself_PRP ,_, so_RB that_IN they_PRP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO control_VB their_PRP$ feelings_NNS and_CC thus_RB ,_, they_PRP manage_VBP to_TO earn_VB more_JJR freedom_NN as_IN they_PRP handle_VBP their_PRP$ unconscious_JJ reactions_NNS ._.
The_DT second_JJ reason_NN why_WRB old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP run_VBP out_IN of_IN time_NN ._.
Since_IN they_PRP have_VBP became_VBD more_RBR mature_JJ ,_, they_PRP are_VBP aware_JJ that_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS will_MD not_RB last_VB long_RB ._.
Not_RB only_RB is_VBZ each_DT day_NN become_VB more_RBR and_CC more_RBR special_JJ with_IN the_DT passage_NN and_CC time_NN ,_, but_CC they_PRP also_RB know_VBP they_PRP can_MD not_RB do_VB everything_NN they_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO in_IN this_DT limited_JJ time_NN ,_, so_RB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS may_MD try_VB to_TO have_VB as_RB many_JJ of_IN their_PRP$ dreams_NNS as_IN possible_JJ come_VBN true_JJ ._.
As_IN a_DT matter_NN of_IN fact_NN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP nothing_NN to_TO lose_VB anymore_RB ,_, so_IN that_IN they_PRP can_MD do_VB incredible_JJ things_NNS ._.
When_WRB getting_VBG older_JJR ,_, people_NNS realise_VBP the_DT vanity_NN of_IN their_PRP$ childhood_NN 's_POS illusions_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD therefore_RB focus_VB on_IN meaningful_JJ matters_NNS ,_, compared_VBN to_TO which_WDT a_DT child_NN 's_POS dream_NN may_MD look_VB as_IN a_DT waste_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP the_DT real_JJ life_NN ,_, whereas_IN children_NNS often_RB enjoy_VBP illusions_NNS ._.
