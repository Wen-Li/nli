Depending_VBG on_IN the_DT cirucmstances_NNS to_TO which_WDT the_DT question_NN could_MD be_VB posed_VBN ,_, the_DT answers_NNS vary_VBP accordingly_RB ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, young_JJ adults_NNS have_VBP completely_RB different_JJ sources_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN to_TO middle_JJ age_NN people_NNS who_WP in_IN turn_NN ,_, have_VBP different_JJ enjoyment_NN to_TO a_DT pensioner_NN ._.
Depending_VBG on_IN where_WRB you_PRP find_VBP place_NN in_IN this_DT chain_NN will_MD distinguish_VB what_WP you_PRP consider_VBP fun_NN ._.
A_DT younger_JJR crowd_NN will_MD enjoy_VB attending_VBG parties_NNS ,_, attending_VBG night_NN clubs_NNS ,_, doing_VBG rather_RB challenging_JJ and_CC more_RBR physically_RB tiring_VBG sports_NNS ._.
A_DT middle_JJ age_NN person_NN might_MD achieve_VB enjoyment_NN from_IN playing_VBG a_DT game_NN of_IN chess_NN or_CC maybe_RB going_VBG to_TO the_DT opera_NN and_CC for_IN that_DT middle_JJ age_NN person_NN person_NN ,_, attending_VBG noisy_JJ parties_NNS and_CC doing_VBG dangerous_JJ sports_NNS might_MD not_RB be_VB enjoyment_NN at_IN all_DT ._.

There_EX is_VBZ a_DT typically_RB trend_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN an_DT older_JJR person_NN because_IN they_PRP believe_VBP that_IN the_DT younger_JJR you_PRP are_VBP the_DT more_JJR fun_NN you_PRP can_MD have_VB ,_, this_DT i_FW believe_VBP is_VBZ incorrect_JJ because_IN ,_, yes_UH of_IN course_NN ,_, the_DT younger_JJR you_PRP are_VBP the_DT more_JJR options_NNS of_IN enjoyment_NN you_PRP might_MD think_VB to_TO have_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT fatehr_NN of_IN a_DT child_NN would_MD rather_RB much_RB spend_VB time_NN with_IN his_PRP$ son_NN or_CC duaghter_NN rather_RB than_IN attend_VB a_DT gathering_NN full_JJ of_IN 20_CD year_NN olds_NNS just_RB because_IN he_PRP has_VBZ different_JJ priorities_NNS ._.
A_DT young_JJ person_NN would_MD not_RB enjoy_VB spendign_JJ tiem_NN with_IN relatives_NNS or_CC older_JJR members_NNS of_IN his_PRP$ fmaily_RB simply_RB because_IN at_IN that_DT age_NN ,_, you_PRP tend_VBP to_TO have_VB different_JJ obligations_NNS ,_, different_JJ points_NNS of_IN interest_NN and_CC different_JJ type_NN of_IN mentality_NN ._.
Younge_NNP rpeople_NN tend_VB to_TO fell_VBD that_IN as_IN your_PRP$ odl_NN you_PRP miss_VBP out_RP on_IN what_WP is_VBZ really_RB fun_NN ,_, but_CC we_PRP must_MD remember_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS where_WRB young_JJ at_IN one_CD point_NN and_CC what_WP a_DT young_JJ person_NN thinks_VBZ an_DT older_JJR person_NN will_MD never_RB dream_VB of_IN doing_VBG ,_, might_MD just_RB probably_RB mean_VB that_IN it_PRP was_VBD already_RB done_VBN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, i_FW do_VBP not_RB believe_VB that_IN the_DT younger_JJR you_PRP are_VBP the_DT more_JJR fun_NN you_PRP have_VBP but_CC rather_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR you_PRP are_VBP your_PRP$ taste_NN of_IN fun_NN change_NN and_CC you_PRP rpriorities_NNS differ_VBP ._.
