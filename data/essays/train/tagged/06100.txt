Some_DT people_NNS think_VBP yonger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, because_IN they_PRP are_VBP healthier_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
I_PRP ,_, however_RB ,_, think_VBP older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN my_PRP$ personal_JJ experience_NN ._.
I_PRP ,_, therefore_RB ,_, disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN which_WDT says_VBZ yonger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR knowledge_NN than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP lived_VBN longer_RBR lives_VBZ than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS and_CC they_PRP have_VBP had_VBN more_RBR knowledge_NN than_IN them_PRP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS will_MD try_VB new_JJ things_NNS that_WDT are_VBP good_JJ for_IN them_PRP ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO play_VB or_CC play_VB games_NNS with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS on_IN weekend_NN ,_, however_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS climb_VBP the_DT mountain_NN with_IN their_PRP$ business_NN members_NNS or_CC travel_VB somewhere_RB to_TO rest_NN ._.

Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP belive_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS ._.
This_DT means_VBZ older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR alternatives_NNS to_TO do_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, one_CD day_NN my_PRP$ father_NN told_VBD a_DT story_NN about_IN ski-diving_NN ._.
At_IN that_DT time_NN I_PRP did_VBD not_RB know_VB about_IN ski-diving_NN so_IN my_PRP$ father_NN brang_VBD me_PRP a_DT place_NN where_WRB is_VBZ for_IN ski-diving_NN ._.
Many_JJ people_NNS were_VBD enjoying_VBG it_PRP and_CC I_PRP really_RB wanted_VBD to_TO try_VB ._.
I_PRP ,_, however_RB ,_, did_VBD not_RB have_VB money_NN at_IN that_DT time_NN ,_, therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP could_MD not_RB do_VB that_DT and_CC I_PRP thought_VBD older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP lucky_JJ because_IN they_PRP have_VBP money_NN to_TO do_VB ski-diving_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR knowledge_NN about_IN life_NN and_CC money_NN ,_, which_WDT means_VBZ they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR alternatives_NNS ._.
My_PRP$ personal_JJ experience_NN taught_VBD me_PRP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD play_VB more_RBR sports_NNS than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS know_VBP more_JJR about_IN what_WP is_VBZ good_JJ for_IN them_PRP ,_, I_PRP ,_, therefore_RB ,_, disagree_VBP that_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
