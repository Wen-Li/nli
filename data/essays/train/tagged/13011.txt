I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX three_CD reasons_NNS for_IN this_DT ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, there_EX are_VBP the_DT good_JJ reason_NN just_RB around_IN me_PRP ._.
My_PRP$ grandfather_NN and_CC mother_NN really_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
After_IN my_PRP$ grandfather_NN retired_VBD his_PRP$ job_NN ,_, he_PRP and_CC his_PRP$ wife_NN often_RB travell_VBP all_DT over_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
They_PRP like_VBP trip_NN very_RB much_RB and_CC they_PRP say_VBP that_IN traveling_VBG is_VBZ their_PRP$ whole_JJ life_NN hobby_NN ._.
It_PRP seems_VBZ to_TO me_PRP that_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN better_JJR than_IN me_PRP ._.
Secondary_JJ ,_, at_IN present_JJ ,_, there_EX are_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN materials_NNS ,_, helps_VBZ and_CC oppotunities_VBZ for_IN older_JJR people_NNS to_TO make_VB their_PRP$ life_NN better_RBR ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, university_NN is_VBZ open_JJ for_IN a_DT lot_NN kinds_NNS of_IN people_NNS like_IN those_DT who_WP working_VBG outside_IN university_NN ,_, and_CC even_RB for_IN older_JJR people_NNS retired_VBD their_PRP$ jobs_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS who_WP want_VBP to_TO study_VB more_JJR even_RB they_PRP get_VBP ages_NNS ._.
thirdly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP like_VBP to_TO ._.
After_IN they_PRP retired_VBD their_PRP$ works_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP they_PRP can_MD get_VB the_DT prenty_NN of_IN oppotunities_NNS and_CC full_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Although_IN older_JJR peolpe_NN have_VBP more_RBR risks_NNS on_IN their_PRP$ health_NN and_CC they_PRP may_MD have_VB difficulty_NN to_TO live_VB ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP great_JJ experiences_NNS through_IN their_PRP$ long_JJ life_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP also_RB the_DT vigor_NN to_TO beat_VB this_DT difficulties_NNS ._.
The_DT older_JJR people_NNS around_IN me_PRP such_JJ as_IN my_PRP$ grandfather_NN and_CC grandmother_NN ,_, who_WP I_PRP really_RB respect_NN ,_, usually_RB advise_VBP me_PRP how_WRB to_TO live_VB ,_, and_CC how_WRB to_TO improve_VB my_PRP$ life_NN when_WRB I_PRP have_VBP a_DT probrem_NN about_IN my_PRP$ life_NN ._.
these_DT are_VBP the_DT reasons_NNS why_WRB I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB more_RBR enjoyable_JJ life_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN both_DT of_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB thei_IN
