I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Our_PRP$ current_JJ society_NN gives_VBZ more_RBR opportunities_NNS to_TO young_JJ people_NNS than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Thus_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR oportunities_NNS that_IN they_PRP can_MD find_VB things_NNS that_IN they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP more_JJR activities_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
young_JJ people_NNS who_WP living_VBG in_IN society_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO do_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
Some_DT people_NNS have_VBP to_TO do_VB work_VB and_CC some_DT people_NNS have_VBP to_TO s_NNS tudy_NN for_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
also_RB these_DT are_VBP decided_VBN by_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ opinion_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD decide_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB and_CC what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
they_PRP can_MD find_VB happiness_NN while_IN they_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG something_NN ._.
I_PRP always_RB thinking_VBG that_IN I_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB a_DT jouenalist_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ why_WRB I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO researching_VBG people_NNS and_CC reading_VBG a_DT book_NN ._.
I_PRP really_RB enjoy_VBP things_NNS that_IN I_PRP do_VBP and_CC I_PRP am_VBP happy_JJ to_TO study_VB that_IN I_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
Aometimes_NNS I_PRP saw_VBD people_NNS who_WP does_VBZ not_RB have_VB to_TO learn_VB any_DT more_JJR like_IN my_PRP$ grandmother_NN ._.
My_PRP$ grand_JJ mother_NN graduated_VBD from_IN Korea-University_NNP and_CC right_RB after_IN graduation_NN she_PRP went_VBD to_TO China_NNP for_IN learn_VBP Cinese_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, she_PRP does_VBZ not_RB study_VB anymore_RB and_CC just_RB stay_VB at_IN home_NN ._.
one_CD day_NN ,_, when_WRB I_PRP visit_VBP her_PRP ,_, she_PRP asked_VBD me_PRP that_IN what_WP I_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB and_CC I_PRP told_VBD her_PRP I_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB a_DT Journalist_NNP ._.
I_PRP remember_VBP she_PRP told_VBD me_PRP that_WDT do_VBP it_PRP hard_JJ wharever_NN I_PRP do_VBP because_IN she_PRP thought_VBD when_WRB she_PRP learn_VBP somthing_VBG that_IN she_PRP want_VBP to_TO was_VBD her_PRP$ happiest_JJS time_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, also_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunities_NNS that_IN they_PRP can_MD get_VB involve_VB the_DT group_NN ._.
In_IN our_PRP$ society_NN ,_, people_NNS need_VBP to_TO live_VB with_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.
If_IN people_NNS live_VBP alone_RB they_PRP can_MD never_RB be_VB happy_JJ and_CC never_RB enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunities_NNS that_IN they_PRP can_MD meet_VB more_JJR people_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Almost_RB young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP belonging_VBG many_JJ kinds_NNS on_IN groups_NNS ,_, suchas_NNS class_NN mates_NNS ,_, church_NN people_NNS ,_, also_RB whatever_WDT they_PRP do_VBP for_IN their_PRP$ habits_NNS ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS might_MD belonging_VBG groups_NNS but_CC according_VBG to_TO research_NN from_IN the_DT Korean-Broadcast_NNP that_IN I_PRP remember_VBP said_VBD compare_VB to_TO young_JJ people_NNS group_NN and_CC old_JJ people_NNS group_NN of_IN book_NN club_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS group_NN have_VBP more_RBR activities_NNS like_IN trip_NN ,_, meeting_NN and_CC discussion_NN ._.
These_DT are_VBP the_DT reason_NN of_IN why_WRB I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT sentence_NN ``_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._. ''_''
Because_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunities_NNS than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
