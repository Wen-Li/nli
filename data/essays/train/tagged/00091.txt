I_PRP partiall_VBP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
It_PRP indeed_RB seems_VBZ that_IN the_DT youth_NN are_VBP more_RBR energetic_JJ and_CC many_JJ new_JJ things_NNS around_IN us_PRP are_VBP created_VBN by_IN them_PRP ,_, however_RB the_DT old_JJ people_NNS also_RB enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN ,_, which_WDT may_MD be_VB no_RB less_JJR than_IN the_DT youth_NN do_VBP ._.
First_RB ,_, we_PRP have_VBP to_TO admit_VB that_IN the_DT youth_NN ,_, due_JJ to_TO their_PRP$ age_NN and_CC physical_JJ strength_NN ,_, are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ to_TO take_VB part_NN in_IN some_DT fierce_JJ and_CC competitive_JJ acitivities_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN football_NN ,_, disco_NN dancing_NN ,_, bungee_NN etc_NN ,_, Therefore_RB ,_, their_PRP$ life_NN are_VBP full_JJ of_IN thrills_VBZ and_CC challenges_VBZ more_RBR probably_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN you_PRP want_VBP to_TO take_VB part_NN in_IN the_DT football_NN game_NN ,_, you_PRP must_MD be_VB strong_JJ ,_, firm_NN ,_, not_RB afraid_JJ of_IN your_PRP$ opponents_NNS no_DT matter_NN how_WRB strong_JJ they_PRP are_VBP ._.
Then_RB you_PRP must_MD strive_VB not_RB to_TO let_VB your_PRP$ goal_NN pass_NN into_IN the_DT opponents_NNS '_POS team_NN ,_, you_PRP also_RB need_VBP to_TO discover_VB or_CC create_VB the_DT best_JJS opportunity_NN for_IN shooting_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, this_DT is_VBZ a_DT good_JJ experience_NN of_IN relaxing_VBG yourself_PRP and_CC acquiring_VBG a_DT sense_NN of_IN accomplishment_NN ._.
Besides_IN the_DT activities_NNS that_WDT are_VBP suitable_JJ for_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ no_DT doubt_NN that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR sensitive_JJ to_TO newly-emerging_JJ things_NNS and_CC terms_NNS ,_, because_IN their_PRP$ knowledge_NN structure_NN is_VBZ not_RB set_VBN ,_, so_IN they_PRP dare_VBP and_CC are_VBP willing_JJ to_TO taste_VB things_NNS that_WDT are_VBP new_JJ to_TO them_PRP ._.
With_IN the_DT development_NN of_IN technology_NN and_CC society_NN ._.
You_PRP can_MD find_VB many_JJ new_JJ terms_NNS such_JJ as_IN cool_JJ ,_, surfing_VBG the_DT internet_NN ,_, iPod_NN ,_, 3x_NN etc_NN ._.
All_DT of_IN these_DT are_VBP created_VBN and_CC used_VBN by_IN the_DT youth_NN for_IN the_DT first_JJ time_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, these_DT does_VBZ n't_RB mean_VB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP nothing_NN to_TO do_VB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ everyday_JJ life_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_JJ the_DT elderly_JJ people_NNS ,_, because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ experience_NN ,_, is_VBZ more_RBR wise_JJ in_IN making_VBG important_JJ decision_NN about_IN what_WP should_MD give_VB up_RP and_CC what_WP should_MD stick_VB on_RP ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, many_JJ successful_JJ investment_NN are_VBP accomplished_VBN by_IN business_NN who_WP has_VBZ rich_JJ experience_NN ._.
So_RB impetus_NN at_IN a_DT time_NN wo_MD n't_RB make_VB them_PRP make_VB wrong_JJ decisons_NNS will_MD cost_VB billions_NNS of_IN money_NN ._.
In_IN summary_NN ,_, the_DT youth_NN and_CC the_DT elderly_JJ have_VBP their_PRP$ own_JJ characteristics_NNS in_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Maybe_RB the_DT previous_JJ like_IN to_TO try_VB something_NN new_JJ and_CC exciting_JJ ,_, the_DT latter_JJ prefer_VBP a_DT calm_NN and_CC rational_JJ way_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
