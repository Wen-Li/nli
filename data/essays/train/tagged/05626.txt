In_IN Japan_NNP ,_, most_JJS of_IN the_DT people_NNS who_WP are_VBP teanager_NN oes_NNS to_TO school_NN ._.
They_PRP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ school_NN life_NN and_CC have_VBP fun_NN with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
By_IN looking_VBG at_IN this_DT stuation_NN ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
The_DT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR enegy_NN than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ._.
However_RB in_IN some_DT countries_NNS ,_, there_EX are_VBP people_NNS who_WP fight_VBP in_IN the_DT war_NN even_RB though_IN they_PRP are_VBP still_RB teenager_NN ._.
