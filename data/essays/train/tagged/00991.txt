Although_IN young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB more_JJR energy_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS for_IN this_DT :_: money_NN and_CC experiences_NNS ._.
To_TO bigin_VB with_IN ,_, the_DT old_JJ people_NNS usually_RB have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ._.
This_DT means_VBZ older_JJR have_VBP more_RBR opptions_NNS to_TO do_VB something_NN than_IN younger_JJR ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, when_WRB we_PRP want_VBP to_TO travel_VB somewhere_RB ,_, the_DT panphlets_NNS of_IN travel_NN for_IN senior_JJ tend_VBP to_TO be_VB costly_JJ than_IN those_DT for_IN family_NN or_CC young_JJ people_NNS ._.
This_DT is_VBZ becouse_NN ,_, the_DT older_JJR have_VBP tendency_NN to_TO eat_VB better_JJR dishes_NNS or_CC ride_VB on_IN more_JJR comfortable_JJ vheicles_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, in_IN general_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS focus_VBP on_IN the_DT cost_NN ._.
We_PRP can_MD also_RB this_DT tendency_NN in_IN panphlets_NNS of_IN travel_NN ._.
This_DT shows_VBZ that_IN the_DT older_JJR can_MD more_RBR flexible_JJ how_WRB to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ money_NN and_CC how_WRB to_TO select_VB their_PRP$ plans_NNS ._.
Next_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR expereinces_NNS than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS which_WDT are_VBP based_VBN on_IN the_DT long_JJ life_NN time_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR possibility_NN to_TO make_VB wrong_JJ dicision_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB we_PRP ca_MD n't_RB decide_VB which_WDT way_NN to_TO choose_VB about_IN something_NN ,_, we_PRP are_VBP often_RB consulted_VBN by_IN older_JJR ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_RB ,_, if_IN we_PRP decide_VBP wrong_JJ way_NN ,_, sometimes_RB we_PRP recieve_VBP inconvenience_NN ._.
This_DT means_VBZ that_IN older_JJR poeple_NN can_MD avoid_VB such_JJ inconvenience_NN by_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ judgement_NN ._.
For_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP take_VBP issue_NN with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS lead_VBP more_JJR enjoyable_JJ life_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Each_DT group_NN of_IN people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN as_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN ._.
