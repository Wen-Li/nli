People_NNS usually_RB say_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP the_DT future_NN of_IN our_PRP$ socieies_NNS ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ because_IN they_PRP have_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN to_TO think_VB about_IN their_PRP$ rest_NN of_IN lives_NNS and_CC their_PRP$ futures_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN opportunities_NNS to_TO learn_VB and_CC try_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB very_RB healthy_JJ to_TO do_VB something_NN hard_JJ thing_NN that_IN they_PRP face_VBP on_IN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR time_NN to_TO consider_VB and_CC already_RB experienced_VBD many_JJ things_NNS that_WDT can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP literally_RB `_`` young_JJ '_'' ,_, so_IN they_PRP have_VBP lots_NNS of_IN time_NN to_TO think_VB about_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Also_RB they_PRP have_VBP much_RB more_RBR opportunities_NNS to_TO learn_VB and_CC try_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP than_IN order_NN people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN dreams_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ futures_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP are_VBP always_RB consider_VB what_WP they_PRP really_RB want_VBP to_TO be_VB ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, they_PRP spend_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO learn_VB new_JJ things_NNS that_IN they_PRP have_VBP never_RB experienced_VBN ,_, but_CC older_JJR people_NNS already_RB experienced_VBD most_JJS of_IN things_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS so_RB not_RB a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS are_VBP left_VBN for_IN them_PRP ._.
In_IN addtion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP enthusiasm_NN to_TO try_VB new_JJ and_CC hard_JJ things_NNS which_WDT can_MD definitly_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Although_IN things_NNS are_VBP hard_JJ and_CC difficult_JJ have_VBP have_VBP youth_NN passion_NN to_TO figure_VB out_RP but_CC old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB really_RB facinated_VBN in_IN difficult_JJ and_CC dangerous_JJ fields_NNS ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP not_RB often_RB healtier_JJ than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB run_VB as_RB fast_RB as_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, although_IN older_JJR people_NNS want_VBP to_TO hike_VB Rocky_NNP Mountain_NNP ,_, they_PRP can_MD afford_VB to_TO hike_VB as_RB much_JJ as_IN they_PRP want_VBP ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP very_RB healthy_JJ to_TO try_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP ,_, even_RB though_IN things_NNS are_VBP very_RB difficult_JJ and_CC dangerous_JJ ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, although_IN they_PRP get_VBP injured_VBN ,_, their_PRP$ bodies_NNS are_VBP easily_RB get_VB better_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS such_JJ as_IN thinking_VBG about_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ,_, learning_VBG new_JJ skills_NNS and_CC experiencing_VBG new_JJ things_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB they_PRP are_VBP heathy_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB these_DT new_JJ experiences_NNS and_CC skills_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
