You_PRP often_RB see_VBP old_JJ people_NNS on_IN the_DT street_NN who_WP are_VBP either_CC angry_JJ ,_, annoyed_JJ or_CC very_RB sad_JJ ._.
By_IN contrast_NN most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS I_PRP know_VBP are_VBP very_RB cheerful_JJ and_CC relaxed_VBN ._.
Apparently_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP much_JJ happier_JJR than_IN older_JJR ones_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP personally_RB believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Evidently_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR maladies_NNS and_CC painful_JJ physical_JJ problems_NNS ._.
The_DT body_NN gets_VBZ weaker_JJR when_WRB you_PRP become_VBP older_JJR and_CC often_RB causes_VBZ horrible_JJ pains_NNS ._.
Generally_RB speaking_VBG ,_, children_NNS and_CC younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP healthier_RBR and_CC consequntly_RB fitter_RBR ._.
My_PRP$ grandfather_NN for_IN instance_NN ,_, had_VBD belly_NN cancer_NN and_CC therefore_RB did_VBD n't_RB relish_VB eating_VBG anymore_RB ._.
Being_VBG traumatized_VBN by_IN horrible_JJ memories_NNS ,_, many_JJ old_JJ people_NNS get_VBP more_JJR and_CC more_RBR depressed_JJ in_IN their_PRP$ old_JJ age_NN ._.
This_DT causes_VBZ difficulties_NNS that_WDT force_VBP old_JJ people_NNS to_TO renounce_VB many_JJ pleasures_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, it_PRP becomes_VBZ more_JJR and_CC more_RBR difficult_JJ to_TO travel_VB ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS still_RB have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN wishes_NNS and_CC ideas_NNS of_IN what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO accomplish_VB and_CC experience_VB in_IN life_NN ._.
Whereas_IN old_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB frustrated_JJ because_IN there_EX is_VBZ nothing_NN new_JJ to_TO discover_VB ._.
They_PRP have_VBP experienced_VBN nearly_RB everything_NN in_IN life_NN and_CC do_VBP n't_RB have_VB any_DT future_JJ plans_NNS ._.
Young_NNP boys_NNS and_CC girls_NNS can_MD look_VB forward_RB and_CC are_VBP still_RB full_JJ of_IN hope_NN ,_, whereas_IN older_JJR people_NNS must_MD look_VB backward_RB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP personlly_RB believe_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ much_RB easier_JJR to_TO be_VB happy_JJ when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
On_IN the_DT one_CD hand_NN ,_, being_VBG young_JJ and_CC fresh_JJ normally_RB leads_VBZ to_TO a_DT happier_JJR life_NN because_IN the_DT body_NN is_VBZ generally_RB fitter_RBR and_CC painless_JJ ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, a_DT child_NN or_CC teenager_NN still_RB has_VBZ the_DT opportunity_NN to_TO discover_VB many_JJ things_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
Given_VBN all_DT of_IN these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP recommend_VBP everyone_NN to_TO learn_VB and_CC experience_VB as_RB many_JJ things_NNS as_IN possiple_NN during_IN his_PRP$ youth_NN ,_, since_IN for_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT pleasures_NNS in_IN life_NN it_PRP will_MD be_VB too_RB late_JJ one_CD day_NN
