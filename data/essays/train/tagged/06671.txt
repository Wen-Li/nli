I_PRP beleve_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, I_PRP have_VBP some_DT points_NNS suggests_VBZ my_PRP$ opinion_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP healthier_JJR bodies_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC this_DT helps_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS to_TO reveal_VB the_DT world_NN by_IN traveling_VBG every_DT year_NN to_TO a_DT new_JJ country_NN with_IN a_DT new_JJ adventures_NNS while_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT ability_NN to_TO travel_VB too_RB much_JJ so_IN they_PRP prefer_VBP staying_VBG at_IN home_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, somebody_NN may_MD say_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD do_VB whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP their_PRP$ sequence_NN days_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP retired_VBN from_IN their_PRP$ works_NNS so_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB busy_JJ ._.
But_CC still_RB young_JJ people_NNS beside_IN working_VBG and_CC getting_VBG tired_JJ they_PRP can_MD go_VB outside_IN every_DT day_NN like_IN shopping_NN going_VBG restaurants_NNS enjoy_VBP playing_VBG many_JJ sports_NNS like_IN tennis_NN ,_, soccer_NN ,_, and_CC basketball_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS 's_POS life_NN is_VBZ so_RB interesting_JJ while_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP so_RB bored_JJ
Third_NNP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT ability_NN to_TO read_VB more_JJR and_CC to_TO reveal_VB new_JJ knowlege_NN ,_, while_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS must_MD wear_VB glasses_NNS and_CC sometimes_RB they_PRP get_VBP confused_VBN to_TO read_VB the_DT words_NNS and_CC to_TO see_VB them_PRP clear_JJ ._.
Also_RB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR angry_JJ and_CC nervous_JJ while_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB ._.
Sadly_RB ,_, every_DT individual_NN will_MD grow_VB and_CC rise_VB till_IN the_DT death_NN ,_, I_PRP mean_VBP that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS will_MD reach_VB the_DT level_NN of_IN eldness_NN ,_, so_IN I_PRP advise_VBP the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN before_IN getting_VBG older_JJR ._.
