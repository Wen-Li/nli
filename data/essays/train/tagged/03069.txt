There_EX are_VBP diffferent_JJ types_NNS of_IN people_NNS and_CC different_JJ life_NN styles_NNS in_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
Answering_VBG such_PDT a_DT quastion_NN of_IN ``_`` do_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ``_`` is_VBZ therefore_RB very_RB hard_JJ ._.
I_PRP personally_RB agree_VBP this_DT claim_NN because_IN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS 's_POS physical_JJ and_CC mental_JJ advantages_NNS ,_, time_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS live_VBP provide_VB more_JJR entertainment_NN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, because_IN of_IN the_DT effects_NNS of_IN passed_VBN years_NNS all_DT humans_NNS become_VBP old_JJ and_CC their_PRP$ physical_JJ atributes_NNS fell_VBD down_RB ,_, for_IN example_NN they_PRP can_MD not_RB run_VB as_RB fast_RB as_IN they_PRP can_MD before_RB ,_, they_PRP need_VBP more_JJR time_NN to_TO sleep_VB any_DT way_NN they_PRP can_MD not_RB do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ._.
their_PRP$ body_NN does_VBZ not_RB let_VB old_JJ people_NNS to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR energy_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP stronger_JJR and_CC they_PRP can_MD spent_VBD more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP ._.
For_IN the_DT reason_NN older_JJR people_NNS lived_VBD their_PRP$ younger_JJR time_NN more_RBR enjoyable_JJ their_PRP$ wish_NN to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP ,_, become_VBP less_RBR important_JJ ._.
Because_IN they_PRP did_VBD these_DT actions_NNS before_IN and_CC they_PRP are_VBP full_JJ of_IN experience_NN ,_, the_DT do_VBP not_RB need_VB to_TO revise_VB these_DT action_NN ._.
On_IN contrary_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR interest_NN on_IN enjoyable_JJ actions_NNS for_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ,_, they_PRP want_VBP to_TO try_VB ,_, they_PRP want_VBP to_TO know_VB consequences_NNS and_CC they_PRP want_VBP to_TO taste_VB all_DT pieces_NNS of_IN life_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, by_IN the_DT time_NN and_CC improved_VBD technology_NN ,_, more_JJR entertaining_JJ enjoyable_JJ conditions_NNS are_VBP provided_VBN to_TO the_DT new_JJ generation_NN ._.
they_PRP have_VBP an_DT option_NN of_IN internet_NN ,_, rapid_JJ transportation_NN oppotunities_NNS to_TO be_VB with_IN people_NNS they_PRP enjoy_VBP besides_IN more_JJR complexes_NNS such_JJ as_IN ;_: sporting_VBG areas_NNS ,_, cinemas_NNS ,_, theathers_NNS provide_VBP young_JJ people_NNS more_RBR places_NNS to_TO spent_VBN their_PRP$ time_NN enjoyable_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, these_DT opppotunities_NNS were_VBD not_RB chances_NNS of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Because_IN they_PRP enjoyed_VBD their_PRP$ life_NN with_IN limited_JJ ways_NNS
to_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN two_CD reasons_NNS that_IN they_PRP have_VBP better_JJR physical_JJ and_CC mental_JJ ability_NN accordong_NN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ,_, also_RB more_RBR opportunities_NNS provided_VBN to_TO them_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP ._.
