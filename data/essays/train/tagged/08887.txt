Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP agree_VBP and_CC disagree_VBP with_IN that_DT statement_NN because_IN sometimes_RB you_PRP can_MD see_VB an_DT old_JJ person_NN is_VBZ enjoying_VBG his_PRP$ \_CD her_PRP$ life_NN and_CC that_IN depend_VBP on_IN his_PRP$ feelings_NNS ,_, money_NN ,_, health_NN ,_, and_CC thinking_VBG about_IN how_WRB he_PRP \_VBD she_PRP is_VBZ going_VBG to_TO spend_VB the_DT rest_NN of_IN her_PRP$ life_NN either_CC in_IN joy_NN or_CC sad_JJ ._.
There_EX are_VBP alot_NNS of_IN people_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP life_NN in_IN different_JJ way_NN ,_, i_FW mean_VB that_IN each_DT person_NN has_VBZ his_PRP$ own_JJ and_CC different_JJ way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
sometimes_RB you_PRP can_MD see_VB old_JJ persons_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN and_CC sometimes_RB you_PRP can_MD find_VB young_JJ persons_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ persons_NNS and_CC as_IN i_FW said_VBD joyness_NN in_IN life_NN differs_VBZ in_IN each_DT one_CD and_CC also_RB it_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN the_DT persons_NNS feeling_NN ,_, money_NN ,_, health_NN ,_, and_CC his_PRP$ way_NN of_IN thinking_NN ._.
you_PRP can_MD see_VB alot_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS who_WP suffer_VBP in_IN life_NN and_CC wish_NN to_TO die_VB ,_, thats_NNS because_IN of_IN lack_NN of_IN one_CD of_IN the_DT four_CD things_NNS i_FW mentioned_VBN above_IN ,_, and_CC sometimes_RB you_PRP can_MD see_VB alot_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS who_WP enjoy_VBP life_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP still_RB young_JJ and_CC being_VBG old_JJ is_VBZ still_RB far_RB away_RB from_IN there_EX life_NN and_CC that_IN they_PRP must_MD spend_VB each_DT second_NN of_IN his_PRP$ life_NN happely_RB and_CC joyfully_RB ._.
Sometimes_RB you_PRP can_MD see_VB old_JJ persons_NNS who_WP suffer_VBP in_IN life_NN and_CC that_DT is_VBZ 70_CD %_NN of_IN them_PRP and_CC thats_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP afraid_JJ from_IN death_NN or_CC they_PRP feel_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP too_RB old_JJ and_CC can_MD not_RB handle_VB and_CC do_VB anything_NN and_CC they_PRP want_VBP other_JJ people_NNS to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN them_PRP like_IN small_JJ childrens_NNS ,_, but_CC still_RB we_PRP can_MD find_VB old_JJ people_NNS who_WP are_VBP happey_NN and_CC they_PRP enjoy_VBP there_EX life_NN alot_NN because_IN its_PRP$ the_DT end_NN of_IN there_EX life_NN and_CC they_PRP have_VBP to_TO pass_VB every_DT minute_NN happy_JJ and_CC that_DT will_MD cause_VB the_DT old_JJ persons_NNS to_TO live_VB longer_JJR ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN the_DT statement_NN could_MD be_VB both_CC agreed_VBD and_CC disagreed_VBD as_IN i_FW mentioned_VBN above_IN and_CC joyness_NN and_CC happiness_NN can_MD be_VB made_VBN by_IN the_DT person_NN him_PRP \_VBD her_PRP$ self_NN ._.
