Do_VB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
To_TO answer_VB this_DT question_NN I_PRP must_MD specify_VB the_DT meaning_NN of_IN ``_`` ENJOY_NNP ''_'' ._.
Enjoy_NN is_VBZ the_DT ability_NN to_TO make_VB the_DT best_JJS possible_JJ use_NN out_IN of_IN a_DT given_VBN situation_NN ._.
Enjoyment_NN to_TO one_CD person_NN might_MD be_VB different_JJ to_TO another_DT ._.
A_DT person_NN might_MD enjoy_VB a_DT particular_JJ thing_NN while_IN the_DT same_JJ thing_NN might_MD be_VB annoying_JJ to_TO another_DT person_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP in_IN a_DT different_JJ mannner_NN than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
To_TO the_DT young_JJ enjoyment_NN might_MD mean_VB partying_VBG ,_, Listening_VBG to_TO Rock_NNP ,_, watching_VBG a_DT horror_NN movie_NN etc_NN ._.
But_CC to_TO the_DT old_JJ enjoyment_NN might_MD mean_VB something_NN else_RB ._.
They_PRP might_MD enjoy_VB visiting_VBG their_PRP$ Grandchildren_NN or_CC might_MD want_VB to_TO visit_VB a_DT park_NN ._.
There_EX is_VBZ enjoyment_NN in_IN both_CC the_DT cases_NNS ._.
Nobody_NN can_MD say_VB that_IN since_IN the_DT young_JJ person_NN went_VBD to_TO the_DT movie_NN he_PRP enjoyed_VBD more_JJR than_IN an_DT old_JJ person_NN who_WP visited_VBD a_DT park_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ a_DT general_JJ misconception_NN that_WDT only_RB young_JJ people_NNS know_VBP how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
The_DT intensity_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN varies_VBZ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT dangerous_JJ roller_NN coster_NN ride_NN may_MD be_VB a_DT pleasurable_JJ experience_NN for_IN some_DT youngester_NN but_CC may_MD not_RB please_VB the_DT elderly_JJ ._.
If_IN you_PRP ask_VBP an_DT elderly_JJ person_NN what_WP makes_VBZ you_PRP happy_JJ or_CC what_WP gives_VBZ you_PRP the_DT most_JJS pleasure_NN or_CC rather_RB what_WP gives_VBZ him_PRP enjoyment_NN he_PRP might_MD disagree_VB with_IN the_DT views_NNS of_IN the_DT young_JJ generation_NN ._.
This_DT does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN what_WP the_DT youngster_NN likes_VBZ should_MD not_RB be_VB classified_VBN as_IN a_DT mode_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
It_PRP means_VBZ that_IN the_DT way_NN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP is_VBZ just_RB different_JJ the_DT way_NN a_DT youngster_NN enjoys_VBZ ._.
Eventually_RB I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO conclude_VB by_IN saying_VBG that_IN I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT topic_NN ``_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._. ''_''
Many_JJ people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN what_WP they_PRP enjoy_VBP the_DT most_RBS should_MD be_VB applicable_JJ to_TO others_NNS as_RB well_RB ._.
But_CC that_DT is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ ._.
People_NNS should_MD understand_VB that_IN the_DT mode_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN for_IN everyone_NN of_IN us_PRP is_VBZ different_JJ and_CC we_PRP should_MD respect_VB that_IN medium_NN whatever_WDT it_PRP may_MD be_VB ._.
