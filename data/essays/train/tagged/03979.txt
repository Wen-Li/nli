The_DT significance_NN difference_NN between_IN how_WRB older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN and_CC young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN is_VBZ another_DT reason_NN why_WRB older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN young_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ ._.
One_CD reason_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS would_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS better_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS would_MD be_VB change_NN in_IN technology_NN ._.

It_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN older_JJR people_NNS to_TO learn_VB it_PRP and_CC enjoy_VB it_PRP with_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.

It_PRP proves_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS could_MD enjoy_VB life_NN better_JJR
As_IN a_DT conclusion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS since_IN they_PRP could_MD enjoy_VB the_DT new_JJ technology_NN ._.
