In_IN day_NN to_TO day_NN life_NN we_PRP see_VBP that_IN people_NNS are_VBP growing_VBG very_RB fast_RB and_CC passing_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS with_IN good_JJ and_CC bad_JJ things_NNS but_CC i_FW agree_VBP the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP having_VBG lot_NN of_IN energy_NN in_IN them_PRP so_RB that_IN they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
In_IN medical_JJ terms_NNS we_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP fresh_JJ because_IN they_PRP are_VBP having_VBG good_JJ nerves_NNS and_CC blood_NN and_CC their_PRP$ body_NN functions_NNS will_MD work_VB with_IN full_JJ enthusiasm_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
If_IN people_NNS grew_VBD older_JJR and_CC older_JJR their_PRP$ body_NN functions_NNS can_MD not_RB work_VB properly_RB ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ life_NN i_FW saw_VBD few_JJ situations_NNS regarding_VBG this_DT ._.
I_PRP will_MD describe_VB some_DT situations_NNS over_IN here_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ street_NN many_JJ people_NNS play_VBP badminton_NN during_IN evenings_NNS that_WDT is_VBZ both_DT young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS ._.
While_IN playing_VBG young_JJ people_NNS will_MD play_VB for_IN lot_NN of_IN time_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS will_MD easily_RB get_VB tried_VBN while_IN playing_VBG because_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB having_VBG that_IN much_JJ energy_NN to_TO play_VB ._.
This_DT shows_VBZ that_IN how_WRB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
From_IN the_DT statement_NN we_PRP can_MD also_RB consider_VB that_DT enjoyment_NN means_VBZ what_WP kind_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN ?_.
It_PRP depends_VBZ on_IN situation_NN ._.
But_CC i_FW can_MD say_VB that_IN whatever_WDT the_DT enjoyment_NN is_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Here_RB we_PRP can_MD can_MD say_VB one_CD thing_NN that_WDT old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP one_CD time_NN young_JJ people_NNS only_RB so_RB they_PRP know_VBP everything_NN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS because_IN they_PRP already_RB passed_VBD over_RP that_DT stages_NNS and_CC they_PRP will_MD also_RB feel_VB that_DT early_JJ age_NN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS are_VBP golden_JJ days_NNS ._.
From_IN the_DT statement_NN my_PRP$ conclusion_NN is_VBZ old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP one_CD time_NN young_JJ people_NNS only_RB so_RB they_PRP know_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP having_VBG lot_NN of_IN energy_NN during_IN their_PRP$ early_JJ stages_NNS and_CC they_PRP can_MD also_RB say_VB that_IN they_PRP enjoyed_VBD a_DT lot_NN while_IN they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
So_RB i_FW can_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
