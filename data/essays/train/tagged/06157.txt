In_IN my_PRP$ view_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ acafeimic_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
Of_IN course_NN there_EX are_VBP some_DT disadvantages_NNS of_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN because_IN it_PRP means_VBZ a_DT greater_JJR investment_NN of_IN time_NN and_CC tuition_NN ._.
Howvever_NNP ,_, there_EX are_VBP even_RB more_RBR compelling_JJ advantages_NNS that_IN I_PRP want_VBP to_TO explain_VB ._.
I_PRP think_VBP broad_JJ knowledge_NN is_VBZ effecticely_RB for_IN many_JJ areas_NNS of_IN the_DT life_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, you_PRP have_VBP a_DT common_JJ core_NN of_IN knowledge_NN with_IN other_JJ students_NNS ._.
If_IN you_PRP are_VBP an_DT international_JJ student_NN you_PRP need_VBP to_TO communicate_VB in_IN many_JJ parts_NNS of_IN life_NN ._.
Broad_NNP knowledge_NN makes_VBZ it_PRP easier_JJR to_TO have_VB an_DT intellectual_JJ exchange_NN with_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.
In_IN opposite_JJ ,_, specialization_NN leads_VBZ to_TO a_DT narrow_JJ view_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
This_DT people_NNS are_VBP not_RB informed_VBN about_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS so_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB share_VB their_PRP$ knowlegde_NN with_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.
An_DT additional_JJ point_NN is_VBZ that_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN increases_VBZ the_DT opportunities_NNS of_IN careers_NNS that_IN you_PRP can_MD choose_VB from_IN during_IN life_NN ._.
From_IN the_DT beginning_NN of_IN their_PRP$ studies_NNS ,_, people_NNS often_RB do_VBP not_RB know_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO make_VB in_IN their_PRP$ futures_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, broad_JJ knowlegde_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS offers_VBZ more_JJR career_NN opportunities_NNS than_IN specialization_NN ._.
Perhaps_RB ,_, it_PRP helps_VBZ or_CC shows_VBZ you_PRP a_DT direction_NN in_IN what_WP their_PRP$ job_NN should_MD be_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, people_NNS often_RB change_VBP their_PRP$ jobs_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ entire_JJ lives_NNS ,_, maybe_RB because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ decision_NN or_CC other_JJ circumstances_NNS ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, broad_JJ knowledge_NN can_MD find_VB another_DT interesting_JJ job_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, you_PRP get_VBP more_JJR opportunities_NNS for_IN leisure_NN time_NN ._.
This_DT means_VBZ ,_, that_IN you_PRP are_VBP interested_JJ in_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS because_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN provides_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN aspects_NNS of_IN life_NN ._.
Later_RB ,_, educated_VBN people_NNS ,_, when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP older_JJR ,_, they_PRP will_MD retire_VB their_PRP$ jobs_NNS so_IN they_PRP can_MD spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN on_IN their_PRP$ hobbies_NNS that_IN they_PRP have_VBP developed_VBN during_IN their_PRP$ studies_NNS of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
In_IN short_JJ ,_, I_PRP think_VBP it_PRP is_VBZ good_JJ to_TO have_VB a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, you_PRP get_VBP exposure_NN to_TO a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, you_PRP can_MD choose_VB between_IN many_JJ careers_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, you_PRP get_VBP a_DT broad_JJ view_NN of_IN leisure_NN time_NN ._.
