I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN which_WDT is_VBZ given_VBN ,_, before_IN ._.
This_DT means_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Because_IN the_DT psychology_NN of_IN youth_NN is_VBZ based_VBN on_IN senses_NNS ,_, feelings_NNS ._.
It_PRP doesn_NN '_'' t_NN look_NN over_IN incidents_NNS ,_, falls_VBZ with_IN completely_RB rational_JJ and_CC logical_JJ eye_NN ._.
If_IN young_JJ people_NNS would_MD weight_VB with_IN rational_JJ eye_NN what_WP they_PRP experiences_NNS have_VBP ,_, they_PRP couldn_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN so_RB good_JJ more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Because_IN they_PRP would_MD see_VB and_CC understand_VB realities_NNS of_IN life_NN ,_, which_WDT are_VBP not_RB so_RB enjoyable_JJ ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS can_MD look_VB over_IN realities_NNS of_IN life_NN with_IN rational_JJ eye_NN ._.
Because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR experiences_NNS than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC choose_VB the_DT rational_JJ way_NN ._.
Their_PRP$ senses_NNS and_CC feelings_NNS are_VBP not_RB stronger_JJR their_PRP$ youths_NNS ._.
We_PRP can_MD see_VB these_DT situations_NNS at_IN the_DT oldest_JJS people_NNS in_IN the_DT most_RBS extreme_JJ fall_NN ._.
Because_IN they_PRP are_VBP closer_RBR to_TO the_DT door_NN of_IN the_DT grab_NN than_IN others_NNS ._.
And_CC nothing_NN can_MD make_VB them_PRP enjoy_VB as_IN before_RB ._.
Opposing_JJ that_IN sometimes_RB we_PRP can_MD meet_VB young_JJ people_NNS which_WDT behave_VBP older_JJR than_IN theirselves_NNS ._.
This_DT means_VBZ ,_, as_IN exceptional_JJ ,_, they_PRP move_VBP more_RBR rational_JJ ,_, more_RBR logical_JJ and_CC serious_JJ than_IN their_PRP$ environments_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, they_PRP think_VBP future_JJ and_CC behave_VB according_VBG to_TO future_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP little_JJ crazier_JJR but_CC this_DT does_VBZ n't_RB affect_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS to_TO the_DT negative_JJ route_NN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD catch_VB the_DT succes_NNS ._.
