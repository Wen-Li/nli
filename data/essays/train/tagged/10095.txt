I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Maybe_RB most_RBS young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP enjoy_VB more_JJR of_IN life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, but_CC it_PRP all_DT depends_VBZ on_IN each_DT individual_NN 's_POS situation_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Some_DT people_NNS say_VBP one_CD must_MD take_VB advantage_NN and_CC enjoy_VB all_DT life_NN can_MD bring_VB when_WRB one_CD is_VBZ young_JJ because_IN once_RB older_JJR ,_, there_EX would_MD be_VB not_RB enough_JJ time_NN and_CC energy_NN to_TO do_VB so_RB ._.
But_CC this_DT is_VBZ not_RB necessarily_RB true_JJ ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ a_DT fact_NN that_IN as_IN people_NNS get_VBP older_JJR ,_, their_PRP$ bodies_NNS get_VBP stiffer_JJR ,_, but_CC if_IN one_CD exercises_VBZ regularly_RB ,_, this_DT wo_MD n't_RB happen_VB as_RB quickly_RB as_IN it_PRP happens_VBZ to_TO people_NNS who_WP do_VBP not_RB exercise_VB at_IN all_DT ._.
And_CC older_JJR people_NNS might_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP many_JJ benefits_NNS that_IN many_JJ younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB ._.
Such_JJ as_IN money_NN ,_, and_CC maturity_NN ._.
One_CD has_VBZ to_TO have_VB financial_JJ backup_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO enjoy_VB some_DT kind_NN of_IN activity_NN because_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT enjoyable_JJ activities_NNS that_IN we_PRP humans_NNS seek_VBP ,_, require_VBP a_DT large_JJ amount_NN of_IN money_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB afford_VB ._.
A_DT person_NN who_WP enjoys_VBZ traveling_VBG ,_, for_IN example_NN ._.
Traveling_VBG requires_VBZ to_TO pay_VB for_IN a_DT variety_NN of_IN advantages_NNS such_JJ as_IN ,_, a_DT place_NN to_TO sleep_VB in_IN (_CD hotels_NNS ,_, resorts_NNS )_VBP ,_, food_NN ,_, souvenirs_NNS ,_, tour_NN ,_, and_CC many_JJ other_JJ activities_NNS one_CD is_VBZ likely_JJ to_TO pursue_VB when_WRB traveling_VBG ._.
One_CD also_RB has_VBZ to_TO possess_VB enough_JJ maturity_NN because_IN only_RB a_DT mature_JJ person_NN can_MD completely_RB enjoy_VB of_IN some_DT specific_JJ activity_NN or_CC action_NN ._.
Since_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP likely_JJ to_TO get_VB into_IN any_DT kind_NN of_IN trouble_NN which_WDT might_MD instantly_RB lead_VB to_TO displeasure_NN and_CC ruin_VB the_DT enjoying_VBG part_NN of_IN any_DT experience_NN ._.
One_CD example_NN might_MD be_VB when_WRB one_CD runs_VBZ out_IN of_IN supplies_NNS when_WRB traveling_VBG again_RB ._.
An_DT older_JJR person_NN is_VBZ more_RBR responsible_JJ and_CC takes_VBZ control_NN over_IN all_DT supplies_NNS and_CC resources_NNS that_WDT might_MD be_VB needed_VBN in_IN any_DT occasion_NN ,_, and_CC enjoy_VB at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ._.
But_CC most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB maintain_VB the_DT balance_NN between_IN enjoying_VBG and_CC controlling_VBG ._.
One_CD young_JJ person_NN might_MD have_VB taken_VBN a_DT certain_JJ amount_NN of_IN money_NN with_IN him_PRP but_CC spent_VBD all_PDT the_DT money_NN on_IN entertainment_NN for_IN example_NN ._.

There_EX are_VBP many_JJ other_JJ examples_NNS proving_VBG that_IN most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
