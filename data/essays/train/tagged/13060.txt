I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN what_WP the_DT statement_NN because_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB mature_JJ enough_JJ to_TO really_RB enjoy_VB what_WP the_DT life_NN offers_VBZ day_NN by_IN day_NN ,_, while_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS can_MD do_VB ._.
Let_VB 's_PRP go_VB to_TO talk_VB about_IN the_DT level_NN of_IN mature_JJ in_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS think_VBP only_RB about_RB materials_NNS things_NNS like_IN cloths_NNS and_CC do_VBP not_RB really_RB pay_VB attention_NN on_IN the_DT other_JJ things_NNS that_WDT are_VBP present_JJ in_IN thier_JJR lifes_NNS ._.
For_IN they_PRP ,_, how_WRB they_PRP look_VBP like_IN is_VBZ most_RBS important_JJ that_IN anything_NN else_RB ._.
They_PRP think_VBP that_IN the_DT cloth_NN can_MD define_VB how_WRB they_PRP are_VBP treated_VBN and_CC how_WRB importan_NN they_PRP are_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, It_PRP aspect_NN doe_NN not_RB have_VB the_DT same_JJ impotant_NN for_IN a_DT old_JJ people_NNS who_WP is_VBZ more_JJR focussed_VBN on_IN see_VB what_WP are_VBP behin_IN the_DT cloth_NN ._.
The_DT old_JJ people_NNS is_VBZ more_RBR interested_JJ in_IN know_VBP the_DT other_JJ person_NN and_CC enjoy_VB it_PRP ._.
Another_DT thing_NN that_IN I_PRP can_MD mention_VB to_TO support_VB my_PRP$ opinion_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS just_RB waste_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN without_IN think_NN on_IN the_DT consecuens_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ behavior_NN ._.
They_PRP want_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lifes_NNS as_IN they_PRP want_VBP and_CC not_RB as_IN they_PRP shoud_VBP ._.
The_DT old_JJ people_NNS ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, have_VBP more_JJR time_NN just_RB to_TO admire_VB what_WP they_PRP have_VBP done_VBN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP done_VBN everything_NN already_RB when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ,_, so_IN their_PRP$ time_NN is_VBZ better_RB invested_VBN ._.
In_IN conclusition_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN considering_VBG the_DT different_JJ interest_NN that_WDT move_VBP to_TO the_DT young_JJ people_NNS and_CC the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ,_, and_CC also_RB their_PRP$ different_JJ level_NN of_IN mature_JJ ,_, the_DT second_JJ ones_NNS have_VBP more_RBR capacity_NN to_TO enjoy_VB more_JJR what_WP the_DT real_JJ life_NN offer_NN and_CC can_MD be_VB able_JJ to_TO notice_VB the_DT beautiful_JJ of_IN the_DT thing_NN that_WDT surraround_VBD them_PRP ._.
