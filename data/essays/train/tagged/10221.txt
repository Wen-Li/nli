Many_JJ people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN professionals_NNS need_VBP to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO succeed_VB in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ careers_NNS ,_, while_IN others_NNS are_VBP convinced_VBN that_IN the_DT broader_JJR knowledge_NN you_PRP have_VBP ,_, the_DT better_JJR ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN a_DT wide_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ the_DT best_JJS option_NN for_IN achieving_VBG a_DT successful_JJ career_NN ._.
There_EX has_VBZ been_VBN a_DT long_JJ debate_NN regarding_VBG this_DT issue_NN and_CC education_NN specialists_NNS gather_VBP in_IN different_JJ conferences_NNS to_TO debate_VB about_IN the_DT diverse_JJ educational_JJ systems_NNS around_IN the_DT world_NN ,_, and_CC analyze_VBP their_PRP$ advantages_NNS and_CC disadvantages_NNS ._.
The_DT current_JJ trend_NN states_NNS that_WDT in_IN order_NN to_TO gain_VB academic_JJ recognition_NN ,_, professionals_NNS need_VBP to_TO specialize_VB as_RB much_JJ as_IN possible_JJ in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_JJ (_NN the_DT more_RBR specific_JJ ,_, the_DT better_JJR )_NN ._.
This_DT specialization_NN implies_VBZ studying_VBG not_RB only_RB a_DT Bachelors_NNP Degree_NNP on_IN the_DT issue_NN selected_VBN ,_, but_CC also_RB Masters_NN courses_NNS and_CC ,_, why_WRB not_RB ,_, PHDs_NNS ._.
Following_VBG this_DT formula_NN ,_, you_PRP could_MD be_VB the_DT most_RBS specialized_VBN person_NN in_IN the_DT world_NN about_IN one_CD specific_JJ area_NN ,_, and_CC you_PRP will_MD get_VB plenty_NN of_IN jobs_NNS related_VBN to_TO the_DT issue_NN ._.
Some_DT oppositors_NNS to_TO the_DT current_JJ vision_NN states_NNS that_WDT nowadays_RB ,_, with_IN all_PDT the_DT fast_JJ changes_NNS that_WDT societies_NNS pass_VBP through_RB ,_, people_NNS need_VBP to_TO be_VB prepared_VBN with_IN a_DT wide_JJ package_NN of_IN tools_NNS and_CC a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO respond_VB quickly_RB to_TO new_JJ challenges_NNS and_CC deal_VB with_IN different_JJ situations_NNS almost_RB everyday_JJ ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ why_WRB they_PRP suggest_VBP that_IN having_VBG as_RB much_JJ knowledge_NN as_IN possible_JJ on_IN different_JJ academic_JJ areas_NNS would_MD help_VB a_DT lot_NN in_IN achieving_VBG a_DT successful_JJ professional_JJ career_NN ._.
I_PRP personally_RB agree_VBP with_IN this_DT second_JJ point_NN of_IN view_NN and_CC with_IN all_PDT the_DT reasons_NNS stated_VBN to_TO support_VB it_PRP ,_, and_CC I_PRP could_MD give_VB some_DT concretes_NNS examples_NNS about_IN my_PRP$ personal_JJ experience_NN in_IN my_PRP$ career_NN that_WDT could_MD help_VB to_TO better_JJR illustrate_VB my_PRP$ position_NN ._.
Even_RB though_IN the_DT first_JJ career_NN that_IN I_PRP studied_VBD was_VBD journalism_NN ,_, after_IN that_IN I_PRP decided_VBD to_TO enroll_VB in_IN a_DT wider_JJR subject_NN and_CC I_PRP studied_VBD Sociology_NNP ._.
That_DT second_JJ Degree_NN gave_VBD me_PRP a_DT much_RB broader_JJR approach_NN to_TO social_JJ sciences_NNS and_CC helped_VBD me_PRP to_TO get_VB better_JJR jobs_NNS ,_, because_IN now_RB I_PRP could_MD work_VB not_RB only_RB as_IN a_DT Journalist_NNP ,_, but_CC also_RB as_IN a_DT Sociologist_NN ,_, and_CC both_DT areas_NNS complement_VBP each_DT other_JJ during_IN my_PRP$ daily_JJ routine_NN ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, I_PRP would_MD say_VB that_IN learning_VBG as_RB much_RB as_IN possible_JJ about_IN many_JJ different_JJ topics_NNS could_MD help_VB people_NNS building_VBG a_DT successful_JJ professional_JJ career_NN but_CC ,_, most_RBS importantly_RB ,_, could_MD make_VB them_PRP grow_VB as_IN human_JJ beings_NNS ,_, while_IN learning_VBG new_JJ and_CC diverse_JJ things_NNS every_DT day_NN ._.
