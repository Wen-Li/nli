Many_JJ people_NNS consider_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ,_, but_CC in_IN my_PRP$ openion_NN ,_, to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ better_RBR ._.
There_EX are_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS to_TO support_VB my_PRP$ statement_NN ._.
People_NNS have_VBP broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS can_MD make_VB subject_JJ more_RBR interesting_JJ ,_, broaden_VB their_PRP$ horizon_NN ,_, and_CC have_VBP many_JJ different_JJ perspectives_NNS to_TO watch_VB the_DT world_NN ._.
Although_IN some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN spcialize_NN in_IN one_CD subject_NN will_MD make_VB themself_RB more_RBR professional_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, if_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB pay_VB much_JJ time_NN on_IN their_PRP$ study_NN ,_, or_CC think_VB the_DT subject_NN is_VBZ so_RB boring_JJ ,_, they_PRP still_RB can_MD not_RB make_VB themself_RB professional_JJ ._.
Hence_RB ,_, study_NN in_IN many_JJ kind_NN of_IN academic_JJ subjects_NNS will_MD make_VB people_NNS feel_VB more_JJR interesting_JJ ,_, once_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP what_WP they_PRP read_VBP ,_, then_RB they_PRP will_MD real_RB understand_VB what_WP the_DT book_NN said_VBD ,_, people_NNS still_RB can_MD become_VB professional_JJ ._.
Next_RB ,_, major_JJ in_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ acedemic_JJ subjects_NNS can_MD broaden_VB horizon_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, if_IN people_NNS just_RB major_JJ in_IN one_CD subject_NN ,_, they_PRP only_RB know_VBP the_DT field_NN ,_, but_CC if_IN they_PRP study_VBP in_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, they_PRP may_MD know_VB history_NN ,_, the_DT foreign_JJ language_NN or_CC learn_VB hot_JJ to_TO appreciate_VB the_DT fine_JJ art_NN ,_, they_PRP will_MD not_RB limited_VBN what_WP they_PRP study_VBP ._.
``_`` Enjoy_VB what_WP I_PRP learn_VBP ,_, then_RB I_PRP will_MD become_VB excellent_JJ ._. ''_''
If_IN people_NNS interest_NN in_IN t_NN many_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN subjects_NNS ,_, that_WDT will_MD broaden_VB their_PRP$ vision_NN ,_, and_CC it_PRP could_MD make_VB people_NNS to_TO have_VB different_JJ respects_NNS to_TO watch_VB the_DT wonderful_JJ world_NN ._.
They_PRP may_MD have_VB positive_JJ thinking_NN than_IN those_DT people_NNS specialize_VBP in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ,_, bucause_JJ people_NNS have_VBP broad_JJ knowledge_NN may_MD also_RB have_VB positive_JJ mind_NN ._.
