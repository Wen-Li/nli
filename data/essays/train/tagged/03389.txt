Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP i_FW am_VBP truley_NN agree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN ._.
I_PRP support_VBP this_DT statement_NN because_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP with_IN full_JJ of_IN energies_NNS and_CC power_NN to_TO enjoy_VB and_CC celebarte_VB each_DT of_IN their_PRP$ day_NN as_IN a_DT festiwal_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrast_NN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP little_JJ energy_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
As_IN time_NN paases_VBZ the_DT old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP become_VBN less_RBR energetic_JJ ,_, emotionally_RB weak_JJ and_CC depend_VB on_IN young_JJ people_NNS in_IN every_DT aspect_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
another_DT reason_NN ,_, i_FW support_NN this_DT statement_NN is_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP full_JJ of_IN sprits_NNS as_IN they_PRP have_VBP not_RB seen_VBN the_DT hardships_NNS of_IN life_NN and_CC they_PRP have_VBP the_DT companion_NN or_CC a_DT partner_NN to_TO enjoy_VB with_IN them_PRP ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP seen_VBN many_JJ problems_NNS and_CC they_PRP usually_RB stay_VBP alone_RB as_IN their_PRP$ partner_NN are_VBP not_RB with_IN them_PRP or_CC their_PRP$ children_NNS are_VBP far_RB away_RB ._.
They_PRP either_RB are_VBP studying_VBG or_CC they_PRP left_VBD them_PRP alone_RB in_IN long_JJ journey_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
furthermore_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP well_RB in_IN every_DT aspect_NN such_JJ as_IN health_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP also_RB independent_JJ finencially_RB ._.
Whereas_IN old_JJ people_NNS they_PRP are_VBP not_RB healthy_JJ socially_RB and_CC as_RB well_RB as_IN mentally_RB and_CC they_PRP have_VBP to_TO depend_VB finencially_RB on_IN others_NNS ._.
and_CC in_IN the_DT last_JJ i_FW would_MD say_VB because_IN of_IN changing_VBG patterns_NNS of_IN life_NN the_DT true_JJ meanig_NN of_IN enjoyment_NN is_VBZ lost_VBN ._.
now_RB a_DT days_NNS people_NNS are_VBP become_VBN very_RB materialstic_JJ and_CC parctical_JJ and_CC they_PRP try_VBP to_TO within_IN themselves_PRP ._.
But_CC in_IN older_JJR times_NNS people_NNS used_VBN to_TO enjoy_VB with_IN others_NNS and_CC were_VBD very_RB social_JJ ._.
Last_JJ but_CC not_RB the_DT least_JJS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN age_NN is_VBZ not_RB the_DT limitaion_NN ,_, you_PRP should_MD have_VB tendency_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ever_RB aspect_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
And_CC young_JJ people_NNS should_MD take_VB care_NN of_IN their_PRP$ elders_NNS and_CC try_VB to_TO enjoy_VB with_IN them_PRP also_RB
