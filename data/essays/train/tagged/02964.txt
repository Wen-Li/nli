Recently_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP concerned_VBN about_IN how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ youth_NN before_IN they_PRP get_VBP old_JJ and_CC when_WRB they_PRP get_VBP old_JJ ,_, they_PRP want_VBP to_TO have_VB a_DT calm_NN ,_, rest_NN and_CC relaxation_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN and_CC things_NNS that_WDT available_JJ to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, young_JJ means_NNS full_JJ of_IN energy_NN ,_, especially_RB in_IN physical_JJ conditions_NNS ._.
Most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT best_JJS or_CC better_JJR body_NN conditions_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
These_DT conditions_NNS make_VBP people_NNS able_JJ to_TO do_VB many_JJ things_NNS like_IN studying_VBG ,_, playing_VBG sports_NNS ,_, drinking_VBG alcohols_NNS and_CC etc_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB sportsmen_NNS get_VBP old_JJ nearly_RB 40_CD ,_, they_PRP usually_RB retire_VBP because_IN their_PRP$ physical_JJ conditions_NNS are_VBP not_RB strong_JJ enough_RB to_TO continue_VB that_IN job_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, when_WRB people_NNS get_VBP older_JJR ,_, they_PRP keep_VBP on_IN destroying_VBG their_PRP$ brain_NN cells_NNS whether_IN they_PRP want_VBP or_CC not_RB ._.
Thus_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN they_PRP are_VBP mostly_RB healier_JJ than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, when_WRB people_NNS are_VBP young_JJ ,_, there_EX is_VBZ so_RB many_JJ opportunities_NNS to_TO them_PRP ._.
Limitation_NN to_TO older_JJR people_NNS in_IN the_DT rollercoaster_JJ can_MD be_VB a_DT good_JJ example_NN for_IN that_DT ._.
Because_IN of_IN young_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD try_VB many_JJ things_NNS even_RB though_IN they_PRP fail_VBP a_DT lot_NN ._.
One_CD more_JJR example_NN can_MD be_VB ,_, availablity_NN in_IN job_NN openings_NNS ._.
Companies_NNS want_VBP young_JJ people_NNS to_TO worl_NN Therefore_RB ,_, young_JJ makes_NNS possible_JJ to_TO do_VB or_CC try_VB many_JJ chances_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP like_VBP to_TO say_VB `_`` enjoy_VB when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ '_'' ,_, where_WRB good_JJ body_NN condition_NN allow_VBP you_PRP to_TO do_VB many_JJ things_NNS and_CC when_WRB so_RB many_JJ chances_NNS open_JJ to_TO young_JJ people_NNS ._.
