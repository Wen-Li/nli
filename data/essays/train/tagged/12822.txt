Certain_JJ people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN some_DT people_NNS disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoying_VBG life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ personal_JJ opition_NN ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP relatively_RB more_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP for_IN several_JJ reasons_NNS according_VBG to_TO the_DT amount_NN of_IN responsibility_NN ,_, energy_NN and_CC time_NN ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT major_JJ reasons_NNS why_WRB younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR poeple_NN do_VBP is_VBZ closely_RB related_JJ to_TO the_DT amount_NN of_IN responsibilities_NNS that_WDT older_JJR people_NNS and_CC younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, getting_VBG older_JJR means_VBZ receiving_VBG more_RBR responsibility_NN ._.
Based_VBN on_IN my_PRP$ personal_JJ experience_NN ,_, as_IN a_DT high_JJ school_NN student_NN ,_, I_PRP used_VBD to_TO play_VB games_NNS ,_, meet_VBP friends_NNS ,_, and_CC did_VBD not_RB worry_VB that_IN much_JJ on_IN my_PRP$ future_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, as_IN I_PRP grow_VBP older_JJR ,_, I_PRP started_VBD to_TO feel_VB pressure_NN ,_, get_VB responsibility_NN and_CC worry_VB about_IN my_PRP$ future_NN which_WDT I_PRP have_VBP to_TO prepare_VB from_IN now_RB on_IN ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Another_DT main_JJ reason_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ based_VBN on_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN energy_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS and_CC old_JJ people_NNS can_MD spend_VB and_CC enjoy_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, based_VBN on_IN my_PRP$ personal_JJ experience_NN ,_, I_PRP used_VBD to_TO eager_JJ to_TO travel_VB and_CC visit_VB foreign_JJ contries_NNS when_WRB I_PRP was_VBD young_JJ ._.
However_RB ,_, as_IN a_DT grow_VBP older_JJR and_CC I_PRP receive_VBP more_RBR responsibility_NN ,_, I_PRP started_VBD to_TO get_VB lazy_JJ about_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, I_PRP put_VBD the_DT studying_VBG primary_JJ than_IN enjoying_VBG my_PRP$ life_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ the_DT reason_NN why_WRB most_RBS parents_NNS sacrify_VBP their_PRP$ enjoy_VB for_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP the_DT responsibility_NN of_IN being_VBG parents_NNS ._.
Last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS ,_, another_DT huge_JJ reason_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ closely_RB connected_VBN with_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN time_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS contain_VBP ._.
As_IN I_PRP stated_VBD above_RB ,_, as_IN people_NNS grow_VBP older_JJR ,_, more_RBR responsibilities_NNS they_PRP get_VBP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS will_MD have_VB less_JJR time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ leisure_NN time_NN ._.
Based_VBN on_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN responsibility_NN ,_, energy_NN and_CC time_NN ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD recommend_VB young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN before_IN they_PRP grow_VBP older_JJR ._.
