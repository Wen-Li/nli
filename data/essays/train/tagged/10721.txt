Some_DT people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowdays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
It_PRP seems_VBZ to_TO me_PRP ,_, however_RB ,_, they_PRP get_VBP to_TO be_VB spending_VBG their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO supporting_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS for_IN this_DT ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, increasingly_RB ,_, in_IN these_DT days_NNS ,_, the_DT school_NN introduced_VBD the_DT social_JJ communication_NN class_NN in_IN the_DT program_NN ,_, and_CC young_JJ students_NNS especially_RB students_NNS in_IN junior_NN hight_NN school_NN and_CC high_JJ school_NN join_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS by_IN cleaning_VBG their_PRP$ town_NN ,_, helping_VBG seniors_NNS and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
It_PRP might_MD be_VB a_DT compulsory_JJ education_NN in_IN the_DT first_JJ place_NN ;_: however_RB because_IN of_IN this_DT educational_JJ system_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP aware_JJ of_IN the_DT importance_NN of_IN this_DT activity_NN ,_, and_CC gradually_RB intended_VBN to_TO join_VB it_PRP afterwards_RB ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP getting_VBG the_DT leader_NN position_NN in_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN communities_NNS to_TO contribute_VB in_IN these_DT days_NNS ._.
In_IN some_DT area_NN in_IN our_PRP$ country_NN ,_, Japan_NNP ,_, there_EX are_VBP some_DT activities_NNS which_WDT put_VBP the_DT the_DT age_NN limit_NN (_CD 25-30_CD year_NN old_JJ )_CD to_TO be_VB a_DT member_NN of_IN social_JJ communities_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB in_IN order_NN to_TO attract_VB the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ,_, some_DT communities_NNS offer_VBP the_DT special_JJ reward_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN paying_VBG the_DT salary_NN or_CC providing_VBG land_NN ._.
Thanks_NNS to_TO these_DT activities_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR getting_VBG involved_VBN and_CC helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS by_IN teaching_VBG sports_NNS ,_, their_PRP$ cultures_NNS ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, in_IN these_DT days_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ frequently_RB mentioned_VBN that_IN now_RB is_VBZ the_DT time_NN of_IN changing_VBG generation_NN in_IN Japan_NNP ._.
As_IN you_PRP may_MD see_VB the_DT election_NN of_IN prime_JJ ministor_NN in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, Mr._NNP Shinzo_NNP Abe_NNP ,_, who_WP is_VBZ the_DT youngest_JJS prime_JJ ministor_NN ,_, was_VBD just_RB elected_VBN few_JJ weeks_NNS ago_RB ._.
Thanks_NNS to_TO this_DT trend_NN ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS positively_RB get_VBP to_TO feel_VB that_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR chance_NN and_CC power_NN to_TO join_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS to_TO achieve_VB and_CC help_VB something_NN more_RBR ,_, even_RB though_IN they_PRP are_VBP too_RB busy_JJ to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO do_VB this_DT kind_NN of_IN voluntieer_NN work_NN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, using_VBG these_DT above_IN reasons_NNS as_IN a_DT basis_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD mention_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowdays_RB have_VBP positive_JJ intention_NN to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
