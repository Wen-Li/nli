The_DT issue_NN of_IN knowing_VBG if_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP is_VBZ a_DT interesting_JJ one_CD ._.
On_IN the_DT one_CD hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP certainly_RB healthier_RBR than_IN the_DT older_JJR ._.
But_CC on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN free_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, my_PRP$ firm_NN belief_NN is_VBZ that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ easily_RB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN for_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS rather_RB than_IN for_IN the_DT older_JJR ones_NNS ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, we_PRP have_VBP to_TO think_VB of_IN the_DT matter_NN of_IN the_DT health_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ an_DT undeniable_JJ fact_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP in_IN general_JJ healthier_JJR than_IN the_DT oldest_JJS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ easily_RB to_TO do_VB exercise_VB when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP have_VB diseases_NNS which_WDT makes_VBZ them_PRP not_RB unable_JJ to_TO do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, if_IN you_PRP really_RB like_IN a_DT sport_NN ,_, you_PRP will_MD be_VB more_RBR able_JJ to_TO practice_VB it_PRP when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB a_DT long_JJ experience_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT whole_NN ,_, youth_NN may_MD be_VB considered_VBN as_IN the_DT time_NN of_IN discoveries_NNS ,_, and_CC there_EX are_VBP different_JJ discoveries_NNS ._.
Some_DT young_JJ people_NNS may_MD want_VB to_TO travel_VB all_DT around_IN the_DT world_NN ,_, for_IN example_NN ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ a_DT fact_NN that_IN generally_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN the_DT youngest_JJS ._.
But_CC actually_RB ,_, it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB matter_VB !_.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP may_MD think_VB that_IN the_DT comfort_NN is_VBZ not_RB a_DT prevalent_JJ point_NN in_IN a_DT trip_NN ._.
Whereas_IN most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, old_JJ people_NNS may_MD have_VB difficulties_NNS to_TO travel_VB a_DT lot_NN ,_, just_RB because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ really_RB exhausting_JJ ._.
Last_JJ but_CC not_RB least_JJS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS may_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS just_RB because_IN they_PRP have_VBP less_RBR things_NNS to_TO matter_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT young_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB worry_VB about_IN his_PRP$ job_NN ,_, about_IN what_WP he_PRP has_VBZ to_TO pay_VB or_CC not_RB each_DT month_NN ._.
A_DT young_JJ person_NN has_VBZ not_RB lived_VBN his_PRP$ life_NN yet_RB ,_, and_CC a_DT lot_NN of_IN opportunities_NNS are_VBP openned_VBN to_TO him_PRP ,_, he_PRP can_MD still_RB decide_VB what_WP is_VBZ life_NN will_MD be_VB ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB often_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT older_JJR ,_, even_RB if_IN it_PRP may_MD appear_VB quite_RB obvious_JJ ._.
There_EX are_VBP also_RB a_DT lot_NN of_IN ways_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP old_JJ ,_, because_IN you_PRP often_RB have_VBP more_RBR free-time_JJ ,_, and_CC you_PRP have_VBP much_JJ experience_NN than_IN the_DT youngest_JJS ._.
You_PRP can_MD see_VB your_PRP$ children_NNS and_CC your_PRP$ children_NNS '_POS children_NNS growing_VBG ,_, and_CC I_PRP think_VBP that_DT is_VBZ one_CD of_IN the_DT beautifulest_NN thing_NN in_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
