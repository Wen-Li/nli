I_PRP strongly_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP a_DT lot_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Even_RB older_JJR people_NNS not_RB have_VBP patience_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
The_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ work_NN also_RB but_CC not_RB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
As_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP too_RB week_NN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO go_VB out_RP side_NN ,_, even_RB if_IN they_PRP stay_VBP at_IN home_NN also_RB as_IN they_PRP are_VBP older_JJR they_PRP are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB as_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
as_IN the_DT people_NNS become_VBP older_JJR they_PRP may_MD get_VB lot_NN of_IN health_NN problems_NNS ,_, if_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB also_RB they_PRP not_RB cause_VB of_IN their_PRP$ age_NN ._.
But_CC unlike_IN th_DT eolder_JJR people_NNS young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP a_DT lot_NN even_RB in_IN work_NN also_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN if_IN there_EX is_VBZ a_DT party_NN going_VBG in_IN a_DT home_NN ,_, let_VB us_PRP take_VB the_DT older_JJR and_CC younger_JJR people_NNS attend_VBP the_DT party_NN ._.
