Some_DT people_NNS may_MD think_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS while_IN others_NNS think_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD really_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN without_IN restraint_NN ._.
I_PRP disagree_VBP to_TO the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN of_IN time_NN constraint_NN ,_, insufficient_JJ money_NN matters_NNS and_CC a_DT sort_NN of_IN the_DT burden_NN such_JJ as_IN study_NN or_CC job_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS generally_RB do_VBP n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ money_NN excluding_VBG small_JJ number_NN of_IN fortunate_JJ people_NNS ._.
Especially_RB in_IN the_DT case_NN of_IN young_JJ students_NNS ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO get_VB the_DT money_NN from_IN the_DT parents_NNS or_CC make_VB money_NN by_IN working_VBG as_IN a_DT part-time_JJ jot_NN ._.
In_IN order_NN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ,_, it_PRP takes_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS would_MD choose_VB traveling_VBG as_IN a_DT way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
To_TO buy_VB airplane_NN ticket_NN or_CC driving_VBG car_NN need_NN fair_JJ amount_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, since_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB afford_VB to_TO pay_VB for_IN travel_NN cost_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN to_TO their_PRP$ wish_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP pressed_VBN to_TO time_NN ._.
In_IN general_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP students_NNS or_CC worker_NN ._.
It_PRP means_VBZ they_PRP belong_VBP to_TO the_DT certain_JJ schools_NNS or_CC workplaces_NNS ._.
In_IN this_DT sense_NN ,_, students_NNS are_VBP pretty_RB much_RB busy_JJ in_IN keeping_VBG up_RP with_IN the_DT course_NN or_CC school_NN work_NN and_CC young_JJ workers_NNS should_MD work_VB on_IN their_PRP$ job_NN at_IN their_PRP$ workplace_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, as_IN a_DT student_NN ,_, I_PRP have_VBP been_VBN always_RB busy_JJ to_TO do_VB homework_NN and_CC I_PRP can_MD not_RB imagine_VB enjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN specially_RB during_IN the_DT semester_NN ._.
Therfore_RB ,_, because_IN of_IN the_DT time_NN constraint_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP many_JJ limitations_NNS on_IN enjoying_VBG themselves_PRP ._.
Third_NNP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP lots_NNS of_IN burden_NN or_CC obligations_NNS compared_VBN to_TO the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ,_, For_IN instance_NN ,_, young_JJ couple_NN who_WP have_VBP two_CD boys_NNS can_MD not_RB relax_VB themselves_PRP or_CC enjoy_VB themselves_PRP even_RB when_WRB they_PRP have_VBP free_JJ time_NN ._.
Taking_VBG care_NN of_IN the_DT chilren_NNS and_CC doing_VBG house_NN chores_NNS can_MD be_VB on-going_JJ job_NN for_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS in_IN the_DT stage_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Besides_IN this_DT ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS by_IN making_VBG money_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, with_IN the_DT burden_NN and_CC obligation_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS who_WP have_VBP family_NN to_TO raise_VB can_MD not_RB find_VB time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP easily_RB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD be_VB the_DT generation_NN to_TO work_VB rather_RB than_IN enjoy_VB ._.
Enjoying_VBG onself_JJ needs_NNS ,_, in_IN general_JJ sense_NN ,_, money_NN ,_, time_NN and_CC freedom_NN of_IN any_DT kind_NN of_IN obligation_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
Considering_VBG the_DT special_JJ nature_NN of_IN life_NN style_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, they_PRP seem_VBP to_TO be_VB more_RBR difficult_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP than_IN older_JJR people_NNS who_WP are_VBP free_JJ of_IN the_DT burden_NN for_IN raising_VBG the_DT children_NNS and_CC then_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN and_CC money_NN to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
