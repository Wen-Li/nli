``_`` Successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS rather_RB than_IN only_RB doing_VBG what_WP they_PRP already_RB know_VB how_WRB to_TO do_VB well_RB ._. ''_''
I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN becasue_NN this_DT is_VBZ a_DT statistic_NN based_VBN statement_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ just_RB a_DT general_JJ idea_NN that_IN somebody_NN has_VBZ put_VBN forth_RB which_WDT does_VBZ not_RB necessarily_RB need_VB to_TO be_VB true_JJ ._.
My_PRP$ opinion_NN is_VBZ that_IN people_NNS can_MD be_VB sucessful_JJ only_RB when_WRB they_PRP work_VBP hard_RB and_CC do_VB what_WP they_PRP are_VBP good_JJ at_IN ._.
People_NNS who_WP know_VBP their_PRP$ work_NN are_VBP better_RBR able_JJ to_TO succeed_VB that_IN the_DT people_NNS who_WP do_VBP not_RB know_VB the_DT material_NN ._.
People_NNS who_WP have_VBP a_DT University_NNP or_CC College_NNP degree_NN on_IN a_DT particular_JJ area_NN of_IN expertise_NN have_VBP a_DT better_JJR chance_NN to_TO succeed_VB in_IN life_NN than_IN the_DT people_NNS who_WP have_VBP not_RB obtained_VBN that_IN certain_JJ degree_NN ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, there_EX will_MD be_VB few_JJ people_NNS who_WP want_VBP to_TO try_VB the_DT material_NN ,_, but_CC becasue_NN they_PRP are_VBP just_RB trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN they_PRP will_MD become_VB better_RBR than_IN the_DT people_NNS who_WP already_RB know_VBP the_DT material_NN ._.
Taking_VBG risks_NNS and_CC trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO turn_VB out_RP better_JJR than_IN what_WP you_PRP are_VBP already_RB do_VB ._.
Suppose_VB there_EX is_VBZ an_DT Art_NNP major_NN who_WP wants_VBZ to_TO ``_`` try_VB new_JJ things_NNS ''_'' in_IN Buisness_NN ._.
Due_JJ to_TO the_DT fact_NN that_IN she_PRP is_VBZ an_DT Art_NNP major_JJ ,_, he_PRP or_CC she_PRP would_MD have_VB to_TO start_VB from_IN the_DT bottom_NN and_CC work_VB their_PRP$ way_NN up_RP ._.
It_PRP would_MD be_VB harder_RBR for_IN them_PRP to_TO cope_VB in_IN the_DT buisness_NN career_NN ._.
They_PRP may_MD be_VB able_JJ to_TO succeed_VB ,_, but_CC they_PRP will_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO give_VB their_PRP$ maximum_JJ potential_NN ._.
They_PRP would_MD give_VB their_PRP$ maximum_JJ potential_NN in_IN Art_NNP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, the_DT person_NN would_MD have_VB a_DT greater_JJR chance_NN of_IN having_VBG a_DT career_NN in_IN Art_NNP rather_RB than_IN Buisness_NN ._.
You_PRP can_MD try_VB new_JJ things_NNS and_CC if_IN you_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO cope_VB up_RP with_IN the_DT work_NN load_NN and_CC if_IN you_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO understand_VB the_DT material_NN ,_, you_PRP may_MD become_VB successful_JJ ._.
The_DT chances_NNS are_VBP ,_, however_RB ,_, that_IN you_PRP would_MD be_VB able_JJ to_TO succeed_VB in_IN what_WP you_PRP do_VBP best_RB ._.
Trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS is_VBZ not_RB a_DT bad_JJ idea_NN ,_, but_CC it_PRP would_MD not_RB take_VB place_NN of_IN what_WP you_PRP originally_RB do_VBP best_JJS ._.
