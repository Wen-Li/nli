Our_PRP$ lives_NNS are_VBP affected_VBN by_IN different_JJ factors_NNS ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT most_RBS important_JJ factors_NNS is_VBZ the_DT age_NN ,_, where_WRB there_EX are_VBP some_DT people_NNS who_WP think_VBP that_IN being_VBG young_JJ is_VBZ better_JJR than_IN being_VBG old_JJ and_CC this_DT what_WP I_PRP am_VBP going_VBG to_TO disscus_NN in_IN my_PRP$ essay_NN ._.
There_EX is_VBZ a_DT statment_NN which_WDT said_VBD ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' and_CC I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN this_DT statment_NN becuse_NN of_IN many_JJ reasons_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_RBR becuse_IN they_PRP still_RB facing_VBG new_JJ things_NNS that_IN they_PRP have_VBP not_RB met_VBN yet_RB and_CC they_PRP still_RB learning_VBG and_CC having_VBG experienses_NNS ,_, however_RB old_JJ people_NNS had_VBD face_NN lot_NN of_IN difficulties_NNS in_IN life_NN so_IN they_PRP are_VBP tierd_JJ and_CC sometime_RB they_PRP might_MD be_VB pesimistic_JJ ._.
Another_DT reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP active_JJ more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS so_IN they_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO do_VB different_JJ activities_NNS that_WDT let_VBP them_PRP enjoy_VB their_PRP$ time_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
More_JJR over_IN ,_, the_DT mental_JJ building_NN of_IN young_JJ and_CC old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Where_WRB young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP differntn_JJ way_NN of_IN thinking_NN and_CC they_PRP take_VBP life_NN as_IN an_DT easy_JJ thing_NN and_CC this_DT might_MD be_VB a_DT reason_NN that_WDT let_VBD them_PRP enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Also_RB the_DT physical_JJ part_NN where_WRB old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ power_NN to_TO face_VB everything_NN ._.
An_DT example_NN might_MD clariffy_VB more_RBR why_WRB I_PRP am_VBP agree_VBP with_IN this_DT statment_NN ._.
If_IN there_EX were_VBD to_TO men_NNS one_CD who_WP is_VBZ 18_CD years_NNS old_JJ and_CC the_DT other_JJ is_VBZ 50_CD years_NNS old_JJ and_CC they_PRP both_DT were_VBD trying_VBG to_TO have_VB a_DT new_JJ experience_NN in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS such_JJ as_IN a_DT sport_NN activity_NN of_IN climbing_VBG mountines_NNS ,_, so_IN the_DT 18_CD years_NNS old_JJ man_NN can_MD do_VB this_DT activity_NN easily_RB and_CC he_PRP is_VBZ adding_VBG something_NN to_TO his_PRP$ life_NN and_CC enjoy_VB his_PRP$ time_NN more_JJR than_IN 50_CD years_NNS old_JJ man_NN ._.
So_RB as_IN we_PRP can_MD see_VB from_IN this_DT simple_JJ example_NN that_IN the_DT physical_JJ apperanse_NN affect_VB their_PRP$ time_NN and_CC activities_NNS ._.
But_CC it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ time_NN and_CC have_VBP fun_NN and_CC this_DT is_VBZ because_IN the_DT best_JJS thing_NN to_TO do_VB to_TO enjoy_VB your_PRP$ life_NN is_VBZ loving_JJ youe_JJ age_NN and_CC never_RB think_VB of_IN it_PRP and_CC take_VB it_PRP as_IN a_DT number_NN not_RB as_IN a_DT problem_NN or_CC a_DT fact_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB that_IN even_RB if_IN I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN this_DT statment_NN it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN when_WRB I_PRP became_VBD older_JJR I_PRP am_VBP not_RB going_VBG to_TO enjoy_VB my_PRP$ life_NN and_CC I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO give_VB advice_NN for_IN all_DT people_NNS around_IN the_DT world_NN that_WDT never_RB take_VBP life_NN as_IN a_DT problem_NN and_CC always_RB see_VBP it_PRP as_IN a_DT piese_NN of_IN cacke_NN ._.
