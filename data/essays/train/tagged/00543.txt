The_DT issue_NN at_IN hand_NN is_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP or_CC not_RB ._.
I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS like_IN life_NN more_RBR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP because_IN of_IN many_JJ reasons_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR person_NN do_VBP because_IN they_PRP know_VBP they_PRP are_VBP much_JJ close_NN to_TO death_NN ._.
They_PRP know_VBP very_RB well_RB the_DT meaning_NN of_IN death_NN and_CC they_PRP will_MD die_VB in_IN anytime_RB ._.
Because_IN of_IN this_DT reason_NN ,_, they_PRP try_VBP to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ rest_NN of_IN life_NN very_RB effectively_RB ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS feel_VBP that_IN they_PRP ever_RB do_VBP n't_RB die_VB and_CC because_IN of_IN this_DT reason_NN they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB aware_JJ the_DT value_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS like_IN life_NN more_RBR than_IN younger_JJR because_IN they_PRP have_VBP many_JJ reasons_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP generally_RB have_VBP children_NNS and_CC a_DT wife_NN ._.
They_PRP need_VBP to_TO care_VB about_IN them_PRP ._.
They_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN because_IN of_IN her_PRP$ family_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB a_DT doughter_NN or_CC son_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP single_JJ ._.
Because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT concrete_JJ reason_NN to_TO glue_NN life_NN ,_, they_PRP do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS because_IN their_PRP$ expectations_NNS from_IN life_NN are_VBP not_RB generally_RB big_JJ ._.
They_PRP generally_RB expect_VBP quiet_JJ place_NN in_IN peace_NN with_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
This_DT is_VBZ enough_RB for_IN them_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, as_IN I_PRP am_VBP a_DT young_JJ man_NN ,_, I_PRP have_VBP many_JJ expectations_NNS from_IN life_NN and_CC if_IN I_PRP do_VBP n't_RB obtain_VB any_DT of_IN them_PRP ,_, I_PRP will_MD easily_RB hate_VB from_IN life_NN and_CC I_PRP will_MD be_VB depresed_VBN ._.
I_PRP expect_VBP a_DT good_JJ job_NN ,_, much_JJ money_NN ,_, brand_NN new_JJ car_NN ._. .._SYM
It_PRP is_VBZ very_RB difficult_JJ to_TO obtain_VB all_DT of_IN them_PRP at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN and_CC due_JJ to_TO these_DT reason_NN most_JJS of_IN time_NN I_PRP do_VBP n't_RB enjoy_VB from_IN life_NN ._.
Ultimately_RB ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP this_DT because_IN ,_, the_DT life_NN will_MD end_VB for_IN them_PRP in_IN a_DT very_RB short_JJ time_NN later_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP many_JJ things_NNS to_TO do_VB and_CC many_JJ people_NNS to_TO care_VB ,_, and_CC they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN expectations_NNS from_IN the_DT life_NN ._.
