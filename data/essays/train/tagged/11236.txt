It_PRP is_VBZ common_JJ to_TO think_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ obvious_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS party_NN a_DT lot_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, that_DT 's_VBZ why_WRB they_PRP seem_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN a_DT lot_NN more_RBR ._.
But_CC ,_, if_IN we_PRP take_VBP a_DT closer_JJR look_NN ,_, is_VBZ it_PRP really_RB true_JJ ?_.
I_PRP 'd_MD tend_VB to_TO disagree_VB with_IN this_DT well_RB broad_JJ idea_NN ,_, and_CC as_IN far_RB as_IN I_PRP am_VBP concerned_JJ ,_, I_PRP 'd_MD say_VB first_JJ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS ceize_VBP the_DT day_NN a_DT lot_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, and_CC then_RB I_PRP 'd_MD like_VB to_TO underline_VB the_DT fact_NN that_IN the_DT age_NN does_VBZ n't_RB matter_VB ,_, that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ the_DT person_NN 's_POS personality_NN which_WDT lead_VBP him_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR or_CC less_RBR ._.
First_RB ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ obvious_JJ to_TO me_PRP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN a_DT lot_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, precisely_RB because_IN they_PRP have_VBP nothing_NN to_TO loose_JJ ._.
They_PRP are_VBP conscious_JJ that_IN they_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO die_VB one_CD day_NN ,_, therefore_RB they_PRP are_VBP living_VBG in_IN the_DT present_JJ ,_, they_PRP are_VBP enjoying_VBG every_DT moment_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS ,_, on_IN the_DT opposite_JJ ,_, are_VBP always_RB making_VBG plans_NNS ,_, thinking_VBG about_IN what_WP they_PRP want_VBP for_IN their_PRP$ future_NN and_CC how_WRB they_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO obtain_VB it_PRP ._.
They_PRP consider_VBP themselves_PRP as_IN immortal_JJ ,_, thus_RB they_PRP are_VBP not_RB really_RB enjoying_VBG the_DT present_JJ time_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS experienced_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN good_JJ and_CC bad_JJ things_NNS and_CC are_VBP now_RB aware_JJ of_IN what_WP makes_VBZ life_NN worth_JJ living_VBG to_TO them_PRP ,_, consequently_RB they_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO really_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
But_CC above_IN all_DT ,_, my_PRP$ opinion_NN is_VBZ that_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ n't_RB a_DT matter_NN of_IN age_NN ._.
Some_DT people_NNS ,_, no_DT matter_NN if_IN they_PRP 're_VBP young_JJ or_CC old_JJ ,_, will_MD always_RB live_VB in_IN the_DT past_NN ,_, mourning_VBG about_IN what_WP happened_VBD to_TO them_PRP ,_, or_CC spending_NN time_NN thinking_VBG about_IN their_PRP$ good_JJ memories_NNS ,_, and_CC as_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, they_PRP will_MD never_RB enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, the_DT real_JJ life_NN that_WDT 's_VBZ going_VBG on_IN before_IN their_PRP$ eyes_NNS ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ why_WRB I_PRP consider_VBP being_VBG able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN as_IN a_DT trait_NN of_IN personnality_NN ,_, which_WDT does_VBZ n't_RB depend_VB on_IN the_DT age_NN of_IN the_DT person_NN but_CC on_IN its_PRP$ ability_NN to_TO be_VB satisfied_VBN with_IN what_WP he_PRP has_VBZ got_VBN ._.
