Do_VB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ?_.
Or_CC does_VBZ age_NN even_RB affect_VB the_DT satisfaction_NN of_IN each_DT individual_NN ?_.
These_DT are_VBP two_CD questions_NNS that_WDT will_MD be_VB discussed_VBN in_IN the_DT following_VBG essay_NN ._.
Several_JJ arguments_NNS will_MD be_VB presented_VBN and_CC evaluated_VBN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, the_DT assumption_NN can_MD be_VB made_VBN that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, especially_RB in_IN Germany_NNP are_VBP offered_VBN more_RBR opportunities_NNS than_IN ealier_JJ generations_NNS could_MD ever_RB experience_VB ._.
The_DT educational_JJ paths_NNS provide_VBP a_DT large_JJ variety_NN to_TO develop_VB oneself_NN and_CC to_TO choose_VB a_DT career_NN that_IN suits_NNS one_CD 's_POS interests_NNS ._.
Next_JJ to_TO the_DT formation_NN of_IN the_DT academic_JJ curriculum_NN ,_, possibilities_NNS to_TO create_VB free-time_JJ activities_NNS are_VBP almost_RB endless_JJ ._.
Should_MD this_DT freedom_NN which_WDT is_VBZ offered_VBN to_TO the_DT young_JJ people_NNS however_RB ,_, have_VBP an_DT influence_NN on_IN how_WRB satisfied_JJ they_PRP are_VBP with_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ?_.
Older_JJR people_NNS in_IN contradicition_NN are_VBP more_RBR limited_JJ concerning_VBG the_DT above_JJ mentioned_VBN aspect_NN ._.
Many_JJ did_VBD not_RB have_VB the_DT possibility_NN to_TO select_VB their_PRP$ work_NN as_RB well_RB as_IN preferred_JJ lifestyle_NN according_VBG to_TO their_PRP$ major_JJ intersts_NNS ,_, due_JJ to_TO the_DT second_JJ worldwar_NN ._.
This_DT issue_NN might_MD lead_VB to_TO the_DT fact_NN that_IN they_PRP regret_VBP that_IN they_PRP were_VBD not_RB offered_VBN such_PDT a_DT large_JJ amount_NN of_IN opportunities_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, health_NN issues_NNS might_MD lower_VB the_DT quality_NN of_IN life_NN with_IN increasing_VBG age_NN ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN the_DT question_NN should_MD not_RB be_VB if_IN older_JJR or_CC younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR ,_, but_CC rather_RB if_IN age_NN is_VBZ one_CD of_IN the_DT significant_JJ factors_NNS that_WDT has_VBZ an_DT influence_NN on_IN overall_JJ satisfaction_NN ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, not_RB age_NN but_CC rather_RB the_DT optimistic_JJ or_CC pessimistic_JJ point_NN of_IN view_NN each_DT individual_NN has_VBZ ,_, decides_VBZ about_IN his_PRP$ or_CC her_PRP$ quality_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
This_DT characteristic_JJ is_VBZ absolutely_RB independent_JJ of_IN age_NN ._.
