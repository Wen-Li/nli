I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN ``_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ''_'' ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT things_NNS ,_, we_PRP enjoy_VBP require_VB novelty_NN ,_, travelling_VBG and_CC friends_NNS ._.
While_IN young_JJ ,_, we_PRP have_VBP the_DT physical_JJ strength_NN to_TO travel_VB around_IN places_NNS ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS travel_VBP little_JJ and_CC that_IN too_RB making_VBG their_PRP$ travel_NN as_IN least_JJS streneous_JJ as_IN possible_JJ ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, they_PRP avoid_VBP exploring_VBG new_JJ and_CC difficult_JJ reaching_VBG places_NNS ._.
Travelling_VBG becomes_VBZ much_RB more_RBR enjoyeable_JJ when_WRB it_PRP involves_VBZ physical_JJ activity_NN and_CC sports_NNS such_JJ as_IN trekking_VBG ,_, mountaineering_VBG etc_NN ,_, which_WDT old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP unable_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB ._.
Visiting_VBG places_NNS may_MD not_RB be_VB as_IN fun_NN to_TO old_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP already_RB have_VBP so_RB much_JJ experience_NN and_CC stand_VB much_RB higher_JJR chance_NN of_IN visiting_VBG the_DT same_JJ place_NN again_RB ._.
Youngs_NNP ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, feel_VBP the_DT excitement_NN of_IN visting_VBG a_DT completely_RB new_JJ place_NN and_CC environment_NN never_RB explored_VBN earlier_JJR ._.
The_DT normal_JJ lives_NNS of_IN young_JJ is_VBZ more_RBR dynamic_JJ as_IN compared_VBN to_TO that_DT of_IN the_DT olds_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP always_RB very_RB special_JJ events_NNS such_JJ as_IN the_DT first_JJ date_NN ,_, marriage_NN ,_, first_JJ child_NN ,_, first_JJ job_NN etc_NN which_WDT keeps_VBZ a_DT young_JJ person_NN lively_JJ ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR prone_JJ to_TO illness_NN and_CC therefore_RB restrict_VBP themselves_PRP to_TO a_DT safe_JJ and_CC secure_JJ environment_NN which_WDT keeps_VBZ them_PRP restricted_JJ to_TO small_JJ vicinity_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS in_IN general_JJ tend_VBP to_TO take_VB little_JJ risk_NN in_IN whatever_WDT they_PRP do_VBP ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, planning_VBG on-the-move_JJ trips_NNS ._.
Uncertainity_NN adds_VBZ another_DT diminsion_NN to_TO entertainment_NN ,_, and_CC since_IN young_JJ can_MD afford_VB to_TO take_VB such_JJ risks_NNS they_PRP tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB themselves_PRP more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Least_NNP but_CC not_RB the_DT last_JJ ,_, friends_NNS are_VBP very_RB important_JJ element_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS usually_RB tend_VBP to_TO have_VB a_DT wider_JJR friend_NN circle_NN ,_, since_IN they_PRP meet_VBP much_RB more_JJR people_NNS during_IN thier_JJR daily_JJ routine_NN during_IN college_NN ,_, at_IN office_NN place_NN ,_, at_IN clubs_NNS etc_FW ._.
However_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS mostly_RB prefer_VBP to_TO stay_VB at_IN home_NN and_CC therefore_RB have_VBP a_DT limited_JJ frind_NN circle_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP thier_VBN old_JJ friends_NNS but_CC again_RB due_JJ to_TO limitation_NN on_IN frequent_JJ streneous_JJ travel_NN they_PRP get_VBP o_NN meet_VB them_PRP rarely_RB ._.
So_RB all_DT in_IN all_DT we_PRP should_MD try_VB to_TO enjoy_VB as_RB much_JJ as_IN possible_JJ while_IN we_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
We_PRP never_RB know_VBP when_WRB we_PRP would_MD become_VB physically_RB so_RB weak_JJ that_IN we_PRP may_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB ourselves_PRP much_RB ._.
