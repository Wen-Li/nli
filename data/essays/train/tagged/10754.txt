Basically_RB I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
What_WP do_VBP you_PRP think_VB the_DT meaning_NN of_IN `_`` enjoy_VB '_'' ?_.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB more_RBR kinds_NNS of_IN sports_NNS than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP because_IN their_PRP$ physical_JJ condition_NN allows_VBZ more_RBR chance_NN to_TO do_VB like_IN snow_NN board_NN ,_, motorcycle_NN ,_, mountain_NN climbing_NN ,_, sky_NN diving_NN which_WDT are_VBP need_MD more_RBR wild_JJ actions_NNS and_CC physical_JJ abilities_NNS ._.
No_DT one_NN can_MD say_VB old_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB these_DT sports_NNS too_RB ._.
The_DT sports_NNS is_VBZ one_CD of_IN the_DT most_RBS important_JJ way_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG our_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Furthernore_NNP old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP much_RB more_RBR conservative_JJ than_IN young_JJ people_NNS when_WRB they_PRP challenge_VBP something_NN new_JJ in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO consider_VB their_PRP$ family_NN and_CC company_NN before_RB challenging_VBG new_JJ things_NNS ._.
However_RB young_JJ people_NNS feel_VBP more_RBR free_JJ to_TO launching_VBG new_JJ things_NNS ._.
They_PRP are_VBP much_JJ bravier_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS so_IN that_IN they_PRP can_MD experience_VB more_RBR about_IN new_JJ world_NN eventhough_NN they_PRP fail_VBP sometimes_RB ._.
That_DT is_VBZ o.k_NN for_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP plenty_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO recover_VB their_PRP$ fail_VBP or_CC mistakes_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
I_PRP did_VBD n't_RB mean_VB old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN but_CC they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR restriction_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
