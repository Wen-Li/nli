In_IN general_JJ ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP many_JJ opportunities_NNS for_IN einjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP physical_JJ power_NN to_TO play_VB ,_, study_NN ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
However_RB ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS actually_RB enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ peple_NNS do_VBP ._.
This_DT is_VBZ because_IN that_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP advantages_NNS in_IN terms_NNS of_IN time_NN ,_, money_NN ,_, and_CC experience_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN for_IN using_VBG their_PRP$ time_NN for_IN enjoyment_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS need_VBP to_TO work_VB to_TO obtain_VB saraly_JJ and_CC they_PRP have_VBP to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
As_IN they_PRP are_VBP very_RB busy_JJ to_TO work_VB they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB the_DT time_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN enjoyable_JJ ._.
To_TO make_VB matters_NNS worse_RBR ,_, they_PRP need_VBP to_TO rest_VB on_IN holiday_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP often_RB tired_JJ with_IN daly_JJ work_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO work_VB because_IN they_PRP can_MD live_VB with_IN social_JJ security_NN system_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD spend_VB their_PRP$ time_NN for_IN enjoyment_NN instead_RB of_IN work_NN ._.
In_IN Japan_NNP ,_, for_IN instance_NN ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS go_VBP for_IN a_DT trip_NN ,_, concentrate_NN on_IN hobby_NN ,_, excercise_NN in_IN park_NN with_IN thier_JJR friends_NNS ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, I_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS actually_RB enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Second_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, older_JJR people_NNS generally_RB have_VBP the_DT money_NN for_IN enjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN ._.
As_IN I_PRP mentioned_VBD above_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD live_VB with_IN social_JJ security_NN sysem_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD obtain_VB money_NN for_IN living_VBG from_IN government_NN (_CD as_RB least_JJS in_IN my_PRP$ country_NN ,_, Japan_NNP )_CD ._.
The_DT money_NN which_WDT is_VBZ offerd_VBN by_IN government_NN so_RB enough_RB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS can_MD use_VB it_PRP for_IN enjoyment_NN such_JJ as_IN trip_NN or_CC shopping_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, older_JJR older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP experienced_JJ man_NN who_WP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
As_IN they_PRP live_VBP longer_JJR time_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, they_PRP actually_RB know_VBP the_DT way_NN to_TO use_VB the_DT time_NN effectively_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN memories_NNS by_IN which_WDT they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB to_TO talk_VB each_DT other_JJ ._.
They_PRP also_RB have_VBP familes_NNS include_VBP grandson_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN there_EX are_VBP some_DT older_JJR people_NNS who_WP do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN ,_, money_NN ,_, and_CC experience_NN for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
All_DT in_IN all_DT ,_, though_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP advantages_NNS for_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ why_WRB I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
