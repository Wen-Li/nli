I_PRP think_VBP that_IN ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS dont_VBP give_VB enough_JJ time_NN for_IN helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
As_IN the_DT most_JJS people_NNS accept_VBP ,_, the_DT life_NN has_VBZ changed_VBN considerably_RB and_CC this_DT causes_VBZ some_DT changes_NNS on_IN people_NNS characteristics_NNS ._.
The_DT effects_NNS of_IN this_DT change_NN can_MD be_VB seen_VBN on_IN the_DT issue_NN of_IN the_DT helping_VBG the_DT communities_NNS ._.
The_DT following_VBG consideratoins_NNS can_MD be_VB accepted_VBN to_TO as_IN a_DT causes_NNS of_IN this_DT change_NN
Nowadays_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS dont_VBP have_VBP sufficient_JJ amount_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO deal_VB with_IN the_DT social_JJ occurances_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO participate_VB an_DT educational_JJ institution_NN and_CC they_PRP have_VBP study_NN for_IN their_PRP$ courses_NNS and_CC this_DT take_VB a_DT huge_JJ amount_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
For_IN the_DT sake_NN of_IN the_DT success_NN on_IN the_DT life_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO dealt_VBN with_IN their_PRP$ education_NN ,_, After_IN the_DT school_NN life_NN ,_, these_DT people_NNS encounter_VBP a_DT job_NN life_NN and_CC again_RB this_DT period_NN spends_VBZ a_DT too_RB much_JJ time_NN of_IN people_NNS ._.
As_IN we_PRP see_VBP from_IN this_DT life_NN conditions_NNS ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB find_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO take_VB part_NN in_IN social_JJ activities_NNS and_CC they_PRP try_VBP to_TO participate_VB more_JJR preferable_JJ activites_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN ,_,
The_DT second_JJ consideration_NN is_VBZ that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS encounter_VBP a_DT huge_JJ amount_NN of_IN competition_NN at_IN the_DT recent_JJ time_NN ._.
As_IN you_PRP guess_VBP ,_, the_DT high_JJ level_NN of_IN competition_NN affects_VBZ the_DT thinking_NN of_IN the_DT people_NNS and_CC this_DT makes_VBZ people_NNS to_TO less_RBR aware_JJ to_TO issues_NNS that_WDT about_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
In_IN the_DT school_NN life_NN and_CC the_DT job_NN life_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP a_DT big_JJ amount_NN of_IN effort_NN to_TO reach_VB better_JJR position_NN and_CC this_DT increases_VBZ the_DT selfish_JJ level_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
These_DT people_NNS only_RB think_VBP abount_NN better_JJR position_NN ,_, better_JJR education_NN and_CC finally_RB more_JJR money_NN and_CC this_DT is_VBZ the_DT opposite_NN of_IN the_DT expected_VBN results_NNS ._.
Eventually_RB ,_, we_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS will_MD be_VB less_RBR involved_VBN in_IN the_DT issuses_NNS about_IN the_DT social_JJ life_NN at_IN the_DT future_JJ becuse_NN of_IN the_DT recent_JJ life_NN style_NN ._.
The_DT people_NNS who_WP lived_VBD in_IN 1700_CD ,_, less_CC involved_VBN in_IN education_NN and_CC the_DT ecenomy_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, they_PRP were_VBD more_RBR involved_VBN in_IN social_JJ activities_NNS ,_, The_DT level_NN of_IN the_DT competition_NN was_VBD less_RBR at_IN these_DT years_NNS and_CC so_IN people_NNS respected_VBN more_JJR to_TO other_JJ people_NNS and_CC the_DT issues_NNS that_WDT are_VBP anbout_IN the_DT community_NN ._.
We_PRP have_VBP to_TO decrease_VB the_DT level_NN of_IN the_DT competition_NN and_CC the_DT working_VBG time_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO increase_VB the_DT involving_VBG level_NN of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO issues_NNS about_IN the_DT their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
