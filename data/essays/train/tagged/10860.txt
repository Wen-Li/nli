I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP and_CC there_EX are_VBP three_CD main_JJ reasons_NNS why_WRB I_PRP think_VBP so_RB ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, there_EX are_VBP more_RBR tasks_NNS given_VBN to_TO young_JJ people_NNS than_IN to_TO old_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO study_VB in_IN order_NN to_TO go_VB to_TO school_NN and_CC get_VB a_DT good_JJ mark_NN at_IN class_NN ._.
They_PRP also_RB have_VBP to_TO work_VB to_TO make_VB money_NN or_CC to_TO be_VB experienced_VBN enough_RB to_TO get_VB a_DT better_JJR job_NN ._.
Sometimes_RB they_PRP are_VBP too_RB busy_JJ to_TO do_VB something_NN they_PRP really_RB want_VBP ._.
But_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP done_VBN all_PDT the_DT tasks_NNS given_VBN to_TO them_PRP ._.
All_DT they_PRP have_VBP to_TO do_VB is_VBZ to_TO receive_VB a_DT reward_NN and_CC appreciation_NN for_IN their_PRP$ hard_JJ work_NN and_CC achievement_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP wise_JJ enough_JJ to_TO realize_VB what_WP pleases_VBZ them_PRP ._.
In_IN other_JJ words_NNS ,_, they_PRP enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS whereas_IN young_JJ people_NNS often_RB get_VBP stressed_VBN out_RP from_IN living_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR experiences_NNS and_CC clues_NNS about_IN what_WP life_NN and_CC they_PRP know_VBP how_WRB to_TO behave_VB when_WRB they_PRP face_VBP a_DT challenge_NN ._.
Probably_RB the_DT reason_NN why_WRB young_JJ people_NNS think_VBP they_PRP are_VBP struggling_VBG through_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP have_VBP less_RBR experiences_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC panic_NN whenver_NN they_PRP find_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS difficult_JJ ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS know_VBP how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, hoping_VBG young_JJ people_NNS will_MD soon_RB realize_VB what_WP they_PRP figured_VBD out_RP when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, and_CC more_RBR importantly_RB maybe_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP richier_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP worked_VBN hard_JJ and_CC have_VBP earned_VBN money_NN as_IN a_DT result_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD spend_VB money_NN on_IN whatever_WDT they_PRP want_VBP ._.
They_PRP can_MD buy_VB a_DT fancy_JJ car_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD make_VB a_DT beautiful_JJ garden_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP can_MD even_RB give_VB their_PRP$ money_NN to_TO their_PRP$ children_NNS if_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO ._.
Everyone_NN wants_VBZ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN and_CC the_DT only_JJ difference_NN is_VBZ the_DT ways_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
People_NNS can_MD not_RB assume_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN only_RB because_IN they_PRP are_VBP old_JJ and_CC boring_JJ ._.
Obviously_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ things_NNS for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO learn_VB from_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP need_VBP to_TO learn_VB how_WRB to_TO work_VB hard_RB ,_, how_WRB to_TO achieve_VB their_PRP$ goals_NNS ,_, and_CC how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN these_DT questions_NNS will_MD be_VB answered_VBN completely_RB as_IN they_PRP actually_RB get_VBP aged_VBN ._.
