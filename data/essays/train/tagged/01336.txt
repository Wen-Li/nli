Peresonally_RB ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS engjoy_JJ life_NN more_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ to_TO say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
They_PRP engoy_VBP life_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, they_PRP play_VBP some_DT sports_NNS or_CC study_NN various_JJ things_NNS and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
But_CC ,_, generally_RB speaking_VBG ,_, old_JJ people_NNS can_MD do_VB same_JJ things_NNS ,_, too_RB ._.
Therefore_RB we_PRP can_MD not_RB say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR peple_NNS do_VBP ._.
I_PRP think_VBP older_JJR pepole_NN can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, they_PRP do_VBP the_DT things_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS ara_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO do_VB easily_RB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD do_VB luxuary_JJ things_NNS such_JJ as_IN clusing_NN or_CC traveling_VBG all_DT over_IN the_DT world_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP are_VBP more_RBR rich_JJ than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS ._.
Second_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, they_PRP know_VBP the_DT way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN young_JJ peple_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP much_JJ experiense_NN than_IN yonger_JJR people_NNS and_CC they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR favorite_JJ things_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ grandmother_NN takes_VBZ part_NN in_IN various_JJ activity_NN such_JJ as_IN flower_NN arrangement_NN and_CC playing_VBG tenis_NN ._.
That_DT means_VBZ they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN in_IN various_JJ ways_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ money_NN and_CC experiense_NN ._.
