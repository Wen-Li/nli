I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB should_MD give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ comunities_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP a_DT couple_NN of_IN reasons_NNS I_PRP think_VBP this_DT way_NN ._.
Let_VB me_PRP tell_VB you_PRP each_DT reason_NN one_CD by_IN one_CD ._.
First_RB ,_, if_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP chanses_NNS to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD communicate_VB with_IN a_DT variety_NN of_IN people_NNS having_VBG different_JJ social_JJ status_NN and_CC being_VBG different_JJ ages_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS ,_, especially_RB students_NNS ,_, tend_VBP to_TO be_VB together_RB with_IN people_NNS of_IN same_JJ generation_NN ._.
Through_IN communication_NN with_IN people_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD develop_VB their_PRP$ ability_NN of_IN sociality_NN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, elder_JJR peeple_NN would_MD teach_VB them_PRP their_PRP$ communities_NNS traditions_NNS ._.
Accepting_VBG their_PRP$ traditions_NNS are_VBP very_RB important_JJ things_NNS for_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
And_CC ,_, in_IN the_DT future_NN ,_, they_PRP should_MD pass_VB their_PRP$ traditions_NNS to_TO next_JJ genarations_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, if_IN young_JJ people_NNS give_VBP enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD have_VB oppotunities_NNS to_TO donate_VB in_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Larning_VBG donation_NN is_VBZ important_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO learn_VB ideas_NNS of_IN cooperation_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO know_VB well_RB not_RB only_RB their_PRP$ school_NN life_NN and_CC their_PRP$ work_NN life_NN ,_, but_CC also_RB a_DT lot_NN of_IN thing_NN in_IN their_PRP$ communitis_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, these_DT are_VBP reasons_NNS why_WRB I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS should_MD give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ comunities_NNS ._.
