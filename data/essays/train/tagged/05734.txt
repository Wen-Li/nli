It_PRP is_VBZ often_RB said_VBD that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR enjoyable_JJ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR strong_JJ body_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB believed_VBD that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN for_IN the_DT following_VBG two_CD reasons_NNS ;_: they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN and_CC money_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP less_JJR responsibilityfor_NN the_DT society_NN ._.
To_TO begin_VB with_IN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR live_JJ than_IN only_RB three_CD decades_NNS before_IN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP more_RBR chance_NN to_TO attend_VB an_DT activities_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN and_CC money_NN rather_RB than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
It_PRP will_MD be_VB a_DT great_JJ opportunity_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, lots_NNS of_IN activities_NNS center_NN such_JJ as_IN YMCA_NNP are_VBP crowded_VBN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP get_VBP together_RB in_IN that_DT place_NN and_CC learning_VBG other_JJ activities_NNS such_JJ as_IN ballet_JJ ,_, yoga_NN ,_, swimming_NN and_CC card_NN game_NN ._.
Also_RB they_PRP are_VBP spend_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN to_TO travel_VB abroad_RB ._.
Since_IN they_PRP had_VBD no_DT time_NN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ because_IN they_PRP focused_VBD on_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ jobs_NNS ._.
They_PRP might_MD be_VB a_DT less_RBR opportunity_NN to_TO travel_VB abroad_RB ._.
Dong-a_NN ,_, mosr_NN popular_JJ travel_NN company_NN in_IN Korea_NNP ,_, shows_VBZ the_DT evidence_NN ._.
In_IN 2005_CD ,_, traveling_VBG abroad_RB older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP two_CD times_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT criterion_NN was_VBD over_IN 60_CD ages_NNS ._.
Thus_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
On_IN top_NN of_IN that_DT ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR responsibility_NN in_IN their_PRP$ children_NNS and_CC society_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ because_IN almost_RB they_PRP are_VBP not_RB working_VBG reguarly_RB and_CC their_PRP$ children_NNS are_VBP growed_VBN ._.
This_DT means_VBZ older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR responsibility_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, I_PRP can_MD see_VB my_PRP$ grandmother_NN who_WP enjoy_VBP her_PRP$ own_JJ life_NN ._.
She_PRP is_VBZ a_DT important_JJ role_NN in_IN her_PRP$ community_NN ,_, getting_VBG together_RB for_IN friendship_NN ,_, and_CC she_PRP has_VBZ lots_NNS of_IN clubs_NNS such_JJ as_IN golf_NN ,_, dace_NN and_CC music_NN ._.
I_PRP this_DT she_PRP really_RB enjoys_VBZ her_PRP life_NN after_IN working_VBG in_IN a_DT public_JJ department_NN ._.
She_PRP had_VBD been_VBN working_VBG for_IN a_DT public_JJ dapartment_NN fo_NN 30_CD years_NNS ._.
At_IN that_DT time_NN she_PRP never_RB had_VBD a_DT opportunities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB her_PRP$ life_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, recently_RB she_PRP seems_VBZ too_RB young_JJ better_JJR than_IN my_PRP$ mother_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR responsibilities_NNS of_IN society_NN and_CC their_PRP$ chidlren_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
In_IN summary_NN ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB belive_VBP with_IN the_DT statements_NNS that_WDT older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
That_DT is_VBZ because_IN they_PRP have_VBP more_JJR money_NN and_CC time_NN better_RBR that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Also_RB they_PRP have_VBP less_RBR responsibilities_NNS of_IN society_NN and_CC their_PRP$ children_NNS ._.
