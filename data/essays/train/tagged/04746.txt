I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB offer_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Considering_VBG too_RB many_JJ entertainments_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ environment_NN and_CC too_RB many_JJ academic_JJ assignments_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ school_NN ,_, and_CC too_RB less_JJR timie_NN to_TO rest_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS certainly_RB spend_VBP insufficient_JJ time_NN on_IN their_PRP$ community-related_JJ tasks_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ too_RB many_JJ attractive_JJ entertainments_NNS in_IN our_PRP$ modern_JJ society_NN that_WDT make_VBP young_JJ people_NNS indulge_VBP themselves_PRP in_IN these_DT entertainments_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ dewelling_JJ city_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP full_JJ of_IN all_DT kinds_NNS of_IN entertainments_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN pub_NN ,_, movie_NN theaters_NNS ,_, and_CC department_NN stores_NNS ._.
The_DT young_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP their_PRP$ each_DT weekend_NN and_CC holidays_NNS on_IN shopping_NN ,_, seeing_VBG the_DT movies_NNS ,_, and_CC playing_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP less_RBR willingness_NN to_TO devote_VB to_TO their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ a_DT great_JJ number_NN of_IN school_NN assignments_NNS that_WDT prevent_VBP young_JJ people_NNS from_IN attending_VBG community_NN affairs_NNS ._.
Today_NN ,_, young_JJ students_NNS have_VBP more_RBR homework_NN ,_, assignments_NNS ,_, and_CC quizzes_VBZ to_TO complete_VB than_IN before_RB ._.
Because_IN of_IN the_DT more_RBR accessibility_NN of_IN of_IN knowledge_NN and_CC information_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP required_VBN to_TO do_VB more_JJR practice_NN and_CC take_VB more_JJR examinations_NNS during_IN their_PRP$ education_NN ,_, which_WDT reduce_VBP their_PRP$ possibility_NN to_TO join_VB communities_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ lack_NN of_IN enough_JJ resting_VBG time_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS might_MD not_RB have_VB extra_JJ energy_NN to_TO engage_VB in_IN the_DT community_NN affairs_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ country_NN ,_, young_JJ students_NNS have_VBP to_TO attend_VB cram_NN school_NN after_IN formal_JJ school_NN classes_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, they_PRP are_VBP expected_VBN to_TO take_VB various_JJ art_NN or_CC music_NN classes_NNS only_RB because_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS ask_VB them_PRP to_TO do_VB so_RB ._.
In_IN this_DT case_NN ,_, they_PRP could_MD n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO rest_NN ,_, not_RB to_TO mention_VB that_IN they_PRP plan_VBP to_TO help_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
In_IN summary_NN ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP that_IN today_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS give_VBP much_RB less_JJR time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS for_IN several_JJ reasons_NNS ,_, which_WDT may_MD be_VB mentioned_VBN above_RB ,_, too_RB many_JJ time_NN on_IN entertainments_NNS and_CC school_NN assignments_NNS and_CC less_JJR time_NN to_TO rest_NN ._.
