I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN in_IN twenty_CD years_NNS fewer_JJR cars_NNS will_MD be_VB in_IN use_NN than_IN there_EX are_VBP today_NN ,_, because_IN of_IN the_DT importance_NN of_IN cars_NNS as_IN a_DT means_NN of_IN transportation_NN ._.
In_IN a_DT globalized_JJ world_NN cars_NNS have_VBP very_RB much_JJ influence_NN on_IN our_PRP$ whole_JJ life_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP an_DT important_JJ means_NNS of_IN transportation_NN in_IN trade_NN as_RB well_RB as_IN a_DT means_NN of_IN a_DT flexible_JJ lifestyle_NN ._.
Without_IN cars_NNS the_DT exchange_NN of_IN goods_NNS in_IN a_DT globalized_JJ world_NN would_MD be_VB much_RB more_RBR complicated_JJ ._.
Also_RB the_DT exchange_NN of_IN people_NNS ,_, in_IN the_DT sense_NN of_IN employees_NNS and_CC workers_NNS ,_, would_MD be_VB much_RB more_RBR difficulty_NN ._.
Many_JJ people_NNS depend_VBP on_IN their_PRP$ car_NN to_TO reach_VB work_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN people_NNS who_WP are_VBP working_VBG in_IN Frankfurt_NNP or_CC other_JJ big_JJ cities_NNS are_VBP often_RB forced_VBN to_TO drive_VB many_JJ hours_NNS to_TO their_PRP$ place_NN of_IN work_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB afford_VB appartments_NNS in_IN the_DT cities_NNS to_TO life_NN in_IN ._.
Without_IN a_DT car_NN they_PRP would_MD be_VB forced_VBN to_TO move_VB houses_NNS or_CC to_TO find_VB work_NN next_JJ to_TO their_PRP$ home_NN ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ in_IN many_JJ cases_NNS because_IN of_IN the_DT high_JJ unemployment_NN not_RB possible_JJ ._.
Without_IN a_DT car_NN people_NNS would_MD not_RB be_VB flexible_JJ any_DT longer_JJR ._.
They_PRP would_MD be_VB forced_VBN to_TO take_VB the_DT bus_NN or_CC the_DT train_NN ,_, which_WDT are_VBP often_RB overcrowded_JJ ,_, late_JJ and_CC in_IN the_DT case_NN of_IN train_NN in_IN Germanz_NNP very_RB expansive_JJ ._.
The_DT limitation_NN of_IN cars_NNS would_MD have_VB a_DT deep_JJ impact_NN on_IN the_DT whole_JJ society_NN ._.
If_IN there_EX would_MD be_VB less_RBR cars_NNS it_PRP would_MD be_VB necessary_JJ to_TO replace_VB them_PRP by_IN other_JJ sources_NNS of_IN transportation_NN ,_, like_IN trains_NNS or_CC busses_NNS ._.
Today_NN many_JJ cities_NNS lack_VBP the_DT financial_JJ capacities_NNS to_TO finance_VB such_PDT a_DT big_JJ project_NN ._.
Because_IN cars_NNS vary_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ prices_NNS and_CC are_VBP therefore_RB also_RB accesible_JJ for_IN people_NNS with_IN a_DT smaller_JJR amount_NN ,_, many_JJ people_NNS will_MD keep_VB buying_VBG them_PRP in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
To_TO come_VB to_TO a_DT conclusion_NN I_PRP would_MD say_VB that_IN today_NN cars_NNS are_VBP an_DT important_JJ means_NNS of_IN transportation_NN as_RB well_RB as_IN a_DT status_NN symbole_NN ,_, and_CC will_MD therefore_RB increase_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
