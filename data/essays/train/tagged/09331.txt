I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN of_IN that_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
When_WRB we_PRP look_VBP around_IN us_PRP ,_, we_PRP can_MD easily_RB see_VB that_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP walking_VBG around_IN the_DT city_NN ,_, going_VBG to_TO the_DT theatres_NNS ._.
doing_VBG something_NN else_RB ,_, while_IN older_JJR people_NNS staying_VBG at_IN their_PRP$ houses_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP the_DT energy_NN that_IN the_DT young_JJ ages_NNS give_VBP to_TO them_PRP and_CC also_RB as_IN a_DT result_NN of_IN some_DT religious_JJ things_NNS ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS naturally_RB have_VBP the_DT energy_NN to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO more_RBR active_JJ than_IN the_DT olders_NNS ._.
If_IN you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT important_JJ health_NN problems_NNS ,_, you_PRP can_MD walk_VB ,_, run_VB as_RB long_RB as_IN you_PRP want_VBP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP an_DT energy_NN inside_IN them_PRP which_WDT does_VBZ not_RB let_VB them_PRP to_TO be_VB stable_JJ ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ country_NN ,_, Turkey_NNP ,_, we_PRP describe_VBP this_DT situation_NN as_IN `_`` not_RB being_VBG ablo_JJ to_TO fit_VB her_PRP$ \_CD his_PRP$ cup`_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT benefit_NN of_IN this_DT energy_NN ,_, they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD do_VB ._.
Moreover_RB I_PRP greatly_RB believe_VBP that_IN ,_, especially_RB in_IN my_PRP$ country_NN ,_, this_DT situation_NN ,_, that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, is_VBZ a_DT result_NN of_IN some_DT religious_JJ circumstances_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS think_VBP that_IN they_PRP are_VBP close_JJ to_TO death_NN and_CC they_PRP feel_VBP the_DT end_NN of_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
So_IN they_PRP consume_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN especially_RB for_IN praying_VBG and_CC doing_VBG something_NN for_IN the_DT life_NN after_IN death_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS think_VBP that_IN using_VBG their_PRP$ rest_NN of_IN days_NNS for_IN entertainment_NN is_VBZ very_RB disadvantegeous_JJ for_IN them_PRP ._.
However_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB afraid_JJ from_IN death_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB close_VB to_TO death_NN as_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
So_IN they_PRP walk_VBP around_RB ,_, go_VB to_TO discos_NNS ,_, theatres_NNS and_CC they_PRP gain_VBP the_DT taste_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
To_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB clear_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT result_NN of_IN the_DT energy_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP and_CC not_RB to_TO feel_VB themselves_PRP to_TO close_VB to_TO the_DT death_NN ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS live_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR entartainmently_RB than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
