I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS because_IN there_EX are_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS to_TO explain_VB this_DT firstly_RB older_JJR people_NNS health_NN will_MD not_RB be_VB well_RB compared_VBN to_TO youger_VB people_NNS by_IN this_DT most_RBS often_RB they_PRP can_MD not_RB go_VB for_IN out_IN of_IN stations_NNS for_IN picnics_NNS ,_, excertions_NNS or_CC tours_NNS but_CC younger_JJR people_NNS visit_VB all_PDT the_DT places_NNS and_CC enjoy_VB the_DT beauty_NN of_IN atmosphere_NN ._.
They_PRP even_RB learn_VBP how_WRB to_TO survive_VB in_IN different_JJ weather_NN conditions_NNS in_IN future_JJ if_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO face_VB ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB able_JJ to_TO learn_VB new_JJ things_NNS faster_RBR and_CC they_PRP can_MD not_RB able_JJ to_TO update_VB their_PRP$ knowledge_NN as_IN compared_VBN to_TO the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
younger_JJR people_NNS has_VBZ that_DT stability_NN that_IN they_PRP can_MD change_VB themselves_PRP from_IN changing_VBG world_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD even_RB give_VB the_DT world_NN a_DT new_JJ product_NN for_IN changing_VBG world_NN as_IN concerned_JJ to_TO older_JJR people_NNS their_PRP$ brain_NN doesnot_NN work_NN properly_RB after_IN certain_JJ age_NN and_CC they_PRP can_MD not_RB develop_VB new_JJ products_NNS for_IN the_DT changing_VBG world_NN as_IN compared_VBN to_TO younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
Another_DT main_JJ thing_NN about_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP stick_VBP to_TO their_PRP$ old_JJ taste_NN that_WDT doesnt_VBP exist_VBP in_IN the_DT present_JJ life_NN this_DT is_VBZ advantageous_JJ for_IN the_DT youger_NN people_NNS that_IN their_PRP$ tastes_NNS exist_VBP in_IN the_DT present_JJ life_NN and_CC they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS such_JJ as_IN movies_NNS ,_, clubs_NNS ,_, pubs_NNS ._.
But_CC in_IN case_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS they_PRP can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB the_DT tastes_NNS of_IN present_JJ life_NN ._.
younger_JJR people_NNS can_MD participate_VB in_IN sports_NNS such_JJ as_IN cricket_NN ,_, soccer_NN ,_, baseball_NN as_IN it_PRP is_VBZ starting_VBG age_NN for_IN them_PRP but_CC in_IN case_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB possible_JJ for_IN them_PRP because_IN their_PRP$ health_NN conditions_NNS must_MD not_RB satisfy_VB the_DT requirements_NNS of_IN the_DT sports_NNS ._.
In_IN the_DT present_JJ busy_JJ life_NN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO survive_VB the_DT fastness_NN of_IN the_DT current_JJ world_NN as_IN in_IN case_NN of_IN younger_JJR people_NNS they_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO survive_VB and_CC their_PRP$ are_VBP becoming_VBG the_DT creators_NNS of_IN the_DT present_JJ world_NN ._.
For_IN all_PDT this_DT reasons_NNS I_PRP agree_VBP younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
