Well_RB ,_, enjoying_VBG life_NN does_VBZ n't_RB really_RB depend_VB upon_IN how_WRB old_JJ we_PRP are_VBP ,_, provided_VBN ,_, one_CD is_VBZ interested_JJ in_IN giving_VBG time_NN for_IN oneself_NN and_CC one_NN 's_POS joys_NNS ._.
In_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT cases_NNS ,_, yes_UH ,_, it_PRP 's_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN better_JJR than_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS why_WRB this_DT happens_VBZ is_VBZ that_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS generally_RB do_VBP n't_RB have_VB much_JJ of_IN responsibilities_NNS as_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
A_DT school-going_JJ or_CC a_DT college-going_JJ girl_NN has_VBZ only_RB one_CD major_JJ responsibility_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
Thats_NNP is_VBZ to_TO study_VB ._.
Apart_RB from_IN that_DT ,_, she_PRP has_VBZ no_DT tensions_NNS and_CC worries_NNS ,_, usually_RB ._.
Whereas_IN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN responsibilities_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS generally_RB get_VBP busy_JJ with_IN work_NN and_CC responsibilties_NNS concerned_VBN with_IN work_NN apart_RB from_IN the_DT responsibities_NNS at_IN home_NN ._.
Elder_JJR people_NNS get_VBP to_TO manage_VB the_DT family_NN economically_RB also_RB ._.
They_PRP need_VBP to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN every_DT family_NN member_NN and_CC their_PRP$ necessities_NNS ._.
Another_DT important_JJ factor_NN that_WDT refrains_VBZ old_JJ people_NNS from_IN enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, going_VBG out_RP and_CC partying_VBG kind_NN of_IN stuff_NN ,_, is_VBZ expense_NN involved_VBN in_IN these_DT ._.
It_PRP would_MD n't_RB be_VB a_DT big_JJ problem_NN for_IN a_DT 20_CD year_NN old_JJ guy_NN to_TO spend_VB $_$ 20_CD or_CC $_$ 30_CD for_IN a_DT movie_NN or_CC spend_VB more_RBR in_IN a_DT restaurant_NN or_CC a_DT party_NN ._.
But_CC ,_, old_JJ people_NNS ,_, as_IN they_PRP take_VBP the_DT responsibilty_NN of_IN the_DT whole_JJ family_NN ,_, do_VBP n't_RB generally_RB prefer_VBP to_TO spend_VB so_RB much_RB on_IN a_DT so-called_JJ ``_`` luxury_NN ''_'' but_CC will_MD want_VB to_TO spend_VB that_DT money_NN on_IN some_DT useful_JJ item_NN for_IN the_DT house_NN so_IN that_IN everyone_NN is_VBZ benefitted_VBN by_IN their_PRP$ expense_NN ._.
Another_DT factor_NN is_VBZ enthusiasm_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS ,_, usually_RB ,_, are_VBP n't_RB as_IN energetic_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP and_CC so_IN they_PRP ca_MD n't_RB spend_VB much_JJ time_NN spending_VBG much_JJ energy_NN in_IN anything_NN ._.
Whereas_IN youth_NN are_VBP full_JJ of_IN energy_NN and_CC spend_VB more_JJR time_NN having_VBG fun_NN and_CC enjoying_VBG than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, there_EX should_MD be_VB balance_NN in_IN anyone_NN 's_POS life_NN ._.
People_NNS ,_, irrespective_RB of_IN age_NN or_CC financial_JJ status_NN should_MD spend_VB some_DT time_NN having_VBG fun_NN and_CC enjoying_VBG life_NN than_IN spending_VBG most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS dedicated_VBN to_TO work_VB ._.
