Every_DT year_NN we_PRP get_VBP older_JJR and_CC older_JJR and_CC we_PRP do_VBP n't_RB care_VB of_IN the_DT changes_NNS which_WDT happen_VBP ._.
We_PRP often_RB do_VBP n't_RB notice_VB the_DT alteration_NN brought_VBN by_IN the_DT passing_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
But_CC in_IN reality_NN we_PRP should_MD wonder_VB if_IN our_PRP$ life_NN is_VBZ not_RB better_RB when_WRB we_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
Do_VBP n't_RB people_NNS usually_RB think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
In_IN this_DT essay_NN ,_, we_PRP are_VBP first_JJ going_VBG to_TO show_VB the_DT aspects_NNS of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN as_IN an_DT elderly_JJ person_NN and_CC then_RB we_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO talk_VB about_IN life_NN when_WRB we_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
First_RB we_PRP are_VBP considering_VBG the_DT fact_NN if_IN elderly_JJ people_NNS reallz_VBP enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lifes_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT one_CD hand_NN ,_, elderly_JJ people_NNS are_VBP often_RB lonely_JJ and_CC have_VBP few_JJ friends_NNS ._.
They_PRP live_VBP together_RB in_IN special_JJ houses_NNS where_WRB no_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP ._.
People_NNS in_IN such_JJ homes_NNS often_RB lose_VBP their_PRP$ pleasure_NN in_IN life_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP are_VBP disconnected_VBN from_IN the_DT outstanding_JJ world_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN elderly_JJ people_NNS are_VBP less_RBR attractive_JJ than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP also_RB more_RBR health_NN trouble_NN and_CC are_VBP often_RB disprised_JJ by_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS ._.
Additionally_RB ,_, these_DT people_NNS always_RB live_VBP together_RB and_CC see_VB no_DT other_JJ people_NNS ._.
This_DT is_VBZ why_WRB they_PRP also_RB become_VBP more_RBR and_CC more_RBR sad_JJ ,_, because_IN they_PRP notice_VBP that_IN their_PRP$ are_VBP rejected_VBN by_IN society_NN and_CC that_IN nobody_NN cares_VBZ about_IN them_PRP ._.
On_IN the_DT whole_NN I_PRP would_MD say_VB that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB difficult_JJ for_IN elderly_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP often_RB are_VBP very_RB lonely_JJ and_CC have_VBP few_JJ friends_NNS who_WP look_VBP after_IN them_PRP ._.
Now_RB we_PRP are_VBP going_VBG to_TO see_VB that_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ live_JJ ._.
First_RB we_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS meet_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.
They_PRP are_VBP always_RB with_IN friends_NNS ,_, doing_VBG sport_NN ,_, playing_VBG games_NNS or_CC enjoying_VBG their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
A_DT lot_NN of_IN the_DT time_NN is_VBZ spent_VBN in_IN places_NNS where_WRB a_DT lot_NN people_NNS are_VBP and_CC this_DT gives_VBZ those_DT people_NNS the_DT opportunity_NN to_TO meet_VB new_JJ people_NNS ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR attractive_JJ than_IN elderly_JJ people_NNS are_VBP and_CC they_PRP have_VBP no_DT difficulty_NN to_TO find_VB a_DT boy-friend_NN or_CC a_DT girl-friend_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP usually_RB good_JJ looking_VBG which_WDT causes_VBZ that_IN they_PRP can_MD better_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ live_JJ ._.
Thirdly_RB they_PRP are_VBP well-off_JJ ,_, are_VBP in_IN a_DT good_JJ shape_NN and_CC health_NN and_CC they_PRP can_MD do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ._.
Their_PRP$ strength_NN allows_VBZ them_PRP to_TO travel_VB all_DT over_IN the_DT world_NN and_CC see_VB new_JJ places_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB there_EX are_VBP not_RB many_JJ limits_NNS which_WDT prevent_VBP them_PRP from_IN beeing_VBG happy_JJ ,_, because_IN these_DT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT whole_JJ life_NN in_IN front_NN of_IN them_PRP ._.
These_DT people_NNS often_RB do_VBP n't_RB have_VB to_TO worry_VB ,_, because_IN their_PRP$ live_JJ will_MD last_VB for_IN a_DT long_JJ time_NN ._.
To_TO conclude_VB we_PRP see_VBP that_IN ,_, as_IN time_NN goes_VBZ by_IN ,_, we_PRP change_VBP and_CC that_IN these_DT changes_NNS affect_VBP our_PRP$ perception_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
When_WRB we_PRP are_VBP young_JJ we_PRP meet_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS ,_, we_PRP are_VBP more_RBR attractive_JJ and_CC we_PRP are_VBP well-off_JJ ,_, which_WDT are_VBP all_DT things_NNS which_WDT disappear_VBP with_IN the_DT fact_NN of_IN becoming_VBG older_JJR ._.
This_DT is_VBZ why_WRB I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN and_CC find_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
