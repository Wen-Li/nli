Although_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, I_PRP definitely_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB eating_NN ,_, travering_NN ,_, and_CC be_VB health_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD eat_VB and_CC drink_VB a_DT lot_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO eat_VB some_DT great_JJ dishes_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD eat_VB all_DT of_IN them_PRP ._.
They_PRP can_MD satisfy_VB with_IN the_DT experience_NN that_IN they_PRP eat_VBP a_DT lot_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, usually_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB eat_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN food_NN because_IN they_PRP become_VBP full_JJ soon_RB or_CC they_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO eat_VB a_DT lot_NN ._.
Not_RB only_RB can_MD young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP eating_VBG ,_, but_CC also_RB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB travering_VBG ._.
If_IN the_DT person_NN who_WP is_VBZ young_JJ wanted_VBD to_TO go_VB to_TO somewhere_RB ,_, the_DT person_NN could_MD go_VB there_RB soon_RB ._.
The_DT person_NN does_VBZ not_RB need_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN preparation_NN for_IN the_DT trip_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, if_IN the_DT person_NN who_WP is_VBZ old_JJ wanted_VBD to_TO go_VB to_TO trip_NN ,_, the_DT person_NN would_MD need_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO prepare_VB the_DT trip_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP very_RB flexible_JJ and_CC agressive_JJ ._.
These_DT aspects_NNS are_VBP very_RB important_JJ with_IN young_JJ people_NNS ,_, however_RB ,_, healty_JJ is_VBZ the_DT most_RBS important_JJ part_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP suffered_VBN from_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN illnesses_NNS ._.
They_PRP catch_VBP a_DT cold_JJ easily_RB ,_, become_VB tired_JJ soon_RB ,_, and_CC need_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN for_IN their_PRP$ rest_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD not_RB play_VB hard_JJ sports_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP healty_JJ and_CC very_RB agressive_JJ ._.
They_PRP can_MD play_VB hard_JJ sports_NNS like_IN baseball_NN ,_, soccur_NN ,_, swimming_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS recover_VB from_IN illnesses_NNS soon_RB ._.
