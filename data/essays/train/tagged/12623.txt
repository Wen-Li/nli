It_PRP is_VBZ often_RB accepted_VBN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS but_CC I_PRP quite_RB disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT view_NN as_IN it_PRP is_VBZ merely_RB associated_VBN with_IN the_DT concept_NN of_IN having_VBG no_DT responsibility_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, the_DT ways_NNS young_JJ and_CC older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN can_MD be_VB very_RB different_JJ and_CC it_PRP has_VBZ nothing_NN to_TO do_VB with_IN having_VBG responsibilities_NNS or_CC not_RB ._.
As_IN a_DT matter_NN of_IN fact_NN ,_, young_JJ and_CC older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP n't_RB got_VBD access_NN to_TO the_DT same_JJ activities_NNS as_IN they_PRP often_RB depend_VBP on_IN your_PRP$ physical_JJ abilities_NNS ._.
The_DT fact_NN that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP ,_, most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN ,_, healthier_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS means_VBZ that_IN ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS could_MD enjoy_VB playing_VBG a_DT soccer_NN match_NN whereas_IN old_JJ people_NNS could_MD not_RB ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, it_PRP would_MD be_VB harder_RBR for_IN a_DT Senior_JJ to_TO spend_VB every_DT night_NN in_IN clubs_NNS without_IN sleeping_VBG ._.
Fortunately_RB ,_, enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ not_RB restricted_JJ to_TO sport_NN activities_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS could_MD enjoy_VB other_JJ aspects_NNS of_IN life_NN like_IN building_VBG a_DT family_NN ,_, creating_VBG business_NN relationships_NNS ,_, take_VB part_NN to_TO the_DT city_NN or_CC the_DT country_NN social_JJ or_CC political_JJ life_NN ._.
These_DT kind_NN of_IN activities_NNS can_MD definitely_RB bring_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN happiness_NN and_CC maybe_RB more_RBR fulfilling_VBG than_IN simply_RB play_VB tennis_NN or_CC spending_NN nights_NNS in_IN bars_NNS ._.
Another_DT important_JJ aspect_NN is_VBZ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS may_MD value_VB life_NN more_RBR as_IN they_PRP might_MD have_VB been_VBN in_IN contact_NN with_IN death_NN of_IN relatives_NNS ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, they_PRP might_MD even_RB enjoy_VB life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS as_IN they_PRP know_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN is_VBZ limited_VBN ._.
On_IN the_DT contrary_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB in_IN direct_JJ contact_NN with_IN death_NN and_CC just_RB do_VBP not_RB realize_VB what_WP is_VBZ at_IN stake_NN ._.
They_PRP might_MD then_RB just_RB live_VB life_NN as_IN it_PRP comes_VBZ and_CC not_RB get_VB the_DT most_JJS of_IN it_PRP ._.
As_IN a_DT conclusion_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS can_MD both_DT enjoy_VB life_NN in_IN different_JJ manners_NNS ._.
Happiness_NN is_VBZ not_RB a_DT question_NN of_IN age_NN but_CC of_IN perspective_NN and_CC I_PRP am_VBP sure_JJ that_IN anyone_NN ,_, young_JJ or_CC old_JJ can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN if_IN they_PRP are_VBP ready_JJ for_IN it_PRP ._.
