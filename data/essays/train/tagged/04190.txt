Although_IN many_JJ people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR pepole_NN do_VBP ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT following_VBG ,_, I_PRP will_MD give_VB three_CD arguments_NNS for_IN having_VBG this_DT opinion_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, I_PRP want_VBP to_TO mention_VB that_IN many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP retired_VBN ._.
That_DT means_VBZ that_IN they_PRP can_MD organize_VB their_PRP$ pastime_NN as_IN they_PRP like_VBP to_TO ._.
They_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO do_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN activities_NNS for_IN which_WDT they_PRP probably_RB did_VBD n't_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN while_IN working_VBG ._.
Usually_RB ,_, many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN travelling_VBG around_IN the_DT world_NN ,_, learning_VBG a_DT new_JJ language_NN or_CC an_DT instrument_NN ,_, or_CC are_VBP just_RB relaxing_VBG ._.
My_PRP$ grandmother_NN ,_, for_IN instance_NN ,_, enjoys_VBZ her_PRP$ life_NN in_IN the_DT summers_NNS by_IN going_VBG to_TO a_DT lake_NN every_DT day_NN ._.
She_PRP loves_VBZ to_TO be_VB in_IN the_DT nature_NN ,_, to_TO watch_VB the_DT birds_NNS and_CC to_TO swim_VB in_IN the_DT lake_NN ._.
Another_DT point_NN is_VBZ that_IN many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS already_RB made_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN experiences_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
They_PRP will_MD probably_RB not_RB have_VB the_DT feeling_NN like_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP that_IN they_PRP could_MD miss_VB something_NN in_IN daily_JJ life_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP surrounded_VBN by_IN kind_NN of_IN a_DT quiet_JJ mood_NN and_CC can_MD totally_RB concentrate_VB on_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, by_IN contrast_NN ,_, always_RB feel_VBP the_DT pressure_NN and_CC stress_NN that_WDT should_MD become_VB successful_JJ to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN later_RB on_IN ._.
The_DT pressure_NN might_MD be_VB caused_VBN by_IN the_DT expectations_NNS of_IN the_DT educational_JJ system_NN or_CC by_IN the_DT comparison_NN to_TO the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ,_, often_RB parents_NNS or_CC grand-parents_NNS ,_, who_WP were_VBD already_RB successful_JJ in_IN the_DT past_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP often_RB happy_JJ abouth_NN small_JJ things_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
They_PRP often_RB do_VBP n't_RB need_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN material_NN comfort_NN ._.
They_PRP rather_RB appreciate_VBP that_IN they_PRP can_MD still_RB walk_VB around_RB ,_, that_IN they_PRP are_VBP of_IN good_JJ health_NN or_CC that_IN they_PRP have_VBP a_DT family_NN they_PRP can_MD talk_VB to_TO ._.
My_PRP$ grand-parents_NNS ,_, for_IN example_NN ,_, do_VBP n't_RB have_VB a_DT car_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB have_VB to_TO worry_VB about_IN higher_JJR gas_NN prices_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP want_VBP to_TO stress_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP definitely_RB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN the_DT same_JJ as_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
They_PRP just_RB do_VBP it_PRP in_IN another_DT way_NN which_WDT might_MD be_VB hard_JJ for_IN younger_JJR people_NNS to_TO accept_VB ._.
