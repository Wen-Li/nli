Although_IN some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN that_DT ._.
There_EX are_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS for_IN me_PRP to_TO get_VB this_DT opinion_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_RBR experience_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP simply_RB older_JJR ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, when_WRB younger_JJR people_NNS make_VBP holidays_NNS in_IN cities_NNS they_PRP are_VBP often_RB more_RBR interested_JJ in_IN making_VBG party_NN than_IN to_TO get_VB to_TO know_VB more_JJR about_IN the_DT city_NN and_CC its_PRP$ cultural_JJ life_NN ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS spend_VBP more_JJR of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN by_IN learning_VBG something_NN about_IN the_DT place_NN where_WRB they_PRP make_VBP holidays_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS see_VBP much_RB more_JJR of_IN a_DT city_NN when_WRB visiting_VBG it_PRP than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP because_IN for_IN me_PRP it_PRP is_VBZ important_JJ to_TO learn_VB about_IN the_DT cultural_JJ life_NN of_IN the_DT place_NN where_WRB you_PRP in_IN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS because_IN they_PRP have_VBP seen_VBN much_RB more_RBR in_IN their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP often_RB interested_JJ in_IN seeing_VBG much_RB in_IN a_DT short_JJ period_NN of_IN time_NN because_IN in_IN their_PRP$ view_NN they_PRP have_VBP not_RB seen_VBN enough_RB yet_RB ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, in_IN most_JJS cases_NNS older_JJR people_NNS take_VBP much_RB more_JJR time_NN when_WRB they_PRP visit_VBP a_DT museum_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Last_JJ ,_, often_RB old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP saved_VBN a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN while_IN their_PRP$ time_NN as_IN employee_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP much_RB more_JJR money_NN to_TO spend_VB and_CC they_PRP have_VBP not_RB to_TO attach_VB importance_NN on_IN how_WRB to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ money_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, the_DT younger_JJR people_NNS are_VBP at_IN the_DT beginning_NN of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN as_IN employee_NN and_CC so_IN they_PRP have_VBP not_RB earned_VBN much_JJ money_NN that_IN they_PRP could_MD save_VB yet_RB ._.
So_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB able_JJ to_TO waste_VB their_PRP$ money_NN as_IN old_JJ people_NNS can_MD ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, this_DT are_VBP the_DT three_CD reasons_NNS why_WRB I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
