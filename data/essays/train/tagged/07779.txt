The_DT most_RBS fearful_JJ thing_NN that_IN people_NNS think_VBP is_VBZ a_DT death_NN ._.
Then_RB ,_, some_DT people_NNS may_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO live_VB comparing_VBG to_TO older_JJR people_NNS ,_, therefore_RB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ sure_JJ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP high_JJ possibility_NN of_IN death_NN because_IN of_IN various_JJ reasons_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN disease_NN and_CC weakness_NN of_IN their_PRP$ body_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, when_WRB the_DT death_NN comes_VBZ are_VBP unknown_JJ ._.
Probabyly_NNP ,_, a_DT baby_NN which_WDT is_VBZ just_RB born_VBN one_CD hours_NNS ago_RB may_MD be_VB die_VB because_IN of_IN the_DT sudden_JJ accident_NN ._.
Therefore_RB I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN which_WDT is_VBZ ``_`` Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._. ''_''
First_RB ,_, each_DT people_NNS have_VBP a_DT different_JJ situation_NN and_CC environment_NN ._.
These_DT situation_NN and_CC environment_NN have_VBP a_DT great_JJ impact_NN on_IN a_DT person_NN 's_POS life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN a_DT lot_NN of_IN children_NNS dies_VBZ because_IN of_IN disease_NN or_CC lack_NN of_IN foods_NNS in_IN developing_VBG countries_NNS ._.
Their_PRP$ lives_NNS are_VBP quite_RB hard_JJ ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB know_VB if_IN they_PRP can_MD live_VB tomorrow_NN or_CC not_RB ,_, because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB any_DT money_NN and_CC food_NN ._.
They_PRP also_RB have_VBP to_TO work_VB for_IN their_PRP$ family_NN at_IN the_DT young_JJ age_NN ,_, and_CC sometimes_RB ,_, they_PRP sell_VBP their_PRP$ organs_NNS to_TO get_VB money_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP healthier_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, therefore_RB they_PRP have_VBP to_TO earn_VB money_NN ._.
Probably_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS in_IN these_DT situation_NN can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Therefore_RB it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ that_IN all_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN and_CC be_VB able_JJ to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ all_DT time_NN for_IN themelves_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS in_IN developed_JJ countries_NNS may_MD have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN free_JJ time_NN which_WDT they_PRP can_MD use_VB for_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD get_VB money_NN from_IN the_DT government_NN after_IN the_DT decided_VBN age_NN ._.
Therefore_RB they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO work_VB ,_, and_CC they_PRP use_VBP these_DT free_JJ period_NN to_TO do_VB their_PRP$ hobbies_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN sports_NNS ,_, music_NN ,_, games_NNS ._. .._SYM
and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ not_RB true_JJ that_IN all_PDT the_DT old_JJ peple_NN enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, but_CC it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ lives_NNS by_IN arranging_VBG their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
Although_IN their_PRP$ death_NN may_MD be_VB comming_VBG soon_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
As_IN you_PRP read_VBP ,_, if_IN the_DT person_NN can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN or_CC not_RB is_VBZ not_RB depend_VB on_IN their_PRP$ age_NN ,_, but_CC their_PRP$ situation_NN ,_, environment_NN ,_, people_NNS around_IN him_PRP /_: her_PRP$ ..._:
and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
By_IN changing_VBG their_PRP$ situation_NN and_CC way_NN of_IN thinking_NN ,_, people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
