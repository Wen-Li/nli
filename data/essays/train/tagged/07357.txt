People_NNS seldom_RB agree_VBP with_IN each_DT other_JJ ,_, even_RB on_IN the_DT slightly_RB issues_NNS such_JJ as_IN if_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Few_JJ people_NNS claims_VBZ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR awared_JJ of_IN how_WRB to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.

Always_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS could_MD hardly_RB be_VB satisfied_VBN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, young_JJ girls_NNS always_RB not_RB satisfied_VBN with_IN their_PRP$ beauty_NN and_CC young_JJ boys_NNS often_RB think_VBP they_PRP are_VBP not_RB strong_JJ enough_RB ._.
They_PRP do_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN work_NN to_TO ``_`` perfect_JJ ''_'' them_PRP selves_VBZ but_CC in_IN vain_JJ ._.
When_WRB they_PRP are_VBP faced_VBN problems_NNS or_CC decisions_NNS ,_, they_PRP are_VBP always_RB hestitaed_VBN and_CC could_MD not_RB stop_VB looking_VBG for_IN a_DT perfect_JJ solution_NN until_IN they_PRP are_VBP completely_RB tired_VBN and_CC feel_VB frustrated_JJ ._.

In_IN addition_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS always_RB have_VBP a_DT better_JJR financial_JJ condition_NN than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS ,_, for_IN instance_NN ,_, high_JJ school_NN students_NNS still_RB need_VBP parents_NNS to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ daily_JJ life_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN them_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN without_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS '_POS financial_JJ supporting_VBG since_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB earn_VB that_IN much_JJ money_NN ._.

In_IN summary_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR easily_RB satisfied_JJ than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ,_, which_WDT makes_VBZ them_PRP relax_VB and_CC enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
