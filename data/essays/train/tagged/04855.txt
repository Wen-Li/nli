I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD major_JJ reasons_NNS for_IN this_DT claim_NN ._.
At_IN first_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP healthier_RBR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Health_NNP is_VBZ everything_NN for_IN humans_NNS ._.
In_IN fact_NN ,_, if_IN one_CD is_VBZ not_RB healthy_JJ he/she_NN can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN at_IN all_DT ._.
Most_JJS enjoyable_JJ human_JJ activities_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN relationship_NN with_IN the_DT other_JJ sex_NN ,_, eating_NN ,_, doing_VBG fun_NN things_NNS such_JJ as_IN playing_VBG sports_NNS games_NNS ,_, dancing_NN ,_, etc._FW ,_, require_VBP healthy_JJ people_NNS ._.
As_IN humans_NNS age_NN they_PRP lose_VBP their_PRP$ ability_NN to_TO enjoy_VB most_JJS of_IN these_DT activities_NNS as_RB much_RB as_IN they_PRP used_VBD to_TO ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT 70-year-old_JJ man_NN can_MD not_RB eat_VB food_NN that_WDT have_VBP high_JJ calories_NNS and_CC a_DT number_NN of_IN unhealthy_JJ ingredient_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, a_DT 20-year-old_JJ college_NN student_NN can_MD eat_VB from_IN the_DT same_JJ food_NN as_RB much_RB as_IN he_PRP wants_VBZ ,_, and_CC nothing_NN happens_VBZ ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS loose_VBP their_PRP$ enthusiasm_NN to_TO do_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN fun_NN activities_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ financial_JJ risks_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO avoid_VB doing_VBG activities_NNS not_RB only_RB because_IN of_IN the_DT health_NN risk_NN ,_, but_CC also_RB financial_JJ risks_NNS ._.
Unfortunately_RB ,_, most_JJS of_IN the_DT fun_NN activities_NNS in_IN today_NN 's_POS world_NN cost_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN going_VBG for_IN a_DT vacation_NN on_IN an_DT expensive_JJ island_NN ._.
At_IN young_JJ ages_NNS people_NNS do_VBP not_RB think_VB about_IN financial_JJ risks_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ action_NN because_IN they_PRP think_VBP they_PRP have_VBP a_DT long_JJ life_NN to_TO compensate_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS would_MD think_VB that_IN if_IN they_PRP overspend_VBP they_PRP may_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ get_VB a_DT job_NN and_CC work_NN to_TO make_VB up_RP for_IN it_PRP ._.
Although_IN it_PRP may_MD be_VB argued_VBN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS would_MD have_VB more_JJR money_NN to_TO do_VB the_DT expensive_JJ activities_NNS than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP the_DT potential_JJ to_TO work_VB hard_JJ and_CC save_VB enough_JJ money_NN for_IN these_DT activities_NNS ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN as_IN the_DT people_NNS get_VBP older_JJR they_PRP enjoy_VBP the_DT life_NN less_RBR because_IN of_IN a_DT number_NN of_IN limitations_NNS that_WDT aging_VBG brings_VBZ to_TO them_PRP ._.
