Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reasons_NNS for_IN my_PRP$ choice_NN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR healthy_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO learn_VB many_JJ different_JJ things_NNS especially_RB enjoyable_JJ things_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR healthy_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Health_NNP is_VBZ important_JJ for_IN doing_VBG enjoyable_JJ things_NNS ._.
If_IN you_PRP are_VBP not_RB healthy_JJ you_PRP can_MD not_RB work_VB ,_, go_VB to_TO school_NN ,_, watch_VBP TV_NN ._.
Shortly_RB you_PRP can_MD do_VB nothing_NN that_IN you_PRP have_VBP to_TO and_CC of_IN course_NN you_PRP can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB ._.
When_WRB you_PRP go_VBP to_TO a_DT pub_NN ,_, you_PRP dance_VBP and_CC sometimes_RB you_PRP drink_VBP ._.
When_WRB you_PRP dance_VBP you_PRP really_RB get_VB tired_JJ ._.
Dance_NNP needs_VBZ energy_NN and_CC energy_NN is_VBZ in_IN the_DT youth_NN ._.
Also_RB most_JJS of_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO use_VB drugs_NNS and_CC that_IN '_'' s_NNS why_WRB they_PRP can_MD not_RB drink_VB alchol_NN ._.
Another_DT reason_NN ,_, the_DT old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO sleep_VB long_JJ hours_NNS to_TO feel_VB well_RB but_CC the_DT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO have_VB experiments_NNS about_IN everything_NN enjoyable_JJ ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS lived_VBD many_JJ thing_NN and_CC they_PRP do_VBP not_RB want_VB to_TO learn_VB something_NN new_JJ ._.
They_PRP do_VBP just_RB that_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO such_JJ as_IN sleeping_NN ,_, working_VBG ,_, eating_VBG ._.
The_DT old_JJ people_NNS want_VBP to_TO relax_VB ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS climb_VBP mountains_NNS to_TO experince_VB the_DT feeling_NN of_IN affair_NN because_IN the_DT feeling_NN of_IN affair_NN is_VBZ new_JJ for_IN them_PRP ._.
But_CC an_DT old_JJ man_NN does_VBZ not_RB choose_VB to_TO climb_VB a_DT mountain_NN ._.
He_PRP can_MD choose_VB to_TO sit_VB in_IN front_NN of_IN a_DT sea_NN and_CC drink_NN coffee_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP healthy_JJ and_CC willing_JJ to_TO learn_VB new_JJ things_NNS ._.
That_DT '_'' s_NNS why_WRB they_PRP enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
One_CD day_NN the_DT young_JJ peple_NN will_MD be_VB old_JJ ones_NNS and_CC so_IN they_PRP should_MD enjoy_VB now_RB and_CC relax_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
