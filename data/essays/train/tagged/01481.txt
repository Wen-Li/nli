Do_VB younger_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ?_.
This_DT has_VBZ been_VBN much_JJ debated_VBN and_CC in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ,_, the_DT older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN much_RB more_RBR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP several_JJ reasons_NNS to_TO support_VB my_PRP$ reasoning_NN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP lived_VBN most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ years_NNS and_CC have_VBP been_VBN through_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN stress_NN filled_VBN and_CC busy_JJ life_NN ._.
Now_RB its_PRP$ time_NN for_IN them_PRP to_TO sit_VB back_RB and_CC relax_VB and_CC pick_VB up_RP other_JJ activites_NNS for_IN which_WDT they_PRP probably_RB didnt_VBP have_VBP time_NN during_IN their_PRP$ younger_JJR years_NNS ._.
Whereas_IN ,_, the_DT younger_JJR generation_NN is_VBZ more_RBR concerned_JJ with_IN accumulating_VBG more_JJR wealth_NN and_CC improve_VB his_PRP$ career_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, the_DT youth_NN is_VBZ busy_JJ planning_VBG his_PRP$ future_NN and_CC supporting_VBG his_PRP$ family_NN ._.
He_PRP has_VBZ several_JJ worries_NNS and_CC the_DT current_JJ lifestyles_NNS do_VBP not_RB allow_VB him_PRP to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN to_TO the_DT fullest_JJS ._.
He_PRP needs_VBZ to_TO be_VB completely_RB focussed_VBN at_IN his_PRP$ career_NN and_CC compete_VB against_IN each_DT other_JJ ._.
Meanwhile_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS generally_RB have_VBP achieved_VBN most_RBS their_PRP$ goals_NNS from_IN a_DT career_NN point_NN of_IN view_NN ,_, tend_VB to_TO look_VB at_IN life_NN in_IN a_DT more_RBR relaxed_VBN manner_NN ._.
Also_RB ,_, the_DT older_JJR man_NN is_VBZ wiser_JJR and_CC knows_VBZ the_DT importance_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN better_RBR that_IN a_DT younger_JJR person_NN ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO spend_VB their_PRP$ precious_JJ time_NN travelling_VBG across_IN the_DT globe_NN or_CC spending_NN time_NN with_IN family_NN as_IN compared_VBN to_TO younger_JJR people_NNS who_WP are_VBP bound_VBN to_TO their_PRP$ work_NN for_IN most_JJS part_NN of_IN the_DT year_NN ._.
While_IN a_DT few_JJ might_MD argue_VB that_IN the_DT youthful_JJ exuberance_NN would_MD edge_VB out_RP over_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN more_RBR having_VBG achieved_VBN most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ goals_NNS on_IN the_DT professional_JJ front_NN and_CC are_VBP in_IN a_DT better_JJR position_NN to_TO take_VB up_RP new_JJ hobbies_NNS and_CC new_JJ activites_NNS ._.
