Yes_UH i_FW agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statment_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS engoy_JJ life_NN more_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
In_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN i_FW think_VB there_EX are_VBP savrel_JJ reasons_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP less_JJR responsblities_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP not_RB married_VBN which_WDT allow_VBP them_PRP to_TO do_VB things_NNS that_IN it_PRP may_MD be_VB hard_JJ for_IN a_DT person_NN who_WP is_VBZ married_VBN ._.
I_PRP am_VBP for_IN example_NN not_RB married_VBN ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ easy_JJ for_IN me_PRP if_IN want_VBP to_TO visit_VB my_PRP$ freind_NN i_FW could_MD stay_VB in_IN his_PRP$ place_NN and_CC dont_NN wary_JJ about_IN anything_NN ;_: however_RB ,_, if_IN i_FW am_VBP married_VBN and_CC want_VBP to_TO visit_VB my_PRP$ freind_NN i_FW could_MD stay_VB in_IN his_PRP$ place_NN but_CC not_RB for_IN long_JJ time_NN it_PRP would_MD be_VB diffrent_JJ and_CC some_DT what_WDT harder_RBR ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP healthier_RBR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS which_WDT can_MD be_VB a_DT big_JJ factor_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN ._.
Many_JJ people_NNS would_MD agree_VB that_IN a_DT healthy_JJ person_NN can_MD do_VB much_RB more_JJR than_IN a_DT perosn_NN who_WP is_VBZ health_NN is_VBZ not_RB so_RB good_JJ ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, not_RB older_JJR people_NNS would_MD have_VB the_DT phisical_JJ stringh_NN to_TO clime_VB a_DT mountain_NN ,_, yet_RB many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS would_MD have_VB the_DT phisical_JJ stringht_NN to_TO clime_VB a_DT mountain_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, nowdays_RB many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS go_VBP to_TO school_NN and_CC colloges_NNS which_WDT give_VBP them_PRP a_DT chance_NN to_TO meet_VB different_JJ people_NNS and_CC to_TO gain_VB great_JJ experinces_NNS which_WDT is_VBZ very_RB enjoyable_JJ for_IN many_JJ young_JJ people_NNS ._.
I_PRP know_VBP that_IN i_FW do_VBP enjoy_VB going_VBG to_TO school_NN even_RB though_IN it_PRP could_MD be_VB very_RB challaning_JJ sometimes_RB ._.
And_CC that_DT could_MD be_VB another_DT reason_NN why_WRB young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN mroe_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP just_RB things_NNS abou_IN
