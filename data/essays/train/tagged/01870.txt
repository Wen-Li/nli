I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN for_IN a_DT several_JJ reasons_NNS :_:
1._LS One_CD may_MD not_RB success_NN at_IN the_DT first_JJ try_NN ,_, but_CC eventually_RB if_IN one_CD keeps_VBZ trying_VBG ,_, one_CD will_MD encounter_VB success_NN ._.
Unsuccessful_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB realize_VB that_IN success_NN takes_VBZ time_NN and_CC effort_NN ._.
They_PRP want_VBP it_PRP to_TO be_VB done_VBN at_IN the_DT first_JJ time_NN ,_, and_CC that_IN does_VBZ not_RB always_RB happen_VB !_.
There_EX are_VBP several_JJ stories_NNS about_IN inventors_NNS who_WP did_VBD not_RB give_VB up_RP and_CC tried_VBD several_JJ times_NNS ,_, even_RB thousands_NNS of_IN time_NN !_.
The_DT inventor_NN of_IN the_DT light_JJ bulb_NN is_VBZ one_CD that_WDT comes_VBZ to_TO my_PRP$ mind_NN ._.
Imagine_VB what_WP would_MD have_VB happened_VBN if_IN he_PRP would_MD have_VB given_VBN up_RP after_IN all_PDT those_DT tries_VBZ !_.
But_CC he_PRP kept_VBD trying_VBG and_CC trying_VBG until_IN he_PRP did_VBD it_PRP !_.
Of_IN course_NN ,_, that_WDT does_VBZ n't_RB mean_VB to_TO get_VB stuck_VBN with_IN something_NN that_WDT does_VBZ not_RB work_VB ,_, which_WDT takes_VBZ me_PRP to_TO the_DT second_JJ reason_NN why_WRB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
2._LS I_PRP think_VBP successful_JJ people_NNS know_VBP when_WRB to_TO change_VB ,_, or_CC try_VB a_DT different_JJ approach_NN ._.
If_IN something_NN is_VBZ not_RB working_VBG ,_, then_RB know_VB when_WRB to_TO quit_VB and_CC try_VB it_PRP in_IN another_DT way_NN !_.
Do_VBP n't_RB give_VB up_RP but_CC do_VBP n't_RB obsess_VB either_CC ._.
Maybe_RB take_VB a_DT break_NN and_CC look_VB it_PRP at_IN a_DT different_JJ angle_NN ._.
Like_IN the_DT chemist_NN who_WP could_MD not_RB figure_VB out_RP the_DT chemical_NN composition_NN of_IN an_DT element_NN ,_, and_CC discovered_VBD it_PRP during_IN a_DT dream_NN ,_, when_WRB he_PRP dreamed_VBD of_IN a_DT snake_NN biting_VBG its_PRP$ tail_NN ._.
3._LS Life_NN is_VBZ constantly_RB changing_VBG ,_, and_CC one_PRP can_MD not_RB stay_VB the_DT same_JJ without_IN changing_VBG ._.
New_NNP technologies_NNS are_VBP developed_VBN on_IN a_DT daily_JJ basis_NN ,_, and_CC you_PRP can_MD not_RB lock_VB yourself_PRP in_IN a_DT shell_NN and_CC pretending_JJ change_NN is_VBZ not_RB happening_VBG outside_JJ ._.
Whether_IN you_PRP like_IN it_PRP or_CC not_RB ,_, you_PRP have_VBP to_TO try_VB new_JJ things_NNS ,_, or_CC you_PRP 'll_MD stay_VB behind_RB ._.
That_DT 's_VBZ what_WP successful_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
4._LS People_NNS fear_VBP that_IN if_IN they_PRP take_VBP risks_NNS they_PRP will_MD loose_VB the_DT few_JJ things_NNS they_PRP have_VBP now_RB ._.
But_CC they_PRP fail_VBP to_TO realize_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP having_VBG a_DT major_JJ loss_NN with_IN the_DT cost_NN of_IN opportunity_NN for_IN not_RB using_VBG your_PRP$ resources_NNS and_CC take_VB a_DT risk_NN ._.
They_PRP would_MD gain_VB much_RB more_RBR if_IN they_PRP were_VBD willing_JJ to_TO risk_VB what_WP they_PRP have_VBP or_CC their_PRP$ time_NN ._.
5._LS Also_RB ,_, in_IN addition_NN to_TO these_DT reasons_NNS ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS know_VBP when_WRB to_TO ask_VB for_IN help_NN ,_, and_CC work_NN in_IN a_DT team_NN ._.
One_PRP can_MD acomplish_VB more_JJR if_IN one_CD has_VBZ support_NN from_IN other_JJ people_NNS ._.
