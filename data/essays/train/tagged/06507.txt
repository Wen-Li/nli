I_PRP disagree_VBP this_DT statement_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS should_MD enjoy_VB and_CC obtain_VB many_JJ good_JJ things_NNS from_IN experiences_NNS ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, they_PRP should_MD have_VB many_JJ things_NNS to_TO grow_VB up_RP ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS should_MD study_VB ._.
When_WRB people_NNS became_VBD older_JJR ,_, there_EX are_VBP not_RB opportunity_NN to_TO study_VB something_NN ._.
To_TO study_VB sometimes_RB make_VB feel_VB boring_JJ ,_, but_CC it_PRP will_MD make_VB use_NN of_IN in_IN the_DT future_JJ surely_RB ._.
Further_RB ,_, while_IN you_PRP are_VBP in_IN the_DT young_JJ age_NN ,_, it_PRP will_MD be_VB easy_JJ to_TO understand_VB rather_RB than_IN learn_VB to_TO in_IN the_DT old_JJ age_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, people_NNS enjoy_VBP a_DT variety_NN of_IN things_NNS by_IN use_NN money_NN ._.
As_IN you_PRP get_VBP older_JJR ,_, we_PRP can_MD earn_VB the_DT money_NN and_CC enjoyable_JJ ._.
Also_RB ,_, you_PRP can_MD find_VB own_JJ favorite_JJ hobbies_NNS as_IN you_PRP tget_VBP older_JJR and_CC older_JJR ._.
Also_RB ,_, it_PRP will_MD be_VB not_RB good_JJ which_WDT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO use_VB money_NN from_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS ._.
Third_NNP ,_, after_IN retired_VBN the_DT job_NN ,_, people_NNS have_VBP alot_NNS of_IN time_NN to_TO do_VB someting_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, people_NNS who_WP retired_VBD the_DT job_NN can_MD go_VB overseas_RB ,_, go_VB out_RP somewhre_JJ anytime_RB ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB to_TO irritate_VB to_TO something_NN or_CC be_VB hurry_NN to_TO do_VB something_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ time_NN as_IN they_PRP like_VBP ._.
One_CD reason_NN that_IN ,_, they_PRP were_VBD hardworking_VBG ,_, and_CC did_VBD for_IN children_NNS to_TO grow_VB up_RP ._.
Enjoy_VB life_NN connects_VBZ with_IN the_DT past_JJ life_NN because_IN they_PRP made_VBD effort_NN each_DT other_JJ ._.
That_DT reasons_VBZ people_NNS should_MD enjoy_VB life_NN after_IN get_VB older_JJR ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, peole_NN should_MD study_VB and_CC have_VB experiences_NNS ,_, while_IN you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ age_NN ._.
That_DT will_MD make_VB you_PRP to_TO grow_VB up_RP and_CC can_MD know_VB about_IN the_DT life_NN of_IN happiness_NN ._.
That_DT reason_NN I_PRP think_VBP older_JJR peple_NN enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
