I_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS instead_RB of_IN specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
Having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN does_VBZ not_RB mean_VB that_IN one_CD has_VBZ a_DT good_JJ knowledge_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR important_JJ to_TO be_VB good_JJ in_IN what_WP you_PRP ,_, I_PRP think_VBP ._.
If_IN a_DT person_NN has_VBZ a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN a_DT lot_NN of_IN subjects_NNS ,_, usually_RB it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB very_RB convincing_JJ ._.
It_PRP takes_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN and_CC effort_NN to_TO really_RB learn_VB facts_NNS about_IN a_DT certain_JJ topic_NN and_CC to_TO understand_VB them_PRP ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ nearly_RB impossible_JJ to_TO have_VB both_DT ._.
It_PRP would_MD take_VB too_RB much_JJ time_NN ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, when_WRB applying_VBG for_IN a_DT job_NN one_CD usually_RB needs_VBZ to_TO have_VB specific_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN the_DT respective_JJ sector_NN they_PRP will_MD work_VB in_IN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, one_CD should_MD know_VB what_WP profession_NN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO prepare_VB for_IN and_CC then_RB get_VB a_DT good_JJ education_NN for_IN that_DT specific_JJ profession_NN ._.
Employers_NNS will_MD usually_RB appreciate_VB it_PRP more_RBR if_IN their_PRP$ employee_NN is_VBZ an_DT expert_NN in_IN his_PRP$ job_NN ._.
My_PRP$ most_RBS important_JJ point_NN is_VBZ that_IN one_CD should_MD not_RB have_VB a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN because_IN they_PRP will_MD not_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
They_PRP will_MD realize_VB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB really_RB good_JJ because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB know_VB details_NNS and_CC can_MD not_RB support_VB their_PRP$ ideas_NNS with_IN reasonal_JJ facts_NNS ,_, for_IN example_NN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, they_PRP will_MD get_VB unsatisfied_JJ with_IN themselves_PRP ._.
One_CD consequence_NN of_IN that_DT might_MD be_VB that_IN they_PRP fall_VBP into_IN depressions_NNS ._.
Another_DT consequence_NN might_MD be_VB that_IN they_PRP try_VBP to_TO improve_VB their_PRP$ knowledge_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, that_DT is_VBZ not_RB easy_JJ because_IN there_EX are_VBP so_RB many_JJ subjects_NNS they_PRP would_MD have_VB to_TO work_VB on_IN ._.
A_DT possible_JJ solution_NN would_MD be_VB to_TO finally_RB specialize_VB in_IN one_CD of_IN the_DT fields_NNS they_PRP are_VBP intersted_VBN in_IN ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO concentrate_VB on_IN one_CD subject_NN and_CC to_TO be_VB good_JJ in_IN it_PRP in_IN order_NN to_TO live_VB a_DT happy_JJ and_CC fullfilling_VBG life_NN ._.
