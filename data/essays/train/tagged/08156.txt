I_PRP do_VBP agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS today_NN are_VBP less_RBR involved_VBN in_IN community_NN activities_NNS and_CC spend_VBP less_JJR time_NN there_RB because_IN the_DT society_NN in_IN common_JJ became_VBD more_RBR individualistic_JJ ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS today_NN perform_VBP individial_JJ sports_NNS or_CC they_PRP perform_VBP sports_NNS only_RB occassionally_RB ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ no_RB longer_RB common_JJ that_IN such_JJ people_NNS are_VBP organised_VBN in_IN sports_NNS clubs_NNS and_CC take_VB responsibily_RB as_IN team_NN coaches_NNS or_CC in_IN training_NN kids_NNS and_CC younger_JJR club_NN members_NNS from_IN their_PRP$ community_NN ._.
It_PRP seems_VBZ also_RB that_IN organisations_NNS like_IN the_DT boy_NN scouts_NNS or_CC churches_NNS have_VBP a_DT problem_NN to_TO attract_VB young_JJ people_NNS ._.
And_CC I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS were_VBD more_RBR politically_RB engaged_VBN in_IN previous_JJ times_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP only_RB few_JJ young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB joining_VBG political_JJ parties_NNS or_CC labour_NN organisations_NNS such_JJ as_IN union_NN ._.
In_IN particular_JJ ,_, most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP reluctant_JJ to_TO take_VB political_JJ positions_NNS on_IN a_DT communal_JJ level_NN because_IN they_PRP can_MD no_DT see_VB any_DT sense_NN in_IN it_PRP ._.
One_CD reason_NN seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB that_IN the_DT economic_JJ situation_NN has_VBZ changed_VBN much_RB over_IN the_DT last_JJ years_NNS ._.
The_DT pressure_NN to_TO be_VB successfull_JJ in_IN the_DT job_NN is_VBZ much_RB higher_JJR than_IN ever_RB before_RB ,_, and_CC the_DT high_JJ unemployment_NN rate_NN threatens_VBZ a_DT lot_NN of_IN people_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ proffesional_JJ future_NN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP urged_VBN to_TO finish_VB their_PRP$ school_NN time_NN time_NN and_CC studies_NNS as_IN fast_JJ as_IN possible_JJ which_WDT leaves_VBZ only_RB very_RB little_JJ time_NN for_IN community_NN activities_NNS ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, it_PRP seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB more_RBR common_JJ today_NN to_TO teach_VB competition_NN instead_RB of_IN collaboration_NN ,_, leading_VBG to_TO a_DT more_RBR egoistic_JJ society_NN ._.
A_DT lot_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS start_VBP to_TO learn_VB this_DT early_JJ in_IN their_PRP$ careers_NNS ,_, leaving_VBG the_DT impression_NN to_TO them_PRP that_DT is_VBZ not_RB benefitial_JJ to_TO take_VB responsibilites_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ communities_NNS because_IN of_IN the_DT time_NN it_PRP costs_VBZ ._.
Finally_RB ,_, the_DT society_NN became_VBD more_RBR mobile_JJ over_IN the_DT last_JJ years_NNS ,_, which_WDT means_VBZ that_IN in_IN particular_JJ young_JJ people_NNS often_RB change_VBP their_PRP$ job_NN and_CC living_VBG place_NN ._.
Hence_RB ,_, these_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB really_RB get_VB rooted_VBN in_IN a_DT community_NN ._.
But_CC this_DT seems_VBZ to_TO be_VB a_DT major_JJ prerequesite_NN for_IN any_DT community_NN engagement_NN ._.
