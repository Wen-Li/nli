Some_DT people_NNS think_VBP that_IN yonug_NN people_NNS can_MD act_VB more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC yong_JJ people_NNS can_MD spent_VBD more_JJR enjoyable_JJ time_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
For_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS ,_, however_RB ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
First_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR free_JJ time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD retire_VB his_PRP$ job_NN when_WRB the_DT people_NNS got_VBD enough_JJ money_NN to_TO spent_VBN their_PRP$ least_JJS life_NN ._.
Many_JJ older_JJR people_NNS can_MD spent_VBD both_DT money_NN and_CC time_NN for_IN what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO do_VB ._.
Some_DT older_JJR people_NNS can_MD travel_VB all_DT over_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
Some_DT people_NNS can_MD gather_VB antique_JJ jewelies_NNS all_DT over_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
Some_DT people_NNS spend_VBP his_PRP$ life_NN treating_VBG their_PRP$ gearden_NN ._.
By_IN contrast_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO go_VB school_NN ._.
Yong_NNP people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB enough_JJ time_NN and_CC money_NN to_TO do_VB all_DT what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ._.
Second_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP a_DT great_JJ deal_NN of_IN knowledge_NN and_CC experience_NN to_TO spent_VBN time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB even_RB in_IN five_CD minutes_NNS ,_, if_IN they_PRP know_VBP writting_VBG poem_NN ._.
When_WRB the_DT older_JJR people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB know_VB about_IN writing_VBG poem_NN ,_, they_PRP would_MD hit_VB on_IN other_JJ ideas_NNS ,_, ssuch_VBP as_IN reading_VBG books_NNS ,_, talking_VBG with_IN others_NNS ,_, and_CC thinking_VBG about_IN their_PRP$ offsprings_NNS '_POS future_NN ._.
They_PRP know_VBP various_JJ choices_NNS ,_, because_IN they_PRP have_VBP experienced_VBN various_JJ past_JJ time_NN in_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ past_NN ._.
But_CC ,_, young_JJ people_NNS does_VBZ n't_RB ._.
This_DT is_VBZ adventage_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, I_PRP strongly_RB disagree_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP their_PRP$ life_NN less_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
