Enjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN is_VBZ one_CD of_IN the_DT most_RBS significant_JJ steps_NNS that_WDT each_DT person_NN should_MD experience_VB ._.
There_EX is_VBZ no_DT clear_JJ cut_NN answer_NN to_TO the_DT question_NN if_IN young_JJ people_NNS or_CC older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB related_VBN to_TO the_DT age_NN but_CC the_DT situation_NN of_IN the_DT people_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, people_NNS have_VBP different_JJ advantages_NNS at_IN the_DT different_JJ ages_NNS ._.
Some_DT advantages_NNS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN are_VBP their_PRP$ energy_NN and_CC money_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, on_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR time_NN and_CC more_JJR experince_NN ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT biggest_JJS advantage_NN of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN is_VBZ their_PRP$ energy_NN ._.
They_PRP are_VBP much_JJ healthier_JJR than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS and_CC have_VBP more_RBR willingness_NN to_TO do_VB more_JJR thing_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN they_PRP can_MD travel_VB to_TO the_DT other_JJ countries_NNS ,_, while_IN it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB very_RB possible_JJ for_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, energy_NN is_VBZ not_RB enouhg_NN ,_, time_NN is_VBZ also_RB required_VBN ._.
When_WRB we_PRP consider_VBP that_DT most_JJS of_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO work_VB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR free_JJ time_NN for_IN themselves_PRP ._.
They_PRP are_VBP mostly_RB retired_VBN and_CC do_VBP not_RB need_VB to_TO work_VB so_RB they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN better_RBR ._.
The_DT second_JJ point_NN is_VBZ that_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN means_VBZ money_NN ._.
For_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS that_WDT is_VBZ not_RB a_DT great_JJ problem_NN since_IN they_PRP are_VBP working_VBG and_CC earning_VBG money_NN ._.
In_IN contrast_NN ,_, for_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB easy_JJ to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN with_IN luxury_NN things_NNS ,_, because_IN their_PRP$ salary_NN from_IN the_DT retirement_NN is_VBZ not_RB very_RB high_JJ ._.
However_RB needless_JJ to_TO say_VB is_VBZ that_IN with_IN the_DT experience_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP gained_VBN for_IN many_JJ years_NNS they_PRP can_MD find_VB the_DT way_NN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN with_IN less_JJR money_NN ._.
Many_JJ of_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP traveled_VBN and_CC enjoyed_VBN the_DT life_NN since_IN many_JJ years_NNS ,_, that_DT means_VBZ that_IN they_PRP know_VBP very_RB well_RB the_DT cheapest_JJS places_NNS and_CC things_NNS to_TO do_VB ._.
In_IN sum_NN ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN `_`` young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do`_VBP ._.
Based_VBN on_IN my_PRP$ personal_JJ experiences_NNS I_PRP can_MD claim_VB that_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN is_VBZ not_RB dependent_JJ on_IN the_DT age_NN ,_, but_CC on_IN the_DT situation_NN ._.
As_IN I_PRP pointed_VBD out_RP above_IN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS can_MD have_VB the_DT energy_NN and_CC the_DT money_NN needed_VBN for_IN enjoying_VBG the_DT life_NN ,_, however_RB that_DT is_VBZ not_RB enough_RB they_PRP need_VBP also_RB time_NN and_CC some_DT experience_NN that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP ._.
