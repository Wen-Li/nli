As_IN we_PRP know_VBP ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR energetic_JJ ,_, enthusiastic_JJ ,_, and_CC enjoy_VB better_JJR health_NN ,_, then_RB it_PRP is_VBZ true_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VB ?_.
Personally_RB speaking_VBG ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN such_PDT a_DT contention_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, the_DT lives_NNS of_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP much_RB more_RBR streassful_JJ than_IN that_DT of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
The_DT generations_NNS of_IN our_PRP$ parents_NNS or_CC grandparents_NNS were_VBD born_VBN in_IN the_DT 1930s_CD to_TO 1950s_CD ,_, when_WRB the_DT population_NN in_IN China_NNP was_VBD relatively_RB small_JJ ._.
By_IN contrast_NN ,_, most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB were_VBD born_VBN during_IN the_DT birth_NN boost_NN in_IN 1980s_CD ,_, therefore_RB ,_, the_DT competition_NN for_IN education_NN opportunity_NN and_CC job_NN positions_NNS are_VBP much_RB more_RBR fierce_JJ for_IN them_PRP ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO work_VB day_NN and_CC night_NN to_TO support_VB themselves_PRP financially_RB ._.
Second_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP in_IN a_DT specific_JJ phase_NN of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS when_WRB there_EX are_VBP more_RBR troubles_NNS and_CC frustrations_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS would_MD feel_VB overwhelmed_JJ with_IN anxiety_NN or_CC stress_NN when_WRB first_RB falling_VBG in_IN love_NN ,_, when_WRB getting_VBG married_JJ ,_, when_WRB expecting_VBG a_DT baby_NN ,_, all_DT of_IN which_WDT are_VBP new_JJ to_TO them_PRP ,_, so_RB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB sure_JJ whether_IN they_PRP can_MD handle_VB ._.
However_RB ,_, the_DT life_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ more_RBR peaceful_JJ and_CC smooth_JJ ,_, without_IN such_JJ anxieties_NNS ._.
What_WP 's_VBZ more_JJR ,_, young_JJ people_NNS might_MD probably_RB have_VB some_DT financial_JJ problems_NNS ,_, especially_RB when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP frustrated_VBN in_IN job_NN hunting_NN ._.
By_IN contrast_NN ,_, most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP pension_NN and_CC they_PRP are_VBP covered_VBN by_IN social_JJ welfare_NN system_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN Medcare_NNP ,_, so_RB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP emaciated_VBN from_IN such_JJ financial_JJ troubles_NNS and_CC are_VBP living_VBG a_DT more_RBR secured_JJ and_CC decent_JJ life_NN ._.
Third_NNP ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP carefully_RB protected_VBN and_CC highly_RB respected_VBN by_IN the_DT whole_JJ society_NN ,_, however_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB neglected_VBN in_IN some_DT way_NN ._.
Nowadays_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP encouraged_JJ or_CC even_RB forced_VBN to_TO move_VB out_IN of_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS '_POS houses_NNS and_CC begin_VB an_DT independent_JJ life_NN by_IN themselves_PRP ._.
Sometimes_RB they_PRP are_VBP living_VBG in_IN detachness_NN ,_, loneless_JJ and_CC isolation_NN ._.
By_IN contrast_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP respected_VBN by_IN the_DT whole_JJ soceity_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP are_VBP refrently_RB visited_VBN by_IN his_PRP$ children_NNS as_RB well_RB as_IN social_JJ workers_NNS ._.
In_IN numerous_JJ family_NN get-togethers_NNS ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB hard_JJ to_TO tell_VB how_WRB happy_JJ they_PRP are_VBP ,_, with_IN a_DT pride_NN of_IN self-accomplishment_NN ._.
In_IN sum_NN ,_, although_IN we_PRP must_MD admit_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR health_NN ,_, energetic_JJ and_CC enthusiastic_JJ than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ,_, they_PRP are_VBP facing_VBG more_RBR stress_NN ,_, competition_NN and_CC anxiety_NN ._.
What_WP 's_VBZ more_JJR ,_, older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP carefully_RB protected_VBN and_CC highly_RB respected_VBN by_IN the_DT whole_JJ society_NN ,_, but_CC young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP negelected_VBN in_IN some_DT way_NN ._.
Thus_RB ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB think_VB young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP living_VBG a_DT better_JJR life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
