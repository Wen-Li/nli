I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN that_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX are_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP much_JJ time_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS because_IN after_IN older_JJR people_NNS retired_VBD thier_JJR jobs_NNS ,_, they_PRP can_MD enjoy_VB the_DT second_JJ life_NN slowly_RB ._.
When_WRB they_PRP were_VBD working_VBG ,_, they_PRP were_VBD so_RB busy_JJ that_IN they_PRP could_MD not_RB do_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO ._.
Besides_IN ,_, they_PRP could_MD not_RB take_VB many_JJ vacations_NNS ._.
They_PRP can_MD do_VB things_NNS which_WDT they_PRP could_MD not_RB do_VB when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD working_VBG because_IN they_PRP have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP n't_RB have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO go_VB to_TO school_NN or_CC work_NN ._.
Students_NNS have_VBP exams_NNS ._.
They_PRP are_VBP recqired_VBN to_TO study_VB harder_JJR and_CC harder_JJR for_IN exams_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
When_WRB they_PRP were_VBD working_VBG ,_, they_PRP would_MD save_VB money_NN for_IN their_PRP$ future_NN ._.
They_PRP can_MD buy_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP ,_, go_VBP where_WRB they_PRP want_VBP to_TO and_CC eat_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP to_TO ._.
Finally_RB ,_, of_IN course_NN older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP experienced_VBN a_DT lot_NN of_IN things_NNS ._.
They_PRP know_VBP what_WP they_PRP should_MD do_VB when_WRB a_DT problem_NN happens_VBZ ._.
They_PRP also_RB know_VBP how_WRB to_TO avoid_VB a_DT problem_NN ._.
They_PRP would_MD experience_VB hard_JJ things_NNS that_WDT as_IN if_IN it_PRP seemed_VBD that_IN they_PRP could_MD not_RB solve_VB the_DT problem_NN ,_, but_CC young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP not_RB experienced_JJ such_PDT a_DT thing_NN yet_RB ._.
Even_RB if_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP experienced_VBN such_PDT a_DT thing_NN ,_, the_DT number_NN would_MD much_RB less_RBR than_IN those_DT of_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
