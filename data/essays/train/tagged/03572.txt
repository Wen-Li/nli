I_PRP agree_VBP that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB the_DT attitude_NN of_IN trying_VBG new_JJ things_NNS and_CC taking_VBG on_RP risks_NNS ,_, because_IN I_PRP believe_VBP this_DT is_VBZ essentially_RB what_WDT defines_VBZ successful_JJ people_NNS from_IN ordinary_JJ people_NNS ._.
More_RBR specifically_RB ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP because_IN of_IN the_DT following_VBG reasons_NNS :_:
First_RB ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS take_VBP risks_NNS because_IN they_PRP know_VBP that_IN risk_NN taking_VBG differentiates_VBZ themselves_PRP from_IN the_DT rest_NN of_IN the_DT herd_NN ._.
They_PRP realize_VBP that_IN people_NNS are_VBP naturally_RB risk-averse_JJ and_CC tend_VB to_TO continue_VB what_WP they_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG ._.
Successful_JJ people_NNS take_VBP risks_NNS ,_, not_RB only_RB because_IN this_DT very_RB action_NN differentiate_VBP themselves_PRP ,_, but_CC also_RB because_IN they_PRP know_VBP that_IN there_EX will_MD be_VB a_DT learning_NN experience_NN offered_VBN through_IN their_PRP$ risk_NN taking_VBG ._.
They_PRP know_VBP that_IN even_RB with_IN failure_NN ,_, so_RB long_RB as_IN they_PRP maintain_VBP the_DT will_NN and_CC the_DT energy_NN to_TO continue_VB ,_, they_PRP can_MD come_VB back_RB stronger_JJR with_IN the_DT experience_NN they_PRP will_MD gain_VB ._.
Second_RB ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS work_VBP on_IN improving_VBG their_PRP$ weaknesses_NNS ._.
Whether_IN it_PRP be_VB a_DT professional_JJ major_JJ league_NN baseball_NN player_NN or_CC a_DT CEO_NN of_IN a_DT mutli-billion_JJ company_NN ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS to_TO improve_VB their_PRP$ performance_NN ._.
They_PRP break_VBP their_PRP$ status_NN quo_NN and_CC leap_NN to_TO the_DT next_JJ level_NN ,_, because_IN they_PRP can_MD identify_VB what_WP they_PRP are_VBP good_JJ at_IN and_CC what_WP they_PRP are_VBP not_RB ,_, and_CC thereby_RB work_VB on_IN the_DT weak_JJ areas_NNS with_IN a_DT new_JJ approach_NN ._.
Third_NNP ,_, successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP curious_JJ and_CC eager_JJ to_TO learn_VB ._.
They_PRP also_RB know_VBP that_IN there_EX are_VBP a_DT ton_NN of_IN things_NNS they_PRP do_VBP n't_RB know_VB out_IN there_RB in_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
Further_RB ,_, their_PRP$ curiosity_NN leads_VBZ to_TO the_DT synergy_NN of_IN their_PRP$ knowledge_NN base_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, an_DT engieer_NN may_MD better_RBR address_VB his_PRP$ current_JJ issues_NNS in_IN the_DT long-term_JJ ,_, if_IN he_PRP gained_VBD more_JJR knowledge_NN about_IN business_NN and_CC other_JJ drivers_NNS that_WDT may_MD be_VB causing_VBG his_PRP$ problems_NNS ._.
In_IN summary_NN ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_DT successful_JJ people_NNS are_VBP willing_JJ to_TO take_VB risks_NNS and_CC are_VBP eager_JJ to_TO try_VB new_JJ things_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ natural_JJ characterstics_NNS of_IN self-improvement_NN and_CC from_IN the_DT knowledge_NN of_IN the_DT benefits_NNS of_IN such_JJ actions_NNS ._.
