With_IN the_DT recent_JJ reapid_NN economy_NN ,_, the_DT pace_NN of_IN life_NN is_VBZ becoming_VBG faster_RBR and_CC faster_RBR ._.
Consequently_RB ,_, there_EX is_VBZ controversy_NN issue_NN over_IN the_DT topic_NN :_: what_WP kind_NN of_IN people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR :_: old_JJ peple_NN or_CC young_JJ people_NNS ?_.
Some_DT people_NNS think_VBP old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ;_: while_IN others_NNS insist_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ._.
As_IN for_IN me_PRP ,_, the_DT choice_NN ,_, nevertheless_RB ,_, is_VBZ not_RB easy_JJ to_TO make_VB ._.
After_IN considering_VBG my_PRP$ fondness_NN and_CC personalities_NNS ,_, i_FW choose_VB the_DT latter_JJ ._.
As_IN one_CD of_IN the_DT famous_JJ saying_VBG goes_VBZ in_IN the_DT country_NN :_: young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP the_DT masters_NNS of_IN games_NNS ._.
In_IN the_DT following_VBG disccusion_NN ,_, i_FW would_MD like_VB to_TO reason_NN and_CC provide_VBP evidence_NN for_IN my_PRP$ point_NN of_IN view_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR activities_NNS to_TO play_VB with_IN like_IN :_: they_PRP can_MD climb_VB mountains_NNS ,_, skate_VBP ,_, swim_VBP and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, on_IN New_NNP Years_NNS Eve_NNP ,_, i_FW went_VBD to_TO skate_VB in_IN the_DT city_NN hall_NN ,_, and_CC we_PRP had_VBD a_DT lot_NN of_IN fun_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, not_RB much_RB of_IN old_JJ people_NNS went_VBD to_TO skate_VB ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT reasons_NNS is_VBZ that_IN their_PRP$ heath_NN conditions_NNS do_VBP not_RB allowthem_NN to_TO do_VB so_RB ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR enthusiastic_JJ ._.
They_PRP are_VBP willing_JJ to_TO try_VB really_RB exiciting_VBG games_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, last_JJ year_NN ,_, my_PRP$ brothers_NNS went_VBD to_TO poji_VB ._.
It_PRP a_DT game_NN that_IN people_NNS jump_VBP from_IN a_DT high_JJ mountain_NN really_RB quickly_RB like_IN about_IN several_JJ minites_NNS ._.
Your_PRP$ heart_NN should_MD be_VB tolerated_VBN enough_RB to_TO overcome_VB the_DT scary_JJ ._.
According_VBG to_TO a_DT statistic_NN conducted_VBN by_IN University_NNP of_IN Toronto_NNP ,_, 95.47_CD of_IN the_DT people_NNS who_WP play_VBP the_DT poji_NN is_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Admitedly_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS enjoys_VBZ life_NN in_IN certain_JJ circumstances_NNS ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, they_PRP walk_VBP dogs_NNS and_CC have_VBP tea_NN together_RB ._.
But_CC those_DT activities_NNS are_VBP limited_JJ and_CC not_RB much_JJ fun_NN compare_VB to_TO young_JJ peoples_NNS activities_NNS ._.
So_IN that_DT is_VBZ i_FW think_VBP the_DT better_JJR choice_NN should_MD be_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ._.
There_EX are_VBP still_RB a_DT lot_NN of_IN reasons_NNS for_IN my_PRP$ fondness_NN of_IN that_DT young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ._.
The_DT obvious_JJ ones_NNS have_VBP provides_VBZ as_IN above_RB ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, that_WDT why_WRB i_FW think_VBP youngpeople_NN enjoy_VB life_NN more_RBR ._.
