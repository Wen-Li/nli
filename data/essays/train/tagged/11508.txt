Personally_RB ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS would_MD probably_RB decrease_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ,_, as_IN the_DT contemporary_JJ situation_NN already_RB provides_VBZ hints_NNS that_IN the_DT trend_NN is_VBZ going_VBG towards_IN this_DT direction_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, the_DT recent_JJ development_NN of_IN the_DT gas_NN price_NN ,_, shows_VBZ that_IN driving_VBG a_DT car_NN becomes_VBZ more_JJR and_CC more_RBR expensive_JJ ._.
Even_RB today_NN more_JJR and_CC more_JJR people_NNS try_VBP to_TO avoid_VB to_TO use_VB their_PRP$ if_IN it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB necessary_JJ ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, already_RB today_NN there_EX are_VBP people_NNS who_WP ca_MD n't_RB afford_VB having_VBG a_DT car_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ very_RB likely_JJ that_IN this_DT trend_NN will_MD continue_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
Consequently_RB it_PRP seems_VBZ sensitive_JJ ,_, as_IN having_VBG a_DT car_NN becomes_VBZ more_JJR and_CC more_RBR expensive_JJ ,_, that_IN even_RB the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS might_MD decrease_VB ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, cars_NNS cause_VBP pollution_NN ._.
People_NNS are_VBP already_RB aware_JJ that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ detrimental_JJ to_TO the_DT environment_NN and_CC thus_RB in_IN consequence_NN also_RB to_TO health_NN if_IN the_DT traffic_NN is_VBZ not_RB reduced_VBN ._.
Campaigns_NNS try_VBP to_TO raise_VB the_DT awareness_NN something_NN has_VBZ to_TO change_VB ._.
Thus_RB I_PRP can_MD imagine_VB that_IN measures_NNS have_VBP to_TO be_VB taken_VBN to_TO reduce_VB the_DT traffic_NN ._.
One_CD of_IN the_DT simplest_JJS is_VBZ to_TO reduce_VB the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS ._.
Governments_NNS must_MD and_CC will_MD have_VB to_TO take_VB action_NN ,_, hence_RB it_PRP appears_VBZ reasonable_JJ that_IN they_PRP will_MD try_VB anything_NN to_TO obtain_VB a_DT reduction_NN of_IN the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS ._.
One_CD possibility_NN to_TO reduce_VB the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS might_MD be_VB to_TO raise_VB the_DT taxes_NNS which_WDT would_MD in_IN the_DT end_NN also_RB make_VBP driving_VBG expensive_JJ ,_, so_IN that_IN people_NNS might_MD no_DT use_VB more_JJR public_JJ transports_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, I_PRP can_MD also_RB imagine_VB that_IN as_IN there_EX is_VBZ a_DT need_NN to_TO reduce_VB the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO protect_VB the_DT environment_NN ,_, the_DT costs_NNS for_IN public_JJ transports_NNS might_MD be_VB lowered_VBN thereby_RB encouraging_VBG more_JJR and_CC more_JJR people_NNS to_TO avoid_VB buying_VBG a_DT car_NN ._.
This_DT trend_NN can_MD already_RB be_VB observed_VBN in_IN the_DT big_JJ cities_NNS ._.
Car_NN sharing_NN and_CC a_DT stronger_JJR use_NN of_IN public_JJ transports_NNS such_JJ as_IN subway_NN and_CC buses_NNS have_VBP become_VBN common_JJ hints_NNS that_IN the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS is_VBZ decreasing_VBG ._.
However_RB ,_, although_IN I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS will_MD decrease_VB in_IN the_DT future_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ also_RB possible_JJ that_IN this_DT does_VBZ not_RB happen_VB ._.
A_DT new_JJ technology_NN based_VBN on_IN regenerable_JJ resources_NNS that_WDT makes_VBZ cars_NNS less_RBR dangerous_JJ for_IN the_DT environment_NN may_MD keep_VB the_DT number_NN of_IN cars_NNS stable_JJ ._.
