I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, if_IN we_PRP specialize_VBP in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ,_, we_PRP can_MD consentrate_VB on_IN that_DT subject_NN ._.
It_PRP means_VBZ the_DT person_NN who_WP specialize_VBP in_IN a_DT specific_JJ subjet_NN has_VBZ much_RB more_JJR knowkege_NN than_IN the_DT person_NN who_WP have_VBP broad_JJ knowlege_NN because_IN of_IN spending_NN time_NN to_TO specialize_VB in_IN that_DT subject_NN ._.
Now_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO talk_VB about_IN a_DT doctor_NN case_NN for_IN example_NN ._.
When_WRB you_PRP are_VBP seen_VBN by_IN doctor_NN because_IN of_IN the_DT flu_NN ,_, the_DT hospital_NN has_VBZ many_JJ notices_NNS to_TO suggest_VB thier_JJR field_NN ._.
What_WP do_VBP you_PRP feel_VB to_TO look_VB these_DT many_JJ notices_NNS ?_.
Do_VBP you_PRP feel_VB anxiety_NN or_CC good_JJ image_NN against_IN the_DT hospital_NN ?_.
The_DT answer_NN is_VBZ obviously_RB former_JJ one_CD ._.
Because_IN we_PRP can_MD rely_VB on_IN a_DT specifian_JJ more_JJR than_IN a_DT doctor_NN who_WP has_VBZ broad_JJ knowledge_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ appearently_RB outcome_NN ._.
For_IN those_DT reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP disa_VBP
