I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS nowadays_RB do_VBP not_RB give_VB enough_JJ time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
Recently_RB ,_, there_EX are_VBP many_JJ people_NNS who_WP need_VBP help_NN in_IN our_PRP$ community_NN such_JJ as_IN the_DT people_NNS who_WP have_VBP disability_NN or_CC elderly_JJ people_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, We_PRP have_VBP the_DT greatest_JJS number_NN of_IN people_NNS who_WP have_VBP the_DT age_NN of_IN over_IN sixty-five_CD today_NN ._.
In_IN spite_NN of_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN there_EX are_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN elderly_JJ people_NNS who_WP are_VBP waiting_VBG for_IN the_DT help_NN ,_, there_EX are_VBP not_RB enough_JJ young_JJ people_NNS who_WP can_MD support_VB them_PRP because_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB much_JJ time_NN for_IN helping_VBG people_NNS ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR likely_JJ to_TO work_VB rather_RB than_IN help_VB community_NN recently_RB ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS prefer_VBP to_TO have_VB pattern_NN jobs_NNS because_IN they_PRP want_VBP to_TO earn_VB more_JJR money_NN for_IN theirselves_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB independent_JJ enough_JJ to_TO live_VB by_IN theirselves_NNS ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD not_RB get_VB affored_VBN by_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS any_DT more_RBR ,_, so_IN they_PRP need_VBP to_TO work_VB hard_RB ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN opportunity_NN which_WDT contribute_VBP for_IN the_DT community_NN are_VBP unpaid_JJ work_NN such_JJ as_IN volunteer_NN work_NN ;_: therefore_RB ,_, students_NNS who_WP want_VBP to_TO earn_VB money_NN dont_NN have_VBP interest_NN to_TO spent_VBN the_DT time_NN to_TO help_VB community_NN ._.
Secondary_JJ ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP busy_JJ for_IN studying_VBG nowadays_RB ._.
A_DT lot_NN of_IN university_NN students_NNS are_VBP busy_JJ for_IN doing_VBG their_PRP$ project_NN or_CC homework_NN everyday_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB extra_JJ time_NN to_TO help_VB community_NN ._.
In_IN Japan_NNP ,_, many_JJ people_NNS think_VBP it_PRP is_VBZ getting_VBG difficult_JJ to_TO get_VB hired_VBN by_IN a_DT good_JJ company_NN recently_RB ;_: therefore_RB students_NNS have_VBP to_TO study_VB harder_JJR than_IN others_NNS and_CC win_VB the_DT competition_NN to_TO get_VB better_JJR job_NN in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB much_JJ time_NN to_TO contribute_VB for_IN the_DT community_NN recently_RB because_IN they_PRP are_VBP busy_JJ for_IN working_VBG and_CC studying_VBG ._.
