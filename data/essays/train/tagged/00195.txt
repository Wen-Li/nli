I_PRP completely_RB agree_VBP to_TO the_DT statement_NN and_CC I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN in_IN order_NN to_TO succeed_VB one_CD should_MD be_VB willing_JJ to_TO take_VB chances/risks_NNS in_IN life_NN and_CC try_VB unexplored_JJ avenues_NNS ._.
I_PRP 'd_MD like_VB to_TO support_VB my_PRP$ statement_NN by_IN mentioning_VBG following_VBG points_NNS and_CC examples_NNS :_:
Firstly_RB ,_, as_IN we_PRP all_DT know_VBP that_IN we_PRP have_VBP to_TO live_VB once_RB and_CC as_IN some_DT people_NNS say_VBP that_IN life_NN is_VBZ not_RB a_DT rehearsal_NN ,_, I_PRP think_VBP we_PRP have_VBP been_VBN given_VBN just_RB one_CD opportunity_NN to_TO explore_VB different_JJ avenues_NNS of_IN life_NN ._.
Indeed_RB life_NN would_MD become_VB very_RB monotonous_JJ and_CC boring_JJ if_IN risks/chances_NNS are_VBP not_RB taken_VBN and_CC novel_JJ things_NNS are_VBP not_RB tried_VBN ._.
Having_VBG said_VBD that_IN it_PRP should_MD be_VB taken_VBN into_IN consideration_NN that_IN the_DT chance_NN taken_VBN should_MD not_RB harm_VB oneself_NN or_CC others_NNS ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, if_IN we_PRP think_VBP of_IN the_DT big_JJ names_NNS of_IN business_NN world_NN like_IN Bill_NNP gates_NNS and_CC Sushil_NNP Mittal_NNP ,_, they_PRP could_MD not_RB have_VB achieved_VBN their_PRP$ current_JJ status_NN ,_, if_IN they_PRP would_MD n't_RB have_VB taken_VBN risks_NNS in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
These_DT people_NNS were_VBD not_RB well_RB acquainted_VBN with_IN computers_NNS and_CC steel_NN ,_, respectively_RB when_WRB they_PRP started_VBD but_CC because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ willingness_NN to_TO explore_VB and_CC take_VB chance_NN they_PRP undoubteldy_VBP succeed_VB and_CC reached_VBD to_TO the_DT highest_JJS level_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN if_IN risks/chances_NNS are_VBP not_RB taken_VBN in_IN most_JJS of_IN the_DT areas_NNS ,_, it_PRP would_MD definitely_RB affect_VB the_DT rate_NN at_IN which_WDT we_PRP invent_VBP newer_JJR technologies_NNS today_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT advances_NNS are_VBP based_VBN on_IN assumptions_NNS that_WDT one_PRP would_MD succeed_VB while_IN attempting_VBG a_DT particular_JJ task_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, momentous_JJ discoveries_NNS like_IN computer_NN ,_, internet_NN ,_, telescope_NN ,_, etc._FW would_MD not_RB have_VB been_VBN possible_JJ without_IN taking_VBG the_DT risk_NN and_CC considering_VBG the_DT possiblity_NN of_IN failures_NNS ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, I_PRP feel_VBP that_IN one_CD should_MD be_VB concious_JJ of_IN that_DT fact_NN while_IN taking_VBG risks/chances_NNS that_WDT success_NN is_VBZ not_RB always_RB a_DT surity_NN becasue_NN we_PRP always_RB do_VBP not_RB get_VB what_WP we_PRP aim_VBP for_IN ._.
So_IN it_PRP 's_VBZ not_RB essentially_RB true_JJ that_IN people_NNS who_WP took_VBD chances_NNS earlier_JJR are_VBP only_RB successful_JJ ones_NNS ,_, but_CC there_EX are_VBP people_NNS who_WP were_VBD unable_JJ to_TO achieve_VB what_WP they_PRP desired_VBD despite_IN of_IN taking_VBG risks_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, I_PRP conclude_VBP that_IN though_IN there_EX is_VBZ no_DT harm_NN in_IN working_VBG on_IN only_RB doing_VBG something_NN that_IN a_DT person_NN knows_VBZ well_RB ,_, but_CC i_FW think_VBP that_DT would_MD make_VB life_NN very_RB stagnant_JJ and_CC our_PRP$ advancement_NN will_MD be_VB badly_RB hampered_VBN ._.
So_IN a_DT person_NN should_MD always_RB be_VB willing_JJ to_TO lookout_NN for_IN opportunites_NNS and_CC take_VB calculated_JJ risks_NNS in_IN his_PRP$ life_NN and_CC sooner_RB or_CC later_RB he_PRP would_MD definitely_RB taste_VB success_NN ._.
