Enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN is_VBZ boon_NN from_IN god_NN to_TO all_PDT the_DT living_NN creatures_NNS ._.
Every_DT person_NN likes_VBZ to_TO enjoy_VB his_PRP$ life_NN in_IN his_PRP$ own_JJ way_NN ,_, irrespective_RB of_IN his_PRP$ age_NN ._.
Age_NNP is_VBZ not_RB the_DT matter_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, since_IN every_DT person_NN enjoys_VBZ his_PRP$ life_NN according_VBG to_TO the_DT energy_NN he_PRP is_VBZ capable_JJ of_IN ._.
According_VBG to_TO my_PRP$ point_NN of_IN view_NN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP a_DT lot_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, because_IN they_PRP are_VBP cold_JJ blooded_VBN ,_, highly_RB energitic_JJ and_CC flexible_JJ to_TO every_DT movement_NN ._.
Since_IN it_PRP is_VBZ a_DT growing_VBG age_NN ,_, he_PRP is_VBZ free_JJ of_IN problems_NNS ,_, and_CC enjoys_VBZ every_DT movement_NN of_IN life_NN ._.
Due_JJ to_TO the_DT flexibility_NN he_PRP can_MD do_VB any_DT thing_NN he_PRP wanted_VBD to_TO do_VB ,_, without_IN any_DT riddles_NNS ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN by_IN participating_VBG in_IN various_JJ activities_NNS as_IN a_DT part_NN of_IN studying_VBG ._.
For_IN example_NN young_JJ people_NNS belonging_VBG to_TO school_NN age_NN enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN ,_, such_JJ as_IN making_VBG noises_NNS ,_, screaming_VBG ,_, fighting_VBG among_IN themselves_PRP ,_, parcipating_VBG in_IN various_JJ physical_JJ activities_NNS ,_, due_JJ to_TO which_WDT they_PRP maintain_VBP agood_JJ health_NN which_WDT yeilds_VBZ good_JJ growth_NN ._.
Because_IN this_DT is_VBZ the_DT age_NN we_PRP able_JJ to_TO know_VB each_DT other_JJ ,_, knowing_VBG relationships_NNS making_VBG buddies_NNS and_CC having_VBG lots_NNS of_IN fun_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP not_RB so_RB energitic_JJ as_IN young_JJ blood_NN ,_, because_IN of_IN the_DT age_NN factor_NN ,_, not_RB flexible_JJ body_NN as_IN age_NN grows_VBZ and_CC responsibilities_NNS they_PRP have_VBP around_IN them_PRP ._.
They_PRP can_MD not_RB enjoy_VB the_DT same_JJ one_CD as_IN ,_, the_DT zeal_NN with_IN which_WDT young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Because_IN they_PRP are_VBP always_RB cornered_VBN with_IN the_DT problems_NNS and_CC responsibilities_NNS that_WDT surround_VBP around_IN them_PRP ._.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP free_JJ birds_NNS who_WP can_MD stretch_VB their_PRP$ wings_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT world_NN around_IN them_PRP ._.
At_IN the_DT mourning_NN age_NN we_PRP like_VBP to_TO spend_VB a_DT lots_NNS of_IN time_NN with_IN friends_NNS ,_, roaming_VBG on_IN bikes_NNS and_CC attending_VBG parties_NNS and_CC functions_NNS to_TO get_VB the_DT time_NN passed_VBD and_CC the_DT joyful_JJ and_CC delightful_JJ mood_NN ._.
At_IN this_DT age_NN we_PRP spend_VBP lavishly_RB and_CC even_RB and_CC we_PRP do_VBP not_RB even_RB known_VBN how_WRB to_TO control_VB our_PRP$ activities_NNS ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB the_DT same_JJ as_IN young_JJ lads_NNS do_VBP since_IN they_PRP know_VBP life_NN and_CC the_DT consequences_NNS they_PRP limit_VBP themselves_PRP to_TO major_JJ extend_VBP ._.
Every_DT person_NN has_VBZ his_PRP$ own_JJ view_NN ._.
According_VBG to_TO me_PRP we_PRP enjoy_VBP a_DT lot_NN in_IN youn_NN
