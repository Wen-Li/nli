The_DT difinitive_JJ difference_NN between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS does_VBZ not_RB exist_VB and_CC to_TO make_VB this_DT difinition_NN is_VBZ difficult_JJ ._.
Also_RB ,_, to_TO decide_VB which_WDT is_VBZ more_RBR enjyoable_JJ is_VBZ more_RBR complexed_VBN issue_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR energetic_JJ and_CC full_JJ of_IN dreams_NNS ,_, while_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP at_IN ease_NN and_CC satisfied_JJ ,_, although_IN such_JJ differences_NNS depend_VBP on_IN the_DT situations_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ abilities_NNS and_CC lives_NNS ._.
I_PRP will_MD take_VB the_DT position_NN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS ,_, and_CC discuss_VB it_PRP below_IN ._.
The_DT most_RBS important_JJ charecteristic_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS is_VBZ the_DT money_NN and_CC time_NN ._.
Most_JJS successful_JJ people_NNS has_VBZ much_JJ maney_NN and_CC much_JJ time_NN in_IN their_PRP$ elerly_JJ lives_NNS ._.
Even_RB younger_JJR people_NNS such_JJ as_IN famous_JJ enterpreneurers_NNS are_VBP wealthy_JJ but_CC they_PRP must_MD be_VB busy_JJ and_CC have_VBP rare_JJ time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ time_NN laxuarily_RB ._.
Older_JJR and_CC rich_JJ people_NNS have_VBP both_DT maney_NN and_CC time_NN ,_, these_DT are_VBP valuable_JJ only_RB when_WRB the_DT both_DT are_VBP gained_VBN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS with_IN maney_NN and_CC time_NN would_MD be_VB satisfied_VBN with_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS and_CC what_WP they_PRP have_VBP done_VBN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ natural_JJ that_IN not_RB all_DT older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP satisfied_VBN with_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS because_IN there_EX are_VBP different_JJ standards_NNS of_IN values_NNS ._.
However_RB ,_, most_JJS people_NNS are_VBP not_RB regrettful_JJ and_CC satisfied_JJ with_IN what_WP they_PRP have_VBP done_VBN ._.
Such_JJ feeling_NN are_VBP difficult_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO accomplish_VB when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, and_CC such_PDT a_DT way_NN of_IN thinking_VBG are_VBP the_DT origin_NN of_IN senir_NN volunteer_NN and_CC their_PRP$ donation_NN for_IN some_DT foundations_NNS ._.
The_DT older_JJR people_NNS with_IN maney_NN and_CC time_NN will_MD also_RB have_VB many_JJ friends_NNS who_WP are_VBP at_IN the_DT situations_NNS like_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS ._.
When_WRB they_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, they_PRP have_VBP to_TO work_VB for_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS and_CC for_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP have_VBP less_JJR time_NN to_TO enj_VB
