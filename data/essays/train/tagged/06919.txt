If_IN someone_NN asked_VBD you_PRP ,_, ``_`` What_WP would_MD life_NN be_VB like_IN today_NN if_IN we_PRP did_VBD not_RB have_VB technology_NN ?_. ''_''
Would_MD you_PRP be_VB able_JJ to_TO answer_VB it_PRP ?_.
Computers_NNS ,_, cellular_JJ phones_NNS ,_, television_NN ,_, and_CC iPods_NNS are_VBP all_DT examples_NNS of_IN success_NN in_IN technology_NN the_DT people_NNS have_VBP made_VBN today_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP all_DT become_VBP a_DT part_NN of_IN our_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, and_CC it_PRP would_MD be_VB difficult_JJ to_TO live_VB without_IN them_PRP ._.
Thanks_NNS to_TO the_DT inventers_NNS who_WP invented_VBD them_PRP ,_, we_PRP know_VBP the_DT lives_NNS that_IN we_PRP are_VBP spending_VBG today_NN ._.
Although_IN some_DT people_NNS never_RB succeed_VB in_IN something_NN no_DT matter_NN how_WRB much_RB they_PRP try_VBP ,_, people_NNS who_WP do_VBP succeed_VB in_IN something_NN ,_, are_VBP always_RB working_VBG hard_RB in_IN it_PRP ._.
They_PRP have_VBP imagination_NN as_RB well_RB as_IN curiousity_NN ._.
Without_IN imagination_NN ,_, people_NNS would_MD never_RB be_VB able_JJ to_TO think_VB of_IN something_NN new_JJ ._.
One_CD could_MD always_RB fail_VB ,_, but_CC failing_VBG opens_VBZ up_RP a_DT new_JJ path_NN to_TO success_NN ._.
I_PRP agree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_WDT successful_JJ people_NNS try_VBP new_JJ things_NNS and_CC take_VB risks_NNS ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, one_CD of_IN the_DT presidents_NNS of_IN the_DT United_NNP States_NNPS of_IN America_NNP ,_, Abraham_NNP Lincoln_NNP ,_, is_VBZ one_CD of_IN the_DT successful_JJ people_NNS who_WP took_VBD risks_NNS ,_, but_CC tries_VBZ to_TO things_NNS ._.
Abraham_NNP Lincoln_NNP lead_VB the_DT North_NNP union_NN of_IN the_DT US_NNP during_IN the_DT Civil_JJ War_NN ._.
He_PRP believed_VBD in_IN himself_PRP that_IN slavery_NN was_VBD wrong_JJ and_CC fought_VBN with_IN the_DT South_NNP ._.
He_PRP later_RB became_VBD president_NN and_CC officially_RB made_VBN slavery_NN illegal_JJ ._.
Back_RB in_IN his_PRP$ time_NN ,_, most_JJS of_IN the_DT US_NNP citizens_NNS of_IN the_DT South_NNP were_VBD against_IN him_PRP because_IN they_PRP lost_VBD there_EX servants_NNS and_CC workers_NNS ._.
However_RB presently_RB ,_, Lincoln_NNP is_VBZ considered_VBN one_CD of_IN the_DT most_RBS important_JJ leaders_NNS in_IN world_NN history_NN ._.
He_PRP risked_VBD his_PRP$ own_JJ life_NN and_CC future_NN to_TO stop_VB slavery_NN ,_, and_CC by_IN making_VBG a_DT step_NN towards_IN complete_JJ equality_NN of_IN men_NNS ,_, such_JJ as_IN colored_VBN people_NNS and_CC non-colored_JJ people_NNS ._.
Those_DT who_WP succeed_VBP are_VBP always_RB imaginative_JJ ,_, hard_JJ workers_NNS ,_, and_CC take_VB risks_NNS ._.
They_PRP do_VBP not_RB fear_VB mistakes_NNS and_CC always_RB believe_VBP in_IN what_WP they_PRP are_VBP doing_VBG ._.
People_NNS who_WP fail_VBP to_TO do_VB so_RB ,_, are_VBP the_DT people_NNS who_WP will_MD not_RB reach_VB their_PRP$ goal_NN ._.
Experience_NN many_JJ things_NNS ,_, and_CC make_VB a_DT new_JJ discovery_NN !_.
It_PRP could_MD change_VB your_PRP$ future_NN ._.
