I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Now_RB ,_, to_TO make_VB the_DT statement_NN clearly_RB ,_, I_PRP define_VBP the_DT age_NN of_IN each_DT people_NNS ._.
I_PRP set_VBP the_DT age_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS around_IN 20_CD ,_, and_CC the_DT age_NN of_IN older_JJR people_NNS around_IN 60_CD ._.
I_PRP can_MD not_RB decide_VB which_WDT people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_RBR because_IN both_DT of_IN them_PRP has_VBZ different_JJ kind_NN of_IN things_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ life_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO compare_VB some_DT points_NNS ._.
The_DT ordinary_JJ differences_NNS between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP the_DT phisical_JJ ability_NN ,_, the_DT quantity_NN of_IN money_NN ,_, the_DT variety_NN of_IN the_DT experience_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
Now_RB ,_, I_PRP compare_VBP these_DT things_NNS between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, as_IN to_TO the_DT phisical_JJ ability_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS has_VBZ more_JJR ability_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
So_RB ,_, we_PRP can_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS such_JJ as_IN sports_NNS or_CC dancing_VBG all_DT night_NN or_CC other_JJ thing_NN which_WDT needs_VBZ energy_NN ._.
second_RB ,_, as_IN to_TO money_NN ,_, most_JJS older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR money_NN than_IN they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
So_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB more_JJR than_IN young_JJ people_NNS when_WRB doing_VBG something_NN costs_VBZ a_DT lot_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, my_PRP$ parents_NNS enjoys_VBZ their_PRP$ life_NN with_IN using_VBG more_JJR money_NN than_IN it_PRP used_VBD to_TO be_VB ._.
They_PRP go_VBP to_TO the_DT restrant_JJ often_RB and_CC eat_VB delicious_JJ meat_NN ,_, and_CC they_PRP go_VBP to_TO concert_NN or_CC see_VB the_DT show_NN ._.
These_DT things_NNS are_VBP costs_NNS too_RB much_RB for_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB often_RB ._.
Third_NNP ,_, the_DT quality_NN of_IN experience_NN is_VBZ greatly_RB differd_JJ between_IN young_JJ people_NNS and_CC older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Because_IN Young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP not_RB know_VB various_JJ things_NNS in_IN the_DT society_NN yet_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD experience_VB new_JJ things_NNS everyday_JJ ._.
So_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP knowing_VBG new_JJ things_NNS ,_, new_JJ people_NNS ,_, new_JJ ways_NNS of_IN thinking_NN ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD live_VB with_IN their_PRP$ various_JJ experiences_NNS for_IN their_PRP$ long_JJ life_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT 60_CD years_NNS ,_, they_PRP experienced_VBD various_JJ kinds_NNS of_IN things_NNS which_WDT the_DT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP not_RB expereinced_VBN yet_RB ._.
So_RB ,_, they_PRP know_VBP more_RBR enjoyable_JJ things_NNS than_IN young_JJ people_NNS ._.
Considering_VBG these_DT points_NNS ,_, I_PRP can_MD not_RB say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Both_DT people_NNS enjoys_VBZ their_PRP$ own_JJ life_NN with_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ steps_NNS ._.
