Most_JJS people_NNS would_MD say_VB that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR that_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP based_VBN on_IN the_DT fact_NN that_IN young_JJ healthy_JJ people_NNS have_VBP all_DT their_PRP$ lives_NNS in_IN front_NN of_IN us_PRP and_CC are_VBP never_RB eager_JJ to_TO experience_VB more_JJR and_CC more_RBR things_NNS ._.
As_IN far_RB as_IN I_PRP am_VBP concerned_JJ ,_, I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN this_DT statement_NN ._.
Indeed_RB ,_, whereas_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO face_VB life_NN difficulties_NNS ,_, the_DT elderly_JJ have_VBP not_RB to_TO deal_VB with_IN stressful_JJ life_NN anymore_RB since_IN they_PRP are_VBP retired_VBN ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP the_DT rest_NN of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO share_VB love_NN with_IN their_PRP$ family_NN ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, when_WRB you_PRP are_VBP young_JJ ,_, you_PRP are_VBP facing_VBG a_DT lot_NN of_IN paramount_JJ difficulties_NNS and_CC choices_NNS such_JJ as_IN the_DT employment_NN and_CC nowadays_RB ,_, unemployement_NN ,_, the_DT right_JJ person_NN you_PRP will_MD marry_VB ,_, how_WRB many_JJ children_NNS you_PRP really_RB want_VBP ,_, how_WRB you_PRP will_MD manage_VB to_TO earn_VB enough_JJ money_NN to_TO feed_VB your_PRP$ family_NN and_CC buy_VB your_PRP$ house_NN and_CC so_RB on_IN ._.
Is_VBZ it_PRP still_RB obvious_JJ that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR one_CD ?_.
Indeed_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP overcome_VBN these_DT kinds_NNS of_IN difficulties_NNS and_CC are_VBP becoming_VBG more_RBR peaceful_JJ in_IN their_PRP$ mind_NN than_IN in_IN their_PRP$ youth_NN period_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP nurtered_VBN a_DT long-time_JJ experience_NN ,_, thereby_RB implying_VBG they_PRP have_VBP learned_VBN from_IN their_PRP$ mistakes_NNS and_CC are_VBP accomplised_VBN individuals_NNS ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, if_IN someone_NN were_VBD not_RB completely_RB satisfied_VBN with_IN his_PRP$ wife/her_NN husband_NN ,_, he/she_NN has_VBZ probably_RB divorced_VBN and_CC got_VBD married_VBN to_TO another_DT person_NN and_CC currently_RB living_VBG with_IN her/him_NN ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, in_IN comparison_NN with_IN his_PRP$ previous_JJ marriage_NN ,_, the_DT person_NN will_MD obviously_RB say_VB that_IN he_PRP is_VBZ enjoying_VBG life_NN more_JJR than_IN he_PRP did_VBD on_IN previous_JJ times_NNS ._.
Moreover_RB ,_, their_PRP$ job_NN experience_NN and_CC relating_VBG stressful_JJ live_JJ is_VBZ behind_IN them_PRP ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS could_MD be_VB retired_VBN with_IN their_PRP$ accumulated_VBN money_NN earned_VBN during_IN their_PRP$ employement_NN period_NN where_WRB they_PRP zerre_VBP young_JJ ._.
Although_IN they_PRP could_MD not_RB afford_VB what_WP they_PRP want_VBP when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ,_, they_PRP usually_RB have_VBP enough_JJ time_NN and_CC money_NN to_TO buy_VB what_WP they_PRP really_RB want_VBP ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB dedicated_VBN to_TO their_PRP$ work_NN ,_, this_DT leading_VBG to_TO forget_VB their_PRP$ wife/husband_NN and_CC children_NNS ._.
The_DT main_JJ goal_NN is_VBZ to_TO earn_VB money_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO live_VB happily_RB but_CC the_DT family_NN suffer_VBP from_IN this_DT behavior_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP settled_VBN in_IN life_NN and_CC have_VBP usually_RB earnt_JJ enough_JJ money_NN to_TO share_VB it_PRP with_IN their_PRP$ entire_JJ family_NN and_CC spend_VB more_JJR time_NN on_IN holidays_NNS with_IN them_PRP ._.
For_IN all_PDT the_DT above-stated_JJ reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP contend_VBP that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
