I_PRP do_VBP not_RB agree_VB with_IN the_DT statement_NN ,_, mainly_RB for_IN three_CD reasons_NNS ._.
The_DT fist_NN one_CD is_VBZ that_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP lived_VBN much_RB more_RBR than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS have_VBP and_CC thus_RB they_PRP have_VBP more_RBR experience_NN in_IN life_NN ,_, the_DT second_JJ one_CD is_VBZ that_IN the_DT are_VBP more_RBR mature_JJ and_CC for_IN this_DT reason_NN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB extreme_JJ attitude_NN changes_NNS as_IN youngsters_NNS do_VBP and_CC the_DT last_JJ one_CD is_VBZ that_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_JJR money_NN to_TO spend_VB since_IN they_PRP are_VBP working_VBG ._.
With_IN the_DT experience_NN that_WDT old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ,_, I_PRP mean_VBP that_IN they_PRP have_VBP experienced_VBN many_JJ feelings_NNS and_CC have_VBP been_VBN in_IN many_JJ situations_NNS that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP not_RB ,_, and_CC then_RB ,_, they_PRP can_MD take_VB the_DT maximum_NN of_IN each_DT day_NN ,_, the_DT enjoy_VB any_DT moment_NN because_IN they_PRP know_VBP that_IN certain_JJ situations_NNS will_MD never_RB be_VB repeated_VBN ,_, they_PRP use_VBP to_TO see_VB the_DT future_NN and_CC prepare_VB for_IN it_PRP while_IN young_JJ people_NNS just_RB want_VBP to_TO live_VB day_NN by_IN day_NN ,_, not_RB worring_VBG about_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
My_PRP$ second_JJ reason_NN is_VBZ that_IN older_JJR people_NNS are_VBP more_RBR matture_NN and_CC thus_RB they_PRP do_VBP not_RB have_VB that_DT radical_JJ changes_NNS in_IN attitude_NN that_WDT young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP ._.
Enjoying_VBG of_IN this_DT stability_NN provides_VBZ old_JJ people_NNS with_IN a_DT great_JJ advantage_NN that_WDT can_MD be_VB used_VBN to_TO dedicate_VB the_DT exact_JJ ammount_NN of_IN time_NN to_TO each_DT activity_NN ,_, not_RB wasting_VBG time_NN like_IN youngsters_NNS do_VBP ._.
Also_RB ,_, this_DT characteristic_JJ is_VBZ important_JJ in_IN order_NN to_TO keep_VB risks_NNS away_RB by_IN making_VBG the_DT correct_JJ decisions_NNS and_CC to_TO avoid_VB doing_VBG stupid_JJ things_NNS ._.
Finally_RB and_CC not_RB less_RBR important_JJ is_VBZ the_DT factor_NN of_IN the_DT money_NN ._.
I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO mention_VB the_DT importance_NN of_IN having_VBG financial_JJ stability_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN doing_VBG what_WP we_PRP like_VBP ._.
An_DT old_JJ person_NN has_VBZ the_DT opportunity_NN to_TO wok_VB hard_JJ and_CC save_VB money_NN to_TO take_VB some_DT vacations_NNS or_CC tavel_VB around_IN the_DT world_NN while_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN rarely_RB has_VBZ this_DT opportunity_NN because_IN they_PRP are_VBP studiyng_VBG and_CC it_PRP is_VBZ hard_JJ for_IN them_PRP to_TO work_VB and_CC study_VB at_IN the_DT same_JJ time_NN ._.
Because_IN of_IN this_DT reason_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS can_MD really_RB enjoy_VB life_NN by_IN doing_VBG great_JJ activities_NNS that_WDT will_MD enrich_VB their_PRP$ person_NN ._.
As_IN a_DT conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO say_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP more_JJR the_DT life_NN than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
The_DT reasons_NNS I_PRP have_VBP presented_VBN are_VBP just_RB three_CD but_CC there_EX are_VBP many_JJ other_JJ that_WDT can_MD confirm_VB that_IN a_DT mature_JJ person_NN can_MD enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN the_DT life_NN while_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS can_MD be_VB just_RB living_VBG an_DT illusory_JJ hapiness_NN ._.
