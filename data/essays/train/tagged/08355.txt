In_IN the_DT same_JJ way_NN that_IN people_NNS from_IN different_JJ cultures_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN in_IN different_JJ ways_NNS ,_, I_PRP am_VBP convinced_VBN that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB life_NN just_RB as_RB much_JJ as_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
However_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP different_JJ things_NNS in_IN life_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN people_NNS change_VBP their_PRP$ definition_NN of_IN happiness_NN as_IN they_PRP grow_VBP older_JJR ._.
While_IN young_JJ people_NNS would_MD most_RBS likely_JJ associate_NN the_DT thought_NN of_IN enjoying_VBG life_NN with_IN the_DT practice_NN of_IN physical_JJ activities_NNS ,_, or_CC a_DT busy_JJ nightlife_NN ,_, I_PRP am_VBP tempted_VBN to_TO believe_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS would_MD tend_VB to_TO relate_VB enjoyment_NN to_TO more_JJR intellectual_JJ activitites_NNS such_JJ as_IN reading_NN ,_, writing_VBG ,_, or_CC any_DT artistic_JJ activity_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP financial_JJ resources_NNS that_WDT allow_VBP them_PRP to_TO do_VB things_NNS that_IN they_PRP were_VBD not_RB able_JJ to_TO do_VB when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD younger_JJR ._.
For_IN instance_NN ,_, older_JJR people_NNS generally_RB have_VBP a_DT more_JJR significant_JJ budget_NN to_TO travel_VB all_DT over_IN the_DT world_NN ._.
I_PRP can_MD still_RB remember_VB spending_NN entire_JJ summers_NNS working_VBG in_IN construction_NN in_IN order_NN to_TO pay_VB for_IN my_PRP$ extra-curricular_JJ activites_NNS during_IN the_DT academic_JJ year_NN ._.
Now_RB ,_, I_PRP have_VBP the_DT ability_NN to_TO take_VB several_JJ weeks_NNS off_RB and_CC spend_VB all_DT my_PRP$ time_NN traveling_VBG to_TO foreign_JJ countries_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, I_PRP am_VBP convinced_VBN that_IN you_PRP only_RB enjoy_VBP life_NN once_RB you_PRP really_RB understand_VBP its_PRP$ value_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR experience_NN ,_, and_CC understand_VB the_DT value_NN of_IN friendship_NN ,_, community_NN and_CC other_JJ things_NNS that_WDT make_VBP anyone_NN 's_POS life_NN enjoyable_JJ ._.
I_PRP would_MD argue_VB that_IN younger_JJR people_NNS do_VBP not_RB always_RB have_VBP the_DT same_JJ ability_NN to_TO step_VB back_RB and_CC enjoy_VB what_WP they_PRP have_VBP in_IN the_DT than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
I_PRP remember_VBP that_IN I_PRP would_MD only_RB care_VB about_IN sports_NNS while_IN I_PRP was_VBD in_IN high_JJ school_NN ._.
Although_IN the_DT feeling_NN of_IN being_VBG a_DT performant_JJ athlete_NN provided_VBD many_JJ opportunities_NNS to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ,_, I_PRP look_VBP at_IN it_PRP differently_RB now_RB ._.
When_WRB I_PRP think_VBP about_IN these_DT times_NNS ,_, I_PRP think_VBP about_IN how_WRB I_PRP could_MD have_VB enjoyed_VBN this_DT experience_NN more_RBR thoroughly_RB if_IN I_PRP had_VBD been_VBN more_RBR mature_JJ ._.
In_IN conclusion_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD strongly_RB argue_VB that_IN older_JJR people_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB just_RB as_RB much_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ just_RB a_DT matter_NN of_IN defining_VBG your_PRP$ expectations_NNS from_IN life_NN ,_, and_CC having_VBG the_DT ablity_NN to_TO understand_VB your_PRP$ own_JJ happiness_NN ._.
