I_PRP agree_VBP the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX are_VBP two_CD reason_NN for_IN this_DT ,_, physical_JJ strength_NN and_CC less_JJR responsibility_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, generally_RB youg_JJ people_NNS have_VBP better_JJR physical_JJ condition_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
With_IN a_DT time_NN has_VBZ past_RB ,_, people_NNS become_VBP to_TO get_VB aged_JJ and_CC the_DT pysical_JJ conditon_NN become_VBN worth_JJ ._.
Having_VBG strong_JJ condition_NN give_VB young_JJ people_NNS more_JJR time_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ possibel_JJ for_IN healty_JJ young_JJ people_NNS to_TO get_VB up_RB early_RB in_IN a_DT morning_NN ,_, drive_NN to_TO mountain_NN ,_, enjoy_VB picnic_NN ,_, and_CC have_VBP a_DT party_NN after_IN comming_VBG back_RB from_IN picnic_NN ._.
Physical_JJ strengh_NNS give_VBP young_JJ people_NNS possible_JJ to_TO use_VB their_PRP$ time_NN tightly_RB ._.
Same_JJ 2_CD days_NNS weekend_NN means_VBZ different_JJ for_IN those_DT tough_JJ youth_NN and_CC tired_JJ old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Next_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO have_VB less_JJR responsibility_NN in_IN family_NN and_CC society_NN compare_VBP with_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Single_JJ young_JJ people_NNS just_RB need_VBP to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN themselves_PRP ._.
That_DT means_VBZ cost_NN for_IN living_NN is_VBZ not_RB high_JJ ,_, so_IN that_IN they_PRP can_MD chose_VBD their_PRP$ job_NN by_IN thier_NN own_JJ idea_NN ._.
If_IN they_PRP do_VBP not_RB like_VB the_DT job_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD quit_VB a_DT job_NN and_CC look_VB for_IN another_DT ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ easy_JJ for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO live_VB alone_RB ._.
But_CC for_IN old_JJ peple_NN ,_, specially_RB have_VBP family_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ totally_RB different_JJ ._.
They_PRP have_VBP a_DT responsiblity_NN to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN their_PRP$ families_NNS ._.
If_IN the_DT one_CD who_WP wants_VBZ to_TO quite_RB a_DT job_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ not_RB easy_JJ to_TO decide_VB ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO finde_VB a_DT job_NN that_WDT pay_VBP them_PRP much_RB enough_RB to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN their_PRP$ families_NNS ._.
In_IN society_NN ,_, more_JJR old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP higher_JJR position_NN than_IN yong_JJ people_NNS ._.
Those_DT higher_JJR position_NN also_RB give_VBP high_JJ pressure_NN to_TO old_JJ people_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP to_TO take_VB care_NN of_IN not_RB only_RB their_PRP$ families_NNS but_CC also_RB their_PRP$ staff_NN in_IN their_PRP$ organizations_NNS ._.
Because_IN of_IN those_DT two_CD reasons_NNS ,_, I_PRP agree_VBP the_DT idea_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP thier_JJR life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
