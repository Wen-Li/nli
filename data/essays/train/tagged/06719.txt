I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN the_DT idea_NN that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO have_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS than_IN to_TO specialize_VB in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_JJ firstly_RB because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ impractical_JJ to_TO have_VB knowledge_NN on_IN many_JJ issues_NNS ,_, and_CC secondly_RB because_IN broad_JJ knowledge_NN may_MD not_RB be_VB enough_RB for_IN the_DT solution_NN of_IN a_DT problem_NN and_CC it_PRP does_VBZ not_RB promote_VB development_NN ._.
I_PRP think_VBP having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN various_JJ different_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS would_MD be_VB a_DT very_RB time_NN consuming_JJ attempt_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN in_IN my_PRP$ study_NN of_IN expertise_NN which_WDT is_VBZ psychology_NN ,_, noone_NN can_MD be_VB expected_VBN even_RB to_TO know_VB the_DT subfields_NNS of_IN the_DT area_NN ._.
There_EX are_VBP verious_JJ areas_NNS under_IN the_DT large_JJ area_NN of_IN psychology_NN like_IN cognitive_JJ psychology_NN ,_, developmental_JJ psychology_NN and_CC social_JJ psychology_NN ._.
It_PRP is_VBZ impossible_JJ for_IN a_DT person_NN to_TO learn_VB all_DT from_IN these_DT issues_NNS since_IN there_EX are_VBP manay_NN issues_NNS that_WDT needs_VBZ covering_VBG even_RB in_IN a_DT broad_JJ way_NN ._.
And_CC if_IN we_PRP think_VBP wider_JJR of_IN academic_JJ subjects_NNS like_IN physics_NNS ,_, chemistry_NN and_CC not_RB the_DT subfields_NNS of_IN a_DT specific_JJ subject_NN it_PRP even_RB becomes_VBZ more_JJR impractical_JJ to_TO possess_VB a_DT general_JJ knowledge_NN about_IN them_PRP ._.
Another_DT problem_NN with_IN having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN is_VBZ regards_VBZ to_TO its_PRP$ sufficiency_NN ._.
Most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN we_PRP can_MD not_RB expect_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN to_TO help_VB in_IN specific_JJ cases_NNS ._.
If_IN we_PRP take_VBP the_DT area_NN of_IN health_NN and_CC medicine_NN we_PRP can_MD see_VB alot_NNS of_IN specialization_NN ._.
When_WRB we_PRP have_VBP a_DT health_NN problem_NN we_PRP are_VBP usually_RB redirected_VBN to_TO a_DT specialist_NN by_IN the_DT general_JJ doctor_NN because_IN the_DT amount_NN of_IN knowledge_NN of_IN the_DT general_JJ doctor_NN is_VBZ not_RB enough_JJ to_TO help_VB us_PRP ._.
We_PRP need_VBP people_NNS who_WP are_VBP specialized_VBN in_IN their_PRP$ area_NN to_TO help_VB us_PRP since_IN they_PRP are_VBP the_DT only_JJ ones_NNS with_IN the_DT adequte_JJ amount_NN of_IN information_NN ._.
Having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS is_VBZ also_RB problematic_JJ for_IN the_DT development_NN of_IN science_NN ._.
We_PRP need_VBP more_RBR specialization_NN on_IN a_DT subject_JJ becaue_NN we_PRP need_VBP accumulation_NN of_IN knowledge_NN for_IN a_DT development_NN ._.
Accumulation_NNP of_IN knowledge_NN can_MD be_VB maintained_VBN only_RB by_IN specialization_NN on_IN a_DT subject_JJ however_RB with_IN a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN you_PRP can_MD not_RB expect_VB to_TO come_VB up_RP with_IN something_NN new_JJ and_CC to_TO contribute_VB to_TO the_DT knowledge_NN pool_NN ._.
Specialization_NN on_IN a_DT subject_NN is_VBZ better_JJR than_IN having_VBG a_DT broad_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ academic_JJ subjects_NNS because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR possible_JJ to_TO achieve_VB that_DT knowledge_NN in_IN a_DT life_NN time_NN ,_, it_PRP is_VBZ more_RBR effecient_JJ and_CC sufficient_JJ for_IN the_DT solving_VBG of_IN a_DT problem_NN and_CC it_PRP promotes_VBZ the_DT development_NN of_IN the_DT area_NN by_IN giving_VBG a_DT chance_NN of_IN discovery_NN and_CC to_TO the_DT accumulation_NN of_IN knowledge_NN ._.
