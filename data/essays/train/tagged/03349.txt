Although_IN I_PRP can_MD understand_VB why_WRB some_DT peolpe_NN have_VBP the_DT impression_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS today_NN are_VBP not_RB engaging_VBG themselves_PRP enough_RB to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ,_, I_PRP disagree_VBP with_IN this_DT statement_NN ._.
I_PRP have_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS for_IN my_PRP$ opinion_NN ._.
First_RB ,_, in_IN my_PRP$ view_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO dedicate_VB most_JJS of_IN their_PRP$ time_NN to_TO their_PRP$ education_NN and_CC career_NN ._.
As_IN the_DT unemployment_NN rate_NN in_IN most_JJS countries_NNS increases_VBZ year_NN after_IN year_NN this_DT is_VBZ the_DT only_JJ way_NN for_IN young_JJ people_NNS to_TO asure_VB themselves_PRP a_DT job_NN in_IN the_DT future_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO attend_VB college_NN or_CC university_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP classes_NNS during_IN the_DT day_NN and_CC usually_RB homework_NN to_TO do_VB in_IN the_DT evening_NN ._.
Some_DT students_NNS also_RB have_VBP to_TO work_VB part-time_JJ to_TO be_VB able_JJ to_TO afford_VB the_DT university_NN fees_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, a_DT lot_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP planing_VBG their_PRP$ own_JJ family_NN when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP still_RB young_JJ ._.
When_WRB you_PRP have_VBP children_NNS on_IN your_PRP$ own_JJ you_PRP need_VBP time_NN to_TO raise_VB them_PRP ._.
Children_NNS need_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN attention_NN as_IN they_PRP always_RB have_VBP so_RB many_JJ questions_NNS about_IN the_DT world_NN and_CC a_DT lot_NN of_IN reasearch_NN papers_NNS state_VBP that_IN the_DT intellectual_JJ capabilities_NNS of_IN children_NNS are_VBP influenced_VBN most_RBS at_IN a_DT very_RB young_JJ age_NN ._.
So_RB parents_NNS should_MD take_VB all_PDT the_DT time_NN they_PRP need_VBP to_TO raise_VB their_PRP$ children_NNS and_CC explain_VB everything_NN to_TO them_PRP ._.
Finally_RB ,_, I_PRP am_VBP convinced_VBN that_IN even_RB though_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP not_RB have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN free_JJ time_NN ,_, still_RB many_JJ of_IN them_PRP do_VBP engage_VB themselves_PRP to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO give_VB two_CD examples_NNS of_IN the_DT community_NN I_PRP live_VBP in_IN ._.
In_IN our_PRP$ community_NN especially_RB young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP part_NN of_IN the_DT First_NNP Aid_NNP Team_NNP of_IN the_DT local_JJ Red_NNP Cross_NNP ._.
They_PRP spend_VBP their_PRP$ time_NN doing_VBG different_JJ volunteer_NN services_NNS ,_, like_IN medical_JJ help_NN or_CC entertainement_NN for_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Furthermore_RB ,_, the_DT Fire_NNP Department_NNP of_IN our_PRP$ town_NN has_VBZ a_DT special_JJ youth_NN organization_NN for_IN people_NNS aged_VBN below_IN 17_CD years_NNS ._.
For_IN the_DT last_JJ five_CD years_NNS the_DT volunteer_NN members_NNS of_IN this_DT youth_NN organization_NN have_VBP increased_VBN steadily_RB ._.
Concluding_VBG ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS today_NN have_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN important_JJ activities_NNS and_CC obligations_NNS like_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ education_NN or_CC the_DT founding_NN of_IN their_PRP$ own_JJ family_NN which_WDT prevent_VBP them_PRP from_IN giving_VBG more_JJR time_NN to_TO helping_VBG their_PRP$ communities_NNS ._.
But_CC I_PRP also_RB have_VBP the_DT impression_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS still_RB engage_VB in_IN their_PRP$ free_JJ time_NN as_IN much_JJ as_IN they_PRP can_MD to_TO improve_VB their_PRP$ communities_NNS '_POS conditions_NNS ._.
