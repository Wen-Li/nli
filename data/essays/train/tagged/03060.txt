This_DT essay_NN will_MD deal_VB with_IN the_DT question_NN whether_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
There_EX lies_VBZ a_DT certain_JJ provocation_NN in_IN this_DT question_NN because_IN young_JJ people_NNS are_VBP often_RB considered_VBN not_RB to_TO take_VB life_NN seriously_RB ._.
But_CC can_MD they_PRP actually_RB ?_.
Most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS in_IN the_DT Western_NNP World_NNP nowadays_RB grow_VB up_RP in_IN a_DT peaceful_JJ environment_NN ._.
They_PRP have_VBP enough_RB to_TO eat_VB ,_, get_VB good_JJ education_NN and_CC also_RB have_VBP enough_JJ sparetime_NN to_TO have_VB various_JJ hobbies_NNS -_: provided_VBN that_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS make_VBP a_DT good_JJ living_NN ._.
In_IN the_DT ideal_JJ case_NN ,_, there_EX is_VBZ not_RB much_JJ they_PRP should_MD worry_VB about_RB ._.
For_IN older_JJR people_NNS ,_, this_DT scenario_NN was_VBD not_RB true_JJ at_IN all_DT ._.
They_PRP grew_VBD up_RP after_IN times_NNS of_IN war_NN and_CC had_VBD to_TO become_VB adult_JJ much_JJ faster_JJR to_TO support_VB their_PRP$ families_NNS in_IN order_NN to_TO survive_VB ._.
They_PRP did_VBD not_RB have_VB what_WP we_PRP understand_VBP of_IN ``_`` childhood_NN ''_'' ._.
This_DT has_VBZ the_DT consequence_NN that_IN many_JJ older_JJR peolpe_NN never_RB had_VBD had_VBN that_IN chance_NN to_TO learn_VB what_WP it_PRP means_VBZ to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS often_RB miss_VBP the_DT pressure_NN to_TO take_VB life_NN seriously_RB because_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS never_RB showed_VBD them_PRP the_DT importance_NN of_IN doing_VBG so_RB ._.
There_EX is_VBZ a_DT problem_NN with_IN the_DT education_NN of_IN the_DT youth_NN ._.
Due_JJ to_TO the_DT fact_NN that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS had_VBD such_JJ a_DT hard_JJ time_NN when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ,_, they_PRP want_VBP to_TO make_VB the_DT lives_NNS of_IN their_PRP$ offspring_NN as_IN comfortable_JJ as_IN possible_JJ ._.
Unfortunately_RB ,_, thereby_RB they_PRP often_RB fail_VBP to_TO prepare_VB their_PRP$ offspring_NN for_IN ``_`` real_JJ life_NN ''_'' ._.
Instead_RB of_IN learning_VBG hard_JJ to_TO achieve_VB something_NN ,_, most_JJS young_JJ people_NNS worry_VBP too_RB much_JJ about_IN having_VBG fun_NN ._.
When_WRB they_PRP grew_VBD up_RB and_CC move_VB out_IN of_IN their_PRP$ parents_NNS '_POS home_NN ,_, they_PRP suddenly_RB face_VBP the_DT problem_NN that_IN they_PRP have_VBP to_TO organize_VB their_PRP$ own_JJ life_NN and_CC often_RB they_PRP fail_VBP ._.
So_IN I_PRP think_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS indeed_RB enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS and_CC that_IN this_DT fact_NN has_VBZ something_NN to_TO do_VB with_IN their_PRP$ education_NN ._.
Older_JJR people_NNS should_MD try_VB to_TO learn_VB from_IN them_PRP ,_, so_RB that_IN they_PRP are_VBP able_JJ to_TO relax_VB when_WRB they_PRP stop_VBP working_VBG ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, young_JJ people_NNS should_MD remind_VB themselves_PRP that_IN fun_NN alone_RB is_VBZ not_RB suited_VBN to_TO make_VB you_PRP happy_JJ in_IN the_DT lon_NN
