THE_DT OLDER_NNP THE_DT PEOPLE_NNP ,_, THE_DT MORE_JJR ENJOYABLE_JJ THE_DT LIFE_NN
Some_DT people_NNS believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP a_DT lot_NN more_JJR to_TO do_VB with_IN life_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS whereas_IN some_DT others_NNS think_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ the_DT opposite_JJ ._.
I_PRP guess_VBP as_IN a_DT young_JJ person_NN I_PRP am_VBP in_IN that_DT second_JJ group_NN thinking_VBG that_IN older_JJR people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN better_JJR than_IN we_PRP young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP for_IN a_DT number_NN of_IN reasons_NNS like_IN having_VBG more_RBR free_JJ time_NN ,_, more_JJR consciousness_NN about_IN the_DT value_NN of_IN the_DT time_NN concept_NN and_CC having_VBG better_JJR financial_JJ conditions_NNS ._.
People_NNS are_VBP born_VBN ,_, grow_VB a_DT little_JJ and_CC start_VB school_NN in_IN a_DT usual_JJ life_NN cycle_NN ._.
After_IN that_DT beginning_NN ,_, they_PRP usually_RB start_VBP working_VBG immediately_RB after_IN school_NN and_CC can_MD not_RB find_VB the_DT enough_JJ time_NN for_IN an_DT enjoyable_JJ life_NN ._.
Unfortunately_RB ,_, they_PRP find_VBP this_DT time_NN to_TO live_VB more_JJR enjoyably_RB only_RB after_IN years_NNS and_CC years_NNS ,_, at_IN the_DT time_NN they_PRP became_VBD old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB retired_VBN people_NNS who_WP have_VBP more_RBR spare_JJ time_NN to_TO live_VB as_IN they_PRP want_VBP ._.
In_IN addition_NN to_TO that_DT ,_, old_JJ people_NNS usually_RB are_VBP wiser_JJR than_IN the_DT young_JJ people_NNS and_CC as_IN a_DT consequence_NN of_IN their_PRP$ experinces_NNS and_CC advanced_VBD opinions_NNS about_IN the_DT life_NN ,_, they_PRP know_VBP the_DT importance_NN of_IN time_NN concept_NN and_CC how_WRB valuable_JJ an_DT effective_JJ time_NN usage_NN is_VBZ ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP that_IN this_DT would_MD help_VB them_PRP in_IN thinking_VBG twice_RB and_CC having_VBG a_DT more_RBR enjoyable_JJ life_NN in_IN a_DT better-managed_JJ time_NN period_NN than_IN young_JJ people_NNS can_MD do_VB ._.
Finally_RB ,_, since_IN old_JJ people_NNS are_VBP usually_RB retired_VBN people_NNS and_CC have_VBP money_NN from_IN their_PRP$ pension_NN funds_NNS or_CC their_PRP$ own_JJ savings_NNS from_IN their_PRP$ investments_NNS done_VBN in_IN the_DT previous_JJ years_NNS they_PRP would_MD have_VB a_DT bigger_JJR chance_NN the_DT enjoy_VB the_DT life_NN in_IN that_DT old_JJ age_NN ._.
At_IN that_DT point_NN ,_, I_PRP know_VBP that_IN people_NNS not_RB necessarily_RB have_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN to_TO live_VB more_JJR enjoyably_RB but_CC money_NN has_VBZ a_DT considerable_JJ effect_NN on_IN well_RB being_VBG and_CC more_JJR money_NN means_VBZ more_RBR opportunities_NNS to_TO evaluate_VB to_TO have_VB fun_NN or_CC to_TO enjoyment_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
To_TO sum_VB up_RP ,_, all_PDT these_DT reasons_NNS make_VBP me_PRP believe_VB that_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP more_RBR opportunities_NNS to_TO live_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS more_RBR enjoyably_RB than_IN younger_JJR people_NNS can_MD achieve_VB ._.
More_RBR free_JJ time_NN ,_, more_JJR consciousness_NN about_IN time_NN management_NN and_CC an_DT amount_NN of_IN money_NN that_WDT can_MD easily_RB spend_VB on_IN better_JJR opportunities_NNS of_IN an_DT enjoyable_JJ life_NN rather_RB than_IN only_RB survival_NN would_MD be_VB good_JJ assets_NNS for_IN a_DT better_JJR taste_NN in_IN life_NN ._.
