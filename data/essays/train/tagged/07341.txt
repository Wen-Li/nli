While_IN some_DT think_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO learn_VB many_JJ academic_JJ subject_NN ,_, others_NNS believe_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO major_JJ in_IN only_RB one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN ._.
I_PRP prefer_VBP the_DT latter_JJ idea_NN ,_, specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD tipical_JJ subject_NN ,_, for_IN three_CD reasons_NNS ._.
At_IN first_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN people_NNS who_WP majored_VBD in_IN one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN such_JJ as_IN law_NN and_CC medics_NNS are_VBP able_JJ to_TO earn_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, in_IN Japan_NNP ,_, lawyer_NN and_CC doctor_NN are_VBP high-classed_JJ professionals_NNS and_CC can_MD earn_VB much_JJ money_NN ._.
To_TO the_DT contrary_NN ,_, people_NNS who_WP do_VBP not_RB have_VB deep_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN specific_JJ subject_NN can_MD not_RB earn_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN ._.
To_TO tell_VB the_DT truth_NN ,_, I_PRP am_VBP a_DT officer_NN of_IN National_NNP Tax_NNP Agency_NNP in_IN Japan_NNP and_CC possess_VB broad_JJ knowledge_NN about_IN tax_NN especially_RB cooporate_JJ tax_NN ,_, so_IN I_PRP can_MD earn_VB 100000_CD dollers_NNS per_IN year_NN owe_VBP to_TO my_PRP$ knowledge_NN ._.
Second_RB ,_, the_DT reason_NN why_WRB I_PRP prefer_VBP to_TO specializing_VBG in_IN one_CD special_JJ subject_NN is_VBZ that_IN students_NNS can_MD enjoy_VB their_PRP$ university_NN life_NN ._.
If_IN they_PRP learn_VBP a_DT lot_NN of_IN academic_JJ subjects_NNS such_JJ as_IN economics_NNS ,_, history_NN and_CC mathematics_NN ,_, they_PRP have_VBP little_JJ time_NN to_TO use_VB freely_RB ._.
On_IN the_DT other_JJ hand_NN ,_, students_NNS who_WP study_VBP only_RB one_CD specific_JJ subject_JJ hard_JJ can_MD possess_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN time_NN ,_, so_IN they_PRP can_MD do_VB sports_NNS or_CC enjoy_VB their_PRP$ academic_JJ life_NN ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN students_NNS can_MD be_VB interesting_JJ in_IN studying_VBG if_IN they_PRP learn_VBP one_CD academic_JJ subject_JJ hardly_RB ._.
In_IN general_JJ ,_, people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO be_VB interesting_JJ the_DT subject_NN as_IN they_PRP study_VBP more_RBR hard_JJ and_CC deeper_RBR ._.
Thus_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP that_IN they_PRP will_MD be_VB taste_VB the_DT jo_NN about_IN studying_VBG ._.
Therefore_RB ,_, for_IN these_DT reasons_NNS I_PRP insist_VBP that_IN it_PRP is_VBZ better_JJR to_TO study_VB only_RB one_CD specific_JJ subject_NN than_IN to_TO learn_VB many_JJ academic_JJ subject_NN ._.
Through_IN my_PRP$ experiences_NNS ,_, I_PRP enjoyed_VBD my_PRP$ college_NN life_NN and_CC am_VBP be_VB able_JJ to_TO earn_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN money_NN because_IN I_PRP studied_VBD only_RB about_RB tax_NN ._.
