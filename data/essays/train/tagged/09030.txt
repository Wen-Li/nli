Education_NN is_VBZ something_NN which_WDT increases_VBZ the_DT self-esteem_NN and_CC improves_VBZ knowledge_NN of_IN the_DT one_CD who_WP tries_VBZ to_TO pursue_VB that_DT ._.
It_PRP also_RB increases_VBZ stature_NN ,_, which_WDT is_VBZ of_IN primary_JJ concern_NN in_IN today_NN 's_POS society_NN ._.
Given_VBN the_DT two_CD options_NNS ,_, it_PRP would_MD not_RB be_VB a_DT good_JJ idea_NN to_TO deal_VB these_DT two_CD options_NNS in_IN the_DT same_JJ way_NN ._.
So_RB ,_, I_PRP would_MD like_VB to_TO view_VB this_DT topic_NN in_IN two_CD different_JJ ways_NNS :_:
1.Undergraduate_NN level_NN
2.Graduate_NN level_NN
First_RB ,_, during_IN undergraduate_JJ studies_NNS ,_, a_DT student_NN has_VBZ to_TO learn_VB a_DT wide_JJ variety_NN of_IN subjects_NNS because_IN it_PRP is_VBZ the_DT high_JJ time_NN for_IN him_PRP to_TO learn_VB the_DT basics_NNS ._.
If_IN he_PRP does_VBZ not_RB study_VB many_JJ subjects_NNS ,_, there_EX wont_VBP be_VB a_DT difference_NN between_IN him_PRP and_CC uneducated_JJ person_NN ._.
After_IN all_DT ,_, everybody_NN expects_VBZ him_PRP to_TO be_VB familiar_JJ with_IN all_PDT the_DT related_JJ subjects_NNS present_JJ in_IN a_DT stream_NN ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, a_DT Mechanical_JJ Engineer_NN is_VBZ assumed_VBN to_TO have_VB knowledge_NN about_IN thermal_JJ ,_, production_NN ,_, design_NN ,_, material_NN sciences_NNS and_CC many_JJ more_JJR subjects_NNS related_JJ to_TO his_PRP$ mechanical_JJ stream_NN ._.
Because_IN all_PDT these_DT depend_VBP upon_IN one_CD another_DT ,_, it_PRP becomes_VBZ absolute_JJ necessity_NN to_TO learn_VB the_DT fundamentals_NNS of_IN all_PDT these_DT in_IN order_NN to_TO excel_VB in_IN mechanical_JJ field_NN ._.
And_CC the_DT same_JJ is_VBZ true_JJ about_IN all_PDT the_DT remaining_VBG streams_NNS too_RB ._.
There_EX is_VBZ one_CD more_JJR disadvantage_NN ,_, If_IN he_PRP studies_VBZ only_RB one_CD subject_NN at_IN this_DT part_NN of_IN his_PRP$ life_NN ,_, he_PRP would_MD probably_RB find_VB it_PRP boring_JJ and_CC insipid_JJ as_IN time_NN passes_VBZ ,_, and_CC would_MD definitely_RB end_VB up_RP becoming_VBG nothing_NN in_IN his_PRP$ life_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, during_IN graduate_JJ level_NN ,_, it_PRP would_MD be_VB a_DT better_JJR option_NN to_TO select_VB any_DT one_CD of_IN the_DT subjects_NNS he_PRP is_VBZ familiar_JJ with_IN ,_, and_CC deal_NN with_IN that_DT particular_JJ subject_NN in_IN detail_NN ._.
Then_RB ,_, he_PRP will_MD gain_VB in-depth_JJ knowledge_NN about_IN a_DT subject_JJ and_CC that_IN can_MD help_VB him_PRP in_IN achieving_VBG a_DT good_JJ job_NN in_IN his_PRP$ respective_JJ domain_NN ._.
Later_RB on_IN ,_, even_RB if_IN he_PRP finds_VBZ the_DT domain_NN boring_NN ,_, he_PRP can_MD drift_VB towards_IN different_JJ subject_NN because_IN he_PRP has_VBZ the_DT fundamental_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN many_JJ subjects_NNS ._.
keeping_VBG these_DT two_CD choices_NNS in_IN view_NN ,_, I_PRP would_MD suggest_VB to_TO gain_VB basic_JJ fundamentals_NNS in_IN your_PRP$ undergraduate_JJ level_NN and_CC then_RB go_VB on_IN search_NN for_IN a_DT topic_NN which_WDT fascinates_VBZ you_PRP and_CC then_RB pursue_VB in-depth_JJ knowledge_NN of_IN that_DT particular_JJ subject_NN in_IN your_PRP$ graduate_NN and_CC doctoral_JJ level_NN ._.
In_IN this_DT way_NN ,_, you_PRP can_MD become_VB a_DT jack_NN of_IN all_DT trades_NNS ,_, and_CC ,_, indeed_RB a_DT master_NN of_IN few_JJ too_RB ._.
