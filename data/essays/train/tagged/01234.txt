Altough_NNP the_DT main_JJ aspect_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN is_VBZ enjoyment_NN and_CC happiness_NN ,_, i_FW strongly_RB agree_VBP with_IN the_DT spekers_NNS statement_NN ._.
the_DT enjoyment_NN in_IN the_DT life_NN can_MD change_VB many_JJ situations_NNS and_CC most_JJS part_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN depends_VBZ on_IN happiness_NN because_IN of_IN the_DT results_NNS that_WDT come_VBP what_WP we_PRP have_VBP expected_VBN ._.
there_EX are_VBP many_JJ reasons_NNS and_CC examples_NNS to_TO strenthen_VB my_PRP$ statement_NN that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP lot_NN in_IN there_EX life_NN rather_RB than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
Firstly_RB ,_, the_DT young_JJ people_NNS mostly_RB enjoy_VBP there_EX life_NN in_IN college_NN education_NN because_IN there_EX will_MD be_VB no_DT burdens_NNS on_IN them_PRP and_CC they_PRP try_VBP to_TO spend_VB most_JJS of_IN the_DT time_NN to_TO enjoy_VB life_NN ._.
for_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP offen_VBP go_VB to_TO picnic_NN 's_POS or_CC tours_NNS when_WRB they_PRP are_VBP free_JJ and_CC another_DT is_VBZ there_EX will_MD no_DT stress_NN or_CC tension_NN in_IN there_EX younger_JJR life_NN and_CC most_RBS enjoyable_JJ time_NN for_IN youger_NN ones_NNS is_VBZ ,_, when_WRB the_DT expected_VBN results_NNS will_MD acheive_VB in_IN there_EX life_NN ._.
Secondly_RB ,_, the_DT enjoyment_NN will_MD be_VB more_RBR in_IN younger_JJR people_NNS rather_RB than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
for_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP frequent_JJ go_VB to_TO the_DT tours_NNS and_CC go_VB to_TO the_DT pictures_NNS because_IN they_PRP are_VBP not_RB having_VBG any_DT burdens_NNS and_CC responsibilities_NNS like_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
since_IN i_FW am_VBP young_JJ i_FW know_VBP the_DT enjoyment_NN of_IN life_NN in_IN these_DT stage_NN ._.
another_DT example_NN is_VBZ that_IN they_PRP enjoy_VBP a_DT lot_NN when_WRB there_EX is_VBZ any_DT adventures_NNS or_CC any_DT thrilling_NN work_NN they_PRP do_VBP means_NNS ,_, by_IN driving_VBG a_DT car_NN or_CC rock_NN climbing_VBG persists_VBZ there_EX enjoyment_NN ._.
Thirdly_RB ,_, i_FW state_NN that_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS can_MD also_RB enjoy_VB there_RB life_NN but_CC not_RB as_RB much_JJ as_IN young_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
because_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS will_MD have_VB many_JJ responsibilities_NNS such_JJ as_IN ,_, maitain_NN family_NN ,_, office_NN work_NN this_DT excludes_VBZ them_PRP enjoyning_VBG most_JJS part_NN of_IN the_DT life_NN even_RB though_IN if_IN there_EX is_VBZ any_DT enjoyment_NN in_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS they_PRP will_MD enjoy_VB in_IN much_JJ decent_JJ manner_NN but_CC the_DT younger_JJR ones_NNS will_MD enjoy_VB a_DT lot_NN ._.
Finally_RB ,_, the_DT conclusion_NN that_IN most_JJS younger_JJR ones_NNS are_VBP enjoying_VBG because_IN they_PRP dont_VBP have_VB any_DT social_JJ responsibilities_NNS like_IN older_JJR people_NNS but_CC the_DT enjoyment_NN and_CC happiness_NN in_IN life_NN will_MD bring_VB a_DT lot_NN of_IN change_NN to_TO make_VB a_DT good_JJ life_NN ._.
