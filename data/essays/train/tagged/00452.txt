We_PRP all_DT hope_VBP that_IN we_PRP want_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB our_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Then_RB this_DT question_NN comes_VBZ to_TO my_PRP$ mind_NN ,_, which_WDT enjoy_VBP life_NN more_RBR ,_, young_JJ people_NNS or_CC older_JJR people_NNS ?_.
I_PRP think_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN older_JJR people_NNS ._.
There_EX are_VBP three_CD reasons_NNS ._.
First_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP healthier_JJR bodies_NNS than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Second_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP longer_JJR time_NN in_IN rest_NN of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS than_IN the_DT older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
Third_NNP ,_, older_JJR people_NNS tend_VBP to_TO say_VB that_IN the_DT younger_JJR the_DT better_JJR ._.
First_NNP of_IN all_DT ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP healthier_JJR and_CC stronger_JJR body_NN than_IN older_JJR people_NNS do_VBP ._.
They_PRP can_MD continue_VB to_TO work_VB longer_RB ,_, run_VBP faster_RBR ,_, need_VBP shorter_JJR time_NN to_TO sleep_VB ,_, and_CC so_RB on_IN than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
That_DT means_VBZ young_JJ peopel_NN can_MD enjoy_VB what_WP the_DT old_JJ people_NNS can_MD not_RB do_VB ._.
For_IN example_NN ,_, they_PRP can_MD swim_VB in_IN the_DT mornig_NN ,_, go_VB out_RP for_IN lunch_NN ,_, go_VB shopping_NN ,_, and_CC have_VBP party_NN with_IN their_PRP$ friends_NNS ._.
Second_RB ,_, they_PRP have_VBP longer_JJR time_NN remained_VBD in_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS than_IN the_DT old_JJ people_NNS do_VBP ._.
If_IN you_PRP want_VBP to_TO be_VB a_DT very_RB good_JJ and_CC famous_JJ doctor_NN ,_, it_PRP will_MD take_VB about_RB ten_CD years_NNS to_TO attend_VB medical_JJ school_NN and_CC get_VB enough_JJ experience_NN as_IN a_DT doctor_NN ._.
Young_JJ people_NNS can_MD plan_VB and_CC achieve_VB this_DT aime_NN because_IN they_PRP have_VBP time_NN ._.
However_RB ,_, old_JJ people_NNS may_MD not_RB beacuse_VB they_PRP only_RB have_VBP limited_VBN time_NN in_IN rest_NN of_IN their_PRP$ lives_NNS ._.
Finally_RB ,_, I_PRP often_RB hear_VBP old_JJ people_NNS say_VBP that_IN the_DT younger_JJR the_DT better_JJR ._.
I_PRP am_VBP still_RB young_JJ and_CC can_MD only_RB imagine_VB how_WRB the_DT lives_NNS of_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
The_DT old_JJ people_NNS ,_, however_RB ,_, experienced_JJ life_NN of_IN young_JJ people_NNS already_RB and_CC say_VB the_DT younger_JJR the_DT better_JJR comparing_VBG their_PRP$ lives_NNS to_TO the_DT ones_NNS when_WRB they_PRP were_VBD young_JJ ._.
To_TO conclude_VB ._.
I_PRP believe_VBP young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
They_PRP have_VBP strong_JJ body_NN to_TO do_VB anything_NN they_PRP want_VBP while_IN old_JJ people_NNS have_VBP limitations_NNS because_IN of_IN their_PRP$ health_NN problems_NNS ._.
Also_RB ,_, young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP longer_JJR time_NN to_TO do_VB anything_NN ._.
In_IN addition_NN ,_, old_JJ people_NNS admit_VBP that_IN the_DT younger_JJR the_DT better_JJR ._.
I_PRP strongly_RB believe_VBP that_IN young_JJ people_NNS enjoy_VBP life_NN more_JJR than_IN old_JJ people_NNS ._.
Actually_RB ,_, I_PRP think_VBP ,_, that_DT means_VBZ young_JJ people_NNS have_VBP to_TO challenge_VB anything_NN they_PRP want_VBP and_CC have_VBP to_TO enjoy_VB their_PRP$ lives_NNS to_TO the_DT max_NN ._.
