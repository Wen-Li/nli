 Nowadays, the world develops very quickly, the knowledge becomes more and more important. Although the specific skill is need and  society can't develop without majory people, broad knowledge also take a very high position in our life ,study and work.
  Firstly, broad knowlkedge of many academic subjects are used widly in our daily lives. Take a easy thing for example, when you get up in the morning, you must use your weather knowledge, if you see the black cloud around the sky you will know it will rain,though it is a little thing ,it really uses the knowledge you had from the book. I have a friend who is good at mathmaticth, but when I across the road with her ,she catch me tirdly, because she doesn't have traffic knowledge and can't accross the road.
 Morever, the broad knowledge of many acadimic subjects are used in our studys,for instance, we will reaserch a flower we should learn the botonay of the flower and also may the physic of it , in addion we can use a poet to describ the flower.we can't think things only with one methord, this maks us wrong somethimes.
 finally ,to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is very importan in our work. Thery used a man who is good at business subject and has done a lot of good case. once the campany askde him to sell numbers of air conditions, he was very happy about the good selling in north because of the cold,so he went to south of china to sell them ,but he sold none at last since the south of china remain 25 degree all of the year. so why the man fail at this case? That's because the lack of the geography knowledge.
   In conclusion, the specialize in one specific subject is very improtant, or we can set rock to the space,Edison can't invented the lights,people can't use the computers. But to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects is really need in your lives since we should use them,improve them.
