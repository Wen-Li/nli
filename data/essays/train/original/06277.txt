	Everybody has different opinions and thoughts about the upcoming generation. Some people doesn`t think that young people  give enough time to helping their communities. As a young person I agree with this statement and i think that young people can do more to help their communities.
	Every country is raising the childrens with different cultures, thats why I just can give opinions about my country. Nowadays, we see that most of the criminals are young people. I can`t really say that it is all the young peoples fault. I don`t think the community is helping young people with their problems also, which makes us come to this point. If the community is not giving enough attention to the young people, they can`t expect young people to help their community also.
	I know that young people are the survivors of their country. They have alot of responsibilties for the community. Most people expect them to do better stuff than they are doing now.  There is a big generation gap between our parents and us. They do everything to help their community and we have to take them as a role model for us, but because of this generation gap young people just don`t think it is very interesting. I know that young people doesn`t help the community but we have to think this statement from a different point of view also. They are young people and they have their own problems which makes them think that it is more important then the world. I am sure that no matter which country they are from it is all same with young people. That is not fair to put the responsibilty of the community to their shoulders. I am sure that nowadays young people are going to be good adults which help their community and going to have alot of responsibilty.
