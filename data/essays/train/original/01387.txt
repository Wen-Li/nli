 I desagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide. I have several reasons why I think so.
 First,travel lad by a tour guide is titely scheduled so you are not allowed to spend time freely. As a result of it, you can not experience  the real life of the people who live in the place you visit. Tour guides show you only what they want you to see.There are many other places you should visit to understand local peoples life. For example, the houses they actually live or parks local children gather in,not the places such as famous temples or historic buildings.
 Second, it is better to travel alone than  being in a group. To travel with your friends may make you feel relaxed, but,especially  in the case of going abroad,you can learn how to deal with troubles by yourself. It will make you tough and much more self-confident. It is true that traveling in a group led by a tour guide banefit you much in terms of seculty  and safety,but one of the most important things you can learn from traveling is to acquire the ability to handle the problem even if you are in a strange place.
 Third, traveling in a group led by aguid tour is passive.If you go abroad,it is bettter to study the language that local people speak.Language can not be separated from calture so in you would really like to understand its culture, you need to learn their language too.
