I disagree with this statement.
I think that car is very important for our life. 
Some people who live in convenient city don't care to nothing car but  local people  don't  think  so. 
For example,  "Shopping". Recently, many shopping moals and big supermarket are located  in the place where is far from city or inconvenient place .  If  those people  don't  have  a car , they can not go shopping anywhere.  And local place dosen't have many trains.
