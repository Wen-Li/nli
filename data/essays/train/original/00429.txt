     When it comes to having a Klowledge, it has been a controversial issue whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subjects than to specialize in one specific subject. Som people may insist that it is better to have specialize in one specific subject becuase sometime unsure informations make dangerous situations. As for me, however,  I think having broad knowledge of many academic subjects is more advantageous for two following reasons : not only it is more practical but also it is helpful when people socialize with others. 

     First of all, having a various knowledge is kind of practical way. 
People would face some problems which they are not specialized, but even though people are not professor about the subject, at leat if they familiar with the subjects they may can deal with that. 

   In addition, it can help people to socialize with others easier. 
People meet a lot  of people while they live. And they engage various fields. However, when people meet who works in  diffrent field, if people know about others fields, they can have talk. 
For example, my brother has broad knowledge of many academic subjects . ! year ago, he went to trip to China, and he made a lot of friends. Because he have various knowldege it was easy to have a conversation with others. So he had a great time. 

   All things comsidered, it is not a balck - or -white issue which way is better, i strongly
