      Nowadays every thing has advertisements, even people startted to have advertisements in the internet. They make their own profile with their hoobies, different abilities and their favorable personalities to have friends or to entertain themselves. It doesn't matter if you say teh truth or not. I do agree that most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are.
      First of all,  when you look at something while you are walking on the street you see lots of different advertisements about different things. They can be food,  clothets or everything you can imagine of.
All of them are well advertised with new technology. They put more efects, sounds or color to have your attention.
      Secondly, with the new technology around the world there are no houses with out televisions or radios. So, that means everybody hears or sees the advertisements of products thousand times of a day. Due to that people who produce advertisements make them more unforgetable and more enjoyable. For example, yesterday I have seen an advertisement of a coffee on the television with a really funny music in it. I dreamed about that coffee all the day and at the same time I sung that music over and over in my head. Finanlly, I had a chance to try that popular coffee. Unfortunately, It wasn't what I waited to taste like. There wasn't any smell or any good taste of that dreamed coffee. It wasn't even a coffee......and I was angry.
       What is more, like before I mentioned advertisements of people in the internet. Most people advertise themselves like they are all perfect and impossible to find on the earth. I don't understand why people try to show themselves differently than they usually are?  
       I strongly believe in most advertisements make products seem much better than they really are. That is why I don't believe in their extraordinary perfectness, if I don't try, use or meet them.Most importantly I believe in honesty in everything.
