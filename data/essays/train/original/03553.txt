In response to the statement given sideways, I express my approval for it. Young people nowadays seem to be more interested and involved in their own life and problems than the community as a whole.

The present day world has undergone a dramatic change than it used to be, say a generation ago.It has become much more competitive and demanding. The advent of globalisation has led to drastic repercussions.In today's world only the best can survive. Recently an article was there in newspaper on globalisation.It was stated there that globalisation is producing rich countries with poor people not only in developing countries but also in developed countries like the United States.The fruits of globalisation are mainly distributed among the rich and the highly skilled persons.Unskilled and less skilled labor are no longer the recipients of these fruits.
This puts an immense pressure on young people to achieve great skill in whatever art they are pursuing.They could not devote enough time for other causes, like any work related to the upliftment of their communities.For them their own survival is the key issue.They want to be a part of the ongoing globalisation.

Moreover,they do not find any potential benefit in lending a helping hand to their communities. All they can think of is their own well-being.Whether they are getting any output by doing so, is what the young people's thinking is. In short, the world has become much more materialistic.

Also young people lacks the sense of responsibility which prevents them in helping their communities.They think that just by being a part of a community and following its rules and regulations is sufficient.They have forgotten the fact that with rights comes duties.

So, I would once again like to  support the statement   that young people are not giving enough time in helping their communities.
