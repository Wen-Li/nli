I don`t think, that there will be fewer cars in twenty years. Of cause it is unknown what will be in twenty years but everyone of us think about his future and not only when you think about buying a new car.
I believe that there won`t be fewer  cars in future, because cars are an efficient way of transporting not only of people also to transport goods. That is the reason way so many cars were used today, because it is often the cheapest way of traveling or transportation. For example it is cheaper for families or even for single people to get from Erfurt to Munich than it would be by traveling by train. Also traveling by car is often much faster than going by train. Additionally to the costs, going by car or driving car is sometimes the onliest posibility for treveling. For example in areas in landscape there `t drive many busses or train espacially in the night or on weekend, so so get away of these vilages you need a car or someone, who is driving you. That leads me to the next advantage of cars, it is that people with cars are mor independent than without.
An other reason way there won`t be fewer cars in the futher future is that there aren`t any good substitutes for them, like mentioned above trains but also plans or ships aren`t good  alternatives because thez don`t can be everywhere or could stop everywhere, because all of these transport-vihecles need an habour. Thats way cars are good for transportation becouse of the well established infrasystem. Almost everywhere are roads so that everyone could achive his targets by car. Furthermore also motorbicycle aren`t good substitutes for cars of cause they don`t need as much fuel as cars, but you can`t tronsport as much things as with car and espacially by motorbicycle you are dependent of the wether conditions.
So all together in my opinion cars are mostly the best option to transport good or persons. Of cuase fuel gets more expensive but new motor-constructions won`t erase cars. Thats way cars won`t be fewer in futr but they could have changed in twenty years. Aditionally I think that, I will of cause drive any car in twenty years and when other people think so too, that there will be even more cars in futur.
So let us see what will happen to cars in future.
