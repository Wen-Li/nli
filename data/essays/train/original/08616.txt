according to this statment, i think that students should learn the facts more than just understand the idea and concepts because if they just understand the ideas and the concepts, they aren't really understand what they have learn. and, if they just understand the ideas and the concepts, they can't use what they have learn in the future.

if students just understand the ideas and the concepts, they don't know what they have already learn. for example, a student wants to learn how to swim, he knows the idea and the concept, but he doesn't try it before. he thnks that he knows how to swim;however, he doesn't.or if a student is learning how to play piano, he listens to the teacher teach him how to play the piano, he knows many things about how to play a piano, but he doesn't play the piano before. does he know how to play a piano? the answer is not, he doesn't know how to play it. because he is just a paper soldier, he just knows how to talk, but not to play.

nevertheless, if students learn the fact, they can use it in the future. students study many things at school, but there are only a little knowlegal they can use in the the future. for example, if the studens study business at school, after they finish the school. they can be the businessman. if some people study nursing at school, they can be a nurse in the future. however, if those people just understand the ideas and the conceptsat school, they will mkae some trouble in the future. there are many things happen suddenly, if they don't now the fact, they can't slove the problem if they should face the problem at that time.however, if they have learn the fact, it is easier to slove a problem than they just understand the ideas and  the concepts on everythings.

therefore, students must learn the fact of everything when they are at school because it will affect their future if they just understand the ideas and the concepts about everythings
