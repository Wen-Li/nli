There are different opinions about a common belief that young people enjoy their life more than older people do. The fact that there are worlds between young and old makes it very difficult. I agree with this statement because older people in general don't have the right attitude toward life anymore.
	One really good example why older people don't enjoy life as much as young people is that you can feel and hear it from them almost every day. If you have old people living in your neighborhood who hasn't heard ore of them complaining about the way you parked your car or drove your bike. When you're older you take life to serious most of the time and you don't really laugh as much anymore. There are different reasons for that. Maybe you just can't adapt to the new more modern life or maybe you just don't want to. While the youth plays videogames, goes out partying and listens to  rock/pop music, old people don't really do that as much because they either can't anymore or they feel that's not their time and they had their fun when they were younger. Another major impact that keeps a lot of people away from having fun is that they have injuries and just can't do the things a 20 year old can. You often hear older people sayin that they wish they would be young again because they know that you can enjoy life much more when you're younger. I'm sure many older people want to go out again and dance or do sport without having to be worried that they are going to break every bone.
Often just the look on an old man's face tells us how he feels and that he's not enjoying the position he's in. There are many worn out old people where you can see that they had a life with lot's of worries.
Doesn't also everybody freak out evreytime they see the first gray hair on their head. people don't want to get old they want to enjoy life.
	Altogether it is a difficult topic with many different opinions. Old people though just can't have as much fun as younger people do.
Younger people enjoy their life more as you can see if you compare them to old people.
