It is well known that gazoline is the main driver in car production. in fact, if the gazoline cost too much, people will less be likely to buy cars. As a result two potential hypothesis concerning the future of cars can be find. First, the decrease of gazoline will limited the numbers of cars. Second a new powerfull subtitued will be find.
To answer the question: `will the number of decrease within twenty years?`, this essay will explain the two hypothesis, their consequenses and it will conclude buy answering the statement.
 
	The first hyppothesis stating that a decrease in gazoline supply will decrease the number of cars. It is comon sence. If the gazoline suplly is limited the price will goes up. As a result comsuption and demand will goes downs down. In twenty years, people will find-out that having a car and especially with gazoline into it has becomes a luxury good. People, individuals, will not be a afford the new prices of gazoline, only major firms or government.

	The second hypothesis is more relevant. Find new sources of energy is possible. We already develop the nuclear which is of course not the best solution for cars but show how human been can find alternative solution. The `ethanol` which is a comple nature source of power can be a solution for cars. What we need to underline concerning the Ethanol is that the smoke created out of the car using it is horrible. it just smell very bad. unless a solution concerning the smell is find it will not be the best solution. Entire cities of Ethanol`s car can not be.

	To conclude, I belive that the number of cars will decrease within the next twenty years. Alternative solution are possible but, not easy to find and use. However, the price of the alternative powers or the comon gazoline will be high or going up. As a result, the number of cars can only decrease with time. Lets not forget that numbers of cars must decrease unless the hole earth will suffer.
