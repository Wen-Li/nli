oh no. I don't have any dates on the buisness car but I dont belive it, but I hope it. Probably after tokio the world and the daily beahevior people must change. The cars make so much pollution that the world isn't able to resist in this way. Also the cities can't resisiste to all of this. In some cities, for example, is made a law to don't go by car in several days and to improve the pubblic services such as metro or bus.
I thik that in Italy the continuos oil's increase cost is do to we don't take the car every day. It' s all rigth for me because in some way we don't take every moment the car.
Althaugt the car company make more and more  new  and amazing cars. they are always more power and that they fire more than oldest.
I am ill when I see that every person has a personal car ( in Italy), and I try fight this going by bike and also I promove the bike.
