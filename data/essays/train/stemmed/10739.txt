there are two kind of peopl in the world : peopl who tri to find their right place to live and enjoy do someth similar everyday , and peopl who after have a time do the same thing over and over , one day they decid to leav all those import thing and start again new project . in my opinion , thi second group of peopl are the most success . peopl who give up job or activ in which they have reach the top or perhap feel that they do not receiv someth valuabl as exchang and suddenli decid to jump out to other activ are admir becaus they have the courag to start over with the onli goal of achiev anoth success in the futur that let them to fill their emot and econom need . of cours , the decis that they make is not eas , it envolv a great amount of valour , disciplin and optim ; howev the advantag of do someth new again are import , such as they have more knowledg and experi to start , their passion of do somet that they enjoy make them feel pleasant to work long hour prepar everyth to reach a new goal . sometim they have to take risk , but they know how to measur that risk to succedd . learn new thing everi day make them happi and it becom and incent to go further , at the end they becom more achiev and proud of their goal . thi is he way for which mani success individu reach the top of the hill in their live . as a result , their accomplish mani econom and emot satisfact . i stongli agre with the peopl who suddenli decid to chang their activ to improv their emot and physic health rather than to live regret of their convent skill , colleag , boss or their live . i think that i am one of these peopl and i will never regret of what i left becaus what i am accomplish is more great and pleasant in my life .
