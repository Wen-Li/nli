some peopl say that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion , i think it is good for a person to have a background in mani subject . howev , he must concentr on one subject which will be hi major in colleg and the field of hi job . each person should ha one special subject . a doctor can not be a civil engin at the same time . there are mani reason whi i think special in knowledg is better . first , everi societi must consist of peopl that have knowleg about differ subject . as the human bodi contain differ member that work independ and consist , the societi need individu with differ job and way of think . in addit , peopl are differ in what they are interest in and we can not find a person who interest in all academ subject . for exampl , i like comput engin but hate medicin wherea my brother 's interest are just the opposit of mine . besid , human brain is limit and a person can not be creativ in mani field . thi centuri is not like the past when one scintist , like newton , wa shine in physic and mathemat . as we have notic , societi must consist of peopl of differ knowleg and it is imposs to find a person who is creativ in mani academ field . therefor , i disagre with the idea which say that it is better to studi mani academ cours than to special in one specif field .
