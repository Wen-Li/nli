it is true that nowaday , school give out more work for student to do . and most of the student are pack with school work that they do not have spare time to do other thing . even though it is true , i still believ young peopl are put enough time to help their commun . as for my school , an averag student spend about four to five hour on their homework , and it depend on the level of the difficulti of the cours they took . but , even though our homework take up a great time , mani student from my school still work for commun servic . my school end at 3 pm everyday , but we have activ that is offer after school , such as commun servic . and most of the student are `` forc '' to do commun servic . there 's no rule set on the minimum hour work per year , but for those peopl who wish to get into good colleg , would do commun servic everyday . becaus we know , colleg care about commun servic . of cours , there are peopl who help out in their commun just becaus of their interest . you might ask , `` whi would peopl enjoy do commun servic when there are better altern such as watch movi and chill out with your friend ? '' the reason you would have ask the question is becaus you have not found a commun servic that you can enjoy do . i have been persistantli go to leprosi home everyweek . i work about seventi hour everi year . colleg applic might be one of the reason i visit there , but the main reason that keep me spend so much time there is becaus of the resid there . even though most of the resid had never gone to school befor , there 're thing that i can learn from them , such as , the way to live and look at your life . they are disabl , and they have been through all sort of difficulti , and while chat with them , they 'll share their stori of how they 'd gone through all the difficulti . and that 's whi there are peopl who enjoy help out the commun - they learn mani thing that they do n't usual learn from school . may be , around the world , young peopl do not give enough time help their commun . but from the environ i live in , i see peopl do commun almost everyday . some of them might be forc by their parent or colleg applic , but those peopl are still the same as those who do commun with interest . either way , peopl are help out the commun . and i think put an extra two hour everyday on top of the five hour homework is a decent amount of time to put into the commun .
