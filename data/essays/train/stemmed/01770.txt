sinc the first car wa creat , the number of car have increas everi year . from my point of view that will be the same in the next year . i disagre with the idea that there will be fewer car in twenti year . basic i beliv the social demand will go on increas . citi are overcrow and we tend to emigr from the cityi to area close to the citi but more calm and sometim with less pollut that the citi one . if we live some kilometr far to the citi we will need a transport to go there . there is public transport , but usual it is expens and less confort than a car . human love to be confort even if that damag for instanc the environ . becaus of that , becaus we love confort , we will usual choos our own car in stead of the public transport to move ourself . secondli , i beliv in sever year a less-pollut car will be creat . peopl are more concern with the environ than year ago . we think more in the environ , damag , pollut caus , consecu . in fact , scientifc are reaserch a way to built car that emit less gase to the atmospher , as electr car . if they achiv their aim , we will have `` healthi '' car and we will not have moral conflict in use them whenev we want . i mean , that mayb now , there are peolpl worri about the pollut and becaus of that he , she doenot take car as much she woukd like . in conclus , becaus of the argument abov mention , ( there are other but the time is out ) in my opinion we could see much car run the road that the number of them tha we can see now .
