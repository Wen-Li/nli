i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are a sever reason to support my opinnion . firstli , in twenti year some of the develop countri will becom econom stabl . when that happen , a number of citizen in that countri will be abl to buy new car . for exampl , china is one of the countri . now , it is becom a econom enorm countri and a lot of peopl are now purchas new car . secondli , in a lot of western countri like america or canada , except for larg citi it almost imposs to transport without car . peopl can not even go to school without car . of cours small countri like japan have a veri nice subway and bu system , but not all countri are like that . it also cost a lot of money to make that system and it not top prioriti in the countri to do thi so i think the use of car will not chang or even increas . thirdli , accord to the develop in scienc , the price of car will go down . therefor , the peopl who could not afford to have car will be abl to buy one and it will be easi for peopl to buy second , third , or even fourth car in the famili . these day in develop nation , there are concern about the fact that use car effect the global warm , and instead of everybodi use car , public transport is be consid . howev , there ha been a lot of research on car that prevent pollut . toyota 's `` priu '' is an exampl . in conclus , i think that there will be more car in use than there are today .
