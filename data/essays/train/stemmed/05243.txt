it is true that most advertis make product look better than how they realli are and it must be like that becaus , if you have to sell a product , you must overr it a littl bit , you must put in evid the good qualiti of it and you must hide it bad peculiar . it doe n't mean lie but it mean just not to tell some part of the truth in order to convinc peopl that your product is good to be bought . what the latin call `` dolu bonu '' is the usual overr that the seller make of hi product and it is absolut permit . on the other hand what is not permit is the real lie : for exampl you ca n't say that you had got a prize for your product without have gotten it realli ; you ca n't denigr your competitor 's product in order to exhalt your product , in other word you ca n't do nag public . what is permit is a compar public : it consist in an object comparison of object data . i think that the italian law , the one i have been speak about is good and i think it should n't be chang also becaus it work and is respect . what i do not like of public is that it creat need . it is veri neg becaus , strike the emot part of peopl who look at it creat in them a lot of need that they did n't have befor . nowaday peopl wast a lot of money in thing that they do n't need and quit often lose sight of the most import thing in life becaus they must have the last model of that watch , becaus they must have the sweater of that particular trademark , beacaus they need to be trendi . i think that thi last effect of public is veri neg and should be fought by express thi point publicli and often .
