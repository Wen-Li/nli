person , i total agre with thi statement and strongli believ that peopl 's succcess is mostli base on their experi . perhap , point of view would be easier to explain with some exampl . just look at the past . most of the scientist reach their goal becaus they alway tri to tri someth new . reamain focus in just what one know , it 's clearli a sign of the fear of tri someth new and differ , and of cours that kind of peopl is scare by not be enough or abl to manag the new situat . if you have never tast a new food , how could you know if you like it or not ? just with the knowleg , it is possibl to make clear decis , to have a complet view of the situat and to choos in a more liber way . let 's take for exampl the role of a judg . how can a judg express hi verdict without know what realli happen ? it is not possibl at all . the same rule is applic to the ordinari life , where nowaday we are alway tempt by someth new - sometim good , sometim not . to make a sucessful decis , in my opinion , the best way to act is to tri and know everyth relat with the topic , and then - just after thi - to take a final decis . be an expertis in someth , it 's absolut a good valu , but it is not enogh to be sucessful .
