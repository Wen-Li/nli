i do n't complet agre with thi statement : in my opinion both the understand of idea and concept and the lear of fact are import to the cultur growth of a student . as a matter of fact , mani time , idea and concept are consequ of fact happen in that period . consequ , student can understand idea better if they know in what environ these concept were born : the fact can describ the context in which those idea grew up . follow thi view , we have to know the import of the histori studi : onli throught the knowledg of our past we can complet understand idea and concept that grew up in those period . for exampl , onli if we undestand what were the econom problem dure the 17th-18th centuri we can fulli comprehend the industri revolut and it new idea of mass product . but the opposit can also be true : some new idea can chang the behaviour of peopl , so result in new event in the human histori . for exampl , some new idea in the world of the physic were follow by the atom bomb and by it use dure the world war ii . in the same way we could mention the new research in the genet field : sure these new idea will chang the world of tomorrow and will give the true prospect throught which read the futur fact . in these term , it is not more import for student to understand idea and concept that it it for them to learn fact . what is realli import is to undestand that you can not fulli comprehend a concept without know the context in which thi new idea wa born .
