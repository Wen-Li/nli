bussi peopl tri to market their product by advertis a lot . even though the product is not much import in our daili life , market peopl will make an impress that the product is veri improt for us . so , i total agre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . '' i usal watch home shop network channel . in that channel lot and lot of product are advertis . peopl watch thi channel are impress about the product and ca n't wait without buy them . for exampl , i wa veri much impress by storag bag which are use to store veget in the refridger . the advertis wa so impress show that veget will be fresh for longer period , if we store in that particular bag and they have shown two group of veget , one group of veget store in ordinari storag bag and one the other group store in that special storag bag . so i wa impress and i order that particular item . in the real , i do n't feel that lot of differ about the bag and i wa not satisfi with the product . advertis are onli one type of way to introduc the product in to the market . just by see the advertis we ca n't judg the reliabl of the product , unless we experi the advantag and disadvantag of the product by use it . normal most peopl inculd me are easili carri away by the advertis . by do so , we are wast time and money . so i suggest to spent some extra time to know the pro and con of a product form friend or rel who have use that product befor and then decid to go for it or not . i final conclud that we should not buy a product just by see an advertis of that product . we must have the knowledg of that product , it use and how improt it is and then buy it .
