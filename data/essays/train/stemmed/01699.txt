wheather in twenti year ther will be fewer car in use than are today is a controversi matter . it ha cost and benefit . in my own opinion i think that it will not ocur in the next twenti year . on the one hand , there is evid that the poblat of the earth will increas in the next year . if now there are six thousend million of peopl wich most of them no have car , and know that the countri not develop are develop now ( like china , brazil or india ) or will develop in the next ten year , the peopl of these countri will buy car . in additt , the develop countri there are two car per famili in now day , with the emigr the number of famili are rais , so more car . and i want to add that the tecnolog is there to make the car more confort and with more secur . on the other hand , car pollut the envior and peopl are now more conciounsli in protect the earth and the ozon . thi could be affect in the market of the car in the world becaus peopl is use and will use more and more public transport in order to protect the earth . also is import that the natur resourc are been use in more cuantiti for all the product ( plastic , fuel , natur ga , etc ) and the car need combust to work and now the natur resourc are grow in use . to sum up , there are import the two way . there are peopl in the two option and i are in the the option taht in the futur
