in my opinion success in itself carri the element of `` desir , sacrifis and a strong will '' to drive one to the destin of choic . sum of such characterist distinguish how sucess we will be . as a human be everi individu tri to be better than what he wa and for thi he improvis in the skill which he ha and after a particular stage when he ha internalis that , the person may becom satur in hi desir and be satisfi by what he ha achiev or he ha the choic of expans , which for a buissnesman will mean buis expans but for a research student will mean to know other area to research upon and tri to appli the acquir skill of one area to get fruit result in the other . there is alway a satisfact come from one achiev but to stop with a hand of achiev is not what peopl who succed and are respect do . take the exampl of einstein , he wa one of the most popular and success theoret physicscist , got a nobel prize in 1923 for photoelectr effect , after which he could have retir and spent rest of hi life in comfort , but he chose to `` sacrifis '' it and work to make a unifi theori till he die . such characterist make succ in true sens . peopl who stop after a mileston are one of those who have doubt on their abil and fear of faliur , which is counter qualiti of a motiv person . so given certain paramet which we can call element of success in a person ; their evolut with passag of life will lead us to the conclus of sucess peopl take risk . but those are calcul risk and not random crazi thought which distinguish them from an egoman !!
