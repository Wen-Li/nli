although sometim we need special knowleg , i agre with the statement . it is import for us to have borad knowledg of mani academ subject . the detail of my reason is as follow . sometim know onli one subject may narrow possibl they choos in their life . for exampl , my friend wa studi english literatur at hi univers . at that time he wa so interest in that and did not studi other subject such as mathemat . now he is job-hunt and got stuck becaus english literatur is not importatnt for the compani which he want to get in . much broader knowledg is requir by the compani . also , i found veri interest to talk to peopl who know thing which i do not know . those peopl look veri confid , and speak convincingli . i think the reason whi they are so is connect to his/her extens knowledg about so mani differ subject . know about mani academ subject clearli make peopl attract . final when peopl are stuck in their live , what they can count on is themselv . they have to use their knowleg when they are in troubl . if pepl have broader knowleg of mani academ subject , they might be provid with more chanc to get out of troubl . to conclud i agre with the idea that peopl should know mani academ subject .
