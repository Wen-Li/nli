accord to me , idea and concept form the base for success understand of a subject . fact are also import for subject like histori or biolog . but have knowledg onli of fact , student can not fetch much . fact can be develop if a student possess an understand of idea and fact . there are mani daili life exampl that would differenti the import between both . for exampl , let us consid a pocelin flower vase that is place on a tabl at one corner of the hous , a child may break it though hear the fact that the porcelin would break . but , if a child ha the idea regard the product , if he ha a knowledg about the charecterist of porcelin then he would never break it . unless and until someth happen accident . if student possess a background knowledg about a product or anyth they would handl it with care . have knowledg of idea and concept would help student in their research work . with idea and concept they can enhanc the exist theori and develop a new theori . fact are also import but possess fact alon cant help student enhanc an exist theori . have knowled of fact hold good for subject like histori and polit scienc . these are the subject where date have to be rememb . when talk about other subject like comput scienc , it is necessari that student possess idead and concept about the subject . for exampl when a team is woke on a project ( each person alloc differ job ) and suppos a person leav suddenli then it becom the respons of the rest of the team to complet the project . thi can be done if the student possess idea and concept regard that part of the project whick is left by a person . henc the abov reason hold good in convay that fact are import but idea and concept are import ,
