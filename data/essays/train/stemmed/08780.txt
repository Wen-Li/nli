i think that the human be can appreci the valu of the studi onli when understand the idea and concept that are on the base of the studi and that explain the realiti . in fact , not all the student have the capac to learn fact and memor them . in genera , they keep in mind onli the fundament inform or the inform that they understand , lose all the other one that they ca n't understand and , as consequ , they could n't rememb . but if the teacher gave them a method to understand the real sens of the fact , the idea and concept , they will learn the fact becaus they could explain the sens of them . i think thi is the idea on the base of the italian school and univers , where student , from the youngest age , learn to understand idea and concept and not to memor inform : thi is the classic method which deriv by latin and greek studi . in fact , greek and latin wise figur out the human be at the centr of the world and appreci more what wa insid hi mind than the background and the enviro around him .
