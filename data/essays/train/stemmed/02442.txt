typic , it is a common misconcept that young peopl would enjoy life more than older peopl do . it is infact true that younger peopl have more potenti to enjoy life , although it is the sad truth that some do not . some of the more older peopl in the world probabl enjoy life much more than younger peopl . i believ that with the right mindset , enjoy life is not a matter of age . younger peopl have more capabl bodi to play sport or do veri difficult activ , such as mountain climb . a child at the age of five would not have mani worri with almost no respons . they would continu run around , think of noth but their next desir . a teenag would exhibit realiz of respons . they would have to keep up with their grade , and their social life , etc . although , a teenag still doe not have a goal set for their life . some have a theori that they have the so-cal `` teen angst '' in which they rebel against mani differ situat and/or person in their life . thi is an exampl of how a younger person may not enjoy life more than an older person doe . an older person should be wise enough to do the right thing and act the right way . anoth exampl could be if a person wa put into a veri bad situat . for instanc , if the teenag or child wa live in the more diseas prone area of africa . they probabl would not be have so much fun , especi with the polit instabl and the littl amount of food around . an older person , on the other hand , usual ha a foot in the direct they would want to follow . they would not have the abil to , for instanc play ninti minut of soccer in one of the major club of the world , although they could still enjoy such past-tim as golf . an older person would probabl have had the resourc set around himself/herself to be in some way succesful . it is up to them whether they want to follow that path or ani other . in conclus , it is onli ourselv limit the enjoy of life . it is true , with some situat , there realli is not much you could do , although we have to make the best of what we have . so onc again , it is not true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl .
