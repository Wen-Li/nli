today , the environ continu to play in increasingli import role in world polit . although , first step have been made to reduc globl warm , the issu is still not treat with the earnesti and convict it deserv so far . sadli i need to stress the fact , that thi may pose a greater threat to civilis than terror . car contribut to global warm by emmit co2 . consequ , the question wether there will be fewer car in use in 20 year is of vital import to us all . i would like to answer with a definit ye . howev , i think otherwis . one of the main reason for thi convict is , that peopl have known about global warm for a long time , but that consequ action , such as drive less ha been taken onli by a small minor . peopl love conveni , and car are veri conveni . moreov car are veri import symbol of statu for mani peopl . feel have a greater influenc on most peopl than ration thought , and thi is whi they will not give up their car if they don not have to . anoth reason whi i think that the number of car will increas , is that larg number of peopl in the so call third world , especi in china , who did not have car so far , are start to buy them . oni a drastic increas in petrolem price could slow thi develop . less pessimist reason for my view , are that new car are bee develop . these car use less fuel , cosequ , they will be afford , even if fuel price should rise significantli . what is more , research ha been tri to invent car that do not use combust fuel at all for quit a while . they will sure succeed in the near futur . i do hope that if i am right , and we do have more car on earth in twenti year , than we do today , that they will not emmit co2 .
