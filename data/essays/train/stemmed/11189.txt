at the univers i onli could take subject that were relat to my carrer , that wa busi . i think it wa n't posit at all becaus i want also to take other subject relat to art and some of histori too . instead i can not say that how i learn wa n't good , becaus after all i 'm veri focu and specialic in what i 'm work now and that is becaus of the way i learn at the univers . the first thing i would like to make is that there are a lot of strong advantag to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it give you a gener knowledg in differ field . that is veri import for exampl when you go to a social event , you meet there a lot of differ peopl and so you have mani type of covers you can talk about not onli thing that you are stude at the moment . anoth advantag to have knowlwdg in differ subject is that you becam in a veri cultur person , an interest person and you will never be a bore person who doe n't like to talk whith . though there are strong advantag to have broad knowledg of mani academ there are also mani advantag to special in one specif subject . there are mani peopl who prefer special in one specif subject becaus so the could concentr better in the thing that they are stude and they could take more advantag of that . in addit i have to say that the way i learn at the univers that wa special in one subject is help me a lot right now at work . becaus i think that in thi way i have more knowledg about the decit that i have to make in everi problem that are present everyday . in conclus , i have have to say that i will prefer both . for me is veri import to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it make you a knowledg person in differ field and it is also import to special in one specif subject becaus it help you a lot in the thing that you are go to do in the futuru . the best chois for me is tri to merg o mix both . if i have the opportun i would do it for sure !
