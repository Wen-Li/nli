i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . travel to an unknown destin can be challeng and mayb even intimid to some . but i person believ that explor and discov the unknown is the real thrill in travel . a tour guid would take hi group to all the popular tourist destin , follow a set schedul and give them a brief histori of each place . when you travel on your own , you are on your own schedul . peopl are most like to travel when on vacat , and you certainli do n't need to abid by a schedul when on vacat and away from work . when you are travell on your own , you can get a map , scout place , get recommend from local and visit all the place that seem intruig and appeal to you . you can read up and learn about the histori in way that you would like and not have some guid rattl it out to you . if safeti is of concern , you could alway travel with a group of friend and still set your own pace . memori of place visit would have more excit , as it would not be just the histori of the place that you would take with you but also all your effort in get to the place and other such experi . on your own , it is more like that you would visit a place that is not a common tourist destin but one that definit meet your tast and expect . when travel or visitng new york , a tour guid would definit take you to see the empir state buidl , time squar and the statu of liberti but for a complet expereinc of a new yorker , you would need a lot more than that . to summar , i would like to say that travel on your own is definit more reward than travel in a group with a tour guid . i serious doubt that a tour guid show columbu the way . and what a loss it would have been for america not to have been discov !
