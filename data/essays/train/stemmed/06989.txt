mayb , but i am not sure . it 's true that tecnologhi are grow veri rapidli , but 20 year ago we said that today we could have car with no pullut and that we cuold fli with them . i beliv in our studi , and i am sure that someth are chang . now we are look at hydrogen like onli solut for a pollut dicreas , but mayb tomorrow we can find someth differ . i think that the onli way to have less car in use is the introduct of a new tax to enter in the citi and a good servic of bu and train in the citi . italin peopl are not abl to reach the work place without their car and , i think a lot of peopl all over the world want their indipend and to be free to go wherev they want . today we are about 5.000.000.000 peopl but in twenti year how mani are we ? how mani car will be ? if we grow up we need more transport and more car . now all the car are move by gasolin , but is it price good and is it dispon enought ? mayb onli solut to cut the car number is the end of the gasolin or a price so high that nobodi can buy it . some studi say that the gasolin price reach in itali on 2007 like a 1 , 80 euro for l , and if we think about mind salari it is easi to see how is difficult drive our car . howev i think that will be veri strang if in twenti year will be fewer car in use but if we learn to go in 2 or more peopl with one car mayb could happen .
