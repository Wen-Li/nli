i agre with the point that in twenti year are go to be less car in use . thi is go to happen becaus some reason : the first reason is for sure that peopl is gete concern about the enviro and pollut . if we do not stop send pollut to the air , more natur disast will happen and nobodi want to die soon . peopl is get concern about take care about our littl planet . anoth reason is that other transport are grow , exampl of thi are : much more peopl use public transport like plane , taxi or buse becaus it is cheaper to move in the citi by public transport , than use your own car and pay the ga . other reason is the continu evolut of the mechan technolog , new transport are go to appear and mayb they are less pollut than car , but for sure thi new vehicl are go to be faster , more comfort and cheaper than a car . speak about car , we have in one hand that they are relli cheap and they are veri use , for exampl to go work on time , but in the other hand we have that car are the thing that kill more peopl in european countri dure a year . for sure thi is a good reason . a car also is someth that need care , and you have to spend your money on it , chang thing that are not fix enough , ga , park and load of other thing that make veri expens have a car . in conclus , for all thi reason , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today and for sure , peopl will think twice befor buy a new car , becaus it is someth expens , it is someth that contribu to pollut our planet and is someth that in twenti year , is go to be consid old-fashion and bore .
