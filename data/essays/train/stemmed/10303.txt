in the daili life , we are surround with advertis , whatev we may do : listen to the radio , take the train , watch televis . .. yet , we can wonder whether these advertis realli reflect the truth . do not they sometim make product seem better than they realli are ? do truth advertis exist ? on the one hand , we can think that advertis onli consist in show a product : noth can realli be bias thi way . inde , in an advertis , a product is shown , describ and sometim we see how it work ( for an electron devic for instanc ) . so , how can we possibl we cheat on ? they make product the way they are . for exampl , when you see on televis an advertis for a new type of cake for children , you see a new type of cake on the screen and noth more . the product seem to us just how it is . howev , we can think that a lot of market is involv in the concept of an advertismn . consequ , everi advertis is care thought and design so as to make us buy the product . that is whi the advertis maker tri to play with our feel . for exampl , more and more product in the advertis are describ as healthi , or good if peopl are on a diet . .. advertsi maker use the new trend for health , diet . .. that ha been run for some month . they tri to make everi prodcut look healthi , even though it is not . for exampl , everi product with an origin high rate of fat is describ as `` lighter in fat '' but hey omit to add that there is still a consider amount of fat in it . anoth way of make product seem better is the use of small letter . for exampl , for a loan , you will see in big letter that you can get a loan in no time , but when you read care , you notic how much it cost . .. the same thimng happen when you suscrib someth with an internet supplier : an attract price is written in big letter in the advertis , but when you read more care the small letter , you notic that the rent of the modem is not includ , that thi price is the one if you engag for three year . .. anoth tool for the advertis maker to make the product better-look to us is the use of a `` star '' to present it . peopl who identifi with thi `` star '' think that if such a person use thi product , it must be wonder . to conclud , we can say that peopl have to be veri care with advertis . inde , even though they sound like truth , they are not realli the truth . most advertis are conceiv so as to make the product seem much better than it is , so as to convinc us to buy it .
