i met a lot of success peopl in my life . all of them have alway tri new thing and take risk . i agre with thi statement . infact , in order to have success in life , is import tri new experi . i think that the more you do in life , the more you learn . if you just do what you alreadi know how to do , you will never succeed in your life . an exampl that can support what i wrote is the analysi of the attitud of one of my best professor : silvio abati . my oral medicin professor is a great person and he is veri success in the hospit and univers where he work . mani colleagu look for him when they do n't arriv at the right diagnosi for their patient . moreov he is veri admir by hi student for hi interest lesson . he often tell me how he had been abl to becom such a good doctor and teacher ! . when he wa a student he had mani school friend that studi just on one book , while he use to read more than one book and he alway review literatur of a specif topic . he also went to meical meet even if he could n't understand everyth . to be sucess in your work you have to increas your knowledg as much as possibl without be afraid of risk . like my professor , mani other scientist found out import discoveri just risk and bet on what they were do . we have just one life so i think is import to exploit it as much as possibl `` without ani brake '' . i 'd like to be a silvio abati in my life , and i will follow hi advic ! risk !
