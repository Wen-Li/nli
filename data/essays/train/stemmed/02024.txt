i agre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun resent . these day , mani young peopl do not care about their commun and even they do not know what is happen in their comun . i have some experi which made me feel that some of young peopl do not care about their comun . it wa a few week ago that we have the day to collect trash in my commun . i paticip in it with my friend . we were gather at a park . can you imagin how mani young peopl came to the park ? there are onli five youg peopl includ me and my friend . later , i ask some of my friend whi they did not come . they said that they did n't have time becaus they wa hang out with their friend or watch tv at their home . some of them even did n't know about it . i wa surpris at these reason sinc i did n't realiz that so mani peopl do not care about the comminuti . also , last year , i wa ask to help a festiv which wa held in my commun but i could n't help becaus i had some thing had to do , so i ask some of my friend to help it instead me . howev , nobadi accept to do it becaus they may get tire . as a result , i help the festiv . i think there are some problem caus by action of those who do not give enough time to help their commun . if more young peopl help their commun , we can make commun more great and good for all of us .
