there are a difer situat that success peopl tri new thing , and success peopl who do not tri . i think that success peopl alway tri new thing becaus they tri to success in difer aspect but i think thi is not correct . obviusli that if you want to be succ first you have to know well what you have to do it . in thi circunst you will have to have a good prepar in the aspect or in the situat that you want to success . for exampl i want to success in my career i am a lawyer and i wanto to be a well know lawyer in my countri in that circunst i know that i have to work veri hard to do it , no tri new thing just do what i realli know and do well the ting that i realli know in thi way i sure that i wiil success . becaus if you tri to succ do new thing i think sometim you can do someth that is nor correct or bad thing it doe not matter your intent , the thing is that that you have to be sure what you are do . in my specif case i can not tri to do new thing becuas i am a lawyer and i wa prepar for a specif area that is commerci and civil law , and i wa studi a lot about thi subject , and i realli honest with me and with my client when someboy ask me if i can help them with other area such as crimin law , human right or enviroment law , that are veri interest but i do not know anytih about and them and is not correct for me to tell that thi area that mention abov i know and help them becuas in thi way i will never success . in conclus i think a reall success peopl just do it what they alreadi know . i am not agre with thi statement becuas you can not tri new thing if you do not well what you are do . alway in better to grow up care take all the valu that it is neccesari . and do well what you realli know .
