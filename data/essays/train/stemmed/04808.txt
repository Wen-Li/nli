i agre with thi statement but there are some disadvantag i will not leav unment . there are actual two question includ in thi statement . the travel in a group and the guid who lead the group . travel in a group ha some fantast aspect that can turn a journey into an adventur . if you travel with sever peopl you will be abl to share your impress , opinion and concern with them and you will have the chanc to learn more about your `` travel-m '' as well . furthermor you can do thing you could never afford when you are travel on your own or onli with your partner . for exampl rent a bu , a hous or even a guid who ha some insid inform for you . the guid is the second point i would like to talk about . take part in a tour that is led by a guid includ the opportun to see area and listen to inform or stori that are not avail in a book or a magazin . you can see realli hidden part of untouch natur or you can get a great tour in a museum with special inform about certain artwork . if you join a guid tour with a group of friend you will share your new and exclus knowledg with other . becaus ( if we are honest ) exclus knowledg and impress are onli interes if someon can show off with them . at least for some of us . but there are some aspect of a guid group travel i do not appreci . you alway have to consid the mood and the wish of all peopl within the group . consequ , you can not make everybodi happi . there will almost alway be at least one person who would like to do someth differ and he or she will be disappoint if thi idea is reject by the group . my concern about a guid are small but you have to think about them as well . when you pay for a guid you have a day that is usual exactli organ which is good becaus you want to get someth for your money . on the other hand , there is no space for a break , some leisur and relax bcaus the group ha to move on . you can not discov anyth on your own you can not have your own littl adventur with your partner . to sum thi up i would like to give my own statement . a travel with a group led by a guid is a fantast experi but there should be some space left to be alon or with your partner to relax , enjoy each other and discov the area on your own .
