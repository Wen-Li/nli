i agre with the statement mention . beyond everi success there is a risk associ with it . if we consid our renow scientist and research , behind their everi success there is a risk . they keep on do risk in find out new invent and new discoveri . success peopl probabl will not wish to do the thing which are well known to them becaus they think in a differ way , aim high to achiev someth which is new . in these aspect they do greater risk to find out new thing . they are veri much dare enough to do ani sort of risk in achiev a posit result . for exampl i consid madam curi to be the most risk take and a most success scientist . as she laid path in the discoveri of `` radium '' , a radio activ materi she took a greater risk in the discoveri of radium . she had done a lot of experi in find the radio activ materi . her experi involv mani risk take factor in which they are veri danger . at last she found out the radium after a seri of experi and reasearch . the discoveri of radium thu involv mani risk factor and atlast she ha tast the success . if she would not had taken the risk mean the radium would not have been found till now . in the same way as mention abov , success peopl alway tri for new thing rather than do the thing which are alreadi veri well known to them . success peopl alway tri new thing and new task . it incorpor in them to tri for a new one . in thi process mani scientist have laid path to mani invent such as marconi invent a radio , grahambel invent a telephon and so on . so i conclud the essay by state that risk must be taken by everi individu in achiev success and tri out for a new thing rather than do the thing which is known to us .
