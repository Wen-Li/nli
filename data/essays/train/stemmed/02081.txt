i agre with thi statement becaus of sever reason . my experi and observ made me think that way . there is a larg number of advertis surround our daili life includ tv commerci , poster , billboard , and so on . howev , there are not mani advertis show what they acual are in my opinion . for exampl , one time i purchas a mascara at a drug store , becaus i wa attract by it poster portray a beauti ladi with a long mascara . nevertheless , i wa veri disappoint by it 's result . there wa no differ between other product . as my exampl , i am veri sure that there are mani peopl who have experienc same . most of advertis are usual over exagger becaus they need to sell their product . in order to sell their product , they have to attract their target audienc . it is not easi thing to do . actual the cost for advertis product is oftenli more expens than cost for make a product . it is veri obviou that compani want to make their product look good or even better than they realli are . moreov , mani compani compet with other compani in the same industri . due to high industri competit , compani even more encourag to promot their product in extrem way . it is their job . in conclus , becaus of there reason i agre with the statement that most advertis look much better that they realli are .
