acc . to me a student should focu more on idea and concept than on learn concept becaus if he will know the idea & concept he will be abl to appli hi learn in hi practic & normal life rather focuss on fact . by knoow the idea & concept , he can check & approv the practal of a learn . but in the case of fact he ha to follow them blindli like a theorit essay . also by know the idea , he can use them formak basic of other relat subject & can continu to research on the basi of concept & make hi own learn fact . but in case of fact , he wont be abl to go out hi bound area of learn fact & continu to follow on the same & wont be abl to explor & prove hi fact . thi will kill a student 's curious & he will becom a follow not a leader . there wont be ani pace in hi life . he will continu to work on same old fact . but by know the idea & concept , he can come close to the practacil of a topic & it will becom a learn for hi life . these idea & concept broaden the mind of a student to think & develop more but in case of fact , these narrow the emrg think of a learn student . by learn idea & concept , he can lead them to a certifi notion by produc practic result but in case of fact , he will not be boter to work ani more on that becaus it will be a so call proff to him . so focu on ida 7 conc
