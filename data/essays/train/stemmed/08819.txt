i agre with thi statement , ` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . ' in my opinion , success peopl ha great abil to do someth , efoort a bit , and good luck . as you see some famou star or celebr , they are mostli clever and have amaz idea which no one had never though . howev , they had also risk becaus they are tri to do someth new . new thing must have risk becaus no one had tri befor . although they had risk , they alway tri and get succeed . needless to say , it 's not easi , but they have strong feel to do what they want to do . in addit , they have experi and knowledg , for exampl about bisi , art , trade money , and so on . thi is the most import thing to be succeed . on the other hand , peopl who want to someth new , but are afraid of do that can never be succeed . if they realli want to be succeed , they should be brave to tri new thing . howev , if they do n't have ani own plan and peopl who help and support them , they must not tri if they want to do . as a result , in my opinion , success peopl alway learn , studi , compair and check other . they read book , magazin , get inform and so on . then first of all , they want to tri as soon as possibl , faster than other . take risk are not matter for them . be interest is the most imoirt thing to be succeed . if we are not interest in everyth at all , we ca n't find ani new thing . not onli feel that , but also knowledg , abil effort and energi are need . no one ca n't be susse without them what i told .
