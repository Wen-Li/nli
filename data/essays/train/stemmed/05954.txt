with the rapid develop of societi and technolog , the car we use today migh have someth differ in the futur . i strongli agre that there will be fewer car in use than there are today twenti year later in consider of econom , earth-friendli , and technolog factor . first , the great number of car and the shortag of oil troubl mani industri countri in the world . gener speak , car are prove to be the worst effici transport . it is becaus that we usual drive alon but a car can take at least four peopl at a time . the space is not use is a wast of time and money . peopl will rethink about the necessar of drive car , especi when the price of the oil is so expens . drive car is not an econom choic at all today . the second reason whi i think car will be replac soon is that car bring out too mani disadvantag to both human and the earth . even though that sometim peopl think that it is veri conveni to drive a car , it caus more pollut than we expect , such as nois and air pollut . mani studi show that the air pollut caus by car have neg impact on the fertil of anim . not mention that the nois pollut caus health problem . therefor , i think the natur resourc on earth , the most preciou treasur share by all human and anim , should be protect by use less car . lastli , technolog will chang the way of life when it come to the desper need of custom . mani scientist and businessmen today are look forward to have some new mass transit system or invent to replac the car . take the internet for exampl , peopl can take onlin cours and do onlin shop without drive out . henc , mayb twenti year later , we do not need car to go to anoth place . instead , we can do all the thing by the aid of technolog in commun and transport . in summari , i believ that the number of car will decreas in twenti year for car consum too much oil , car caus a seri of pollut , and more cutting-ag mass transit system will be provid . as a result , i think that the decreas of car will be just around the corner .
