i disagre with the statement accord to which it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact for the follow reason : first , a theori must alway be follow by a praxi , as the austrian philosoph karl popper use to state at the begin of last centuri . as an exampl , thi make me think of the last class on pedagogi i attend at the univers of bologna ( itali ) a coupl of week ago : the professor told us that student need to know fact , but it is also true that in my countri on the whole we student are not train so practic way second , i believ that what make histori is praxi , fact and event , not just theori : it is the praxi that determin the chang and the develop of histori . third , a young student who is more `` theoric '' than practic ( just like me unfortun , i should say ! ... ) can give the impress of live in anoth world and he sometim can even have some difficulti in everyday life : how mani time have i person felt somehow lost and unconfid in practic situat that appar were not so hard to face ! ... that is due to the fact that unfortun i am still not so experienc , i believ . .. ! in conclus , i believ that idea and concept should alway be relat and appli to fact , even though i can understand that that is not alway the case .
