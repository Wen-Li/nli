should we studi in the specif subject as some peopl content ? i agre with thi point insofar as that as a colleg student the major cours is import for us . howev , those peopl might beg the question by neglect the fact that the `` ture educ '' mean have mani differ area knowleag . when i face with thi situat , i prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ . in one import aspect , studi other subject is clearli accur in the extent that everi subject could connect with each other . they could not stand by their own , for exampl , without the knowledg about math , chemistri will not do the correct the data from the lab . in addtion , for `` ture educ '' the more signific consider is that in the modern societi , we need mani differert subject knowledg to have our own becom more competit when face the develop of the technolog . ani observ person could list the adequ to illustr thi point , consid the develop of the comput . if we do not know how to comput , which compani might employ us and how we get the so mani inform around the world ? asid from the two proposit mention abov , one caveat might come along with have too knowledg of other subject . special in our major subject provid the us to get the certain job in subject . the contrari side of board knowledg would mirror a too-narrow view about the true educ and it adequ object . i would admonish that extend the point too far may risk have a chill effect on the univers studi . in sum , even though i prefer to have broad knowledg about the differ subject , no area of the educ could oper in a vacuum . to becom `` true educ '' , we must strike the apt balanc between the major studi and the pursuit . whether mean of educ is justifi must be determin on case-by-cas basi by weight the benefit of the individu and societi .
