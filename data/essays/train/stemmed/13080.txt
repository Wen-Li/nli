i agre to the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . to my mind , thi is a typic but natur problem of advertis . show an obviou benefit of buy the product , or even present a brand to a new market , advertis is design to let the sell rate increas . and that is whi advertis onli announc the advantag of a product , but not the disadvantag or problem that may occur if use it . moreov , the design of the advertis is not necessarili interest in the benign of the user who buy the product , despit , he or she just want to sell it . to show thi problem , i will make two exampl of advertis : everybodi know that chocol tast sweet and delici on the one hand , but if you eat to much of it , you will get fat . nevertheless , the advertis onli deal with the delici tast or may show a famou person - who is of cours not fat at all - eat the chocol product which shall be bought . anoth , veri obviou exampl for an advertis exagger the use of the product is the advertis for wash powder : if you use one special brand of wash powder , your cloth will get clean much better than bz use anoth product . and the white t-shirt in the advertis are as white one can hardli imagin . but despit of the neg effect of advertis , there are posit one 's , too . without advertis you get no idea of the varieti of product you are abl to buy . and as you know the problem of advertis , you can judg it better . i think everi adult , and also most of the teenag know that not everyth advertis provid is true . nevertheless the product may have an advantag . and often you realiz new product which you mayb search for onli by the advertis . in conclus , although most advertis present product better than they realli are , it is not so bad mani peopl belief . and moreov : you do not have to buy these product .
