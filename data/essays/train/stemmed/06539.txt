i agre to the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today for three reason . think of the pollut air and the grow width of the ozon hall , the number of car must be reduc whether we like it or not for the surviv of the global citizen . first of all , we have to improv the condit of the pollut air . in develop countri , such as china and korea , they have a grow number of automobil , which caus even wors air pollut . also develop countri , such as the unit state , have as great number of car as befor , as they are use to the conveni way of life with automobil . howev , we have to have clean air to surviv on the earth . if we continu to live in thi pollut air , much more peopl would die becaus of pollut air . we have to do someth for the better of human be . secondli , there will be less amount of petral avail to keep the car run . oil is not sustain resourc and it will be use up if we keep use it . to obtain enough amount of oil , there will be more case of intern conflict and war . therefor we have to think of altern way of transport , such as public transport , car share , and even walk to work . thirdli , the number of peopl who can buy a car will decreas becaus of widen of the gap between the rich and the poor . these day , the rich get richer and the poor get poorer , and unfortun , the number of the poor outnumb the rich in mani case . thi is whi i have to agre that we must reduc the number of car in twenti year , although i now indulg the luxuri of drive to work . i realli have to think of what i can do to improv thi environment issu of the world .
