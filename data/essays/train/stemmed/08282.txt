i disagre with the idea that young gener do n't have enough time to help their commun for the follow reason . first reason is that almost all school have a class which give student to do some volunt activ these day in japan . when i wa in the senior high school , i took the class of volunt work onc a week . in thi class , student pick up garvag on the road , play with children who ha mental illn , and join to social event , for exampl , festiv of our town . through my high school day , i could learn spirit of welfar , and it made me to help my commun more easili . second reason is that young peopl have mani opportun to help old peopl nowaday . becaus of tendenc to becom aging-societi , there are a lot of peopl who are age in japan . if we go out , we may face the situat that we must help old peopl at least onc in a day . for exampl , i help to car a lagguag of old ladi at stair of station everi morn , and give them a seat on the train . moreov , sometim i go to neighbor 's hous to talk with old ladi who live alon in order to erac her loneli . thu , there are mani opportun for young peopl to contribut their societi in mani way , and thi opportun are go to increas as aging-societi will be advanc .
