i disagre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . becaus the truth of the thing is alway right way for everyth . the advertis make producet seem much better that ca n't to stand forev . first reason i think the product did n't need to seem much better thatn they realli are that becaus when i go to the shop center to buy someth , i usual need that and we will buy it . if we bring it go home and found it is n't well as we saw at the shop center . i will fell sad . and i will rememb it name then i will never to buy the thing of the name again . actual the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , that mean they want to sale a lot of product . if everi custom will never buy it at the second time . i think that is the obsid what they want . that may make the children to learn the bad habit . second reason i think we need keep the truth of the product is becaus we need keep the truth for everyth . when a littl child came with hi mum and saw the process of thing as same as the fover . he may be learn from it and do someth as same as that . he wo n't do the truth of the thing . that the troubl with the futur . final , i think if we can work hard for everyth . and tri to do the best . then we will not need some advertis make product seem much better , and the product will be the best . to show the truth of the thing may be not well at that time , but it is a good way to chang to the best .
