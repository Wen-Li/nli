i disagre becaus it doe not matter to tri new thing and thi is show that onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is better than tring new thing . first in fact i wa tring to learn how to speak spanish for 2 year in middl school and after that i master how to speak spanish howev i forgot to speak english . i use to talk japanes at home everytim . there wa no relat between i and speak english . my frend are all japanes . tri new thig make peopl confus . if peop confus amd they can not understand what will happen next . so you have to tell apart which is more import , the futur or the present . in addtion i had to take a physic test in middl school so i wa tring to do my best . on that day i did it veri serious and i wa veri happi . howev my leg wa hurt next day . i went to hospit and i wa examin by a doctor . he said you have to wait for 2 month to heal your leg . i wa in a basebal team and i wa a pitcher of the team . i could not believ it . my friend are disappoint . i wa alon and i can not bear about it so i chang my favor sport . eventu if peopl tri hard and hard or thier bodi will break . i think that peopl should concentr now not the futur . in fact present is more import than the past and the futur , if peopl do not want to do thier best or someon complain and scold you . howev it doe not matter a littl . your life should be decid by you . it doe not relat a littl between the present and the futur . i would like to import the present not the futur .
