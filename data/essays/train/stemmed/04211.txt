i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know . i have specif reason for my opinion . which mainli support the idea of success and develop . the first an most import reason is , that i strongli connect success with challang . in order to have a success i need to have a challang . you can imagin a man who is respons for open a door or gate . he is do thi everi day , without ani chang . therefor he ha no challang , becaus he ha done thi sever time and know what to to . without the challang he can not show a success and wo n't be recogn by anyon . the second point is that you need to stay open mind and learn to be success . everyon recogn someon as success if he doe someth spectacular , new or difficult . in order to do new and difficult thing , i need to know my capabl . these capabl will need train . henc if i do stay with the well known and do not train new capabl , i have less possibl to choos of . therefor i am limit in the thing i can solv . in contrast stay open mind and learn new thing will train my capabl and give me more tool to solv situat which lead to be more success . the third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be success . for exampl your boss will test you befor he promot you . he will give you thing to do that are new for you . for that you will have to take risk to solv thi problem . therefor you need to be abl to take risk to prove yourself and be success . i had thi often in my person career . my boss test me and gave me difficult task . he wa not mainli intrest in the result of the task , but how i did it . in conclus , success need peopl to take risk , move to unknown territori and tri new thing . without thi there would be a stillstand not for yourself but also in the recognit of other . i do encourag everyon to take risk and tri new thing whenev you can .
