ye i do . in my opinion i thing that the best way to travel is alon , not in goup , i 'll tell whi . first if you era in a travel group you heve tod follow the guid and the rest of the group , that indic so you do n't have the time to enjoy the thing that like you , the pictur are faster , quickli and other thing that happen usual . a travel group led by a guid tour could be not exit , becous all the inform is short and in mant case are incorrec . you suposs taht the guid know everyth , buy in some case or some place do n't have the educ or not are prepar . i am not say that all is bad , it have ome point on it side , you can ask , and alway you will find a perfect anwer . if i travel alon i can enjoy everi thing that inter me. person i am an architec , i like watch car the enviro , like build , plaza , street , hous and natur , and for those reason i thing i cant enjoy a group tour . on the other hand is more interest if you construc your kwonlegemet becaus it will for ever , you can get imidiatli refer of place or build , and one import part i cant take pictur like i want . i prefer take my time and not make ani plan of the thing that i go to . that not the sens of a travel. a travel is to get relax , drink some coff in a littl coff shop , walk through the citi , visit some histor place , visit museum and whi not meet peopl . final i wish i cant tavel by arond the word aoln and have mani pictur and mani histori to teel you when i came back .
