as mani specialist stress it , the countless number of car in north-american and european countri is like to stabil and might even begin to whittl down in he next twenti year , becaus of environment and energet issu that make the use of car much more expens than what it use to be when nobodi wa interest in those problem . there are citi , such as london or pari , which creat new law so that it becom veri expens and unpract to drive in town centr . i believ that the unit state will soon chang some of it habit and take similar measur . on the one hand , i disagre with thi point of view as mani research scientist are on the verg of major scientif breakthrough that should enabl mankind to switch to environ respect techniqu such as all-electr car or hydrogen energi . the ever grow interest for sustain develop may deal with these issu in western countri . on the other hand , i am much more pessimist about poor countri , especi fast-develop nation like china or india where peopl are begin to have access to car . even though the high price of crude oil are partli a consequ of the instabl in the middle-east , we must no forget that china is anoth reason as it use of petroleum is rocket . there are hundr of milllion of chines peopl who will probabl be rich enough soon and buy a car . but all the new energi technolog figur out by scientist are go to be far too expens for those peopl to use in the next twenti year so that they will probabl buy regular car and particip in the plight . even though scienc is the solut to the rocket number of car , i believ that the develop of mani asian , south-american and african countri is like to paricip in thi issu . the opposit evolut will need much more than twenti year to be achiev .
