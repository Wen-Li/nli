studi can be a great pain for mani student , and it is true that mani doubt the purpos of learn throughout the cours . i believ learin is an import process in which i can incorpor more inform and enrich myself , therefor i believ studi in gener is import . howev , i believ understand the basic idea ha to come befor learn fact , which is usual more simpl and interest . for instanc , i have know mani friend who do not have strong base for the mathemat : they have difficulti in solv basic calcul such as multipl with fraction . also , when a student ha difficulti in understand , it is like to caus her to lose interest in studi . thu , lack of the basic knowledg may lead student to lose the will to studi . when those who lack the basic knowledg learn fact , those fact may not seem so appeal becaus they are not familiar . howev , learn fact can be more entertain . and moreov , i believ it effect is the most appar in the studi of histori . for exampl , i strongli believ that i would not be so interest in studi histori , or world war ii in particular , if it wa not for the background knowledg i have gain throughout the life . becaus i have seen a documentari about ann frank and holocaust , the inform provid in the classroom seem a lot more interest and familiar , give me a will to learn more about the subject . although some peopl may not realiz the great import of the presenc of interest , i believ student should persu strong base for each subject through understand the idea step by step . i believ interest are greatest factor which would bring chang to the student ' attitud , and more importantli , their will to studi . and i do enjoy know and persu trivia . howev , as a student and for my abil to studi pleasantli , i believ it is more import to have a great understand in the genral idea rather than learn fact by bit , for collect of the fact is less like to make sens . but i would like to stress that understand of gener idea and learn fact can be interdepend for enjoy studi .
