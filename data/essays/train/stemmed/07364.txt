in my opinion it is better to have a broad knowledg of variou academ subject than to spealiz in one specif subject . in our childhood as children we will be interest in differ subject . even in our school we read a wide rang of academ subject becaus all are essenti in our life as we grow up . special in one subject will not help us to do whatev we want and to achiev pinnacl of success . we need differ subject such as mathemat , histori , physic , chemistri , literatur and mani other subject in our day to day life . without one subject also we cant proceed . for exampleif i do special in physic and donot know other subject at all then there is no mean to my interest at all . i need to literatur when i hav to convers with peopl and for count money and all i must know math . so each and everi subject is interlink with each other . it also make studi easier by do differ subject rather than sit with one subject . with the knowledg of differ academ subject we can achiev immens knowlendg in variou stream . we will be awar of the worldli progress and new invent or discoveri . even the great scientist of the world had an idea of the differ subject . for exampl mari curi discov the effect of radioac tive substanc and the cure for the cancer . it soleley not chemistri which she appli in the discoveri . there is a lot of physic and math also involv in it . there are mani advantag of know differ subject . some peopl do special in art , literatur , etc.but they should be awar of other subject . learnind differ subject will includ a lot of curios and gener knowledg of a person . it will motiv an individu to adopt innov think and to get expos to the world . so i conclud by tell that there are mani advantag of have a knowledg of differ subject rather than a singl bore subject .
