the knowledg in itself ha the import . whether it is broad or it is specif , it is anoth thing . have knowledg in ani form is quit import or the develop of the individu . actual the broad knowledg ha it own advantag over the spacif one . take an exampl from the madic field . suppos u have problem in your eye . now in thi case what you do . you go to a health centr . there the doctor ( gener one who ha broad knowledg in hi field ) will check you . if the problem is seriou the he will refer you to the eye specilist . or if the problem is not so seriou and in hi control then he go for the treatment . thu in the last you have not go to speciatist . so you save your time as well as your money ( sinc the fee of specialist is quit expens ) . but for the first case you have to go for the specialist who can treat your eye problem . may be he refer the glass lens for you . thu in thi way onli he is abl to cure your problem sinc he is the spacialist in hi subject or field . thu the specialist have their own advantag which can not be ignor . the other most import thing is that for major in ani subject first you should have the knowledg ( may be litt , sinc thi littl is quit help ) in all the relat subject sinc we know that all subject ha some type of interconnect . for exampl major in the oran chemistri also requir the undrestand of the physic paramet sinc they will contribut and effect the reaction . so either you have the knowledg of physic chemistri or you have to take the help of some physic chemist . so conclus accord to me , it is good import to have a broad knowledg even though you are majo in a specif one . sinc it will help you in some way .
