life is perceiv differ by differ kind of peopl . similarli young peopl enjoy life more than elder do can be state onli by view perspecrt of life partial . what i mean to say is that i do not agre with the fact that young peopl enjoy more than the elder do complet . in my opinion youth can be view as stage of physic stength and vigour and also as a stage of stress and respons . in youth everi day is a challeng and one can not afford to while away the time they have . therefor it becom more stress for young peopl . one ha to attend their studi , fund their studi and at the same time earn for a live , compet with their fellow classmat for the first posit . then come a stage of choosing-choos a career that shall decid everyth and choos a life partner with whom one ha to spend the rest of their life . onc satisfi about the stage of settlement , then come the stage of feel respons for one 's children , their educ , desir and their settlement . inspit of all these difficulti youth is an age of pleasur , vigour , adventur , friendship and love . it is a bless state , usual with constant good health that give an oppurtun to experi and make the most of life . i feel unfortun are those who do not realis the import of youth and neglect the age under the pressur of respons . old age to me in a stage of peac where one ha to enoy the fruit of all the hardwork one ha done dure their lifetim . sinc elder peopl are often subject to brunt of illhealth and ill they have to enjoy life to the maximum in the destin durat of old age that they have . therefor , i opin that one ha to perceiv life beautiful , all stage have their own import and each stage should be enjoy with an optimist attitud . onli then can one realis the import of ouer birth .
