there are two kind of peopl around us in basic , success one and unsuccess one . there are a lot of reason affect the success or caus the unsuccess , we all awar of them . but when we search the live of success peopl , we gener face with some success stori . nearli all of these stori start with a risk factor . but in my opinion i am against have too much risk in life . at thi point i want to give a say that i heard in my school life `` more about less or less about more '' . when i am ask to choos one of them , i chose more about less part . becaus i believ that special on the area you are work will be the best and guarante way of be success . when we think about our daili life we can see the exampl support my idea . for exampl , think about two restaur one is special on pizza , and the other ha a lot of kind plu pizza . and you want to eat pizza . most of the peopl around us will choos the pizza restaur becaus the human logic state that `` they are expert on thi job '' . to be successful i believ that person must be one of the best in his/her area . but at thi point i want to clerifi someth . what i mean here in text by success is not money , therefor rich peopl are not accept as success in my mind . my success persondefinit is that `` someon who contribut much to societi '' . in order to earn big money it is true that you must have risk , but success peopl , in my mind , are the one who are realli know what to do and can see far futur from today . in thi way a person can react to the chang in societi quickli and thi can result in reaction that may make peopl think as if the person is take risk . but the person know the reason and the result of the reaction veri well so that he can see the success that other peopl can not see at that point . to sum up i want to ask a question ; live is risk by it own whi to take more risk ?
