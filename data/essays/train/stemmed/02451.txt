some peopl tri new thing and take risk , while other onli do what they alreadi know how to do . onli do what one alreadi know is a safe way . howev , i believ that tri to do new thing is alway better . first , it is benefici to tri for new thing becaus by do so , one can learn and therefor hone him or herself . if one were to repeat do what he or she alreadi know how to do well , that would be bore and there is no opportun for him or her to learn , or find new thing . second , it is alway fun to get to know new thing , and especi when one master , there is a great fulfil . even when one fail to be success , he or she can alway set new goal for it and sharpen hi or herself , and eventu be success . the same idea can be use on skateboard . if one were to onli do what he or she alreadi know and repeat them all over , there is noth more he or she can do , which would make it extrem bore . howev , by tri out for new trick or move that one ha not yet done , he or she might be abl to find someth new that would not onli help him or her make that trick , but also on other skill . when he or she eventu learn it , there is a great fulfil and happi . by tri to do what one ha never done befor , he or she can train hi or herself , learn new thing , and feel accomplish . even if there are risk , one can learn someth by fail and eventu be success . from these benefit , which can never be gain from repeat what one alreadi know how to do well , it can be conclud that tri new thing is alway better .
