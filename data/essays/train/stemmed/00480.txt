i believ that most of the product we see on tv or magazin are much better than they realli are . two year ago i bought a face cream i had seen on the televis and it turn out to be a disast . thi kind of misrepresent are realli common in today advertis world becaus of the compani aim to sell more product and advertis agenc way of be more attract . the compani repres their product better sinc there is a a lot of potenti custom and they all want to take their share in thi larg cake . these compani have great competit between themselv and they are readi to do everyth even these thing are uneth . their way to sell more product is to show their product better and they can do thi easili sinc there is no control over the kind of misrepresent . besid the compani , the advertis agenc show some product differ than they realli are . sinc they are in the busi to make peopl believ , they creat some idea or imag which seem more attract to the custom on the televis while misrepres the product . while they are do thi untru present , the compani do not prevent them sinc it is for their advantag . from thi arreng in a conclus , today most adverti we see repres the better version of the product and there are still peopl who buy these product befor search the product realli qualiti . i took my lesson two year ago and i hope everyon see the true face of these compani and advertis as soon as possibl . thi misrepresent will continu as long as it goe until someon come and show the real face of these compani and advertis agenc to all world , but until that time i wonder ` what is next'
