the statement refer to the differ between understand and illustr . i partli agre with thi statement . be abl to analys as well as understand idea and concept is a crucial part of academ achiev . understand concept do not onli confer student the abil to anal a situat but also to adapt thi concept to other context . inde , the role of a concept is to provid a broad base of understand . thi intellectu exercis is part of the process that enabl the student to switch from theoret consider to practic consider . thi process is possibl onli through the concept . consequ i think that we should consid concept as more import regard the fact that they are part of a construct process . we have seen abov than the concept is a preciou tool for the understand process . howev , thi tool must first be understood in itself . and at thi stage , factual element remain crucial . a concept is reliabl onli if it is illustr by fact . therefor , i consid as also import that student learn fact becaus it repres the onli way to understand concept . for exampl , a concept ha no valu without a broad factual basi . therefor , fact are import too for student . as a conclus , i would say that understand concept is more import for student as a way to be abl to analys a situat . howev , factual element seem crutial as a way to understand concept . my consider on the compar import of the two element would be to consid them as part of a uniqu process . thu , consid concept without ani refer to factual element seem useless . also , consid fact without join it with concept make ani global oper approach imposss .
