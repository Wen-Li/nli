thi is a veri interest question becaus it repres the current challeng in french educ . inde , the task of educ is to teach student a lot of theori , idea and concept . that 's also whi we learn philosophi in school , to learn to doubt , to think and anal . the follow quotat of montaign show the real question : `` it is better to have a well establish brain that a full brain . '' but both ca n't work separ : we need comon knowledg to learn how to take a decis and how to behav in societi . histori show us the way to behav with other countri , mathemat show us how to deal with other countri , geographi teach us how to reach other countri and languag allow us to speak in other countri . the comon knowledg repres all idea , concept and theori we need to make the right decis and understand our environ . despit all of thi , one day , student have to use their knowledg in a practic field to experi the profit of it . the increas rate of internship demonstr thi need of ` fact ' . educ requir alway more from student without teach them the real work they are attend for . that 's whi , there are more and more privat school that offer a practic school with a long period of internship . univers realiz thi problem few year ago and tri to adapt themself to the realiti of the market . to conclud , i would say that thi is a central question in educ field . in my point of view both are as import . the question is no longer to know if we should teach idea and concept but more to know where is the border between idea , concept and practic fact ?
