peopl , especi common peopl , often discuss whether it is necessari to tri new thing and take risk rather than onli done what they alreadi know how to do well . but i strongli believ that succss peopl tri to new thing and undergo risk . if it were not for take harship and tri new thing , they have no opportunit to win other competitior . success peopl gener more bold and painstak than those who do not . as everyon know , thi is not the onli way of succeed in do , but thi is one of the most effecit way of succed . in addit , it can posit contribut to find new one that give peopl a lot of confid . let 's say that a scientist tri to reasearch new thing , if he is just the man who just mix other theori that alreadi everi peopl know . he would never be success in hi file . if he tri to find new thing and take harship , he would succeed . success peopl also think differ way in everi time . i understand that too much attent paid to new thing is neg becasus it may caus much more cost to do and sweep memeb along , sometim to the detriment of their origin work . but the advantag of tink creativ eclips the disadvantag . for exampl , peopl who alway think differ for win in the market econnomi can find the fraction between mani product . so he can beat other competitior . as everyon know peopl can not work to it best abil when there is not new one that enabl compani to be vigor as well as compani to win in economi . take all of thing into account , there is no doubt in my mind that if you want to success peopl or to win in some field , you should be not do what you know how to do well but do more courag , painstak and creativ .
