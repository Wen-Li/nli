the french educ system put a premium on the theoryc knowledg , contrari to other educ system which emphasi parctic knowledg . which of the two could be the best ? understand idea and concept is the base to be abl to undersand the realiti , the current event in the entir world . inde , theoric knowledg and cultur permit to be open mind , to analys a situat with the nessari compet . for exampl , a brilliant manag ha to know a great varieti of inform to make the righ choic . moreov , franc promot the ` class preparatoir '' , it is two year of hard work to integr the best busi school . to suc the exam , you have to learnt a great amount of concept : you have to studi mathmat , econom , philosophi , histori . the goal of thi learn is to give you kwonledg to cope with all type of situat , in everi day life , at work . .. but on the other hand , to understand concept is no sufici . i think it is someth veri interrest and use , but student have to learn fact too . for exampl , certain adult did not studi long time when they were young and they suc in life becaus they use their practic compet and their work experi . so it is import for student to do train period for exampl . to conclud , i think these two type of learn are link , so they have the same impot for me becaus if student know mani concept and they stay far from realiti , it is a problem becaus in their futur , for their career , both compet are requir .
