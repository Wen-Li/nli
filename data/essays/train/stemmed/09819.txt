some peopl in the world , may be in poor countri dislik to understand idea and concept , but they prefer to learn fact . i do n't agre with thi statement , becaus the real sens of the life is in the fact . for exampl : it is more import for a fisher understand how find a fish , or it is more import for he swim in the river or sea and becam to know how is phylosophi of fish , i think the fisher should be firt a good swimer , and he onli will obtain good result in hi work with practic , with fact . but it is also import understand idea of how work the thing , becaus if we do not studi first the world can not know the fact . for exampl , the same fisher will obtain best result in hi work , if he first will studi how is the behavior of the fish , in which kind of water , the fish grown faster . other exampl , the farmer cultiv a lot of year ago , without our tecnolog and knowlodg . how did they cultiv it ? there is a onli answer , with fact , with practic . so , if the farmer cultiv with more idea , with more knowledg , their result will be best . how did child learn to speak ? he do not learn with to understand idea and concept , he learn with fact . in the progress countri , there are some peopl think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in concluss , it is more importand for student learn fact , practic for learn , becaus thi can use for them in their countri .
