in my point of view , i agre that young peopl enjot life more that older peopl do . young as the peopl are , they receiv inform more quickli than the older . thu , when they they want to enjoy their life they have more idea , more passion , and more creativ . firstli , nowaday , each time we receiv a piec of new inform we hold a new idea . provid that we do n't have the internet we ca n't enjoy mass media resourc . the older peopl are not abl to enjoy them due to the limit of the knowledg of the internet . young peopl dive into the ocean sea for the sake of the new technolog , imagin that if young peopl ca n't get the new idea they wo n't do that . howev , the old peopl may not or dare not . secondli , i think young peopl have a strong passion for life . they dream for their futur . as be in the young group , i alway plan my bright futur no matter what problem i encount , thu i am get readi for anyth to happen in the next minut . i do n't think the old peopl are will to accept all that is not pleasant . life is full of unperdict and i think the best way to enjoy it is to enjoy the unknown thing happen . we are passion enough to face the life . thirdli , life should be around with creativ . there is impossibil that a lot of thing such as romant thing , surpris thing are suppos to happen to us without our creativ . i think the young peopl are more creativ than the older one . if we want to enjoy the life it ca n't be emphas ani more that creativ is requir . a lot of famili problem is caus by less creativ . therefor , our young peopl should take the advantag of hold variou creavit to enjoy life . life is enjoy with passion , creativ , and idea . young peopl , as the major part of societi , should do it better that the older peopl .
