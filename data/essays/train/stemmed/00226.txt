although it would be a good thing for the environ if there were fewer car in the futur , i do not think thi will happen . three argument convinc me that there will be even more car in the near futur . in the first place , most of us reli on their car to easili go to everi place whenev it may be desir . i am sure that no one will chang thi behaviour , unless he or she is forc to do so . i do not think everyon will suddenli use the bu or the train , becaus most of us would feel as if their mobil or person right to move were restrict . therefor , there will not be fewer car within 20 year . addit , the number of car is a global affair . i recent read an articl about the emerg state in the far east , which mention the fact that peopl in countri like china are about to have gather enough wealth to afford car . imagin a billion person from thi region , who suddenli drive a car ! so , even if the develop countri would reduc their relianc on car , the number of car would actual increas . quit on the contrari , one might argu that global societi will have no choic but to use fewer car in the futur becaus of a shortag of oil . but i think that mankind will final overcom thi concern , at least when it is forc to do so , by use altern energi . these technolog are alreadi avail today , but are not be use extens for sever reason . eventu , when cheap oil is now longer avail , car produc will switch , becaus of the peopl ' relianc mention earlier . consequ , the number of car will not drop significantli . in conclus , i predict that the number of car will rise instead of declin . i would feel a lot better with that , if peopl would take more care of their environ and use green car today , even if they are a bit more expens .
