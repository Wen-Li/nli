the issu of travel with a tour guid is a controversi one . some peopl find it to be benefici , and more inform while other think that travel on their own is more challeng . i , howev believ that travel with a group guid is better . the reason for my belief are the follow : first , travel with a tour guid is more inform , sinc the guid ha all the inform about the place , and should be abl to answer ani question . he ha also visit the place mani time , and know all the interest place to be seen . i think that a person travel with a tour guid will gain much more inforamt and knowledg about a countri 's cultur , than if he wa to travel by himself . i have travel with a tour guid onc to turkey , and although it wa a tire trip becaus the schedul wa full , i got to know most of the turkish cultur . one of the thing i wo n't forget , is when we visit a play about the old tradit turkish wed . it wa a veri interest thing to see . second , the tour guid usual ha a schedul for hi group . in thi schedul the group get to see the most import , famou , and interest place in the countri be visit , probabl a person visit the countri on hi own would not have been awar of , or could not have plan such a schedul . i find the time schedul to be my ultim reason to choos a tour guid . anoth reason , is the financi reason , usual tour guid have special deal with hotel or restur sinc they bring them custom . third , i believ that travel with a tour guid who know the countri , and travel with a group of peopl is much safer than travel alon . when visit a new place , a person doe not know the safe place , or what time is a good time to walk in a certain neighborhood . these detail , which are of great import , are taken care of by the tour guid . for all of the reason , i mention abov i believ that it is a much safer , and more interest experi to travel with a tour guid , if of cours travel to a countri for the first time .
