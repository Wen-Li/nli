i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i disagre thi becaus half knowledg is alway harm . the primari reason whi i prefer special in one specif subject is special give you indepth studi of the subject which could be veri use in the real time applic . for exampl a comput engin can not be an effici cardiologist . thi may effect the heart patient . anoth reason for special in one subjet is you can discov new thing after go across insight inform of the subject . most of the discoveri have been made by the scientist onli after special in one subject . that is after conduct repeat experi on one thing . thirdli , special improv creativ in a person . in everi field special is the essenti compon . howev it is better to have some knowledg of mani academ subject and that is whi when you come from graduat to post graduat then to phd , you are suppos to take special subject . therefor base on the special student are classifi as comput engin , electron engin , doctor and so on . in conclus , i strongli recommend that special in one subject is better than have broad knowledg on mani academ subject .
