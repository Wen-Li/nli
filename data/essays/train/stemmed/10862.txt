well , it depend of the kind of person , i think we all have sundri of answer and thougt about thi statement , in my person opinion i think it is more import to student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . howev i am not say that it is not import to learn fact , but for me the most import is to develop thi idea and concept in usual life . in the first place , when student learn in a classroom , most of them studi for the exam and no for life . for that reason i think it is import for the teacher to develop some outsid class excersis , in that way they will be abl to practic and realli live thi hypotet situat , i am total sure that thi will be more efect than to be insid of the class talk and talk about the theme , becaus you not also will understand the idea and the concept , you will also rememb thi mayb for the rest of your life , if you have a good memori of cours . in the second place , when we memor special concept in class and we have a final test at the end of the year , we usual do n't rememb thi special fact , becaus dure the year there are so much activ , exam , quiz , and practic that are veri hard to rememb all , we onli keep the idea and the concept in our mind . meanwhil , if you do a research of your work , mayb ask some student all around your colleg , or univers you will find out that they prefer outsid activ , in that way they can get the idea fastern than to learn the fact . on the other hand there are some student that prefer to learn fact becaus for them it is easier to understand and asimil . final i think that thi is the world were we live , we will find a varieti and sever person with differ opinion and concern about life , studi , and whatev is in our mind , but in thi speciff answer now you know my opinion , for me it is easier to lern idea and concept , mayb for you is the same , or mayb not . but now , you can understand me a littl bit more .
