what kind of peopl do you like ? in my case , i tend to be interest in the peopl who tri new thing and take risk . i think that i also like the peopl who is do onli same thing to know how to do well , howev i realli like the peopl who tri new thing . therefor i agre with the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . first of all , i realli like challeng for new thing , becaus i think that challeng will give me a comfort life . for exampl , when i live in japan , i often watch a tv program which is some peopl tri to invent new technolog . i love the tv program , becaus some inventor had been studi some difficult new technolog , final they invent the technolog , for exampl , dvd , microchip and so on . thank to the invent , our live are get better than befor . if the inventor had n't tri that invent , our live would have n't been conveni . therefor i think that such peopl are veri import . moreov , i realli think that a challeng spirit will give us encourag . for exampl , when i work for a bank , there is a veri good salesman in the bank . he wa veri famou for a loan offic , and then he often got the best sale award . howev , one day he suddenli quit our bank , and he establish a busi consalt compani . mani banker in our bank were surpris , becaus if he continu to work the bank , he would be a presid . howev he quit . he said that he want to tri new own busi without our bank 's name valu . after he quit our bank , i wa realli encourag from him . as a result i also quit the bank , and i tri to get an mba in the usa . even though we are do veri well , i realli think that challeng spirit is veri import for our live and our mental . if we did n't tri new thing , our live would n't improv and our own abil and possibl would n't broad . i think that even if we take a risk , we should tri someth . therefor i agre wiht the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do well .
