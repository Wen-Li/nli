i agre that that it is more difficult to assimil an idea unless there is a good exampl to support it . in order to make them reachabl , idea and concept should be follow by real fact taken from everyday 's life experi . to illustr with an exampl , a concept such as ` freedom ' ha a veri broad mean and therefor it may be difficult to categor and confin it with a few sentenc . it should be present with exampl from differ place around the world , relat to peopl with complet differ cultur background . import fact that chang the cours of the histori should be given . the first major movement that start in the name of freedom is the french revolut . it chang the face of the world in a veri posit way . thi would be an excel exampl to explain the fact that freedom is essenti for anyon who want to live his/her life proudli and respect . everyon ha a right to make his/her own decis and respect other peopl 's decis . also , one should have the freedom to express him/herself . there should be a toler and respect toward differ opinion . scientist , writer who are kill violent becaus of their opinion should be given as exampl to illustr the danger when one overtak anoth 's freedom of express . with freedom come anoth concept which is ` equal ' . thi idea can also be support by mani histor event that took place and still take place . peopl with differ race , religion and cultur should be treat equal . there should be no judgement on peopl ' opinion base pure on which religion or cultur they belong to . unfortun , even today , we see mani exampl of inequ . everi day newspap are full of them , and i think a professor will have no difficulti to show student a few fact illustr the exampl of inequ .
