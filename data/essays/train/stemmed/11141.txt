to me thi statement seem reason becaus idea and concept are necessari to understand whi someth is as it is and how it develop . concept and idea connect fact , describ and explain their relationship to each other and make process understand . furthermor they enabl student to think beyond what is observ , to cast a light on relat issu , analys fact and develop or to make predict or suggest for the futur . thu , concept and idea are theoret approach to the observ world and the basic element of what we would gener regard as scienc . learn and understand idea and concept is therefor necessari to studi serious and eventu to be a good scientist . a further step is develop your own idea and concept on what you know empir . thi show that you not onli understand the relationship of fact and what is behind them but that you are also abl to be product and creativ in find new explan and form of analys someth . although it is certainli not requir to develop an own theori in order to be a good student , have individu idea is fundament for your person develop and an intellectu necessar at ani univers . so , i would say that the statement is correct although one should keep an import aspect in mind : in order to understand idea and concept you have to know the fact at first . and thi mean that you realli have to know as much as possibl about a special topic becaus fact are the unavoid basi of concept and idea or theori . lack import inform may not onli result in complet disabl to understand concept but can also caus misinterpret that chang the mean of an idea , theori or concept total and thu lead the student into a complet wrong direct which might have seriou consequ . so , in the end , it is import to stress that learn fact is definit necessari . but they still are onli the basi . real understand of a topic also mean that you have to understand the concept and idea behind the pure fact . that is what make idea and theoret approach so import .
