the educ is more and more import to everyon in the world now , but differ peopl have differ pointview on what is more import for the student . some peopl think that understand the idea is more import , but there is also a group of peopl think that it shou n't be like that , learn fact is more import than understand idea . i , howev , believ that we should pay more attent on learn fact than understand idea . becaus the reason below . the first reason , the most import one , the idea are come from the fact and the fact is help us to understand the idea better . here is an exampl , when we take the physic class , we alway do a lot of lab , for what ? to get the fact , then by these fact , we get the idea by ourselv , then becaus we got the idea by ourself , we understand these idea much deeper than just learn from the teacher . and also , the fact is help us to understand the idea much quicker . as an exampl , if you want to learn swim , do you think is it go to be learn it quickier by just get the idea ? or you go insid the water , then you learn how to swim ? of cours should be the second way . then the second reason , idea sometim get wrong , but how do you know ? without the fact , you never know . like in the past time , there is a idea about if two object drop from the same height , then the one got greater mass would hit the ground first . but then a scientist do n't think so , so he did a lab , he went on a tower and drop two object with differ mass at same height , but these two objest hit the group at the same time , so that mean the idea said higher mass hit the ground first is wrong . so we see , without the exam by the fact , you never know the idea is right or not . well , from the reason abov , we can say that , learn fact is import than understand idea , no fact , no idea , even we got the idea without the fact , you might get the wrong idea . so i agre with the idea that pay more attent on learn fact .
