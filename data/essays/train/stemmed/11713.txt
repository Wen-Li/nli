i agre with the given statement . i think it is not onli import to understand the idea but also their interact and relationship with each other . usual , fact like formula in econom and date in histori are someth that one can use to get a good grade in a test or exam , but in the real world , that start as soon as a student leav the univers , no one will care if you can calcul a fiction unemploy rate in a fiction economi or not . it is more import to understand how unemploy develop , what factor influenc it , and how it can be influenc by govern . and it is also more import to understand the develop from world war i to world war ii than to know on what exact day the confer of munich took place . idea and concept give a student a toolset of how to approach a problem , how to think . an idea is open to chang , it can be transform , develop and adjust to the situat in which it is need , whi a formula or a fact is onli relev under special , given circumst . of cours it is import to know exampl , from differ time , from differ countri , so one can compar reason and develop line , but thi doe not includ number . in a univers lectur one might hear about the great depress - but it doe not make a differ for the understand if there were 10 or 11 percent of unemploy , it is more import how it wa caus . the onli except in my opinion is in the field of scienc - physic , chemistri or medicin , where the differ between one or two degre of bodi temperatur for exampl can lead to total differ action and outcom . student need to learn to think by themselv , develop their idea and find argument , for or against a theori , they need to learn to judg a situat to act appropriatli , and they will not get to that by learn number by heart .
