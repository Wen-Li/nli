some peopl think that studi a wide varieti of subject is a wast of time , and that one should concentr on one 's major . of cours studi hard about one 's major is import . but learn other subject , which might seem at time unrel to one 's major , is just as import , especi in institut of higher educ like univers . i will introduc my own experi to illustr my point . i am an art major , studi to becom a profession artist . i could have just been content with the technic train and paint class that the art colleg provid . they did help a lot to improv my creativ skill . but i `` wander off '' to the realm of art histori . at first it wa becaus i want to learn about how the great artist of the past creat their work . but as i studi on , not onli did i learn about the histori of visual cultur , but how artwork could be seen from a historian 's point of view , and insid the cultur , histor , and social context . i also took a lot of elect cours in literatur . these class show me how beauti and self-express could be achiev through word . i wa provid with a chanc to compar how literatur wa differ from the art form creat with color and form . it made me think deeper about what paint wa realli about : what it characterist were , and just what it wa that could be done onli through paint and through no other form of art . although art histori and literatur had noth to do with the actual paint process , they both help me tri to produc a better , deeper paint . art histori open my eye to the fact that artwork could be receiv from a variou point of view . literatur class made me think serious about the essenc of paint , my major . in conclus , widen one 's scope in academ interest not onli result in becom more inform but also in open one 's eye to a wider perspect . moreov , one can understand one 's major better by studi other subject , rather than restrict oneself in one 's specifi field .
