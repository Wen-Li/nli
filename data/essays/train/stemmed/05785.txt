some peopl aclaim that they prefer to travel alon , while other oppsit it . despit assort opinion to the contrast , as for me , i would not hesit to agre that travel alon is the best the way to travel . there are some reason as follow . to begin with , travel alon is free . we can go anywher we want and have no need to listen the guid ' requir . howev , if we are in a group led by a tour guid , we have to compli with the guid ' . it entir possibl that there are some place we do not like to stay long but the guid still take us to go . then we will feel unhappi . there is no doubt that our purpos for travel is releav stress and entertain our life . howev , it make us feel more annoy . then whi should we go with a guid ? besid , in nowaday some guid like to take the visitor to the place which are not realli interest place but shop to let us buy a myriad thing which are so-cal `` memorari gift '' . it not onli wast lot of money but also make us feel bore about the tour . to illustr it , there is a persuas exampl . last year , jane went to lushan in xian provinc with a lot of peopl , which is her first time to go there . she thought it would be an indel experi . howev , after she got there , the guid did not take them to climb the mountaon instead of ask them to buy some photo first . and them he also take them to a shop nearbi and make them consum mani thing for the reason that they can symbol that they had been to lushan . admittedli , travel alon is danger to some degre . howev , it is obviou that it instrment rather than detriment to us . therefor , with thoroughli consider , i can draw that i would inclin to travel by my own .
