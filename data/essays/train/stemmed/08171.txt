i agre to the statement that student must understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason for thi is an incid occur in my life , i prefer tell my experinc about thi statement . when i wa do a project i use to sit wit my project team consist about 10 member where each one give there own idea which come to their mind , when i wa in the team i should understand the idea given by the person so that i could implement the idea to get the good result . in the same way when a person is work in the group he should respect the idea of other by listen and understand them . one of my friend work in the it compani as a design of the websit . when he is do that he get mani doubt about that page which he is design then he ask hi partner to give him some suggesst and to share some good consept relat that design . when the partner give the concept it is the dueti to understand by the one who is readi to implement . otherwis there is no use of take concept or idea from other . .. in the same way when a perticular person get ani idea in hi mind the next job he doe hi understand the later part of the idea . base on these exampl that i have given i could fairli agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . learn fact is obvious done by ani one who experinc the incid that he could rememb veri fairli . accord to me when ur around some peopl you should get to understand what they are talk about and understand their idea and view produc by them . final i would say that i do agre about the statement reguard the issu given .
