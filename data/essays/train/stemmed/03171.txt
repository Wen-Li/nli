think about thi statement i come to the conclus that thi statement is actual nonsens and imposs evalu . the first problem of thi staement is that it is much too broad . in order to be abl to evalu on the topic one first ha to narrow down the age group in question . what is meant by `` younger peopl '' ? what is meant by `` older peopl '' ? if `` younger peopl '' mean children of , for exampl , 3-5 year of age and `` older peopl '' mean their parent then i fulli agre with the statement . if one ha ever observ children in kindergarten they seem to have no worri . they can play and meet their friend and usus everth is taken care of for them by the parent . the parent , on the other hand , as alreadi impli , have to take care of everyth : they have to work in order to be abl to buy everyth necessari for every-day life , such as food and cloth . the situat chang when the children get to school . they have duti to fulfil such as attend the class and do thier homework . thi all virtual eat thier time they use to spend for so mani other nice thing . ani adult would say now : `` oh , if i could just go back to school again ! '' howev , it is not about the adult here but about the children 's percept . in the eye of children school can be veri anoy which lead to them not enjoy their life as much as they use to . to which degre they do not enjoy it can not be answer here . it can not be answer , either , whether they enjoy it more or less than adult . thi is depend on mani more factor , probabl most importantli person percept . it is in everyon 's own view whether one enjoy 's life or not . measur and compar joy is rather imposs . thu , gener should be avoid , also becaus each age group ha own worri as well as each societi . children as well as their parent in europ have to worri about differ thing than children in africa , for exampl . a proof for which age group in which societi is the happiest one is probabl imposs to produc - if it wa , the result would probabl be rather astonish .
