the world is full of peopl with a wild rang of differ person , differ experi , and even more diffrent way of se life . some peopl enjoy life more than other , but it doe not depend on the age of the bodi . therefor , i truli disagre with the statement that say `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peolpl do '' . each age ha it own magic , and in everi step of our live we learn and develop abil that help us to enjoy the time we are live . for exampl , when a young child begin to commun with hi or her mother by the use of word , probabl feel realli proud of it , and enjoy it . the same happen when a babi start play with toy , or a kid learn to read . thi fact can be appli to adult when they reach their first academ degre or when they get marri . furthermor , everi person ha it person way of enjoy the thing he or she doe , in addit to a uniqu form of express how he or she feel . for instanc , two human be can experi the same situat at differ period of their live , react to it in a veri differ way , but enjoy it similarli . other fact that is import to have in mind is the concept of jo . it should vari from one person to anoth , besid the fact that a person can be have pleasur when other understand that the first one is suffer . as an illustr , i will state the imagen of a person cri , i can infer that someth bad ha happen to the person , nevertheless he or she can be cri of happi . in conclus , i believ that each person enjoy life in hi or her own way , and would like to add that will be veri help for human to stop look at situat from a person perspect and tri to understand that each person live as he or she want and not to compar between them .
