is it more import for student to understand idea and concept or is it more import for them to learn fact ? in my opinion it is more import to understand concept and idea for sever reason . fortun i had the oppurtun to experi high-school in germani and in the unit state of america . in germani there are no fact ask in test or exam . moreov you absolut will not find ani multipl choic question . in juxtaposit to thi multipl choic question and rememb fact is basic all i did while i wa in chicago . i never realli had to work with the fact i memer . today i can say i forgot almost everyth i have learn in the us but i still understand the concept and idea that were taught to me in germani . anoth reason whi it is more import to understand concept is the follow . a person that is abl to memer a lot is not necesarilli an intelleg person . so it is possibl that a rather unintelleg person get higher grade in school than person that ha a high iq if onli fact are ask . in my opionion the studi fact should be reward but you should not be abl to achiev a veri high grade by just memer fact . my last and most import point is that understand idea and concept prepar you better for your work life . all these fact you might have learn in school will not help you if you can not work with them . and the first step to work with them is to understand the main idea . understand the main idea make it also a lot easier to memer it . so from understand concept you pick up fact anyway . i believ if you understand the idea and concept you will memer the most import fact anyway . therefor just memer fact is a less advanc way of learn . as a consequ of thi it make it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
