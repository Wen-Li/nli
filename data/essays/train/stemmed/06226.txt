mani peopl have believ that young peopl today tend to spend less time to help their commun . howev , i disagre with the statement bacaus there are a lot of way to help other peopl and we ca n't estim how young adult help . to begin with , peopl can devot to their own societi in differ manner . without spend lot of time to work for other , they can dedic themselv for the commun . for exampl , one of my friend use to be blame by other for not give enough time to help the poor . howev , she actual did her best to provid help through the internet . sinc she took a varieti of class at her school , she could n't spend time just dure the day . after know thi fact , most peopl felt sorri to her and regret to focu on just quantiti of the feasibl time . in addtion , help other is not abl to be observ , it also ca n't be estim by an object standard . of cours , spend time would be a good basi , but it never show one 's all tri as i mention befor . to give an idea , here is the exampl from kim-jun , who is one of the famou lawyer in korea . he are renown for not onli be success in hi career but also dedac for the societi . it is evid that he ha limit time to make multipl thing at the same time . in order to overcom thi problem , he ha devot for the commun in variou way which do n't need to long time . he provid a huge money for poor peopl and no one blame him although he dose n't spend enough time . in brief , i strongli support that young peopl have still do their best for the world . they have their own way to help other and we never evalu their tri . for these reason , we should n't overlook how they contribut to our commun just becaus they have n't spent a lot of time .
