in my opinion , young peopl can enjoy life more than older peopl becaus of three main reason which are health , willing for live faster and more enjoy and have less respons for in life . to begin with , it is a biolog fact that as the human becom older his/her health problem increas directli . as a result of thi fact older peopl have mani and differ kind of health problem and these problem prevent peopl to live in a comfort way . for exampl , if a person is a lung cancer , he/sh can not enjoy the life becaus there is a big problem in his/her health . on the other hand , young peopl genar do not have health problem so that they can do whatev they want . secondli , young peopl have the willing for live faster and more enjoy becaus they have independ and new idea about life . for instanc , they may want to go to himalaya mountain for camp and there is noth to prevent them for go . howev old peopl do not want such a hard thing becaus they usual have no energi for that activ and want to stay at home . final , young peopl have less respons in life . in other word they are live more independ from other peopl . they do not have children or wife to look after or usual their onli job is school and they can make lot of plan after school for holiday . these situat make young peopl more free and they have mani differ and creativ plan for life . in conclus , for live more enjoy and differ life , be a young person ha a great import becaus young peopl genar have no health problem , they have a will to live faster and more enjoy than old peopl and they have less respons in life and for their environ .
