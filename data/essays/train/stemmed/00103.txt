i do agre with the statement that nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i think it is realli import that the kid of today do not onli sit in their room and play comput or watch tv . but that is how they spend their free time . they do not care about peopl who realli need help and they are onli interest in themselv . for my applic for a student exchang programm with the govern i wa ask to spend some time in a place where peopl need my help . i chose to go to a place where homeless peopl can have lunch and dinner . dure that time i saw so mani poor peopl , with old and dirti cloth , who were veri hungri or who need medicin . it realli wa an experi for me . i help to give them warm lunch and dinner and i felt so good when i saw that the homeless peopl where happi about the meal and that they could laugh again . there i felt as if i realli can help peopl and that i did someth import . but if you go in the citi you see mani kid who are laugh at homeless peopl , who are angri about them and who say that they should be taken away by someon . but who is the `` someon '' if they do not want to help ? i think it is import to chang their behaviour . furthermor , the same thing happen with old peopl , who can not live longer on their own . the youth of today doe not care about what happen to these peopl . they onli say that they are old and that they will die soon . but the question is what they would say if they are in the posit of the old peopl who need help ? they would wish that there is somebodi who help with their shop , wash , clean the room etc . in my opinion the experi to do someth import and to see peopl laugh again , is realli import for the educt of today 's youth . you do not onli need to be good at school and know how to work but also how to handl other peopl and what to do for the societi . for me that is , when you are readi to becom a respons human be .
