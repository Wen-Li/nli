i do not support the idea express in the statement . i can not think of ani clear or evid reason to think that fewer car will be in use on the near futur . howev , i can present three reason whi i think car use will , at least , state as it is in the present time . the reason are directli relat with the car industri and car custom . to have less car in use , less car should be sold , and that trend can not be seen happen in the near futur . nowaday it is common to have at least two car at each household , and even more if there are young adult in the hous . young adult see car as provid of independ and social prestig , so it will be hard to chang their buy need . in addit , young adult are not the onli one that think that car and independec go togeth , adult think that way too . worker are use to commut and travel short distanc by car . improv at public transport by citi administr are not chang the behaviour pattern of citi commut . by my experi in spain , i think that most of the peopl that use car , drive them to go to work or to the citi , and thi behaviour just seem to increas , not decreas . environment pollut and ga price could be two other reason to decreas car use . howev , none of those reason seem to affect the market . the car industri is focus it effort on research to appli `` green energi '' to car . electr car or hybrid are start to be common on nordic countri and some region of the unit state . i also hope that thi type of car will be more common when their price decreas . in relat to last statement it is the problem of the oil price . expert and ecologist thought that the actual rise trend in oil price will make peopl more sensit to car use and especi in the moment of buy a new automobil , but thi is not happen nowaday . i think that the reason i have present support the idea that car use is not go to decreas in the near futur . if oil price have not help to chang the car use pattern , i think it is ver hard that ani other thing would do it , especi in twenti year .
