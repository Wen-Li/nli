at the begin advertis start with sho what the product realli ha in it and that did not work with peopl who watch it . so from my point of view i will say i agre with what the statement mean and what it is point at . so compani start to do advertis with fals inform . in my point of view the reason is or the reason are that mani product were invent and they have the same qualiti so peopl do not care about what the product ha and what is it look like ? becaus there are mani of them with the same idea . so advertis start to be more cool than talk about the product and let 's talk about the sport car for exampl . they alway show you in the advertis that those two young peopl can hit on the most beauti girl in colleg becaus they have the cooliest car in the entir univers which is unusu to happen in school around except some special time and anoth exampl of that is the coffe advertis when they show smoe handsom boy with beauti girl sit togath in starbuck or whatev it is , talk and laugh while drink that specif kind of coffe or in that specif coffe shop and they look cool so peopl when they see them they feel realli good of do that think of do thi we 'll make them cool or whatev . anyway , advertis are not suppos to be real . it it all about show the bad thing as good enough to get sold from store or use in shop and mall as much as it could . and talk about thi subject advertis are cost a lot of money these day and it will be more and more expens everytim the ad will be long and ha along stori and a new one but if some one ask me about be in thi section my answer would be `` ye '' .
