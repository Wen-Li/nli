profession or gener ? in our current societi of learn and studi there are a lot of theori how to achiev the best result , how to get the best mark and how to get a well paid job . on the one hand some peopl think that specialis on a certain topic or subject and have an entir knowledg of it will be the solut to achiev the most . on the other hand there are peopl who think , that it is necessari to have a certain knowledg in mani differ subject . both of these way to prepar for life have their advantag and disadvantag . if you are specialis on one subject and you realli know much , nearli everyth , about it it is go to be easi for you to get a job in thi area , becaus you are veri well qualifi . but therefor it is import that there are enough job to be offer in your area you are specialis on , becaus it is not appeal be a profession in your subject without have a chanc for a job . but when you know much about mani differ subject , but not as much as you would if you were specialis on each , it is also not easi for you to find a job , becaus mayb you are not qualifi enough in the area that is requir from the compani . so you are not specifi sufficiantli , albeit you know veri much . in contrast there are also mani compani that ask for such a gener knowledg in mani area , so your chanc for get a job also depend on the kind of job which are offer . so there is the contrast between superfici knowledg in mani subject or entir knowledg of one specif subject . i am the opinion of that both thing do not benefit get a job . i think it is necessari to have broad knowledg in mayb two or three subject which match togeth veri well ( e.g. mathemat , physic and biolog ) . but furthermor it is also import to have a certain base knowledg in some more subject , but not as specialis as in the other . as result you will end up with differ level of knowledg in nearli everi subject . with such a qualif i think it is go to be easier to emphas your gener knowledg and to get a job .
