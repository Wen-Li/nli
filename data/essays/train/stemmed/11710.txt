it is more import for student to understand idea and concept , becaus , they can appli thi concept and idea to resolv fact that may be present in the futur . also , thi way would prevent dissapoinmemt and frustrat in the student at the time that prepar them to resolv problem without experi , just knowledg . if a student understand idea and concept , he would be abl to resolv the fact succes ; thu , he ha the tool to resolv problem and circust without experi , just by use the knowlegd that he ha learn befor , in order to learn fact . if the student learn fact befor understand idea and concept , he would learn more painful and they proprabl would learn more by mistak . i realli think is better learn by advic that by expiri . to know the idea and concept first would prevent the student to make a lot of mistak that can cost him pain and dissapoin feel , becaus he would propabl choos the correct and convini solut for the fact that present take hi knowledg . even though , thi is not a warranti that the student would choos the correct solut . he may choos the wrong one , but there is more propabl that he choos the correct solut . i realli beliv is more import for student to undertand idea and concept , that learn fact . i would be more useful , painless , motiv and reward to think in a solut take the concept thar he ha , that learn fact without experi and knowledg about it .
