i agre with the statement . for a student , it seem more import to me to understand idea and concept seem than to learn fact . nevertheless , i do not underestim the valu of the latter , although overal i think understand idea and concept is for two reason a more appropri way to respons to life 's challeng than studi mere figur . first , we are face an increasingli complex world today , and understand concept might prove to be better help in react to thi complex . inform and technolog are chang rapidli , as our knowledg about the world advanc . knowledg is veri flexibl nowaday . for exampl , fact about medic problem or genet diseas can chang within month . the same appli to the growth of new achiev in heal patient who suffer from , to give anoth exampl , cancer . thi impli , that the abil to understand idea and concept gain more import today than in the past , sinc it doe not `` expir '' , as fact and figur , which we onc learn , do . but not onli the factor of expir of some fact make them less use for student to tackl problem with . it is also import to provid student with tool which can help them work in differ situat . concept and idea might be applic to more than one situat , and in thi respect they are differ from fact which appli to singl situat and problem . understand these idea seem to be use to learn how to solv problem in gener . on the other hand , learn fact and figur of cours is import to have some basic knowledg about the world . compar problem , that onc aros , with current one might help us understand the matter in a more comprehens way than otherwis , and in some case it might even help us to develop innov solut . to conclud , it is both import for student to understand idea and concept and to to learn fact . nevertheless , i think that student should concentr on understand idea and concept , which are applic in differ time and situat , wherea fact and figur might expir and onli appli to a certain context .
