i agre it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . just like math , idea and concept are process and answer is fact . i think most of the teacher would like student to understand solv problem 's process not understand what the answer is . if you have right process for the problem but get wrong answer that teacher suppos give you point , if you get right answer but your process not correct that will let your teacher doubt you `` how did you get thi answer ? '' understand process that would easier to know how to solv the problem but know the answer ca n't sure you know how to solv problem . it is import for student to understand idea and concept . fact are dead , idea and concept are live . fact alway have one but you may have the other think in the mind for your idea or concept and if you studi deepli , it may overthrow origin fact . that whi understand idea and concept is more import for learn fact . sometim learn idea and concept can make you easier to understand , we can find someth trick among them . what is your think , your concept or your idea , like math have mani of way to solv problem not just one .
