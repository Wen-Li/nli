i fulli agre with the follow statement : ' young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help theor communit . ' it is hard to fing a youth who enjoy and is will to help other peopl . i , as a teenag , admit that help other is not my prioriti . one of the main reason whi i believ young peopl do not spend much time help other is the lack of free time . as an student of the intern baccalaurit ( ib ) program i spend a great amount of time studi and prepar for the exam in may . accord to the school , we should do atleast 3 hour of homework everi night . i come back from school at four thirti , then go to the gym for around one hour and then do my homework . by the time i finish it , it is alreadi 8 or 9 o'clock . thi doe n't leav me much time to do activ to help my commun . furthermor , the littl time i have free i want to spend it on thing i enjoy do the most such as meet my friend . anoth reason whi i think youth do not give much time to help their commun is becaus of the increas competit in the world . out parent want the best for us i.e they want us to be success . thi desir of want to be better than our peer ha made us more selfish and therefor reduc our willing of help other . for exampl , for a profession sportsman to becom the best one in world , he need to practic a lot . these train setion take time ; therefor he will have less time to help the commun . in addit , psycholog , he will onli be focus on him get better and dismiss other thing such us help the other . competit also lead to anoth reason for my opinion ; the lack of even get involv in program for help the commun . becaus some of us are sometim brought up in way that everyth involv around competit we do n't even tri to help other ; we do n't know what it is about . the ib requir the student to complet 150 hour of what is known as ca ( creativ , action and servic . ) thi part of the programm encourag me to get involv in acit such as collect cloth and food for refuge , help teacher plan activ and organis famili day . i have to admit that i realli enjoy them and the feel of satisfact after help other is amaz . so , becaus of the lack of experi , i assum that help other would be bor and not worth ; howev , i realiz it wa the opposit . in conclus , i believ that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus they do n't want to or sometim is n't even their fault . program such as the ib ha notic thi weak in the current teenag and is tri to recov their interest in help other . i think that parent and teacher should also emphazis the import of these and the benefit we get for do it .
