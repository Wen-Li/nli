i agre with thi opinion that succ peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they arleadi know to do well . the reason i agre with thi opinion is that succcss ha someth to do with peopl 's mind . if someon tri to someth that they want to it , they can make success someday . anoth reason is that tri to make success by develop own person . for exampl , i usual rode a bike to go to school , onc time i trid to drive my father 's car , when i first took a car , it is realli difficult for me to handl a car , but the more i drive , the easier and more intrest . howev , somepeopl make their own success by do onli one way becaus they ususlli do it oneth that they alreadi know how to do well . in conclus , peopl who tri to do new thing is good .
