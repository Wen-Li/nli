my person thought is that it depend on the situat of the student to understand the idea of a topic or just learn some fact about it . i have some good exampl for both of the thought which explain whi i think that thi statement depend on situat . i have sever reason to thin that a student need to understand a topic complet . my first reason to think like thi becaus of the kind of the topic . there are differ kind of topic . some are not import for ani part in our life ; some are the base of the complex topic and some are signific topic which will come up in your life . the student need to understand the topic that are base of some complex and signific topic in order to understand the upcom main topic . the reason is clear in my opinion . if you understand the base of a topic clearli ; you will not have ani troubl in understand the complex and import thing about that topic and will not have hard time about some simpl thing in hard and complex topic . a student need to understand the signific and hard topic too in the sens of be succes as both a student and a bussinesman . when you are a student ; you need to understand the topic inord to do well in the exam about the hard topic . so the student will not have ani problem when he is work professionali in a compani when a task about that topic come up . on the other hand ; i would suggest the student to learn the fact onli if the topic do not have ani import at all . by thi way , the student will succeed the exam becaus he know the basic fact of the topic , but will not lose some import time by understand the topic . in conclus ; i can say that my opinion is in the way that a student should understand the topic except than the one that do not have ani import in life and onli for the period of classtim in the school .
