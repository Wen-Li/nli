what is the most import thing we have to learn at school or at univers ? that is the question . .. is the most import thing to have a good understand of the main concept or idea ? or is it to learn a lot of inform , without have a good comprehens of the main concept ? accord to me , the main charact for a good student at the end of the school is a good comprehens and an habil for reproduc the concept . in your argument , we will present some element in order to give our own opinion . first , i think it 's veri import for a student to be abbl to reproduc the main way of a reflexion . for exampl , concern a mathemat exercis , a student wil be judg about hi habil to do again the problem with differ inform . so that 's more import , it is'nt the basic inform but the way of reflexion . it 's gener the same for evey scientif topic . to my mind , it 's better to understand the gener idea until of the gener fact . secondli , i believ for gener fact as the histori fact , student have all time to learn it in the free time . for exampl , i do n't think a littl boy , if he doe n't know the name of the actual presid , will be a bad student . on the contrari , thi boy can have the inform by other way : televis , news-pap , radio . .. and i do n't think the perfect student is the student who know everyth concern all the topic . so for me , a good student will gener curiou and in the most case , he will search the inform by hi own capabl . last but not least , it 's clear that understand concept is more import in the real life that learn a lot of fact . in fact , if a young student ha mani habil in learn hi histori lesson at the age of 8 year , but without understand concept , it will probabl be hard for him to continu high school . so it 's necessari to earli learn comprehens and understand . to sum up our reflexion , it appear that understand the main idea and concept is veri import for a student who want to integr an high school . the fact are also import , but we have all the time to get it , wherea it is not the case for the gener comprehens .
