i agre with the opinion that have the knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to have deeper knowledg in one major subject . it is more import for the undergradu student to have the basic knowledg in the field like biolog , histori , chemistri , archeolog etc . the student should be abl to know the basic of the variou subject befor take the major subject . for exampl , if the student dont have the basic knowledg in the biolog subject then he may not know the variou organ of hi bodi and their function . then the student may not know the kind of food he must take for the proper function of the particular organ . he need to face so mani problem if he doesnt know about the function of hi own bodi . one more exampl is that , student can be abl to know about the origin of the hi cultur and tradit if he ha a basic knowledg of the subject ` histori ' . he can know about the differ place in the world and he know better about the world map . the student should also be perfect in the gener knowledg . he should know what is happen around him and also should know the chang in the polit affair . then onli he could judg the thing in a better way . he must know the current affair . the univers is the major sourc from which the student gain the basic knowledg in the differ field . they should provid a good environ for the student so that they can have the overal develop . for the student the overal develop is veri much import to compet with outsid world in the futur . befor choos their major field the student must have a basic knowledg in the other subject also then onli they can compet with the outsid world .
