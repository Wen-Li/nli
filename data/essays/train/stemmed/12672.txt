although peol may think that there will be more car in the world as the year go by , i hold a differ view . i strongli believ in 20 year , there will be fewer car in use due increasingli high-maint cost and better altern . first of all , i hold thi opinion becaus i believ that the increasingli high - maintanc cost of car will discourag peopl to drive car . dure the past few year the oil price have increas more than two-fold , which is make it difficult and unreason to keep up with automobil maintanc expens . although , have the luxuri of drive and own your car may seem more glamor , it just ist'n practic nor reason anymor . as such more and more peopl are be discourag to use car . in addit , i believ that there will be fewer car 20 year from now due to the fact that peopl now have better altern for transport . 30 year ago , use a car wa essenti , as a mean of transportaion . if you need to go on a busi trip or visit famili , there wa not much altern method . howev , nowaday , a car is n't the onli method of go somewher , there are variou altern . in place like new york or hong kong , you realli do n't need a car to move around , you can use the subway or buse as your main mean of transportaiton . these day , in the major citi of the world , i believ rather than own and drive your own car , it is more wiser to use public transportaion . in summat , due to surg oil price and reason altern , i would have to diagre with the statement . though drive your car , whether it is on a date or to work may have mani benefit , i do not believ those benifit will out weigh the ration of choos a differ mean of transport .
