i could not say that everi young person dedic themselv to help their commun , but i do think that a larg number of them are do a larg amount of voluntari work to help make a better commun . i have wit mani particip in social servic by young peopl around me . when i wa in high school in hong kong , the citi where i live , almost everybodi at school join at least one volutari activ , be it elderli home visit or fund-rais carniv . some put a lot of effort into organ these voluntari work , while other support by gener donat or activ particip . we all enjoy be involv in these activ , know that we are contribut to our commun . i have person contribut and experienc commun work , too . as member of the hong kong red cross youth unit , my team mate and i have initi a few servic project which serv the object of chariti organ . we design a 3-day programm , which includ a fun day for elderli and children , to convey messag such as social harmoni and cross-gener commun . all of us have dedic ourselv into the prepar and launch of the project . it wa time-consum but we all believ that it wa worth make a more joy commun . help the commun is not onli demonstr by actual particip in voluntari work . i think that the young peopl who are realli make contribut are those who manag their time well between voluntari work and academ studi . we should alway look at thing in the long term . instead of complain that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , mayb we should appreci how they are tri to get the most of their studi and contribut to the societi later on . that mean that they are not wast the resourc that the societi is give them in their educ . they also prove that the ` invest ' in their educ will gener return when contribut what they learn back to the societi . are n't they help their commun , too ? mani young peopl are actual awar of their posit in their commun and are give a lot of time to help . we should appreci what they have done and encourag those who are do less to contribut more . ultim they will be the one who benefit from a better commun they themselv live in .
