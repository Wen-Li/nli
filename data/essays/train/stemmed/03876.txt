in my countri there is a famou sentens that say , if you know the realiti today it will be easi to know the histori , for thi reason i thik is import to understand idea and concept , but to learn fact also is useful . first , if the student learn idea , they are capabl of practic their knowledg to some exampl or fact in the real life , i rememb that when i wa stude histori i undestood the concept of revolut but onli when my teacher gave me some exampl i could understand the real mean , and after it is easi for me to developesom idea about the industri revolut , or social revolut . i wa learn also differ thecniqu in math for fact . in addit , there are some effici method to teach , for exampl if the teacher give in clase un concept , after the student should make as a homework un exampl associ with thi concept , and i am sure the student are not go to forget thi word . as a student the most import thing is do not learn subject with my memori becaus these kind of learnig is easi to forget . second , when the student to learn fact they can associ some caus or consequ and make conclus , but to conclud it is not possibl onli if the student have onli idea and concept . educ ha made import advanc in thi area and in the actual word , intellig person is who can appli the knowledg or the theori in the real life . it will be useful learn concept and fact at the same time and inmediatli to practic abov real exampl in a compani or a school in conclus ti undestand idea and concept and too learn fact both are essenti . howev i think it is necessari for student to have idea and concept clear becaus these are the base to develop some interest new project or knowledg , thu if have have to choos over these point as most import i would choos to understand the idea as first step .
