one of the most difficicult choic that a man ha to front everi day of hi life is about when take risk is use and when it is n't . i think that take danger is import to reach an obiect but it must be done with intellig , becaus act without the control of the situat could be veri danger . for exampl i would n't go on the top of a mountain if i were alon and if i had n't the mean to complet my adventur . i think that sadli a lot of peopl front the risk in a way like thi , for exampl choos to invest their money in financi action , whithout have ani inform about them , or becaus advic by bank of other institut , which give to client inform that he doe n't understand at all . obvious , on the other hand , there are peopl that remain fix on their way of live and front situat and thi is not good at all . in fact , whithout take ani sort of danger , how can they think to have the possibl to extend their knowledg to aspect that are not properli the one they are use to ? in a work contest thi way of think ca n't lead them to discov anyth , while peopl who take some more risk could find better way to complet a process or they could achiv new tool for their activ . i think that the first way to live is more difficult but can provid much more satisf than the other one , obvious if risk are taken alway give them the right weight . in fact thi can help you to discov and accept more like other opportun , also completli differ from the one you are use to . i think that peopl who behav like thi are more like to be open and so they probabl gain more inform then the other kind of peopl enrich their knowledg more rapidli .
