in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus there will be more and more other public transport , such as airplan , train , buse , ship and so on . i think that if there were more and more public transport peopl could not use car . public transport are alway late so peopl prefer to take a car to go to work . everi day peopl buy a new car instead of take a public transport becaus the car can follow your time , you do not have to wast too much time to wait for . but i think that in thi period public transport are more and more necessari becaus car are too much . so it is difficult to find a car park and moreov car pollut the air . in my opinion in the futur everi state will work to find solut to elimin mani car . gouver will tri to do someth to not pollut the air . the pollut is the great problem at thi time . so we have to work hard to reduc it . for thi reason is necessari that we spend more money in public transport . public transport are the futur becaus i think that if we go on in thi way , so we continu to buy car and car , in twenti year we will have ani place to move . so we have to find a solut for thi great problem . the right solut could be in public transpor . moreov in thi period there are a lot of car that peopl have to wait so long time on road . i think that is more use to take a public transport becaus it is cheaper than car and moreov you can spend less time on it . as the matter of fact in thi period there is a lot of traffic and you are not so sure to arriv on time to your destin . i do not realli know how the world in twenti year could be , but i know that if we do not do anyth to chang our posit we would have seriou problem . we need to chang our actual posit becaus problem will not find a solut by themselv . we have to stop the growth of car to be free to make easi our movement , and also to protect us to the air pollut .
