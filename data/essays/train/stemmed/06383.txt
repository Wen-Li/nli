i do not agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it is get more and more afford , even for younger peopl who have just gotten their driver 's licenc , to own a car . so there are much more , rather young peopl drive than in the past and i do not think that thi will chang . so thi is a constant in my consider . not onli that more young peopl possess car , also peopl that are older will still be drive when they are at the age of 75 or 80 , becaus peopl becom older but will stay mental and psycholog fit even in higher age and will not give up on drive sinc it will - in twenti year like nowaday - be import for human to be flexibl and be abl to move wherev and whenev you want to . regardless of high car-dens that can alreadi been found today , peopl will not give up on their car becaus they have gotten use to the conveni of drive . some sort of exploring-ment will forc human be to even drive further than today . with new car technolog that will probabl been found in twenti year that should not be a problem . anoth import fact in thi consider is the role of countri like china and india . they are about to step up as progress state in which industri take place . of cours there will be high demand of car in the upcom year . with it billion of peopl these two countri will have a tremend impact on the usag of car in the futur . more and more peopl there will be abl to financ a car and - with the cours of industri - will buy one . under these circumst it will be import to find new solut for avoid high-traff in urban area and pollut of the environ .
