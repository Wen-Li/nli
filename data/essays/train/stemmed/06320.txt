in my opinion it is more import for student to understand concept than to studi or learn the fact pertain to the subject . i have experienc a lot of problem in thi matter in my childhood day where i usual concentr more on the fact than idea and concept . one such experi occur in my tenth class where i usual learn fact of my subject such as physic , social , mathemat befor exam . by the time , it is readi to write the exam i usual forget most of answer or fact which i learn earlier and get less mark in exam . my friend of mine on the contrari , usual concentr on idea and concept in physic , social subject and he is abl to reproduc success what he learn in exam without ani troubl . anoth experi i face , when i am write entranc exam for engin cours , where i concentr more on formula and principl relat to mathemat and doe not concentr on idea and concept . due to tension in the exam i am unabl to recal the formula what i learn and end up with low score on the exam . howev for undergradu student it is not necessari to understand idea and concept pertain to their subject becaus actual undergradu cours is of four year so it is hard to remeb idea and concept for variou subject . instead they must rememb onli fact except their favourit subject , where they are go to do research in graduat cour . in conclus one thing can be drawn that student must studi idea and concept upto intermedi educ and not necessari to rememb concept in their undergradu cours .
