actual , i do n't think that the statement `` youg peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their communti '' , is complet truth . person , dure the week i am alway busi becaus of the univers and the work , and dure the weekend i usual enjoy with my friend and unfortunatli , thi kind of life is similar to all my friend life and the main part of young peopl life . but i have acquit with some boy , who realli feel the need to help other peopl an the commun . for exampl , one of them , who is just 23 year old , decid to give all hi free time work in a hospit as volunt . now they are 3 year that he enjoy work there . he spend all the week , everi saturday night work for the commun . anoth boy i knew last year , left as voluntear an now he ha been work for 6 month in the south america . in the villag where i live , lot of peopl give part of their money in chariti : rotari associ is veri popular , and there is one minor club that it is onli for young peopl . but also lot of other associ are support by everyon . i think that thi kind of action mean that we can support an improv not onli give our time but also give a financi support , and that we are not indiffer about the topic . probabl , the major of peopl are not use to think veri often about help their commun , and fact refelect thi ; but in thi last year the govern ha put lot of advertis on the radio and on televis , and my view is that now peopl are get more confid with the problem that we have in our own commun . i think that we are pay more attent at thi topic in thi year than in the past . so probabl young peopl in gener have n't lot of time to help their comun , but they are interest in do thi , and someon of them choos help peopl as the main activ of their life .
