in student 's life learn is veri import ; the tipic day of a student consist mainli of learn . although almost all student learn a lot and consid learn an essenti factor , it is import to analyz how they learn . that is , one should consid the object and the focu of a student who is learn . quit often student learn new topic but forget them after a while . the reason for thi might be the way how they were learn . in my opinion , it is much more import for student to understand idea and concept that is it for them to learn fact . in the follow i will give rever reason to support my statement . firstli , learn doe not mean learn by hard , that is `` memor fact '' , but understand of idea . if a person learn by hard , he will tend to forget the notion learn as soon as he doe not need or treat them anymor . secondli , learn should not just be final to get high score in a short time , but should enabl student to appli the concept they have learn and extend them also to other situat . tirdli , learn constitut the basi of research . in order to be abl to make research in a given area , it is essenti to understand all what is connect to it . if i consid my experi , i think that understand idea is realli essenti for your profess later on and i would suggest to support student . for instanc , common discuss help student to verifi if they understood a concept correctli or not . in some other case , it could be help to appli a concept in a studi , in a use case or in the laboratori . in summari , i am convinc that learn fact is not suffici for student . it will not enabl them to proceed on their own in an area . on the contrari , i consid understand of idea and of concept as bee essenti in the learn process .
