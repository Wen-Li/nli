in the world there is a great market of exang in which peopl have to do mani choic buy a product . so it is difficult for a singl compani to get a consider part of thi market to take advantag from it . so i think that a common method use by a compani to reach a wider part of the market is that to use advertisi . an exampl support thi statement is that a compani present a product in a way thank to which you see it better . you know onli the good qualiti and not what is wrong with the product . thi is the purpos of advertisi , to enchant yourself in a lot of differ way such as use famou actor like peopl who use that product . on the other hand , a compani should use an expert to present it product say him to enphas the new concept of the product . i know from experi that advertisi make product seem much better than they realli are . for exampl , one time i order a product by internet becaus i wa veri fascin by the way in which it wa describ . but when i had had that product at home i wa veri unhappi becaus the product did not function as it wa describ . thi wa a veri bad surpris for me . anoth common method use by advertisi is that of full the page of a newspap or the screen of the televis with a lot of colour . in thi way , peopl ' s attent is focuz not on the product but on other thing . it is a veri successi practic . sum up , i think that advertisimet chang the real characterist of a product in order to convinc mani other peopl to buy that object or that solut . for me , thi is a veri bad way to sell and to trade a product . use these method , compani make onli trick on peopl and befor or after they will be discov . on the other hand , the best advertisi for a product is it good qualiti .
