advertis are increasingli present in our everyday life , in sever support and in sever way . to wonder if advertis make product seem better than they realli are could be seen as a non-sens question , becaus precis the aim of an ad is to make a product unreplac . that is whi i agre with thi statement . advertis are made to give peopl the will to buy the product . it 's also the onli way to get peopl awar of a new product , and obvious the better is thi product , the more peopl will buy , even if it 's just to tri . so my first point is that advertis should and must make product better than they realli are , becaus they 're made for that . my second point is that advertis can do more than just show a product at it 's best . i mean that advertis is also a way to build an imag , a spirit for a product and for the peopl who buy thi product . for exampl , in advertis for car , advertis manag to show onli what they want to insist on , in order to attract a specif rang of custom . they can insist on secur , fun , sportiv , but it 's alway to make peopl feel attach to a way of think and behav . so advertis are a way for produc to sell their product by give more to the consum than onli the product . obvious all peopl are not sensit to the same purpos of advertis , and that 's a way to highlight the weak of advertis . an ad ca n't be like by everybodi , and sometim ca n't be understood by anybodi . so ad can also be unproduct and uneffici . the point is that i believ that advertis can be both veri profit and danger for a produc . that 's whi i final confirm that i realli think that advertis is veri power , and veri import for the life of a product , but it ha to be well prepar , well broadcast to be veri effect .
