as peopl climb the ladder of success their idea tend to chang from dynam and innov to static and conserv . i believ that succes poepl focu and do what they alreadi know how to do rather than explor or tri out new thing and take risk . reach a level of success whether in bussi or in life requir time and hard work , and upon reach success risk would be to huge of a price . for exampl , a bussi man would prefer to `` keep-it-saf '' and insur hi posit rather than jeopard hi whole career over a simpl mistak . the same goe for tri out new thing , becaus success poepl are who they are due to the pricipl and polic that they have follow ; and for them to abandon such polic which lead them to success would be highli unlik . thu the latter would prefer to follow a path of conform instead of radic chang . anoth import factor that render success poepl to aproach new thing would be their mental ( as in how the think ) in which they tend to reli on their past experi as a measur for thier action , while on the other hand fresh mind tend to grap new idea faster and better thu strive to tri out new thing and build new experi . a typic exampl for a dynam mind would be a fresh univers graduat which is eager to learn and follow the path of success . the ladder of success chang peopl in mani way , as they take the first step peopl are will to take risk and tri out new thing ; but as their journey progress they develop a new mental which is built on past innov , dynam , and fruitful experi thu pave the way for a more conserv and limit mental .
