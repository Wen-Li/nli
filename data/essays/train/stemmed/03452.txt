i strongli agre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group with a person that can guid you in the place where you are go . i believ that thi is import in order to know a place becaus i usual like to visit place with a good histor background . if i want to take advantag of the time while i am travel , and thi time is limit , i do not want to wast it , just tri to recogn what place are import in that citi or locat . for instanc , if i go to itali , i would love to go to all the museum , and famou restaur . i also would enjoy the opportun to go to the beach in the mediterranean sea . normal , a tourist would need more than a month just to plan these activ . howev , if you go with a tour guid , thi person will make your life a lot of easier , becaus he or she alreadi know where to go , at what time , what are the import part where a tourist should focu hi attent . last year , my famili went to dominican republ . we bought a all inclus plan , but we did not have a guid . we were total lost there , we did not know where to go . all the time peopl were take advantag of us charg an incred high amount of money for differ servic like taxi transport , onli becaus we do not have anybodi that could give us advic or inform about the usual fare for that kind of servic . we had to pay $ 20 for buy a sunprotector . the most expens sunprotector in my whole life . also , share your vacat with a group of friend is realli wonder . i would say that it could n't get better if you are travel with the peopl you like and with somebodi that alreadi have a plan for you .
