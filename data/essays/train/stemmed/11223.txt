do you agre or disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ? it is a great question to be offer becaus nowaday young gener ignor how to help and contribut their communit more than the past . i total agre that instead of give enough time to help the societi , they concentr themselv more . first of all , becaus of the educ from the famili and the societi , they teach the young gener that they should think themselv first then the other thing , even the thing are about the countri and the world . the educ tell them that no matter what happend , they should develop themselv first . accord to thi kind of theori , nowaday the young gener becom more selfish then the past one . due to thi situat , i think that while we discuss that if the young peopl should pay more attent in their commun , the educ of famili and societi should be discuss at the same time . secondli , nowaday no matter which countri you belong , it is kind of tendenc that there are fewer children in a famili , for instanc , mainland china , onli one child in a famili is normal . depend on thi situat , the child doe not know how to get along with the other peopl , how to care the peer and how to contribut himself for the societi . sure , he will not focu on the need of the commun and the world . the first task he think is how to develop himself well . besid , nowaday parent alway give too much pressur on young peopl 's grade , and i think that 's also the reason whi the young gener ignor the commun and societi . to the summar , it is kind of wors tendenc that young gener doe not pay attent to their commun . in my opinion , if we hope to develop more wonder societi and world which we belong , the first task we have to do is teach the young gener doe not be selfish ani more , on the contrari , they should focu on the societi and world more .
