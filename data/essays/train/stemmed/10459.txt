as far as i am concern , i think that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun . mayb my answer seem to appear like selfish even if it is not my aim . at first sight , i think that nowaday young peopl ha got a great deal of work to do and therefor less freetim . for instanc , young peopl must go to univers to studi but on top of that most of them are forc to work besid their studi to earn some money in order to pay their school . as a result , it is hard for these young peopl to find the time to help their commun . actual when you finish your school at the end of the day you want to escap from realiti and therefor relax and eas the tension of the day 's hard work . you do not want in your leisur time to go and help your commun . i am convic that when you are young you have to take advantag of life . consequ , you have to enjoy yourself and have fun becaus you know that one day when you will becom a grown up you will have to support responsabil and oblig in your town or citi . moreov , sometim in certain situat young peopl wo n't have enough experi to deal with the problem wherea older person will make the right decis . nevertheless , it is undoubt that help commun might be a reward experi for young peopl becaus they will improv their knowledg thank to the older advic . in fact , it should be an opportun for young peopl to evolv in a good way . even if these young peopl think that help their commun is a misfortun it can also appear as an asset becaus thay can learn a great deal of thing that will help them in the futur . but the main problem as alway is time .
