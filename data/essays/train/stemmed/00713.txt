now-a-day the life for everyon ha becom hectic , let it be a boy go to the colleg or middl age man who ha famili responsibilit . especi for young peopl who have their entir life in front of them & it time now for them to decid in what direct they will steer their attent to get to the destin which will take life to the aim that they have to achiev . for a start they have to attend colleg . some time have to pay for it themselv . so for that work part-tim . but now-a-day i can see student dont mind work for their own educ . they have becom more activ in the societi . they have start realis the import of human valu like honesti , human & trust . henc , i disagre with statement that is made here that young peopl donnot give enough time or help their commun . i can give you an exampl which i experienc myself . few month back , in my citi there wa an excess rainfal in a season when it wa complet unexpect . henc , the govern resourc were not avail on time . at that time , peopl stay near the place , where lot of water wa creat a blockag of traffic , came onto the street to help the peopl for cross the road which were under water . i even heard news that these peopl provid shelter & food to those who couldnt get to their home due to lack of trasport . all these peopl help out other were young . it wa quit evid becaus old one couldnt help do so mani thing by walk in rain . there might be some youngster who are involv in drug activ or crime or some even `` do noth sit at home '' type . but you can not judg the entir young gener onli by look at them . i think that today 's young gener is veri much awak about it respons & are do their duti well , without fail . give them opportun to do it is now the respons of our commun .
