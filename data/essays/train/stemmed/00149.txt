how mani time have you got deceiv by commerci ? how mani time have you regret buy thing you saw on commerci becaus they were not as good as they seem ? i am sure that thi happen to mani of you . i think that commer alway inflat what product realli are . there are mani product which are not good and have lot of commerci . on the other hand , there are mani product that do n't do much advertis which are much better than product which advertis all the time . so a product have mani advertis doe n't necessarili mean that the product is good . i can speak about thi out of experi . i onc saw an advertis on the televis about a soultion that remov all type of stain . i wa so thrill by the advertis that i bought one for me and one for my sister . one day my friend came to my hous and she spill blueberri juic on her white shirt . i proudli got the soultion and rub it on the stain as instruct . shockingli , i figur out later that the more i rub the more the stain spread . i wa veri embaresses from my friend who had to throw her shirt after that day . in addit , a lot of the thing mention in advertis are incorrect . i onc saw a toothpast commerci that state that thi toothpast give 12-hour protect to the teeth from decay and plaqu . as a dentist , i knew that thi did n't make ani sens . there is no such thing as `` 12-hour protect '' . it is well-known that plaqu start grow on teeth right after you brush them . unfortun , fals advertis lead to a wast of money and loss of trust between custom and seller . therefor , i think that there should be a commite to supervis what is be mention in advertis .
