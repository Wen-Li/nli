some peopl have a great amount of knowledg , they know mani subject and are abl to work in differ context . if those knowledg were all deepen it would be ideal becaus peopl would be total flexibl and they would have a great deal of cultur . on the contrari , other prefer to special in a specif subject and know it perfectli well . personn , i think it is veri interest to know mani thing , to be abl to talk about mani subject but i am not sur that it is veri effici on the ground . i mean that it may be attract to studi sever subject when one is at school but in the end of one 's cursu it is necessari to special in one particular subject to know more about it . for exempl , undergradu student in busi school studi financ , manag , market . .. and final they choos a specialis befor get a job . that is necessari to be realli effici sinc the begin . on the contrari , someon who will have just studi mani subject without be special will have knowledg but not deep knowledg on one particular item . howev , i reckon that it is necessari to have studi mani subject befor specialis not onli becaus of flexibl at work but also for one 's own cultur . inde , it can be interest to understand how the other worker do , what is the background of what peopl see everi day . for instanc could be interest for a mathemat teacher to know geographi too or to have basi in economi . .. have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can be veri use but i think that specialis is also necessari to be realli effici at work .
