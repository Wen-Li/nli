in everi countri we go , there is a larg number of car , but thi figur will decreas in the futur . i think that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . nowaday there are so mani car in the world that we will be forc to abandon them in the futur . there are certain factor that i want to point out that will favour thi decreas . first of all , i think that it will be impos for everyon to have a car . the car price but special the petrol price will go up steadili in the futur : the fuel is go up and up everyday , but it will get wors as they becom scarc . petrol price are expens now but they will be imposs to pay for a larg number of peopl . the pollut will be anoth factor that will decreas the number the car in our street . we all have to be awar of the danger of the pollut that car produc . the car smoke is one of the key factor of pollut in mani countri . in is import to bear in mind that we are damag the planet and soon thi damamg will becom irrevers . also , in a more practic approach , traffic will act a deterr for mani car buyer in larg citi . in the futur , it will be imposs to drive in the citi and more and more peopl will use the public transport . although there are mani citizen use the public transport , it seem that figur will increas everi year . regard the public transport , citizen should put more pressur on govern so they creat an effect public transport network . in my opinion , if thi object is accomplish , peopl would reli in the public transport and would abandon the need of the car . in conclus , i think that in twenti year there will be less car in our street than there are today . i think that we will need to consid these point in order to use or not use our car .
