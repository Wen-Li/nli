in gener i agre with thi statement , although i think it doe n't make sens to suggest an exclus choic . of cours a student ha to do both , understand idea as well as learn fact . i think it ha got to do a lot with differ between cultur . my educ wa definitli focus on understand concept . but i know for exampl from korea that student have to learn much more by heart . i will tri to explan what i mean on an exampl from the field of music . in india it is common for tabla-play to learn mani composit by heart . although there exist a system for music notat it ha no relev . everyth is learn by heart from mere listenen . on the other hand you have the european tradit of staff notat and music score . it is not necessari to learn everyth by heart becaus it can be look up at everi time . thi fact is connect with a differ attitud toward tradit . while in india it is more common to emphas the continu of a certain school or famili tradit ( call gharana ) in europ more attent is pai on what is new or what seem to be new . of cours both music tradit develop and chang in the cours of time , but their way to new way of express is a differ one . in india a tabla player ( who is a compser as well as a musician ) first learn mani fact ( composit ) , and then , after a long time of practis and tri to adapt the tradit he might introduc new featur and invent hi own composit . in europ mani compos ( who are not necesserili perform musician ) start to compos at a veri young age . befor they had the chanc to learn the histori of music they alreadi begin to understand some idea and concept and with the help of these develop composit as object . to summar i would like to say that it depend on the cultur environ what import ha to be given to the understand of idea or to the learn of fact .
