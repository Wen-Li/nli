i disagre with the states that there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the follow reason . first of all , huge number of peopl will buy their own car in twenti centuri . for exampl , thirti year ago , each famili in japan can buy onli one car . becaus it wa too expens and peopl in japan wa not rich to buy mani car . when my parent were child , there wa a onli car for one famili . theseday , peopl in japan buy own car , so one famili purchas two or tree car . i think same thing will be happen in idia or china in twenti year . more and more economi grow , more and more car will be purchas peopl . thi exampl clearli show that huge number of peopl will buy their own car . second , technolog develop will give us more opportun to ride a car . some peopl would say that we should not ride car becaus it ha neg impact for our environ . some siti offic in japan do not allow citizen to ride the car insid the central citi . howev , some car maker which ha high technolog alreadi develop electr car . the car develop by the compani doe not pollut the air . if erectr car is sold at same place with the car which we ride , mani peopl would buy erectr car . and gover would encourag to buy erectr car and ride those car . thi exampl demonstr that technolog develpo will give us more opportun to ride a car . threfor , i strongli disagre with the opinion that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
