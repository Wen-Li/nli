nowaday , there are numor debat on whether or not understand idea and concept is more import than learn the fact . from my point of view , i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the follow reason will support my opinion from three perspect . first of all , idea and concept are the foundat of the fact . in addit , in the most textbook , everi chapter begin with the term and definit of the idea and concept . at the begin of everi chapter the professor will ask student to understand everi term and idea which is includ in thi chapter . becaus everi subject have some speical term the student did not hear befor . if they do not understand these idea and concept , they will have a lot of difficulti to learn the fact about these idea . secondli , understand idea and concept will help student to learn fact more effiect and effici . when the student understand and memor all the idea and concept which they are go to learn about , they are get readi to accept the new fact relat to these idea . forthermor , they will familiar to these fact by the mean of they understand idea and concept . all of these will help student to learn the fact quickli and correctli . thirdli , student learn fact indic to memor the concept correctli and accur . in the school , the first object of student are learn the academ knowleg which refer to the idea and concept . later , they will use these knowleg in the work place and connect the idea with the fact . therefor , in the school student should concentr on the idea and concept , meanwhil , they can use the fact to help them memor the idea and concept accur . to conclud , understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . firstli , the fact is base on the idea and concept . secondli , understand idea and concept is a good way for student to learn the fact . lastli , lear idea and concept will more benefici for student achiev their academica goal . therefor , student should make a great effort to understand the idea and concept , then to learn fact .
