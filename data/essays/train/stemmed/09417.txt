i definit agre to the statement , and i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for three reason . to travel where i never visit befor , it is hard to choos where to see around . when i visit itali , i had hard time schedul where to go . there are mani church , cultur architecutr , and famou concert hall to visit . i could not choos where to go first or where i defenit should go . howev , when i travel with a group and a tour guid , tour guid plan everyth and schedul in effici . i do not have to loos time to make decis , and also i never miss famou place to visit . sometim it is hard to find a restaur when i travel by myself . usual , the place to travel is where to travel first time . so i have no inform about price of food , what to wear , and it tast good or not . when i wa a student and travel to itali , i wa a a backpakk . sinc i wa young , i do not contain much money to eat expens food . i usual eat cheap pizza , pasta , and snack . but one time i choos a restaur which serv delisi food but veri expens . when i seat and look at the menu , i wa surpris about the price . in thi situat , if i go with a tour guid , he or she will suggest me about the averag price of the food thi restaur serv . furthermor , i have more chanc to take mani pictur if i travel in a group . sometim , i find hard time take pictur when i travel by myself . becaus , i need to take care of luggag . but if i travel in a group , i can ask other or a tour guid to take a pictur . also , i can ask a tour guid to watch my luggag while i take a pictur . as i mention so far , i agre the statement , and i will choos to travel in a group with a tour guid .
