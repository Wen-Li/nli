i partial share the idea of those are think that young peopl today do not give enought time to help their commun . first of all i would highlight that we shoud split the world in sever area as well as in differ categori of famili . in my opinion in some area of the world like china or countri underdevelop young peopl are help their commun due to the fact that they are part of a larg commun with the same problem and with the same histor link . in that case the commun can be defin everi think is around the peopl and doe not need a further of explan . at the contrari in countri more develop peopl are live in their littl ireland . it is veri hard to dentifi the commun . if commun mean famili i am assist to a reduct of the relationship between parent and children due to the fact that the young , in mani case are alon dure the day and they have not ani guid refer for their life . if commun mean religion i would like to say that most of the young peopl have differ interest than the religion today becaus they preefr to spend their spare time in a differ way . if the commun is the sport team in that case
