happi and enjoy is a percept and ha no relat with age . i donot agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . when a man is young , he ha to make a career and ha a lot of respons on hi shoulder . though he is more physic activ , but he may not have the resourc to enjoy the way he want . hi social and person oblig would keep him occupi all the time . on the other hand a person who ha the time and resourc and ha got the matur to understand hi need , can live a happier life . he know what would give him pleasur and would not mere experi with thing . he know the valu of time and money and would util it more effeci . enjoy is not just go to night club or do adventur sport . a person can enjoy a stroll in th park or a sun tan on the beach . but for enjoy you need a relax mind . a mind free of tension and anxieti . i see more older men , who have achiev their goal enjoy life than their younger counterpart . i went for a cruis thi year end with my parent and girlfrend . there were peopl from all walk of life and differ gener on the ship . peopl were enjoy their heart out but to my surpris it wa the older peopl who were look happier . there wa a newli marri coupl who were on their honeymoon and had a room next to me . i could listen to their fight everi night . there wa anoth coupl who didnot have much time to talk as the guy wa alway busi on hi laptop and the cellphon . major of the young peopl did not look happi and satisfi . they had goal to be achiev . they didnot have time to sit back and enjoy their accomplish . they had worri which could not leav them even on a vacat . a person who can not maintain a balanc between hi person and profession life can not enjoy life . therefor , i feel an older person can enjoy life more than a young person doe .
