sinc the end of the nineteen centuri , the expans of car is increas all over the year . the need to move from a town to anoth or the pleasur of drive had produc a big market and econom system . could you imagin the evolut in a few year ? what could be the number of car in twenti year ? in fact , the real question is if the car will be fewer or not in the next year . firstli , we live in an econom system base a lot on the petroleum industri . the main energi of car , today , is the petrol . have fewer car in a few year would say we need to be more independ about thi energi and develop other sort of energi . the decreas of the number of car will be possibl onli with econom chang and also polici reglement . secondli , our road network is sometim satur . i ca n't imagin where we could put the other car into the traffic jam . we can impli to build other road . but thi ca n't be indefinitli . now we could in thi term have some car additionali but in a way , it ha to stop a day . end thirdli , peopl are more and more sensit to the environ . lot of them go to work in common transport or in bicycl . peopl had some car but do n't use it in the same way than few year ago . the cost of car are also a barrer , not onli the aquisit but also the train on it . peopl do n't want car or ca n't buy them . to conclud , i hope that in twenti year , we can breath without carbon and pollut , that 's whi i hope that polici and econom system will chang and encourag the develop of common transport like bu , tramway , metro and so on . i think also that peopl are readi to chang their car cultur . in fact it is now the decis of a pollut way or an oxygen way for our planet .
