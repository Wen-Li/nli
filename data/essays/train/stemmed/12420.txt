thi is a topic that sometim turn over in my mind and i think that is not so easi give a corret answer also becaus probabl doe n't exist a real corret answer . i think that for the student is import understand concept and idea but without learn fact they do n't have a complet knowledg . is sure that if the student know onli the fact they are like `` parrot '' so they could onli repeat in a mechan way the inform , but if they undertand the main idea and concept they could do an elabor and express also their opinion about the matter . so i think that understand the main idea is of paramount import and learn fact is import but not enough . in other word i think that undertand the gist is realli import also if you do n't know veri well the particular fact but is not possibl the revers , the fact without the main idea are unuseful . i must confess that i did n't use to studi a lot in the school , so i wa n't sometim abl to rememb veri well date and particular fact but with a good knowledg of the concept i could be safe . the problem is also that mani theacher think that the fact are so import and want that the student onli repeat like a machin the inform . i think also that for them is easier theach fact that tri to explain the main idea but fortunatelli not all the theacher are the same . i alway realli appreci the thaecher that do n't tri to give onli inform but want that the student undertand the concept and reformul the idea with their own opinion . final i can say that is incorret say that is most import understand that learn but is sure that without the first one we have an `` robot knowledg '' .
