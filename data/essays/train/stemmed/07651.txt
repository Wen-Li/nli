i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time for commun servic and i do not attribut some chang in the youngster charact that ha brought thi undesir contribut toward their societi . my parent give numer exampl regard their particip in the better of the commun and i alway feel that iam unabl to do as much as they did . not onli me , all the youngster of present age are unabl to alloc suffici amount of time for their commun . thi may be becaus of mani reason . firstli , becaus the present day life is like a race . the competit ha been increas day by day and onli the strongest and effici can surviv . in thi race the youngster are not find enough time to serv the societi . secondli , the modern day student ha a lot of thing to do ; he ha a lot to learn within the time . he ha to take care of not onli hi academ but also exta curricular activ . thi make clear that he ha less time for other thing . for exampl i had to attend the comput class and also music class which were compulsori for all in our school . moreov the concept what my parent learn in their time , iam learn them at an earli age . so the complex ha increas and requir more time to understand . we do commun servic in the short time we are have . we celebr all of our friend ' birthday in the final year of my undergradu school in an oldag home where we could help them to some extent . so i think it is logic to say that the present gener yougster are contribut less time to serv the societi than the earlier gener . it is not becaus we are not willng to do do but we are forc to some other thing .
