in my opinion it is more import for student to uderstand idea and concept rather than learn fact . although it is veri import to know fact , becaus they are necessari to understad mani of the event which are occur in our day-lif , it would be veri hard to deepli understand them just learn everyth by heart . in fact , it is import to understand concept becaus it 's veri easi to forget fact . for exampl , it would be quit imposs to studi litteratur or better histori just tri to rememb al the fact by heart . mayb it would be possibl to learn like that for an univers test but there are a lot of possibl to fail the test becaus it 's veri easi to forget some inform or to invert some fact . so , it would be better just to tri to undersand and to make some gener scheme about a topyc in order to have some clear and gener inform and in thi way it would be easier to rememb the fact becaus they would have a logic order . for istanc , onc i tri to remeb all the fact which occur dure the french revolut for an high-school test . i had littl time to studi so i thought that the better solut wa to learn as much as possibl all the fact by heart . i did not sleep at all to be prepar for the test , but anyway , i did not pass . the test day i wa so nervou and tire that i almost forgot all the fact occur dure the french revolut and i wa not abl to pass the test , that it wa actual veri import to me . it would have been more useful just tri to keep in mind all the main idea and mayb i would have pass the test , or at least , i would have slept dure the night time !
