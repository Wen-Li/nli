basic i agre with the statement but there are also mani case that demostr that i could possibl be wrong . i think it ^ s true that success peopl alway tri to do new thing , but i also think that a success man is a man who make hi thing well . mayb tri new thing could be a reason of a success but i don ^ t think that tri new differ thing caus directli a success . sure be abl to do variou thing or type of work it ^ s a great gift . in the past mani group of peopl ha had the need of adapt on the work they need to do to surviv . for exampl a man which escap from fallen down airplan and find himself in a desert island ha the need to adapt himself to do variou type of work ( like find food or build a home to repair himself from rain ) instead of surviv . if he reach hi object he is sure a success man . a man that onli doe specif kind of thing that he know well could be a success person in the same way as the one which alway tryi new thing . the posit thing about make onli what you alreadi know is that mayb you could make it better . probabl a man who tryi alway differ thing could not execut those thing veri well in the first time . a man that doe what he know well can sure offer a more qualiti and specifi product . for exampl a baker that make bread from twenti year can sure sell me better bread than a math teacher that doe the baker from onli one week . in conclus i think that success is not relat to the risk token or the abil to tri new thing , but it is relat to the abil on do thing well .
