i think that help one 's commun mean take part in the commun activ . therefor , if given the choic , i think that yonug peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are two reason . first , young peopl nowaday are veri busi . for exampl , i would like to think about junior high school student in japan . they go to junior high school , of cours . after school , almost all of them go to cram school . they have to prepar for the entranc examin of high school . they ca n't come back to their home until 10 p.m or so . they do n't have opportun to meet their neighbor day time and know what kind of peopl are in their commun . they do n't have sens enough to feel live in the commun . second , young peopl tend to enjoy their free time in thei home even if they have much time . these day , there are mani enjoy good which you are alon . one exampl of thi is the internet . with use the internet , you can commun with not onli your close friend but also peopl in the all over the world you have never seen . the internet make you decreas the opportun to meet someon face to face . take part in the activ held by commun and touch your neighbor make your commun more power and cheer . but young peopl do n't go their commun becaus of be busi and atract good in their home . as a result , i think young peopl do n't help their commun .
