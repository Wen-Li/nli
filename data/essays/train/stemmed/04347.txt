tri new thing and take risk are part of the life of everybodi . but in the last time even more success peopl are tri to super the limit . there are more reason , i will mention onli three becaus of the time . the first one regard the style of life of the success peopl . they have a good job and also money . they can permit themeselv whatev they want even that they do not need it . money is veri danger for peopl . they are sure they can do what they want and when they wnat and sometim it is the best way to lose the right road . as a second reason there is the fact that if you do everi day the same you will be bore with the time . and when peopl are bore they look for someth new and differ . sometim the result of thi research can be danger and take risk for their proper live . if a businessman goe free climb without enough experi onli becaus he is bore in hi offic he doe not take the right decis , becaus it is a danger sport . as third reason the last but not the least , it can happen that peopl will demonstr what they can also if they can not and are not abl ! it is frequent by success peopl , i think becaus they need to feel better than other . thi feel can bring them to do thing , what they do not know how to do , onli to be and to feel the first one or the best one . in conclus , i agre with the statement becaus it is base on my own experi . all the reason i mention are fact i have experienc with peopl around me . it is not a surpris effect of the societi we are live in , but educ and intellig peopl shall not do thing onli to demonstr someth to the other , what unfortun happen .
