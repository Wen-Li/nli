as far as i am concern , i am not agre with the statement at all that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are mani reason that i do not like the group led travel , and i will just explor the most import one here . the first reason i want to bring forward is that travel in a group led by a tour guid is so limit , not onli the space but also the time . usual , the trace of thi kind of travel ha been plane befor the travel begin . so you just take a limit glanc at some place you want to visit , which just decid by the tour guid . there are alway more place that will atract your eye beyond the tour guid 's thought . anoth aspcct is about the time . it seem unwis not the follow the tour guid as near as possibl , or you will fall behind . becaus the time of the travel depond on the tour guid instead of you . anoth reason , which is also commonli consid , is that the travel in agroup led by a tour guid is alway in the holiday . for some aspect , it is not bad . howev , travel in the holiday will caus mani problem . it is obvious that the tour place are rather crow dure the holiday . if you want to take the group led travel , you just can avoid the unpleas situat . what is more , as a result of the rush of the holiday travel , mani accid are easili to take place . in addit , travel in a group led by a tour guid is not a good idea for famili travel . in the modern societi , peopl pay more attent to the time spent with famili menber . if you choos to travel with your famili indeped , you will find it is much easier to enjoy the life along with the travel . for the reason abov , it is sure that i will travel without the tour guid . it is just realiz the mean of the travel ---- for fun and pleasur .
