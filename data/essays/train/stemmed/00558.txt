i agre with the statement , which said it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to sepcial in one specif subject . have a variti of knowledg is much better than studi one major . as a student i have made a plan to appli thi rule or what state . thi plan are base on what i think and my person openin . my theiori , is peopl and specailli student have to studi what major they like . as a student , i am tri to studi art and design but in the same way i would like studi econom and bussi . studi art , is the first step for my plan . after i take my master in art , i will head in studi bussi . these are not my main goal to a chiev . my main goal is built and run a compani which specail in cartoon so by studig these tow major , i 'll be abl to have some sens of art , in addit , i can run my own bussi . i think if everi person should studi what he like , he will be satisfi in two way . one way , he will be pleas that he is parctic what he like and he will not feel bore , which is the major caus of lack at work . moreov , he will not give in someth that he do n't like as if he in someth that he acut love do it . secon way of satisfact , that what i observ that peopl who are do what they love are succeccful . the main thing i recommend peopl who are inttend to studi more than one major is to studi what they love . becaus not all of peopl have the potentail to studi a diffir major . in the moment i consid myself a person who hane all the potentail to studi a veraii major .
