person , i am agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . my point of view depend on two argument , the first one is that i believ there is no profit without risk . the second one is that repetit of a task or a job turn out to be a routin . the common say of the busi argu that there would be no profit without risk . when opel , the german car manufactur , first introduc their small car model `` corsa '' , mani peopl ask that whi someon would purchas small car . but corsa had reach tremend sale number in all over the world . opel took the risk of produc a small and unusu car and sold million of corsa all over the world . on the other hand , we can see lot of failur stori about new product , job , even marriag etc . the main reason for failur is the involv of risk and the amount of risk can never be calcul accur . howev , some peopl prefer to do what he \ she alreadi know how to do . person , cultur or econom condit can be effect for not take risk . do the same thing for a long time result in specialis in ani task . howev , it also result in repetit of task , in anoth word , it creta a routin . as a result , the dilemma of take risk or not depend on whether you are a risk takei believ i am a risk taker and would prefer to tri new thing and to take risk up to some degre in order to be success in my life .
