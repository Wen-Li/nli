it is gener beliv that the young peopl in today are less interest in their neighbor than previous . althogh some young peopl still spent their time on help their commun , in my opinion young peopl do n't enjoy their time spend with their commun no more becaus of develop of technolog and competit educ . abov all , the develop of technolog bring about the indivisu . in other word , becaus each person ha amus thing such as the tv , comput , p2p in each home , peopl do n't need peopl whom we enjoy time with becasu peopl can enjoy enough their time use thi eqpuip . for exampl , when i wa in secondari school , i would rather spend the time on play game by comput than play game with my friend in playground or hous . thu , such a indivisu allow peopl concentr on just oneself , therebi make peopl spend more time in their hous and not give enough time to help their commun . moreov , the competit educ make young peopl not help their commun . in particular , today 's educaion enabl babi go to the privat academi to becom more smart children . in thi process , young children believ that more import thing in success life is concentr on myself not other . for instanc , parent prefer to their children to concentr on onli studi than help other peopl . therfor , becaus such a competit educ not allow children spend their time on thing except studi , young peopl do n't have ani chanc to help other peopl . in conclus , i agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their local neighbor ani more for the reason that i mention abov . not onli high level indivisu but also competit educ make young peopl not be abl to spend their time on help their commun .
