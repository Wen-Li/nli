in a first approach , we may think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . young peopl , and even more veri young peopl like children , do n't take into account sever factor of the life , and they seem to enjoy life . for exampl , the every-day-lif of a child is not as much difficult as one of an adult . someon take it to the park , he can play with the other children , even if he doe n't know them , the commun is veri easi . then when he goe back home , he do n't have to take care of the lunch or dinner , he just have to seat or to be seat and he eat . he doe n't have to buy product , to cook them and so on . elder children seem still to enjoy life , and therefor they are more independ than when they were babi . they do n't have yet to borrow of earn one 's live , they must just have their homework done . then , when one becom an adult , sever problem appear . first , after have chosen to make studi or not , one must find a job , and then a appart . then there are the tax . but peopl are independ . between 50 year old and 65 or 70 year old , some peopl have accumul money , and they can now have the benefit of it . they have no more young children , they may travel when they want or just where they want . of cours , the elderli peopl , live either in their own hous or in a retir hous , do n't seem to enjoy life as mush as the younger do . of cours the death ca n't be further and further . .. so they must enjoy everi event , even if it may look veri common for the younger peopl .
