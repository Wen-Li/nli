travel alon or with group will depend on one person and travel habit . i have more posit experi in travel with group than travel alon . so i like to travel with groupl led by a tour guid . travel with group is more stress free , organ , safe and less expensic . usual for group travel , one will take care of the ticket book , hotel reserv etc. group will decid when it time to start , which place is nice to stay . so i do n't need to worri about these thing and can enjoy the trip with out ani stress . last year , i visit india with a group led by a guid and i felt my trip wa stress free . my group leader organ travel and reserv and my tour guid take me to all the import place . guid will take the group and show everyth that group need to see in that area . in thi way , i do n't need to spend my whole even plan for next day event . thi is so time save . thi way , i can concentr on other thing like enjoy my even spa in the hotel spa room or meet new friend in the parti etc . group travel is more safe . all way you have some one along with you and take care of you if need . it is easi for you to recov from sick sinc somebodi is take care of you . especi with long trip , if you are sick in the trip and you travel alon then it is veri hard to recov from the sick . sinc all the expenc are share among the group member , i will pay less money than i pay , if i travel alon . i strongli beliv that travel with group led by a tour guid will give more stress free trip in an organ fashion with less money and more safti .
