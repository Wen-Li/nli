in my opinion , it 's better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becaus you reduc your choic of lifestyl and have to studi for mani more year on witch you could alreadi afford a nice job if you had chosen to studi mani academ subject . by exampl , a person studi medecin academ subject will choos to special himself or herself to be a chirugian or a dentist , but onc the choic is done , you have to studi everyth again to chang your job . if someon wish to special in one specif subject he or she might get more into depth witch is a good caracterist onc you 're look for a job , but you could also appli for a job that which is n't as good as you cool have refer to the studi you ` ve accomplish . moreov , when you special yourself , you have to studi longer to get your master degre and your doctora . on the other hand , if you studi econom or market you have a much bigger choic and you can work in differ depart . when you studi econom , you can also special in one specif subject but most peopl end there studi at the master degre which lead you to lot of differ job such as market , public relat , and mani other . in conclus , we could say that both thoeri lead you to a nice life and that the choic depend of everi student . howev thi choic can be made onli onc you get to thi point of your studi becaus you might descov a lot of new thing dure your student period . final we could ask ourselv which of these two type of studi lead you faster to the job you ever dream of as you 're a child .
