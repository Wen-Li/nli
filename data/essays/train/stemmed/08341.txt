for me , as a student , i often wonder about thi statement . in my school you often have to learn a lot of fact . especi in lesson like histori . for exampl the revolut in franc in the 18th centuri . is it so import to know when everi action exactli happen ? i person think not . it would be more import for the student to understand how it came to the revolut in franc and which consequ it had . instead of learn when the king wa kill by the peopl . i experienc thi myself in histori lesson . we had a great teacher who alway want the student to understand the idea and concept of histor action . you never had to learn ani date for test but you should have known when all the action had been you are writi then student would be more qualifi for their job . becaus they do not onli know thing in theori but also can practic it . on the other hand you sometim have to learn the fact , becaus then you would not be abl to understand the idea and concept . for exampl in chemistri or biolog lesson . in chemistri you could work with a veri danger chemic substanc , with which you could hurt other student or yourself , just beacus you did not know the import fact the the substanc is toxic . in biolog it is quit the same thing . you are not abl to talk about anim in a specif enviro , like a camel , when you do not know ani fact about these anim . you would not understand how a camel is abl to live in a desert like the sahara , if you had not learnt fact about the camel . for exampl how it can save water in hi bodi in a hot place like a desert . as a conclus i would say that it is both import for student to understand idea and to learn the fact . to understand idea and concept , you depend on the fact you have learnt . both side are link with each other .
