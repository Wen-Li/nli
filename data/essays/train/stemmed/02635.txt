time is a big problem nowaday . not onli concern the time we have to spend work everi day to make our live but also the time we have to spend to serv social demand . what young peopl are taught in an averag famili today is much differ from what they were taught fifti year ago and it doe definit not lead to a person who is activ particip in social area such as commun without be push by parent or career . spend time for social benefit instead of for person interest is someth that is veri rare seen . i think that it is right that young peopl of our time do spend veri littl time help their commun but i am of the opinion that one should not onli blame the youth for their lack of interest but in fact look at the caus which are basic for thi chang . if you want to be respect and like in our societi you have to work hard for a good educ in order to work in a profess which allow you to earn a lot of money . there is not much time left besid thi . it is a question of moral standard that chang our attitud toward commun work . when our parent were young there wa no question that the famili went to church everi sunday and that the mother and children help at commun feast and celebr . those parent show their children that thi commun work is part of their daili life . nowaday howev thi is not the case in most of the famili anymor . how are the children suppos to gain access to their commun ? how are they suppos to valu the benefit they get from such work if the parent do not show them anymor ? i found that the friend i made within my commun are the one which remain over a long period of time , not all of them but still a notic lot . i spend a lot of afternoon in the commun ' room for kid when i wa about fourteen and i must say that i truli enjoy help to organ our yearli commun feast . final there are alway except to be made when it come to gener an opinion about a group of peopl - or even a whole gener - as in the discuss statement . not all young peopl are interest in help their commun but still there are some who are more than interest . therefor i find it difficult to agre to such a gener statement eventhough there is definit truth in blame our gener for not be interst in help other without direct earn benefit fo oneself .
