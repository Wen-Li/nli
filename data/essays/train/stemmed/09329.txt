it 's 21th centri now , and if you visit to a develop countri , you can see car everywher . car have becom an import part of our daili life , on weekday we drive to work , at weekend we drive to tour . for myself , i do n't believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , car are too conveni . everyon want to have a car if they could . and , as the technolog improv , to produc a car becom much more easier than befor . what 's more , they are even cheaper ! in the past , you may found someon complain about car are too expens . nowaday , you 'll onli hear that peopl could n't decid which one to buy ! some famili even have two or more car , for each famili member they have their own car . that 's someth you ca n't ever imagin befor . the second reason i would like to talk about , is the develop countri . take china for exampl , think about how mani peopl are there in china . what will happen if everyon in china bought a car ? mayb it will be a super traffic jam , but it 's someth that could realli happen . in the recent year , the develop countri , such as china , india , and tailand , had grow repidli on their economi . what make it wors is that they are also the region that have the most popul around the world . combin the two factor , peopl and money , it will be a huge market for everyth , and car , of cours . or mayb you could tell the 600 million peopl to take the bu ? well , that still need a lot of buse , and still increas the number of car . i do know that car have lot of bad affect on our environ , and i hope that the number of car could decreas through the time . but , will that be happen ? i do n't think so . mayb we need more educ on peopl about how the car hurt the environ , so that the number of car wo n't increas so fast . but to decreas ? i do n't think so .
