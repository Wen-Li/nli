travel around the world should be a great experi becaus it is the time to meet peopl and to discov a new countri . i defin disagre with the idea of travel in group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . regard to my experi , i am sure that the best way to travel is with peopl that you love and visit the place which are not all the time indic . first of all , everi time i have travel in a foreign contri , i wa with my friend or with my famili and i have appreci my trip better , becaus i wa with peopl who i love to share my time with . when you travel with a group you do not know the peopl with who you are , and thi situat can be the appropri time to have new friend , but for me , have a friend is a long stori which can be count in year . in my opinion spend my money to visit a new place is the time to share veri good moment in a new atmospher with my famili and friend who know me . when i went to itali it wa with my best friend and i could appreci much better thi wonder place . last but not least , when you travel with a tour guid you have to follow their rule whom is exactli what i dislik to do dure my vacat becaus i must follow the rule all the time dure my daili life . tour guid ha alreadi a plan and personali i love the idea to do not know what i am go to do the day after . thi sensat is a wonder sensat of freedom . furthermor , travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way to miss the best place becaus i am sure that everi countri have is spirit , which can be discov onli if you spend your time with the popul and visit with their own eye . in conclus , travel in a group led by a tour guid is not the best way for me to visit a new place , becaus you have to follow their rule and becaus you do not know peopl of the group .
