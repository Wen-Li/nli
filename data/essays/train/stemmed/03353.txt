i disagre with that statement . becaus i do n't believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . becaus the popul of world continuosli grow up , it meanther will be live more peopl on the earth than today . so it mean peopl will need more car for their request or anyth els whatev you want to call . if we look to back , our past will show us , we are alway usig more by time . for exampl , if we use 10,000 car in the 1920 's , we are use over than 500 million car today . thi is onli one exampl show , there is alway a good tabl show us we alway use more car than last year . and it will be go up like thi way . let look with a differ point . there are car facil and other like tear productor etc . so alway , they will need to be develop new model of car and other part . and we are driver or whatev we call , shortli peopl will be chang their car to anoth new car . in thi while other poor peopl , i mean who doe n't live in good life standart or condit . then as you seen there will be two car in use , if you will think other peopl doe same too , so can you tell me , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? no there wo n't be fewer car in use in the futur . if you look around and think that , when you were child there wa less car , but when you were growng up , if you think carefuli then you will see that car are rais with time . now look around , how mani car there are ? is it wa less than the time you were child ? no it 's not . becaus there are more car in use now than past time . final i will say we will see mani car in use in the sooner futur . if we do n't find solut for traffic problem , so we will be in big troubl . we will wast time in traffic and we will wast ga for noth while wait at traffic . also i think patrol compani wo n't let it be less car . becaus how mani car is there , they will sell that much ga and earn money . we can give mani exampl like these . hope there wo n't be much car than today for more healthful live . but my brain doe n't tell same thing . i think we need to work hard for thi big problem . we need to teach peopl for social transport vehicl like bu and other . for a healti life we also need to use byscl . i will say again , i do n't want a world with aot of car . i just want a world in peac and clear and healti and without stress .
