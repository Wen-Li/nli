in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i agre with the issu state abov . the detial and exampl list below state my view on thi issu . it a known fact that car accomod fewer peopl when comapr to buss and train . let us say for exampl there are 100 passeng for all these person in order to accomod a bu requir 2 buss in case of a car the number is larg say around 25 car . we have to use fuel in order to run these car and buss . compar the fuel that is wast when we use 2 buss and 25 car the fuel wastag is heavi when we use car . so that we can save some fuel for futur gener . anoth reason is that as more car are move there will be more amount of pollut on the earth the pollut in turn effect health of mani peopl . for exampl some citi in itali celebr one day in a year as car day on that day no car will be in the street the main purpos of thi is to celebr one day with out pollut which clearli state that ride more number of car will have a devast effect on the environ and the fuel price are increas rapidli it is veri difficult for common peopl to maintain a car so they wo n't use a car frequent . the other reason is that in these present day global warm ha increas rapidli which mean the temperatur on the earth surfac is increas rapidli thi caus melt in polar ice cap if it happen so mani of the part in thi world will be submearg . of cours car are not onli the mean that are caus thi howev if we reduc the usag of car we can reduc it somehow . so in futur govern of variou countri will took necessari step to use fewer car . in conclus car are not onli the onli mean for transport but there are some other mean of transport which can be use by the public in effect way so fuel can be save for the futur gener . henc after twenti year fewer car will rum on the road .
