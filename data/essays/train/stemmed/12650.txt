at first sight , i think success peopl have to take risk becaus it is import , when we manag everywher , to tri new thing to see if we succeed in these . the failur would not be grave . when you are the possibl to do someth you do not know , you must do it . although success peopl are proud of them and do not chang what they repres , it would be interess for them to tri other thing , to show that they are abl to do someth that they do not know , in order to prove their actual possibl and valu . on the one hand , the fact they do someth new , show that they want to research the difficulti and becom interess person who do not stop at they know alreadi do . their live have not to be bor . do what we alreadi know doe not permit to meet new circumst and event . take risk stress our volonti . some peopl who decid to tri new thing understood that the life is interest so long as we want meet the surpris of the life . for that we have to take risk when we have the possibl . on the other hand , do onli what you alreadi know , prevent you from discov someth which would pleas you . to put it in a nutshel , take risk , it is live , when we are success , becaus we have the possibl to manag the new thing that we do . on second thought , it is a secur for the person to do onli what we know to do . somebodi are not realli keen on discov new way of live and come into the daili . i respect thi point of view . success peopl can continu their life by do what they alreadi do . in the meanwhil , to my mind , i would like to encourag success peopl to take risk becaus it is import for them .
