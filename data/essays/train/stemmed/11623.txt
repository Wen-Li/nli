from my point of view , in gener i can onli agre with thi statement . nevertheless i think thi statement request for further analysi in detail to come to a final opinion on that topic . it is a clear and from my pespect veri sad trend that young peopl nowaday do not invest much of their spare time into help their commun . therefor it is import to evalu the reason for thi trend first . be 21 year old myself and therefor belong to the group of `` young peopl '' i think i can base my evalu on my own experi . one of the main problem commun have to face is to make `` help the commun '' attract for young peopl , especi take the divers of other possibl activ young peopl are offer today into consider . most young peopl rather invest their time into entertain than in help their commun neglect the fact that help their commun can becom entertain , too . i experienc a good exampl of thi myself . sinc i start think i know about a littl festiv in our suburb of the citi of cologn . everybodi knew about the exist of thi littl festiv , but somehow nobodi wa interest in the organ or market of the festiv . no wonder such condit led to dramat decreas number of visitor throughout the year , which made the festiv itself of no interest at all for the young popul in our suburb becaus it alway had the prestig of be `` bore '' . but one day our school princip start a school-wid project call `` organ a social parti '' . initi by a good friend , some friend of mine and me start to think about an event we could use to organ . then it came to our mind , that it would not be neccessari to invent a new social event at all . all we had to do wa to do a better organ and better market campaign for the exist suburb festiv . soon we start brainstorm for idea that could make thi commun festiv more interest and attract for young peopl . quickli a whole bunch of idea wa collect , so for exampl , a soccer compet call `` littl world cup '' where littl team of young player repres a countri of the world fight for the world championship . soon everyon in school wa talk about thi competit and the commun festiv , too . the result wa an all-tim record of festiv visitor that year . thi littl person exampl show up how `` help their commun '' can becom entertain and therefor becom much more attract for young peopl . all that it necessari is to show up the attract of improv their commun . if thi can be aim can be achiev i think much more young peopl will start think about becom activ in their commun . and thi , even thi may not be the way out of the dilemma at all , it is a import first step to deal with thi trend among the young gener .
