nowaday most student understand idea and concept but gener they do not know fact . i think it can becom a real problem . as far as i am concern i think that most student know idea and concept . inde they are more taught in the univers . i think they are the first point in a teacher lectur . with thi point student can understand fact . howev i think we shuold bear in mind fact . they are import too . for instanc if all presid or ruler knew the histori of the world they could avoid do the same mistak . war are proof of thi . moreov fact are also import on econom ground . for instanc in order to make forecast . inde fact are alway the same if we consid a long period . but after a fact we have to analys it with concept . on the other hand i think that student prefer learn fact . it is more interess becaus it is co to conclud i think that the both are veri import fot our futur . it is a question with a real stake .
