do peopl nowaday give enogh time to help their comun ? i think that peopl nowaday have tire to give enough time to their commun . there are sever key reason for my posit . first , peopl nowaday have work veri hard to surviv . they do n't have much time for themselv , not mention about the time for commun . compar now to the fiveti year ago in taiwan , peopl had a lot of time for their commun becaus peopl mainli work as a farmer . for exampl , peopl have to work from 7 to 9 for their compani becaus the compet nowaday are so keen , howev fiveteen year age peopl just need to work 9 to 5 . it is a industri world everywher and peopl have to do their best to surviv . peopl have tri their best to give their leisur time to the commun . second , govern nowaday alway take a lot effort to help the commun so that peopl do n't have to give too much time to the commun . gover have alreadi made plan to help commun . for exampl , the govern in taiwan alloc human resourc and money to everi commin to help children get tutor after school for free . there are also a lot polici the gover pay effort to help the commun , such as local secur durinf night , provid human resourc to help peopl to solv their difficuti . peopl do n't have to worri about that they do n't give enough time to their commun becaus govern ha alreadi took care for the need of the commniti . mani peopl do n't disagre with me , state that peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to the commun . i think peopl nowaday have alreadi spent enough time for their commun sinc they do n't have much time for theirselv and also govern ha also put much effort in the commun so that peopl do n't have to worri about it .
