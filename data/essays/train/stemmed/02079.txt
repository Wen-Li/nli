i do not agre that the best way to tarvel is in a group led by a tour guid . i can agre that it can be good but in my opinion it is not the best way i would like to give an exampl from my own life in order to illustr whi i do not agre . befor i came to new york , i wa in madrid in order to get master degre in law . when i wa in madrid , i did not have so mani oppotun to work as a student . for thi reason , i use to work as a translat or an assist for a tour guid . mani time i attend mani tour with tour guid to help them . last year at thi time , one big group which consist of more than 35 peopl came from turkey and the travel aggent want me to help the tour guid and i help . i wa togeth with thi group for almost 8 full day . as far as i could understand from their behavior and opinion , all of them were much more differ than each other . i would like to give an exampl from one of our activ such as visit the museum of prado which is one of the most famou musuem all over the world . while some of them want to visit there , a few of them did not . like thi exampl , there were so mani conflict among peopl who came for thi travel , in addit becaus the tour guid got angri with them , he wa travell by himself and he did not want to help anyon dure the tour . becaus of him , i had to help them as i wa a tour guid even though i wa there just to help thi guy . as long as i wa in madrid , i face so mani event like thi while i wa work as an assit of a tour guid . if there are so mani peopl such as more than 10 peopl in the group , as far as i know and have an experi , to satisfi all peopl is get difficult . in my opinion , when all peopl who attend these kind of travel know each other , we can consid that one of the best way to travel in a group but if they do not know each other , i can not say the same thing . for all these reason , it can be summuar the trip or travel can be best way when you travel in a group , if you know with whom you are go to travel .
