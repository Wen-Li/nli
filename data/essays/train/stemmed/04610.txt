in turkey , almost 45 % of total popul is compos of young peopl . if there is a problem about young peopl , that caus big problem to be solv . nowaday , it is believ by most of the popul that , young peopl do not give enough attent on their commun . first of all , it must be accept that there is a problem about young peopl and tri to be solv . especi in turkey , we can not see ani young peopl when some problem about social life or countri are discuss . young think that `` these are unnecessari subject and can not be solv by us '' which is complet wrong . peopl are effect by variou sourc of commun devic such as tv , radio , mobil phone , etc . in the program , it is alway mention that be a rich person in an unfair and quick way is the best way . young do not want to studi ani more becaus of these program . second , student popul is veri high in turkey . they are highli concentr on their primari job which is finish the school in an accept time . problem about social life and countri do not bother them ani more . educ system make student onli `` live memor '' instead of a research or a confid person . how can we expect a young boy/girl to be confid if he/sh is grown up under pressur of his/her parent or teacher ? final , read habit is veri low in young gener . it can be seen not to be relat to thi subject in the first sight but the more you read the more you know and if you do not know , you can not discuss or help . as a result , young gener is effect by some extern factor and forc to believ and live in such a lazi and slave life style . the situat is valid for today but should be work on it . turkish cultur and tradit must be told young gener instead of the west world 's .
