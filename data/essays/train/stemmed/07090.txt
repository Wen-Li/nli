the world is alreadi awar of the harm that the industri revolut ha made to the atmospher . sinc it is an issu of worldwid import restrict polici are implement in the most develop countri . until new technolog will be discov , unfortun tho restrict polici will not work . there are few reason for thi . first it is evid that with the growth of the qualiti of human health , peopl will live longer and so the number of human be on earth will consider increas . thu the number of potenti car driver will increas allso . even though countri will tri to limit car use and develop public transport the develop of human sociti combin with the global will creat a bigger need for car all over the world . the develop or underdevelop countri will need car and all the new possibil provid by car in order to develop their economi . almost all the african contin will need motor vehicul in order to creat a strong economi and way to trade with their neighbour . moreov if we look at the recent boom in the indian and chines economi we may suggestt that in twenti year those two great countri will also be the first car import as their popul are the greatest compar to the one of ani other countri in the world . as the averag condit of live of the popul around the world are slowli and enequ increas there are still some countri that did not undergo the industri revolut . i t seem quit obviou then that there will not be fewer car in twenti year . there may be fewer car in the occident countri as europ or the unit state or at least they will be less pollut . as a conclus i would say thay even with the best will of the polit thr car is still a product that is not onli useful but also beautiful for some peopl . it can be use for a lot of differ purpous and as a lot of peopl like to show off and live in great luxuri , the car will not disapear in the next twenti year .
