to some extent there is need for broad knowledg of mani academ subject , but final one shold master onli one specif subject to do great in their carrer . a person have broder knowledg will serv better for sometim becaus the thing he learn from one subject can be carri over to other . he can easili relat thing sinc he alreadi been thi . but if someon who realli seriou about there carrer , will choos to master a specif subject than go through all the subject . in thi way he will develop hi interest and there by he can carri on thi , he can do reaserch on wht he ha select , there by he can give new dimens to theold traditn way . it will also help him , in hi carrer where he can earn more than other do becaus he ha more knowledg about that subject and becaus he can do thing in more effici way . consentr one one subject also reduc the confus and he can see what he want in more precis way . let consid a a academ student of higher school , he ha more subject to learn then student who is do master . but he ha that knowledg in limit spetrum . where as student of graduat or pg . will learn or concentr on one particular subject , and he get thorugh knowledg of waht is happen , what is happein and what wiil be ? student on complet wil get highli paid job , in hi field rather one doe n't have more specif knowledg . student should concentar on specif sbject which will lead to more practical of appli thing . master specif subject will lead to more applic of what is been learn all these year . it will also develop student attitud toward that subject will inturn get huge benefit . so , in my opinion student should have basic knowledg all the subject but he should have more knowledg on specif subject which will serv him better and hi societi .
