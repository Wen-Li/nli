travel by group is an excit experi due to you can meet new peopl apart from meet the plac that is be visit , in my case i agre thi statement becaus 3 year ago i had the oportun to travel with a group of girl from my same age , and it just wa an experi that i will never forget , meet peopl of differ place , is quit nice , but it is better to enjoy a trip or a certain place with anoth peopl , be led by a guid is veri import when do you realli whant to know about a place , it cultur , it peopl , and thi kind of thing , it also is interest to visit place that are onli known by thi kind of peopl . it veri enjoy have a person who can answr to all of the doubt or question that that you have about certain place , thing , cultur or histori of the citi or countri that is be visit . if the porpous of your trip is of get relax and get appart from peopl , it is better to take that trip alon , ad to discov and solv the doubt about the place alon , due to is tru that for reflex and have peac there is noth better than be alon , or with your famili , without strang peopl . in my person opinion i prefer to travel by group meet peopl and be led by a tour guid , which can solv my doubt and can teach me more about the place , can give me an advic about what can be done or what can ot be done in that place , which restaur is better and so on , also when im go in a relax plan with my famili or alon it is better to be led by a guid becaus of tha same reason that i expes befor . the better advic that can be done to a travel is to enjoy the trip alon or in goroup , be led by a guid or not , there is noth better than meet new place and new cultur , due that kind of experi are print on memori dure long time .
