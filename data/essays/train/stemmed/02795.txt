all day we take car to go at work , take train to transfer from a citi to anoth , buy variou type of electron machin , on all of thi action we can watch a million of danger situat ! on the train we can read uppon the window that is veri dander put out the head or put out bottl , dure drive car we can watch mani traffic signal that rememb the maximum speed permit , or final when we buy a washing-machin we can read the book where are write all instruct to what do and what do not . thi are the advertis that daili we can find in the life . just when we are child , parent show what is danger for us , `` do not touch thi '' is the mainli phrase that it is said . dure the grow each child decid what is right for him and , sometim to follow the fashion , make bad decis for himself like smoch cigarett and joint , or go around with not veri good peopl . sometim an advertis could seem veri eccess , like how do not put a cat in the microwav , but not all peopl are abl to think what is right and what is not . i think that it is imposs know whether a person is abl to choos the true way to make somethingh , and so it is better if other write sampl instruct for him \ her . final i definit disagre the statement becaus we can not know when and what is realli danger for us , and so i think that is better follow the instruct .
