the statement that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact might have vari opinion depend on how a person take it but i myself agre to the statement . for me if a student understand the idea and the concept about a particular topic , the student can get a clear pictur of as to how that particular concept came into be by know the basic for it without ever get the thought that how did he for that matter reach to thi conclus . wherea had the student just learn the fact , he would be just have sort of an overview of the topic without know ani in-depth detail about that particular concept and still might have so mani question regard the topic which he might have not been abl to answer by learn the fact . anoth point to understand idea and concept is that upon understand them , it would stay in student head longer and may be perman as by understand he would be know as to how a particular concept or idea evolv . he would be know the fundament for the idea or concept and onc a student is clear with hi fundament i person think there should not be ani problem anytim recal it . thi is not the case with leaern just the fact , as one would have to keep go back to hi note or book to memor them as the fundament have not been instil into hi mind which would have been the case if he might have understood it . besid the student can also tri and relat to that particular idea , which they can later narrat with eas whenev ask to do so , if he understand that particular idea , without much of strain or stress . while thi might not be the case if the student is acquaint with just the fact , as learn the fact without know the basic for them is equival to or rather is cram which doe n't help much and rather might end up pretti confus instead . an exampl support the abov point that i made would be of a biolog student . had the student just learn the fact about a ecolog flowchart for a particular group of anim it would be okay , but might face problem when a question compris anoth group of anim is given to him as he ha n't understood the basic principl onto which relationship between variou anim is base . on the other hand a student who understand the concept for it will have no problem of answer the question anytim as it is all crystal clear in hi mind .
