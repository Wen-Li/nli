some peopl think that old peopl ca n't enjoy life the way young peopl do . but , person i think they can for the follow reason . most importantli , the age doe n't matter . if the person kept on mind that he want to have a good time and live a happi life , he will do and find the pleasur in alomost ani situat . noth that the young peopl can do the older ca n't do it . it depend on the person himself . for exampl , when i wa young , i use to go to the public park with my grand father . we had such a great time that we want there everi weekend . we enjoy play danger electron game . even though my grand father wa in hi fifti he wa stiil young and abl to enjoy hi life , while my father wa vari young , but he spenjd all of hi time in hi offic work . in addtion , old peopl have more exprienc in life . they are usaulli wiser and know how to spend thier time . in today 's modern societi , young peopl are almost wast thier time do useless or harm thing . they do n't have enough experi to do the right thing or to know how to spend thier time in a good way . in other word , the exprienc of the old peopl will help them to know the right way to enjoy thier life . anoth reason is that young peopl have more responspilti . they have to studi or to work . wherea , old peopl do n't have to work as mush as the young do . most of them have finish thier studi . also , there children are grown up and start to depend on thereselv , so they have more free time . in conclus , i tend to think that older peopl enjoy thier life more than young peopl . they finish thier messag in life , so they have the time and the experi to enjoy thier life better than the young peopl do .
