i can agre to thi statement but of cours thi doe not mean that there are no peopl that spend time - or enough time - to help . the problem as a whole is a problem of the societi be fast , anonym and commerci . let me explain some of the reason for the problem in detail . first of all mani young peopl nowaday do not even have the time to get realli involv into a commun for a long time . after school they go to a univers far away and afterward they will find a job elsewher - and even that job can end soon and one will have to leav again . one point - perhap relat to the one befor - is the focu peopl have . most do onli look at themselv and do not want to handl the problem of other peopl - mayb they do not have the time or connect to the peopl and citi the went to for their new job , for exampl . so , alway look for the own success make peopl blind for problem of their neighbour , classmat and commun . furthermor the prefer of indoor activ as they are veri common today - such as tv , comput game or internet - lead to loss of commun with other peopl . follow help other peopl or commun get less and less , too . a girl sit at home and watch her perfer afternoon soap and deal with the problem shown there will no longer be interest in the problem in her commun . in conclus i can state again that i agre with that statement - but thi neg issu is not onli the fault of singl person but - to a certain amount - the fault or problem of the societi and our gener as a whole .
