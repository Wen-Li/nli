in univers i am often confront with thi kind of question from my friend or other student . of courc both , a broad knowledg of sever academ subjekt and a special knowledg on one subject are import . in my opinion one ha to find the right balanc between these to option . on the one hand , it is more import to have a broad knowledg of mani differ subtject in earli stage of studi . i tri to illustr thi on an exampl . i am studi geographi . thi main field consist of mani differ file such as geomorpholgi or climateologi . when you start studi geographi you even do not know about the exist of these field . thi is the reason whi you first have to get known all the differ part and field of geographi . you first have to find your field of interest on the other hand it is realli import to special on one specif subject when you achiev a certain amount of broad knowledg in the second part of your studi . after you finish univers you have to find a job . therefor it is essenti that you are special in on certain field . compani do not nead peopl who just have got a broad educ . to come back to my exampl of geographi , the special subject of geographi `` geogaph inform system '' is a realli upris field . person who specialic in thi field will have it easi to find a job when they leav univers . in conclus i think the right answer to thi question depend on the point of time . first of all you have to reach a certain amount of broad knowledg such as given in the bachelor degre . later on , it is import to special in your field of interest such as given in a mater programm .
