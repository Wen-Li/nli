i disagre with the statement , that is , i insist that in twenti year there will be more car than there are today . i have two reason . one is about the continu construct of road , and the anoth is about the convini of use car . the first reason for me to disagre with the statement is that the construct of the road for car are continu . it will make the benefit by use car widen more and more . although of cours i agre that the construct of road are often connect with the intent of politician who are eager to earn money by produc too mani road , and it often said to lead to the damag to environ , these construct can not help continu without the dramat chang of law that restrict these behavior of politician , which i think will not occur in twenti year . the second reason for me to disagre with the satat is the convini that car bring us . by car , we can go exact place where we want to go to , while for exampl train can onli bring us to the `` station , '' which might be veri away from the place we want to get to . as shown in the fact that road are so wide spread in the world , we are so benefit by car that we ca n't stop use car . so , it is easi to see that claim bad effect car have , such as pollut air , even though these effect are import enough to care think about , wo n't be abl to stop us use car in twenti year as we are n't now . for these two reason , i disagre with the statement and insist that the number of car will rather increas in twenti year .
