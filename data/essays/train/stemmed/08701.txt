there are lot of factor which would influenc that statement but i think that there will not be fewer car in use in twenti year than today . on the one hand , oil price are get higher and higher becaus the resourc of petroleum are veri limit and so the car as we know it today will be too expens to afford in twenti year . the problem is that the resourc are limit and get more and more difficult to reach . we need to dig for oil in region no one ever live befor for exampl in alaska or on the ground of the ocean . the other thing is that the pollut by car is veri danger for our environ , the ozon layer is get thinner , we have global warm and for a big part of thi the pollut by car is respons . thi ha to stop . on the other hand there is a scientif progress on run car on water or hybrid car which need less ga than the old fashion car . they use the energi wast at break to load a batteri . so mayb we do not need ani more or much less oil in the futur to run a car . the pollut by car would decreas too . if they were run on water the onli pollut would be water which is not danger at all . we also do not have ani real replac public transport system at the moment and probabl will not have in the near futur . the buss and train are a possibl altern in the big citi but in the rural area there is no such thing like train run everi ten minut , one ha to wait approximatli two hour or more to get a train or bu and the buss are travel much slower than the car . in a time where time is money , most of the peopl need to get as fast as possibl from one point to anoth . so as the popul of mankind increas steadili there will be more car in the futur , hope cleaner and more secur one .
