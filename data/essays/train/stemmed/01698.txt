i desagre with thi statement . the car are one of the most creativ invent of the human be that have contribut with the tranport . the invent of the car come from a long time ago when someon discov thi new way of transpor that would chang their live forev . and sinc then the human be ha been tri to improv the car in all of it aspect . grow like a train dog , follow everi step that the human take , satisfi their transport need . now car are mayb the most succesful way of transport and peopl is not still satisfi with the last innov of thi car , in fact they want more , they want better car that can be abl to satisfi their person demand . so now year with year there is more peopl born , peopl that then grow and develop new ideolgi and new demand for the car design . so with the time pass by , and the technolog improv day by day futur car design are gonna be mayb 100 hundr time more succesful than they are nowaday and still , peopl will be look for new innov . in twenti year the scientist and car design could be abl to get these car to the sky , and just imagin how mani demand for thi new car are go to be made . i 'm sure that some day there is not gonna be more space for thi car but i am also pretti sure that peopl are not gonna care for thi , instead they are go to develop new way to store them but never get rid of them . i think that the car have left a veri big footprint in the heart of the human and it go to take a while for it to disappear . they are gonna be use for a long time .
