for me it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , becaus if you have broad knowledg you alway could make anyth in ani moment . if you have specif knowledg you are limit . in the world of the work if you have specif knowledg you will have more difficult to find a job than a person who have broadn knowledg . i think that is more import have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus usual , for the work , is not requir special knowledg in one specif subject . well i think that for the person is more beauti have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becaus if you have more knowledg you can speak with ani peopl you meet . you could speak with variou type of peopl . peopl who have differ truck of life . peopl who arriv to variou place of the world and speak differ languag . if you have special knowledg in one specif subject you may not understand other differ subject veri well becaus you do n't have basic knowledg of other subject . in the past there wa n't the possibl to know mani sub
