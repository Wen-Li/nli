although for some profess it might be better to have a profund knowledg of their specif subject , in my profess you are dependend on a rather broad knowledg . so i tend to agre with the statement also know that there are strong reason to think the other way around . be an architect my client not onli expect from me to make an excel design which fit their demand , it involv also at least a basic knowledg of mani other profess like electr , plume , wood work etc . so if i would just focu on skill concern the design , i would not be abl to meet the demand in the other field . but then of caus i am also dependend on peopl who know more about specif subject than i do like i mention in the begin . there is an other exampl to underlin my point of view . surgent often need veri specif skill and knowledg about deseas in order to be abl to cure them . but then it need also less specialis doctor who are abl to diagnos the deseas in the first place and thi might involv more than one field . but on the other peopl who are special can be veri narrow mind as well . they do n't show interest in other thing such as cultur matter like theater and art becaus they do n't know anyth about it . for some profess it is even necessari to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject such as buisi man . to be abl to commun with other in differ field can be a veri import factor for their success . so all in all i think it is better to be interesst in mani subject than just in one , it give a a better understand of other and open up your mind for the `` unexpect '' .
