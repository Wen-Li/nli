nowaday young peopl are veri busi with everyth that is go on out there in the world . technolog is one of the most import thing that is make them busi , such as internet , video game , televis and alot more . it seem to be that they spend so mush time play and use these thing without know how much time they are wast . you see them play video game for hour , but do noth for their commun . there are so much to do and so much to give but ignor is the problem . children must be tought in school how to help and give , but the first place to learn that is at home . parent doe n't know the import of teach their children how to help with their communit . children should do chariti work and they also should help poor peopl and peopl with physic and mental disabl . parent should plant in them the beauti of give , help and care . also teenag , they should learn that to . now all they care about is what to wear and where to go and what new in fashion . i know they are teenag and they should live their age but thi doesnt hold them from help their commun . there are so mani stuff to do for their commun especiali her in saudi arabia . so i strongli agre with the statment . i think that we should take thi problem more seriou becaus the way young peopl are now is not the way we want them to be n the futur . as a start i will talk to mani peopl i know who can help me in thi case and hope i will make a chang in my commun and i am sure that mani children and young peopl will respond if we talk to them the rght way .
