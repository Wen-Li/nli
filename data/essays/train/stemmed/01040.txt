i beliv that in 20 year the use for car will declin becaus there will alway be new technolog , more safer way to trave , and new fuel sourc . if you look close in histori , you will see that man ha alway been tri to find better substitu to what he ha and for that reason peopl are ride car now . for exampl , long ago peopl use to walk for transport but thought that it wa n't practic so after much look around they start ride domest anim , after that they began to tri and travel in group the answer wa the envent of the carag , later on they began to find other mean of faster transportaion which end in the envent of car . it 's true that car are fast and reliabl but their are not safe enough . car accid might be extreamli damag or fatal for that peopl start to make rule for ride car like buckel setbelt , not lete children sit up frond , and sit in the right posit . although there are rule most peopl wo n't go by them and tri to `` do it '' their way , so a safe mean of transportaion must be found . in today 's world fossiel fuel is the most import resourc , mani machin depend on them like car , plane , and train . if you look at my first reason , new technolog , you will see that becaus of it human will find anoth form of fuel , like cold fussion , to use other than fossiel fuel becaus it pollut the atmosph and case diseas like cancer . in conclus , i think that car are go to be use less in the next 20 year becau there will be a much safer , more hi-tech , and natur friendli mean of transportaion .
