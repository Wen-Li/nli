i agre wtith thi opinion that success peopl tri new thiung and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are sever reason . in my case , my mother is a succsess person . howev i alway think mani thingshappen in daili life neg . for exampl , now i am in canada to studi english . howev i had a complain about my class . one of my reason wa that class wa so noisi . mani peolp alway speak a lot and i could not consentr at all . then i discuss with my advis , mythla . she told me that i will chang the class that is more higher level . howev i did not have a confid if i can do well in thi level . after school . i told all stori to my mother . then she gave me an advic . she told me the stori thet she experienc . the stori wa whar she went to ski with her friend . and her advioc wa that if you go to ski with friend who ha same skill with me , you can enjoy but your skill will not improv . howev if you ski with friend who ha better skill than me , then your skill is more improv . i agre with her advic . i think the person who do what they alreadi know how to do well doe not take risk but they will not receiv anyth instead of their safti . if i will ski with my friend , for me it is big challeng but i can learn from my fail . and , perhop i will tri to do that i will never happen again . everybodi have a bad experi . howev we can get mani advic from it . therefor i think success peopl is the person who do not afraid of fail and keep challeng to get new thing .
