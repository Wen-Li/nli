i do not agre with the question . the major reason that brought me to thi conclus is , that onli specialis make perfect . that mean if you want to work in a certain field , you have to special . becaus you have to know as much as possibl about thi certain field , in order to work on a highli profession level . for exampl , if you are a doctor , you should learn everyth about medicin , the human bodi and how to treat sickniss . if you onli know how to treat a cold and how to measur the blood pressur , you can not work on a high level . to give anoth exampl ; if a programm would not special , he or she will never find a job . becaus there is such a great varieti of program languag , that onli specialis will make it possibl to work in a certain field . there is no gener program ! a programm ha to choos one field to work in , mayb web-design , than he or she ha to studi a lot in order to get a good overview about thi particular work field . i think you can transfer thi to everi kind of academ subject . onli specialis make perfect . but it is also my opinion , that peopl should have a broad knowledg of mani differ subject . not especi on academ level , but a good gener knowledg is import as well .
