although it might be veri difficult to know how peopl act in futur i cast doubt on thi statement for mani reason . first of all , if peopl will drive fewer car there must occur a big invent of a thing in futur that is more useful and at the same time cheaper than our car . look at the current technolog i do not think that it is possibl to creat wonderful thing within the next twenti year . anoth import point is that third world countri , like india or pakistan are just at the begin of use car . they are mani year behind the sophist countri like for exampl germani or the unit state . so in these countri the car usag will be emerg in high rate . moreov an invent like that should also be not veri harmful to the environ . otherwis the kyoto protcol which wa sign by most of the world nation could not be fullfil . and becaus of there are no recent environ friendli invent of power deliveri i do not think that it is possibl within ten year . of cours world lead scientist are work on more environ friendli thing than petrol , but these progress are made onli for car and not for other form of transport devic . final one could say that it is imposs to invent a more sophist transport devic than car within the next twenti year . so we have to surch for other possibl whz the usag of car could declin . most obvious would be the point , that we simpli do not use as mani car as we do know . therefor it must be better for peopl to not use there car . but as the human be is said to be lousi , that seem veri unreal .
