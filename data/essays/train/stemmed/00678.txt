i would disagre with the statment , the reason be is that it would lead to noth except confus . have a gener idea about variou subject is prefer rather than persu full time studi on all the subject . a student who prefer to studi all the subject will have to work much harder than the student who ha onli choosen special in one subject . special in one subject , will have a clear idea as to what to persu next with regard to that particular academ and could plan for a better career . even career opporutun would be good for the student who ha special . let us take an exampl of med-school student . one student decid to take cardiolog as the special and other choos to studi mani special . the student who choos cardiolog will have concentr total on the specialz which he choos and can be a master in that special . thi student can work in corpor hospit which are relat to cardiolog . on the other hand the student who choos mani special will have to work realli hard and to get on top it , it would be veri difficult for him and some time it may result that he end up with noth . thi person will have hard time in choos hi career field as well . the abov exampl clearli state , what would be the advantag of special and with that of knowledg about mani subject . even if you look at the student of busi administr , you would see that they will choos either one special or dual special , but not more . even the school and colleg would give a over all idea of the variou subject and then it will be divid into special . even the person who would opt for broad knowledg of mani academ will have to be special in one particular subject at the end of the day , sinc he/sh need to choos a career path which lead to a special . the statement look better to read on the paper to have mani academ subject , but in practic it would be veri much tough to acheiv it , although there are peopl who are persu mani special , ideal it would be suggest to have one special .
