i do not agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that today becaus peopl have been have the desir of have their own car to have convieint life and in 20 year , the price of the car will be lower . first , in 20 year , there will be even more car than today . out economi and the state of live conditon have been better and better . these day , peopl gener do not need to worri about food , place to live and cloth . nowaday , it is the problem of choos so mani option to enhenc out life . sinc we live in a great life , we want to have more comfort and easi life . there wa an interest articl of drive a car instead of use pubblic transport . the articl say even if peopl know that the rush hour is pain , they prefer to drive their own car becaus it is simpl to go out and go to the place where they want . second , it will be easier to buy car in the futur . the thing that were use to be veri expes so we could not buy well are get cheaper and cheaper . for instanc , buy a comput or a car cost a leg or an arm about 30 and 40 year ago . even buy a comput thi year is cheaper than last year . thank to our technnolog , there are a lot of suppli than need and peopl keep look for a brand new thing which are enhenc more and more . that is whi car are also cheaper day by day so as in twenti year , peopl can get car more easili than now therefor , if peopl have car , they will use them more than now . like these reason , i disagre that use of car will be fewer than now . some peopl might think that our pubblic transport will be more use than indivisu car but still in the big citi have longer rush hour and more traffic everi year . two reason that i mention abov support my opinion of use of car in twenti year will not be fewer than today .
