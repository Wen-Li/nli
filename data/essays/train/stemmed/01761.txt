no , definitli i do n't agre with thi statement . i think in the futur it could happen exactli the opposit in the usag of car , and i 'm go to explain whi i 'm sure of thi . in my opinion , the main reason among a lot of aspect , is the relav explos , in these year and also in the next futur , of the asiat popul , and , as a direct consequ , of the asiat market in thi sector . in these eastern countri , as , for exampl , china and india , there is a big popul that is in costant increas of their birth , but , what is more import , is grow the level of their social and technolog cultur and knowledg . it mean that those popul , that togeth have a number of inhabit which is about thirteen time larger than the one of unit state , will creat in all econom area , and so also in car sector , a big market that in the next twenti year could onli increas the number of materi good ( as car , in thi case ) which will be exchang in the global commerc . in thi particular exampl , furthermor , there is anoth veri rilev aspect which can be affirm to support my thesi : it is about the relat , in those eastern countri , between the popul and the territori where thei live . although the number of the inhabit is so high , the extens of the territori that they occup is veri big , and the need of movement from one side to anoth of the citi it is a real aspect we have to consider . nowaday thi problem is not solv with an import solut , but it is reason to think that in the next year , with the increas of the technolog cultur and possibl , will be built more road and than car will becom the onli mean of indipend trasport and movement .
