thi subject could be consid as a mix bless for societi and for me . i agre with thi statement but also be old have disadvantag it doe not mean that older peopl not enjoy life . altough young peopl have more avail for fun from their health , there are also older peopl like young childeren in their sixti . i agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . to begin with , young peopl have more abil and energi to spend their time and act a activ role in the social activ . they can go wherev they want and they can enjoy with the societi like concert , cinema , theatr . also they are spend most of their time with their friend at school so they are alway in a communicaton . on the other hand , older peopl have not got the full physic abil like young as they they are old . they can not even walk without ani help so they can not be abl to see their friend for talk and share , rest and stroll . so when teenag want to have fun there could not be a chanc for them so they becom uncomfort becous they need to walk , run , talk as they also have the respons of be a teenag . on the other hand there are some except both for older and younger peopl . some teenag do not like be with other peopl and they do not love anyth . so i do not understand how they can enjoy life without love anyth to do and complain about get bore . despit of be older , i can see them , especi woman , in their sport car and drive through most popular avenu , shop with their frien , play game , have parti . to summeris , we should not consid the statement like young peopl alway enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus it is not someth relat with the age . it is someth come from the insid of the peopl and have the abil to know how to enjoy life .
