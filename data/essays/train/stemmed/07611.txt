i certainli agre with that statement . in my opinion thi is due to a common sens of selfish that is so widespread in young peopl . onli a few teenag spend their free time in reward activ , such as drive ambul or help blind . the other , the biggest part , think that onli enjoy ha import in thier singl life . so the key phrase is enjoy yourself and do n't care of anyon . thi is so wrong : if you alway think to youself , you will never note how the world need your help . you can give your contribut onli with a simpl deed and with a simpl attent toward who is suffer or is ask your help . at thi common sens contribut the bad exampl that televis and internet give : almost everi famou person s onli interest to go to the parti , to have vacat in wonder place , .. about my person experi i can say i have never help my commun . in part , thi is due to my past and present involv in studi but also in sport activ . in my normal day i have to stay up to 8 hour to the univers and then i have to train myself in my favourit sport , the taekwondo . when i come back home i neither can watch the tv without sleep in front of it . honestli i also must come clean that i am realli realli lazi . in fact i desrcrib abov not my life in the weekend , but also dure the weeek . if i could , i would help my comun in the weekend like some friend of mine do . but , on friday and saturday even , i want to enjoy myself until the earlier hour in the day . thi impli that i am too tire on sunday for help my commun take , for exampl , dinner or lunch to old peopl who can not move from their home
