some peopl believ that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject wherea other support to special in one subject . in my opinion , notwithstand a person should have knowledg of all relat academ subject , to special in one specif subject is most appropri in complianc with thi centuri . we are live in a centuri in which it is easi for everyon to reach inform about nearli anyth at anytim they wish . howev thi knowledg is gener too surfac base . therefor the level of knowledg determin the differ between an academ person and non-academ person . to special in one academ subject prevent a person from spread hi energi , effort and time to too mani thing at the same time and help to contrat on that one subject wherea broad knowledg of mani academ subject shall onli result with a lot of unnecessari , unclear and ambiguo knowledg which end up with no contribut to academ at all . the area that agre to specializaton ha been increas by the develop of technolog . scienc ha been seper to much more branch than it wa fifti year ago . for exampl principl such as law and medicin encourag peopl to special in one specif subject sinc it is imposs to learn to a subject deepli with a surfac base knowledg . thu , i believ that consid the easi and quick at reach inform , it is better to special in one specif subject in order to draw a differ between academ and non academ .
