car are veri use to us in mani way . they transport us to our destin quickli . they help to save our time instead of walk . car are wide use by million of peopl around the world today . their price is not veri high and they live for a long time . after mention all the use use of car abov , i total disagre with the statement that say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i know that technolog is becom more and more progress everyday and anoth invent could be invent , but the use on car will not decreas . in my opinion , car are veri essenti to everi person now in the world . a person can not go to ani place that he need without a car . whoever doe not own a car is oblig to ride in government or public car such as buse and microbus that transport individu to certain place accord to the destin of each bu . so at the end , the person ride a certain type of car and doe not go to hi destin walk as it will take a long time to reach hi destin . in my second opinion , i think that in the next twenti year the use of car will increas as new and mani featur will be ad to car which give the opportun for driver to get greater benefit from car . by that way , more car will be use than today . for exampl , about 50-60 year ago , the car that were use were veri old-fashion and were veri larg and some were move by hors . now , everyth ha chang and car becam much mor good-look . they becam smaller in size and are no longer move by hors . that is what i mean by ad new featur . in conclus , i total disagre with the topic sentenc and propos that the use on car will increas and not decreas .
