i disagre with statement . in my opinion the best way to travel is alon or in a small group of peopl that have approxim the same degre of knowledg of the region . there are sever reason for my belief . first of all , a tour guid will protect the travel from most interact with and exposur to the local inhabit by organis transport , accomod , food etc . thi is , of cours , conveni and effici but it often mean that the travel will not use the local languag nor will he encount local custom of commun and everyday life . thu , he miss out on mani new experi and cultur insight . for exampl , when a friend and i were travel in turkey on our own , we had to learn a coupl of turkish phrase in order to commun with local peasant , and the priceless reward wa that we were invit to stay with the famili for a coupl of day and experi how life in rural turkey realli is like . thi would not happen when travel with a tour guid , use prearrang facil and no need to talk to the local peopl . second , a tour guid will have specif idea on what to show and what to hide of a countri . the travel will onli see what is esteem a cultur highlight , or entertain , and he will follow the footstep of mani tourist befor him . if he travel on hi own , he ha the chanc to leav the usual path and discov the new environ on hi own . he is like to encount nice as well as unpleas thing but hi pictur of the local cultur will be more balanc and more complet . similarli , travel without a guid might be less effect in term of `` visit sights/day '' but it will be a more thorough and individu experi . when travel with a guid one face the danger of fall into a passiv , consum posit where prepar piec of inform are deliv . in summari , travel alon mean activ involv , challeng and individu experi as oppos to the conveni and superfici screen of tourist attract provid by most guid tour . it depend on the prefer of the travel which form of explor a new region he choos but i believ that without a guid the experi is much richer .
