a major physic break through wa made when einstein suggest a brand new theori deal with rel . thi innov vision wa a success and einstein had strong physic basi . do we need a real ceasur to succeed in one area or do we need to evolv gentli to reach a key point ? first , let 's explain how seek excel can bring us to a success . for exampl , the comput fluid dynam activ need real mathemat and fluid physic knowledg so a person can then think about a revolutionnari concept . by focus on one point , we can tri differ method to bypass it . work on someth wellknown help think about the major issu and not about mathemat ' properti . peopl who keep do well what they know are gather knowledg , experi so they are recogn by other peopl for thi and often call , need to explain , show , develop thi subject . final , as a third point , shall i mention that take risk is not realli allow when work on a nuclear plant or when drive a war , as human live are at stake . but , mani battl were won by use surpris method like the hors made of wood dure the greek troy war . more over , take space between a concept and our work can lead us to borrow idea from other area , like use mathemat for urban plan optimis . and thi make the concept work . howev , an other reason of take risk is that most peopl have too much fear about risk anyth they alreadi have . so you are distinguish yourself from other and then appear , when succeed , as a successful person . to summar , acquir excel in one particular field is the first step of a successful stori . then , an innov concept would make the differ between success and daili wotk .
