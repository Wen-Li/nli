actual , when we are student , we learn a lot of thigh without understand exactli . can we say thi situat is ok ? it is controversi issu whether understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . some peopl say that it is more import for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept . as for me , howev , i dissent from thi opinion becaus of follow 2 reason . without understand thoroughli , we ca n't get a good score in the exam and we ca n't appli idea and concept to our real life effect . first , if student learn someth in their school and they could n't understand well at that time , they could n't solv the problem in the exam about that topic . even though we can memor fact what we learn whithout understand for an exam , it ca n't be relat our real knowledg . so , right after coupl of day , we will forget most of them we memor befor . howev , the fact which we understood are more impress so it will stay our mind longer . therefor , compar to the the score we got when we understood idea and concept exactli , the score we got when we did n't understand will be poor . second , the matter which student learn and understood in the scool can be applic to their daili life . for exampl , imagin that in the ethic class we learn that we should give a seat to old peopl in the bu or subway . if you total understand the fact , you will do same action in your real life . howev if you could n't understand the fact whi you should do , you will not act like that . also , there is other exampl we can use the fact which we learn in the scool . for exampl , when i watch movi about world war ii , at that time if i learn histori about the time and i could understan the situat well , it will help me enjoy the movi well . like thi , understand idead and concept can be use to our daili life . in conclus , i think that just learn fact without understand the mean in the text is useless . becaus it will bring poor score in the examin in scool , also it ca n't be applic to real life .
