as far as i am concern , young peopl have not all the same behaviour with their commun . obvious , differ peopl have differ interest and thought . as a consequ , thi question is extrem difficult . howev , i quit agre whit thi statement . in fact , i think that almost all young children who live in my neighbourhood do not take care our commun . last year , for istanc , i have help the priest of my church to look after some elderli peopl who had some deseas . i have to do thi activ with other peopl of my commun , but onli one person wa a friend of mine , i mean a person who ha my age . anoth exampl wa the littl parti that my commun organis everi summer at the end of the school . thi is an occas for us , who live veri close , to meet each other , and have fun togeth . in thi day a lot of children and young peopl particip to the event . howev , they usual do noth to organis thi parti . onli your parent either cook delici cake and other food or organis game , such as volleybal or footbal . accord to me , there are a lot of reason young children have in order not to help their commun . first of all , they attend school in the morn , and in the afternoom they should do their homework . othertim , the practic sport all the afternoon or meet same friend of their in order to reliev stress and have fun , and so on . for exampl , last year i start to attend univers quit far from my hous , consequ i have spent less time in my commun and i can understand the problem young peopl have to face . take everyth into account , it is true that nowaday onli few young peopl do someth to improv their commun . howev , i think that help our commun is both a right and a duti for everyon . in particular young children can either improv mani skill by do thi , or learn import knowledg for their futur life , that are not writter in book .
