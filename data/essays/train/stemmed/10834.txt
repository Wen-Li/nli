it 's veri difficult to know how mani car there will be in twenti year , becaus there are some reason that tell us that there will be more car , but also there are reason in the opposit way . i think it is more common and more easier to expect more car in the futur , becaus if you look for the number of car twenti year ago you will be abl to see that there were fewer car than today , if thi tend continu , there will be a lot of car on our street . the problem is that tend can not continu forev becaus we have not resort enough to creat and keep them aliv . and also we have no space for that car . for exampl , i have a car but i 'm think of sell it becaus it 's imposs for me find a place where put it . anoth reason to expect an increas of the number of car in the next twenti year , is the decreas of the prize of a car . nowaday everybodi or almost everybodi is abl to buy a car . but thi is not completli truth becaus thi part of the world is richer each day but the other part of the world is veri poor and they do n't buy and produc ani car . anoth reason is the tend of thi world . i think that comun is now the more import thing . you alway have to travel becaus of your work or to visit peopl in other part of the world , and you need someth to transport yourself . thi fact multipli car ' sail . but thi reason also have the opposit effect , becaus now trip are so much longer than last year and you do n't do anyth with a car , you need take airplan or train , but not car . in conclus , on the one hand peopl need car and there will be a lot of car on the street , but on the other hand futur will requir other way of transport . futur requir public transport , and we should promov it . so in my opinion , there will be fewer car in twenti year but there will be a lot of car yet .
