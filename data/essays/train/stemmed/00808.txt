i alway beliv that everi age ha it own beauti . when i look around and observ peopl from differ age all around me , i can see that they love to do differ thing and they enjoy differ thing but they can still enjoy . i do not think that the peopl who are in their old age enjoy the life less that the young one . a young person may do lot of thing in a singl day than an older one . he can go to cinema in the afternoon , go to shoop in the even and go to a concert with their friend at night . howev , it doe not mean that not do these kind of activ make the older one enjoy the life less the younger one . the older one may have done all these befor in hi younger age and may want to do diffrent thing such as have a beati dinner with hi children and grandchildren or may want to have a walk with one of hi friend to have a cup of tea on the seasid . peopl at some certain age are alreadi have the tast of someth and they want to do diffrent thing . i do not beliv that , thi make them enjoy life less than the young peopl . my mother love to cook delici meal when i go to my hometown at the holiday , and my father say that the happiest time of my mother are those when i say that ` mum , these are all delicious` . my mother enjoy the life at those time . i can see it in her eye . go to cinema or shop or to a concert do not make happi her as much as have a dinner with all familiy . overal , peopl can be happi with diffrent thing in their differ age . therefor , they can enjoy life veri much at their older age .
