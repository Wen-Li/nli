i do n't think it is the best way to travel in a group led by tour guid . there are mani good tour in the world today , and mani peopl use them . i do n't think it is bad to trip becaus peopl said it is so use . so i want to tell my opinion as posit and neg point . first , i will tell you posit point about tour trip . if peopl go to trip with some tour , they do n't need to prepar for travel such as serch famouc place or hotel . travel agent do everyth for us if we pay money . we can go mani popular and famou place and eat good food . if we confus someth , tour guider may help us immidi . we do n't need to worri about anyth , and we just relay on the guid and enjoy a lot . and also almost all tour plan is good prise like not too expens . peapl can join it so easili . thi is the posit point . next , i have opinion as a neg point . the reason whi i have never join that kind of tour is i need my privat time . if i go to trip as a tour group , i have to go everywher with member as a tour and i have to move on time . even though tour guider bring me to famou place , if i do n't like there , i may want to leav soon , and even though i realli like one place and want to stay there , if time to go , i have to leav there . i do n't want to be selfish , but when i go to trip , i use my money onli for trip , so i should go somewher which i want , and i should use all minit as preciou time . i have two side of opinion about tour travel , but i realli do n't know which is the best . i think depend on peopl , we can enjoy travel a lot and have a great time .
