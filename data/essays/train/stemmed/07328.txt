car are the most import investig in our world , and it is veri useful in all of our life way . we can travel by car for long distanc and we can transloc our thing . in my opinion it make our world smaller than it is . for the priviou benifit i disagre with the statment which said that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . let us go to the past , befor car were be invint , the man wa suffer from travil becaus it wa lost hi time and wa veri sloli and veri difficult . we can immagin for exampl if we want to travel for 1000 kelo meter what the time we should be taken to arriv or reatch our station . now aday we can travel as far as we can without suffer or wast more time . second exampl whi i hold no confidonc with the priviou statment is the fast develop of car industri we can see today variou kind of car differ from it use and which are less expens or do not need alot amount of ga . although in the last few year car were becam dangrou for human health becaus it can pollut the air , but recent new gener of car are appear and it consid as a friend of the environ . what is more if we had not car what we will do return to the back and ride donki or depend on our foot . i can not immagin life empti from car . the last reason whi car will still for ever it provid some jop for the peopl , such as driver , mechanican and worker in the car industri . therefor we can say that becaus of the mani use of the car it will be found for ever and will not decreas and will be develop to be appropri for ani environ use mani sourc of power which are not harm for human .
