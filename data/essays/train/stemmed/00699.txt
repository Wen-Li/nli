no i fulli disagre , accord to my percept it is import for student to learn fact than understand idea and concept . fact make life easier for the student beacus if they know the fact what is happen they can continu live happili in the world . learn the idea and concept is more imagin ie the idea that come in our mind is not alway true or fact that it is right . for instanc , there wa a bomb blast in the train and mani peopl made an idea that most of them have injur and fewer have lost their live but the fact wa vice-versa most of them had lost their life , so there wa wrong inform shown in the televis . fact also tell student to believ in the world they are live in . they should not depend upon the televis news all the time they should see on their own and beleiv . student should learn fact than idea becaus they live in the world which tell that what recent is go on ask them about it . . idea they can appli their own but fact is a fact they ca n't chang it anymor after it had happen . they should be fulli known about the fact that happen in the world , not the idea that what is go to happen . student also should n't have to depend upon the teacher or say ` ye ' to their ` ye ' , if the teacher is say a fact student should n't agre until he get some idea of understand , after understand it onli he should agre for the fact . no doubt they should understand the idea and concept that how thi fact have come , they should be given the reason that whi thi fact have been occur , they should understand the reason of thi fact . see all thi i then too disagre with the statement becaus the advantag of fact carri much more weigh than understand idea .
