i agre with the idea to travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus i believ that it is realli help when you are travel in countri or citi where you do not know the lenguaj , the street , the custom , or the law , due to that i think that is veri import to be accompain with somebodi who can help you with all thi troubl , as an exampl i can mention that i rememb a realli embarras situat that happen to a friend when he wa travel in europ , specif in franc , and he wa in the airport and nobodi understood what he need becaus nobodi could understand hi lenguag , due to that he call to hi sister in who live in other countri and talk french , and final he spent all hi money call her all day dure hi trip to ask her to translat him everyth , like to talk with the waitress to translat what he want to eat , but of cours that if he wa accompain by a tour guid he probabl had not had spent all these money and he better could have enjoi thi extra money buy curios or cloth or to make a larger trip , or anyth . other excel thing about a tour guid can provid you in atrip is that you can to know more about the histori of the place , to visit import build , to eat typic food in typic and cheaper restaur recommend by him and you can ask to the tour guid for more tip to make your travel unfforgett . howev , i am a kind of person who enjoy to be in a sure place with sure peopl as a travel group with friend , so , the fact to be travel in a place where i do not know peopl is someth difficult to me , due to that , i realli think that a tour guid is an excel resourc , and is not as expens as to pay the consecu to be lost in a big citi .
