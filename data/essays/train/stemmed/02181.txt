i am in complet agreement with the point of have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i feel that is is better to have some knowledg of all the subject than to have a lot of knowledg in one specif subject onli . tommorow , if some one appraoch me and ask some question which is relat to some veri bizzar topic , i may not abl to give him or her the exact explan . howev , i am sure i will be veri happi and satisfi with the fact that i will be abl to atleast give him or her some basic inform about the topic and get the work start . i think thi point of atleast provid some basic info and guid the start of the topic is far more better than complet be blank about the topic as the topic may not fall under your subject . we have all heard about the popular proverb `` jack of all trade but master of none '' . i prefer to be the jack and not the master . sometim it is the demand of the situat or the job profil of the person . you never know what will your own kid ask you when he or she see someth for the first time . not onli in term of famili and educ your near and dear one but also in a competit atmospher at work if one show hi abil and knowledg in a humbl way , he or she is bound to be appreci and promot . the best exampl can be the competit examin in india which are conduct to fill up govern post . these job are so demand that they cover almost each and everi subject from the scratch to right till the graduat level . that again tell us how demand the job must be becaus you never know in which depart or disciplin you will be post . so it is alway prefer and expect of you to have a prior and basic knowledg of all the major subject that will be put in practic . so basic i feel that if one is ask to talk on a bizzar topic or an unknown topic then he or she should be abl to talk about atleast some basic point than just go blank . it is noth wrong in not have ani idea of an unknown topic but it is alway at your advantag to know differ subject . you never know when and where will you need the inform . and then you will be thank not onli by other peol but also by your ownself . i dont think there is ani better definit to the word `` self satisfact '' than thi .
