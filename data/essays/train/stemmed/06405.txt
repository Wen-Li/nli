i disagre with the statement that there will be fewer car in twenti year than there are now . first of all there wa no consider chang in the last twenti year and i think there will not be one in the next twenti . although there have been go on some develop that speak for the use of public transport , such as the increas oil price or the ongo improv in public transport , the reason whi peopl use car or refus to take public vehicl will stay the same over the next twenti year . i think the first and most import reason whi a lot of peopl will not give up their car is the flexibl it bring . you do not have to care about bu schedul . if you want to go somewher you simpli enter your car and immedi you are on your way . a further , also veri import reason is the independ a car bring . you do not have to worri about how to come to the next train station or what to do if you need to go somewher in the middl of the night when no public transport is activ . neither you have to care about be late for work as the train is late . you onli depent on yourself . anoth fact that support my theori is that the price for public transport are still quit expens . consid that they have not chang consider in the last twenti year i do not expect them to get much cheaper in the next twenti year . furthermor car and their effic are improv continu , which make them more and more independ from the oil price . i think that all the mention reason contribut their part to the theori that in twenti year there will be as mani car in use as there are today .
