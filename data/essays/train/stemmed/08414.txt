i had a trip to che-ju island in my countri , korea , with my friend , and it wa a trip that led by a tour guid . after the journey , there were more bad memori than good one , becaus of these reason ; caanot choos visit place , and the problem of extra fee . for my experi , i disagre with the opinion that the tour group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . first of all , peopl rob their right to choos the spot to visit , if the travel team is organez and led by a tour guid , peopl of the the team have to follow the schedul which is made by the guid . for exampl , i could n't visit the museum which exhibit the numer kind of uniqu plant grown onli in han-ra mountain in che-ju island . instead of that , we mere follow the typic travel cours like teddi bear museum , and restaur that sell black pig . how wast of time !! i can see such a thing not onli in the island , but in my town . to follow the schedul we had to sacrific our right to decid where to go . in addit , go travel with a guid is too costli . there are mani so call ` option ' that we can choos whether we will experi it or not . howev , in realiti , the ` option ' are not option as it mean liter . the guid make peopl to do , or sometim buy someth madatorilli . and of cour it is not conclu in the travel fee peopl alreadi paid . to illustr thi , a tv program in korea reveal the realiti of the ` option ' system . they research about that , and conduct a survey to the peopl who experi the guid tour . most of them did n't want to do the program , but compel to do that by the reason that if someon doe n't particip alon , then he or she will break the harmoni of the team . furthermor , about 90 % of them disappoint to the cost , and qualiti of the option program they had experienc . it show how expens to tour with a guid . in conclus , i disagre with the view that the tour with guid is the best way of travel , becaus we can not go where we wish to go , and have to pay for the extra fee for option program , as for me who experienc such a bad-memoried-trip , i am plan to go euroup next summer with my own prepar , and organ . even though it is hard to prepar , it will bestow me happier memori , and allow me to save money .
