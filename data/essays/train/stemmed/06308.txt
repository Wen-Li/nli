while some peopl who like travel alon disagre with that opinion , but i total agre with that opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have two reason for thi . they are reliabl and gurante . first , travel with tour guid ha reliabl for time and schedul . when i go to travel alon , i sometim miss a transport what we need to get on or a park i want to visit is close . but if we go to travel with tour guid , we can not miss it and we can visit there . i hate to worri about anyth except from enjoy . when i go to travel to see someth i want , we do not know about when it is open or close even though i studi befor , it might be suddenli close . we can not reach the purpos of that tour . second , i have certainli gurante which is kind of insur in travel with tour guid . though sometim we have a sick such as headach and cold even though heart diseas , if we are with the tour guid , he take us to the proper hospit or the place to rest . that is a big use in travel . when also we have a possibl to meet accid such as car accid and someth mine stolen , he will contact with local polic and might get back . in terribl situat such as a sick or accid , we can reli on the tour guid . on the other hand , if we go to travel alon , we can not reli on anyon , so we should commun with your stranger and negoti . that need vast work and get exhauset . in conclus , when i go to travel , i am alway togeth with my tour guid . it is the most use way for us to enjoy our travel . thu i would go to travel ina group led by a tour guid . and i recommend you to go to travel with a tour guid for your most happi .
