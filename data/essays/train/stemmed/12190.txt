there are two side to the question whether young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do . on the one hand , one could say young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . they still have their live ahead of them and , due to their youth and good health , are still in the posit to aspir a bright futur as well as to have all the possibl to live their dream and achiev their goal and what they may want in life . also , the chanc that young peopl are impair physic and/or psycholog are way lesser than they are with older peopl . on the other hand , one could also claim the opposit and say that due to their experi , older peopl are more in the posit to enjoy their life to the fullest , despit mental or health problem . after a life full of experi and adventur , older peopl know what to acknowledg about life and not to take everyth for grant - they will know who and what is import to them . to conclud , i believ that one can not find a final answer to our initi question , as it is mere imposs to measur joy or better a person 's capac to enjoy life . a young person can also be pysic and/or psycholog impair in the same way an older person can be absolutley healthi and fit despit their old age . in addit , some young peopl have alreadi gone through a lot of hardship despit their youth , while some old peopl have never face a sever problem . whatev the case , i believ it is not so much a question of whether a person is young or old , but rather a question of peopl individu charact , outlook and attitud that enabl them to live and enjoy life to the fullest .
