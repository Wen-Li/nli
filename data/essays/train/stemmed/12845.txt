in my opinion it is better to have special knowledg in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academec subject . a person have a broad and superfici knowledg of mani academ subject is like a jack of all trade but master of none . such a person can not do justic to ani of the academ subject . like for exampl no patient will like hi brain to be oper upon by a gener physician rather than by a neuro-surgeon . similarli a teacher teach a varieti of subject can not do justic to student of a specif stream . he might be awar of all the subject he is teach but he might not be well equip to satisfi the queri of a student regard the specif of a topic . it is advis to have an overal knowledg of variou subject and be awar of all the thing which is whi we as a student studi a varieti of subject at school level . but then it is even more import to give a direct to the cours of our studi by pursu further educ in a field of our interest so that we do proper justic to our studi . a student might not be as interest in studi literatur as he might be in engin scienc or vice-versa . so it is kind of unfair to make him studi subject that do not interest him which ultim lead to hi secur poor grade in those subject . one may veri well argu that a student may be interest in more than one subject and may want to pursu hi further studi in both . in that case , now-a-day there are mani combin of subject avail which help us in understand the inter relationship of differ subject with each other . for instanc , the applic of engin scienc in medic stream is one of the most studi combin . by the time a student complet hi school he is in a condit to make up hi mind and decid hi area of interest . so give him a choic then to choos hi prefer stream will help him perform well and henc will lead to hi motiv and satisfact . moreov , there are numer field which requir exhaust research and studi for their proper understand and appreci . a student whose faculti are be use in a varieti of subject will not be abl to find enough time and resourc to utilis in all the field . henc he might not be abl to appreci the nuanc of a subject as well as he could have when studi that subject in detail . in view of the abov argument i believ that it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
