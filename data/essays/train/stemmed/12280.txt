i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do thi mayb becaus of my personn experi . actual , i am a young student still in high school and think that i realli do enjoy life more than my parent for exampl . i am say thi becaus be young meen not a lot of repons and a lot more freedom . first , i want to say that as a young student i am not respons for a lot of thing in my life . of cours , except the educ success but thi could also be my decis , to be success or not . nevertheless young peopl are not respos for ani crimin act : when a young boy is for exampl charg of someth , the parent take full responsibiliy . in addit , young peopl have no job stress , they onli have a school to worri about but no more and the work done at school could not be compar to the work of a real job . we have no respons of live as our parent cover all our person need . we have then no respons of find a job to be abl to live . less respons , is more freedom . i think that young peopl have more time in everi aspect of life . an import aspect are mistak ; in fact we have more time when young to make mistak and correct them . for exampl , i can make a bad decis choos what i want to studi , be young allow me to reconsid my decis and start anoth program or cours on anoth field of studi . i can see also from my situat that be old disadvantag you from do a lot of activ . my father , who wa a grat tenni player in hi younger life have now a back problem and ca n't even run for a long period of time . i can not immagin myself not play soccer when i grow older . be young mean do thing that a lot of older peopl would n't do , like parti frequent . young peopl have thi caract that push them to go danc and spend a lot of time with friend and do a lot of thing at the same time . with the reason and exampl state befor , i came to a conclus that be young allow to enjoy life more than be old . thi could be differ for other peopl
