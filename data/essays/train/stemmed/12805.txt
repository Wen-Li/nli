the world we live in is get more and more an egoist , self-focus world . it is true , at least in my opinion , that peopl are more reluct nowaday to give their time to help their commun . howev , i do not think thi to be a characterist of young peolpl onli . actual , i believ adult are the first one to give us thi bad exampl . pursu alway more their career and alway spend more time for themselv rather than for build up famili or care for their old rel , the adult of thi new millenium seem to prefer live by and for themselv rather than place themselv insid commun . thi is at least the pictur that the televis and movi industri show us . . just look at worldwid famou sit-com like `` friend '' and `` sex and the citi '' , it is imposss to find there portrayt of adult interest in someth differ than their job , their friend , basic their live . younger peopl , instead , are becom more and more sensibl to their commun , probabl becaus that feel of `` enlarg famili '' that in the past wa typic of small citi ha disappear dure the last year . european commun launch mani program of nation and intern volount job in order to make youngster understand how import is to be part of a larger commun and share experi with other , offer what you have and get back what you lack . an alreadi ten year-old associ activ in the citi i live in , call `` time bank '' , aim right at thi purpos : you give other your time and help when you can , and in return they give you a `` time check '' by which you can ask back the time you donat to other when you will be in need of it ! it is therefor gener true that peopl have becom more selfish and not alway will to help other member of their commun , but i also think that thi will all chang soon - mainli thank to young peopl - becaus we have all understood that it is not easi nor good to live like float island on the same ocean , but is way better to start live as a real , strong commun .
