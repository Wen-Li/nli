thi is a difficult topi as both travel in a group and travel alon ha it advantag and disadvantag . and the choic also can vari from person to person . in my case i dont agre with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are variou reason to support my choic and these are discuss below . firstli in the case of take tour in a group led by guid , there is time bound . the tour guid manag the time keep in mind the whole group . in thi case i can not spend much time on the place which i realli like . if i am trevel on my own i can visit the place of my choic . secondli , in the group travel the tour guid gener make the stay arrang at the place which have better facil . in thi case you do not get a chanc to interact with the local peopl . when i am take a tour i like to know the local cultur and talk to the local people. , becaus i think that is more fun . addit i like to tri the local food if i am go to some new place . thi give me a chanc to improv my knowledg about that place and the peopl there . in a guid led tour there are veri less chanc of do that . furthermor , i am a spontan person by natur . i enjot thing at certain moment . so if i am take a tour with sever other peopl it will not be possibl to do watev i want . and in thi case i will not be abl to enjoy properli and it will not be fun for me . so in the conclus i want to say that it actual depend upon the individu whether he like to travel in a group led by tour guid or on hi own .
