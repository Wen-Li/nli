although there are sure except , i agre with the statement that young peopl in gener enjoy life more than older peopl do . there are differ reason whi i state thi opinion . first young peopl do n't take life and their life-tim so seriou , they often do n't even think about it . becaus of their youth they have the feel that they have plenti of time left , so they are veri free to spend it on whatev they like to . enjoy life often mean to take time for someth that is not neccesari but that make be aliv more fun . young peopl do not hesit to spend time for travel , parti , visit friend and so on . thu they enjoy life more than older peopl who often do n't seem to have spare time . thi lead us to anoth reason whi young peopl acut have the possibl to enjoy life easier . as long as they go to school or studi they do n't have to work the whole day like older peopl have to . they just have more free time to deal with and they are most like not as tire in the even as older peopl are after have work mani hour . as a result older peopl will probabl prefer to sleep on such even instead of do someth they realli enjoy , although the next day will again start with work . furthermor there is one import thing which distinguish young peopl from older peopl . in gener young peopl do not have so much respons . they often live at home where their famili look after them and they must not worri about money , food , insur and thing like that . older peopl who live on their own , perhap have an own famili and must earn the money to pay the live , have much more respons and often also worri . so enjoy life in thi situat is more difficult which is perhap a reason whi mani older peopl have problem do it . nevertheless i think especi as an older person who ha to manag life in so mani way it should be an aim to enjoy it at the same time or at least most of the time . onl then it is worth live .
