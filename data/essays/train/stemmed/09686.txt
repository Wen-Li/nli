the question about generalis or specif is a veri import topic becaus it is an ever last dicuss . my opinion on the question wether it is better to specialis or generalis is accord to the generalis , to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in thi text i will state my opinion by show the advantag in privat and offic live . the first reason support my view is have the possibl to see more differ aspect of a topic . imagin you are a leader of a firm . manag thi firm mean cooper with differ stakehold who have differ interest . when thi manag now ha a gener knowledg in differ academ subject he save a lot of time by understand what these stakehold want from him . for exampl when you speak with research you know a few thing they are talk about . second it is import to be abl to combin differ knowledg . thi possibl enabl you to solv a problem by your own . inst of alway ask peopl from differ sector you may be abl in some situat to get the solut by your own . thi is also an aspect for save money in a firm , by do thing on hi own instead of outsourc evert small task . the last reason for my opinion explain the advantag of broad knowledg in privat live . have a larg rang of knowledg you are automat interest in more thing . be interst in differ thing will help you to find more friend . and with these frind it is possibl to connect a network of reliabl person who will help you in the job or besid the job . these are a few reason that follow my opinion to be better wide spread educ then have onli a small rang of view . you can gain a lot of advantag get and use the knowledg out of mani differ academ sector .
