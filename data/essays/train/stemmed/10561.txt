most peopl agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem better than they realli are . through own experi and and earn knowlegd , peopl learn to differ between realiti and the promis of the `` commerci world '' . but still a lot of peopl get miss lead by the appear of product in advertis . i think that small compani do n't realli what their product to appear better than they are becaus they ca n't sell their product when they have promis someth complet differ . for exampl , the clean product doe n't do what it 's promot promis . onc you have bought thi product you will never buy it again becaus it 's wast money to invest in it . eventu you will tell your friend and they wo n't buy it either . it 's more effici for the compani of a smaller size to invent a product that is reliabl and peopl will buy thi particullar product more often . so the compani is abl to earn more money . in my oppinion the fals appear of product in advertis is a result of a wrong , overpromot and often use by big compani who sell more than one product . when big groceri store produc commer , their goal is to attract new costum . peopl do n't go to groceri store just to buy a singl appl . onc they are in the store they buy other thing which increas the profit of the compani . i think you ca n't realli gener that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it depend on the size of the compani , their promot abil , the moni a compani ha avail to spend on promot and the target age group . littl kid are more like to believ what commerci are promis than most of the grown-up who understand the concept of busi .
