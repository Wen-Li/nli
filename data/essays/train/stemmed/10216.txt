as the transport system ha develop , travel becam one form of enjoy for peopl . they may enjoy travel in a group led by a tour guid , or they may go in a group but without a tour guid . in my opinion , travel in a group without a guid would be the best way to travel becaus it is cheaper , and more enjoy . first of all , travel with a group , but without a guid is cheaper . in one case , i have a experi of travel with my famili and a guid , and it made think that hire a guid wa a wast . when i went to tokyo , japan for travel , the guid wa with us all the time . our famili had to pay her transport bill , lunch , and dinner . howev , if she were n't there , i could have ate more sushi . furthermor , on a newspap , there is alway a commerci about travel abroad . while i wa read it , it said that travel hawaii with a guid requir three hundr dollor more than without the guid . for these reason , sinc travel with a guid cost more money , i prefer travel without a guid . secondli , travel without a guid is way more interest . when there somebodi who take you everywher that one doe not have to open a map , it is meaningless . for exampl , when eugeni , a friend of mine , visit beij with her friend without a guid , she could know more about beij . she explain me where the great wall loacat and how to get there econom . by then , i realiz that travel without a guid is more excit sinc one can learn more . morov , when i went to kyungjyu with my whole classmat and our homeroom teacher as a tour guid sinc she wa born there , it wa bore . my teacher want to go to histor place and explain us about them , while student want to go to amus park and have more excit . thu , travel with a guid is never good . in conclus , i strongli believ that travel in a group led by a tour guid is not great . my experinc of travel japan , kyouju certain prove reason for whi . becaus travel with out a guid is more econom and excit , i think it is excel to travel onli in a group of peopl who i know .
