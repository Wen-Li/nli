first of all i agre onli partial with the statement abov , and in particulari i think it ca n't be consid an alway valid statment . i think that the problem is veri simpl : the statement can be consid true if we want to do a gener analys of the problem . it 's well known that advertis are done to tri to sell a certain product , and so if they are not convinc how can the productor sell them ? a second factor is that in the world we live now , we are complet submers by product of everi type , everi form , everi colour and everi brand , how could we choos one of them without advertis or explan of what the product is consist on ? i have also to admit that sometim the compani of media exager in tell lie , but is in the intellig of the person who have to buy someth to not believ in everyth they say , and first of all see the product with their eye , ask for inform about it , compar the price and the featur with that of the other product of the other compani , and final buy the object . gener i appli the way of think i explain abov , but i have to admit that sometim they captur me in their advertis ; i will give you an exampl : some month ago i had to go to london to improv my english languag , and when i had to book the flight i check on internet the differ possibl . flight sometim are veri expens , expeci for a young girl like me and so i rememb i had seen an advertis on a train in my citi of a veri low price compani of flight . then i found it on internet and book my flight at a veri surpris price ! onli 50 euro ! first i wa veri happi , but when i arriv at the aireport i had to paid 50 euro more for my luggag and 30 euro more for the overweight of my luggag !!! i wa veri veri veri angri and i decid i wo n't believ anymor in the futur in peopl who promit you someth without ask anyth !!
