work and be abl to special in today 's world is a veri big challeng . there are mani differ opcion and also a lot of peopl work in the same field , in my opinion is import to decid in which way should we face our carreer , and the advantag of have broad knowledg af mani academ subject and also the advantag of focuss in a secif subject . have knowledg of mani academ subject is a hard work , and if i decid to do thi , i would like to know deepli the thing i 'm studi , not just a simpl look , and thi could be veri difficult and hard . i realli admir peopl who do thi and are realli good at it . in my profess , i am a doctor , thi is a big challeng , and there are few doctor who realli know a lot about everyth and are realli good at their job . we have to consid that thi could take mani year of your life , becaus is not an easi thing to accomplish all that knoeledg . i think that the biggest advantag of thi opcion is the dedic , and all you get to know throug the year , but is not an easi opcion and it doe not alway get the recognit it deserv . be an scpecialist in one specif subject , in my opinion , is easier , eventhough there are subject that need a lot of dedic , time and a big effort too . i think is better to work in a more reduc field , to be good at a veri specif thing , in someth that other peopl is not focuss , so you will get the chanc to work more and in my case , have more pacient . thi is a big advantag , and you can studi and work hard in thi specif subject , learn everyth about it , thing that is veri difficult when you focuss in too mani subject . studyng is alway a good thing , and when you do thing you like is even better . i realli enjoy studi medic and now i enjoy work at the hospit with peopl . in my particular case , i think is better for me to be special in one specif subject in medicin , and i will work hard to be realli good about it , i want to do a lot of research about thi subject , so i 'm abl to know all i can about it .
