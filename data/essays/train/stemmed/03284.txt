young peopl usual cost lot of time on comput , cell phone and go out for fun besid school and work time . but i do n't think it mean they do not give enough time to help their commun . i think the commun ca n't separ form the common activ and peopl . young peopl can learn a lot in friend , comput and somth or someon they meet in life . for exampl , i alway cost a lot of time on comput and interenet . i met mani kind of peopl onlin i will not find at school . i alway can find new thing from them . and i can away get the news onlin when i want . but in the eye of other peopl , mayb i just play the comput all dat and do not give enough time to help my commun . that is whi i do not think young peopl they do not give enought time to help their commun . i think they just chang their way to do it .
