i would like to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . there are sever reason whi i prefer thi way . first , a fact can be more easili to use if you know the concept of it . if you do n't have ani idea about some fact , you ca n't go further step in order to improv your abil . for exampl , let 's say you know mani formula about math , but doe n't know how to use it . of cours it is realli import to know formula . but , when you have a math test , you will be confus becaus you have no idea what the formula mean . you 'll have varieti of fact , but you ca n't use it properli . by contrast , if you understand the concept of the formula , you know how and when to use it . secondli , if you know the concept of someth , it is easili to understand the fact . thi is becaus you feel comfort when you have some imag that are relat to the fact . i can say thi by use exampl from math formula again . if you have imag of basic formula , you should n't have hard time to memor mani formula at the same time . sometim i get confus when i encount to new rule we use in the math class . thi is becaus i do n't have a basic understand about formula , which mean i have no idea about it . when i know how to prove whi the formula can be use , i have deep idea about it , so it is not pain to memor it . also , if i know some background of these formula , i do well on the math exam . final , you can improv in some way by understand the concept . when i play golf , the ball curv from right to left . if i want to fix thi curv , i ca n't just shot million of ball until i could final make it straight . at first , i have to know whi and how a golf ball make a curv . thi part is the concept . onc i got some basic idea , now i can hit and tri some differ swing in order to make the ball straight .
