i definit agre with the statement . in my point of view . the willing and determin on tri new thing and take risk are signific the the success peopl . there are coupl of reason to support my view . to begin with , i think noth is imposs . to make my point clearer , i mean sometim if you do not tri new thing , you would not know you actual can achiev the goal . for my own experi , i had attend an outward bound cours last summer . everyon were forc to take a harsh task . that wa to jump into the sea on the ship . everyon wa shock as that time as i rememb . but in the end , all the member , includ myself did finish the task . we were all so proud of ourselv . to other peopl , it seem noth to them . but in our heart , we knew that it wa onc a success experi we had . apart from that , take risk is a must for you to succeed . everyth do exist a risk . in my own experi , as i would like to improv my badminton skill in order to compet for an award in a competit , i had pay extra effort on my daili practis befor i have the competit . what is so riski to me is that , practis much more time than other normal day would have a greater chanc to get injur . at the end , of cours i did n't get hurt , but it pave the way to my succeed-th champion of that competit . final , i would like to rais one more exampl . that is the man who invent microsoft . when he wa studi hi first year in the univers , he decid to left school and concentr on develop the idea of microsoft . he wa oringin alreadi good at comput and to fulfilm hi dream , he ignor the risk of ca n't graduat in the univers . and of cours , hi develop on the softwar wa so success that almost everyon were use the softwar he invent . to conclud , if you think you ca n't achiev a goal without tri and take risk , you will definit not to be succeed in your futur .
