with new use invent or work method someon can make much money in less time . the question is , if thi person need tu be riski or not - or if someon who doe it the old `` normal '' way , could not succeed . first of all in my opinion everybodi can be veri success in everi littl job or thing he doe . if he want to , he will do good and will not need some new way or risk to work it out with more success . he perhap will last longer for that thing he want to reach but he will reach the end much more safer . if you dare more like other compani , do not mean that you risk more . you can check and doubl check and if your idea is not good , you can tri again . in modern world nobodi will throw a new product on market without sever test of custom . everybodi tri to reduc the risk to a minimum . on the other side a realli new idea need a big start amount . thi big investit doe not guarante the profit and the success . thi of cours could then open a door to a higher level of money but is veri riski , becaus nobodi can say , if peopl will accept the new product or not . in the fast chang internet and mobil world , often you just have to be the faster one and thi person . new invent like ebay are abl to have million of custom , it is just the idea , that count . in conclus i think it is not necessari for a new compani to be riski or to dare too much . first of all you have to check the guarante of success and if the idea of the compani is good , the success will come in a much more safer way .
