i disagre with thi statement . i think that car is veri import for our life . some peopl who live in conveni citi do n't care to noth car but local peopl do n't think so . for exampl , `` shop '' . recent , mani shop moal and big supermarket are locat in the place where is far from citi or inconveni place . if those peopl do n't have a car , they can not go shop anywher . and local place dose n't have mani train .
