i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis are to help the compani to commerci their own product to peopl , to make better profit out of it for themselv . then with that fact , it is obviou that they should make the product seem much better so that peopl would buy it more . i myself , and everyon might have experienc it at least onc in their life , that whenev you go to restur or stop at the food place , you will see all these pictur of the food in the menu . they all seem veri delici and look nice , but sometim it doe not tast or look as what you expect it to be . advertis doe thi to make you eat their food , which will help them to make money for themselv . no one will want to wast their money by purchas anyth wrong or bad . peopl look for better and good one 's for themselv , therefor , advertis tri to show best abil out of the product as much as they can . sometim even by make up the fact that realli doe n't refer to the actual product , they compeat with other compani to sell more of their product than other 's . in my opinion , it is understand that they do thi . sinc we alreadi know that most of product are commerci and exaggur in a better and good way by the advertis , we could avoid buy ani fake or bad product . plu , it actual feel better for us to buy someth that ha more fanci and nicer advertis than the one that are not veri commerci . becuas by that we could know if the compani is well and rich enough to support the product , which again will tell us that compani ha been make good profit for themselv by a lot of peopl who ha been buy their product . therefor , i agre the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are which is true and understand in mani way .
