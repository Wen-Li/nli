in my opinion , it is import to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . the first point of my argument is that you often do not know which subject or topic you mainli prefer when you are interesst in mani thing . when you want get a broad knowledg you do n't have to chose earli in which kind of direct you later get a job . anoth point to support my opinion is , that when you later get a job you can work more flexibl with the knowledg in more subject . so , you can work not onli in one part of a compani . for exampl , when you are onli studi economi you get probabl a job in the bureau . but when you are studi english or ani other foreign languag addict to economi , you probabl work as a salesman or get a job in other countri too and not onli in germani . and if your compani need specialist for some kind of project they are go to start , you can get less difficultli thi knowledg by go to even school or someth like that . it 's more difficult to expand your knowledg when you are special onli in one subject . so you are not abl to work in thi project , becaus you need too much time to get more knowledg about a foreign subject . the most import reason whi a broad knowledg is more import than to special in one subject is , that you more easili secur your job . when the compani ha to leav one complet part of the compani and you probabl are in it , you have no more chanc to work for thi compani in the futur . but with more qualif you can still work in anoth section of your old compani .
