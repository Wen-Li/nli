accord to my opinion it is better to special in one specif subject than have a broad knowledg of mani subject becaus of the follow reason . firstli , a person is expos to differ kind of subject in the elementari school to help him understand hi interest . for exampl , i like biolog in my high school . so i chose to becom a doctor . so , i concentr more on biolog so that it help me when i start my graduat cours in medicin . so , i had good knowledg about ` cell ' and ` reproduct ' than algebra or geometri . even though i had to studi other subject , my idea about them wa just to improv my gener knowledg and not to go in depth . secondli , i would like to mention that if a person speacial in one particular subject , their is more room for growth and improv . such a person will not be lost in the bundl of differ varieti of subject , he will not be confus in hi approach to the subject . he might aswel do good research on the particular subject and write sever book and conduct mani seminar to share hi knowledg . if a person is not a specialist in a particular subject , he may not be in a posit to explor and invent new thing in ani subject , as the say goe `` jack of all trade but master of none '' . emin peopl world over are be recognis for thier meritori work in a particular field and not for their work in differ field . we all studi to contribut someth to the societi god ha gift everi indivdu with some hidden talent in a psrticular field and we need to reconis them befor it too late . conclud , i would like to say that `` it alway better to be a lion in the jungl than an ant in a coloni '' . i will alway choos to special in one subject than have a braod knowledg of mani academ subject .
