young peopl often wonder about their futur , question if they will be happier when they get old . in gener , older peopl live happier life than the young . first point that i want to address is that the older peopl are more stabl emot as peopl becom matur as a human be , they would not be temper as quickli as they use to be . we discov that it is meaning to be agress . for exampl , i hate everyon at school when i wa in middleschool . howev , when i read to kill a mock bird , a novel , i start to realiz that it is wrong to hate someon with no reason second , older peopl live happier life by manag or overcom their hardship easili . there are time of desper and sad in our live . to prevail frustrat is veri import to avoid depress and anger , but young peopl usal doe not have abil to do so . statist conduct on 2006 show that there were averag thirti student for a day who commit sucid becaus of their academ pressur . it is rel bigger averag rate than of adult , while it is not ture that student bare more stress than adult . the last thing i have discov is that older peopl appreci thing in their life more . my grandmoth know how to appreci small thing in her life such as sunshin , food , and hous ; it seem that she get happi everi moment in her life . in contrast , young peopl tend to be careless and neg . they say `` cool '' onli when there is a realli nice thing . in conclus , older peopl tend to have happier life . by mangag frustrat , emot stabil , and appreci of life abl them to be happi in everi aspect of live .
