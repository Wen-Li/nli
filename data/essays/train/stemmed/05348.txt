i did not agre with thi statement . actual , i give more valu to fact . i think without know fact , one can not analyz idea or concept . then you will onli memori , not understand . if you realli want to learn the idea and concept about sth , first you should learn all the fact about it . then you can be readi to understand and discuss both the given idea and concept . howev , i understand the reason behind thi . as everybodi , the student want get good mark without studi hard . that whi we choos to learn onli the thing that will be ask to us . if they ask to write the idea and concept instead of let 's say argu thi concept or state whether you approv or disapprov thi and that idea , natur a student pay no attent to learn the fact . obvious , he or she will prefer to memori the idea and concept about a subject and then he or she will get a good mark . that 's what i have face mani time when i wa at high school . thi wa the first reason actual . the second reason is that mani resourc do not cover enough fact , mostli they embrac the result or the consequ . there is not a chanc to cover all of the fact . the student choos learn idea and concept due to the educ system . they teach us how to memori not to discuss .
