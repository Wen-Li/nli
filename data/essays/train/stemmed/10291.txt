i agre with the idea which more and more young peopl lose their interest toward commun work or voluntari work . then i wonder who is respons for that . of cours young peoel have respons by themselv . everytim i go out in tokyo , i see mani young peopl who throw their gabbish on the street without ani consider . i wonder have they ever thought about cleenig crew who mostli work voluntarilli . i also see mani young peopl sit on prioriti seat in front of elderi peopl or handicaped-person on the train . they usual chat with their friend loudli or talikg on the cell-phon . i think these behavior exactli mirror the younger 's attitud toward commun work or voluntari work . i blame japanes younger , howev , i think japanes govern also have a respons for today 's trend which young peopel do not give enough time to help their commun . basic , japanes school do not requir student to work at their commun or to joinn voluntari work and there are no class about how imporatnt help commun is . those lack make yound peopl lose their interest in commun work . lastli , i also think commun itself have a respons for young peopl . i am sure that young peopl do not spend enough time on commun work , howev , i want to ask the commun that they have help ani young peopl or gave them advic in the commun . unless commun and young peopl find out the way that they support and help each other , there is no way that thi situat will be chang . i think major of young peopl do not give them time to help other in their commun . howev , i also know some young peopl are eager to work for their commun onli becaus they want to contribut their commun . i think young peopl just have not realiz how worth it is . if everybodi will chang in order to their commun better , i beliv that the number of young peopl who join commun work will incres .
