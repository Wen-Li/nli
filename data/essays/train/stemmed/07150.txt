in the time of humboldt who develop the idea of an ideal educ system that is univers in natur and combin both natur and human scienc subject , a broad knowledg of mani academ subject wa a true valu . today , by contrast , we can observ an increas special and academ educ becom more and more focus , almost narrow mind , train peopl from the start onli for a specif subject . while i would agre that given the amount of knowledg avail on specifi issu and the scarciti in the labour market , it is import to be veri knowledg in one particular field . be a true expert is import in order to be abl to compet with other peopl in the same field and to enhanc knowledg and promot progress in research on that special field . howev , specialist should not loos sight of the context in which they carri out their work and should alway be awar of the broader social , econom and polit implic their result may have . to give an exampl , one could think of the physicist or engin that contribut to the develop of nuclear energi . they sure need a veri high level of expertis and an equal focus educ to be abl to perform sucess in their task . at the same time , they should be the most far-sight individu , awar of the respons the bear given the social , polit and environment risk their work might impli . even the most special expert who is concern with highli complex calculu or abstract reflexion should be educ enough and suffici involv in mundan issu to keep in perspect the context in which they carri out they work . therefor , i belief that a specialist educ that focus on a specif subject from earli on should alway be complement by a fundament ( not special ) educ about the need of societi , the complex of polit relationship and philosoph and ethic consider .
