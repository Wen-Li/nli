i agre that most advertis realli make product seem much better than the product realli are , and that is whi peopl make the advertis for their product becaus they want to sell them for money . businessmen do not care about other peopl ' right , onli thing they just want is money , money , and money . athough some product which are made by famou compani are actual pretti great , but most of product are not as well as the adertis shown . i still rememb when i wa a child , i saw a veri cool advertis of a toy , but my parent told me i should not buy that becaus the real thing is imposs as well as the advertis said . i disagre with them and final bought the toy which i want at that time . after i got home , i wa so excit and opend it without take off my shoe , and i found out i wa wrong . it wa the worst toy i had ever seen befor . i felt so sad . i wa cri for whole night . after that time , i do not believ those beauti advertis . i think it reali dishonst for peopl who bought these product . the businessmen make the advertis which are too differ from the real thing . it is fine for me if there is onli a littl differ between the product and advertis . but sadlli most of advertis for the product are too `` wonder '' which make me think it is imposs to be . i reali hate those advertis , but that is how the thing work , i could not chang that . i think in the furtur there will still be a lot of peopl buy those amaz product , and they would understand and learn a new lession , `` do not trust those dadvertis anymor .
