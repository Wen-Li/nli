in my opinion in twenti year we will see more and more car than we can see today . today we have big pollut and enviroment problem and we experi everi year dramat disast but actual i think that thi would n't stop the trend to have even more car circul around the world . i am not happi about thi , i am onli realist . emerg countri like china and india , that were realli poor ani year ago , are now growh incred fast and they need a lot of resours and transport . they do n't care ( for the moment ) about pollut problem , they want car . for the moment i do n't see a valid altern to car . it could be that in futur we will assist at a chang in the materi that give the power to our car . the oil resourc is anoth import problem theseday but the technolog progress is run fast and mayb in twenti year we will put water in the fuel tank . someon could think that with the spread use of comput an the presenc everywher of the internet we dont'ne anymor to go away
