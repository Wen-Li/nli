i actual disagre with thi statement . i 'm a young girl and i want to spend some word support boy and girl of my own age , in fact we are not so bad as peopl say , we spend time do social work and help our comun too . i want to give an exempl : in my own town there are almoust 3,500/4000 person , i live in a small town , but we 've got a sever number of old men and women which need help for hous work , do shop , have friendli relationship . .. etc . .. becaus they are alon , mayb without wife or hausband anymor , so a group of young boy and girl , 20 year ago , made a group , the name is `` let 's meet again '' which is made of young peopl , specif nephew and niec , that want to spend more time with their grandpar , but also they want to let them meet each other : togeth we can learn a lot of thing . thi group wa work from 1983 , and the most beautiful thing is that old men and women are veri happi to meet new peopl , to tell stori in which they often recogn each other , to have a good time dure the weekend ; on the other hand all the young peopl are veri happi and satisfi to learn a lot of new thing of their 's granpar life , of their job , of their love . .. mayb divid by the second world war ! sometim grandmath teach us littl hous work that nobodi know anymor and grandfath tell about how strang it wa to get marriag with a woman they absolutli did n't know . .. they are veri nice and thi is a pretti good way for guy to learn about love relationship . .. they understand how import is to be free to meet a person and to be abl to know each other as much as possibl befor get marriag . i think that thi is a way to help a comun and to do the greatest school of life !
