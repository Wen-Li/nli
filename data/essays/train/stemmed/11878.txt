the statement whether there will be fewer car in use than there are today in the next twenti year is a controversi one . on one hand , the number of car are bound to increas sinc spend power of peopl is increas which enabl them to buy car . on the other hand , it may be possibl that there will be a vast reduct in the number of car due to lack of resourc which drive the car i.e. gasolin . howev , i believ that the number of car in next two decad are go to increas . one reason for my belief is that the eas with which a consum can buy a car in today 's world . even if the consum is short on cash , he can easili buy the car on instal , a facil which is provid by most of the showroom . moreov , bank also play a big role in purchas of car by introduc auto loan which enabl their custom to borrow the money from bank and pay them later with easi instal with margin interest rate . anoth reason for my belief is that the human in today 's world are look for comfort . gone are the day where peopl believ in physic workout to make sure that they stay fit . today 's gener hold the thought that comfort is the best pleasur of life . with such ideolog , it highli like that each individu would like to own a car for hi comfort . not onli own a car lead to comfort , it also consid as a part of ` statu symbol ' in our societi . peopl own luxuri car are given a high statu in the societi wherea peopl own no car are gener look down upon . if a person doe not own a car then mani peopl form the opinion that he is not financi stabl which is whi he can not afford to buy a car . perhap the best reason for my belief is that even though there is go to be shortag of gasolin in come year , scientist are continuouslli tri to come up with altern sourc which can drive the car . mani such invent have alreadi taken place such as a solar power car which get it fuel from the sun 's ray or a batteri power car . although these car are not widespread in use as of yet but it a great possibl that they will be wide in use in the come decad . in addit , there is also no restrict impos by ani govern in the world on ownership on number of car which lead the consum in buy of car without worri about break ani law . that is whi we see mani famili own more than one car . thu , the abov reason substanti my disagr with the statement .
