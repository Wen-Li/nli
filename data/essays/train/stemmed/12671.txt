for me , travel is alway good and pleasant . everi time i can , i go to as mani place i can afford to go . but if i had to choos , there would be some point to review in order to make a decit . sometim or some place are more like to be visit alon , with your own itinerari . you can eat whenev and wherev you want , you can spend as much time as you want in an attract and you are entir free to visit all the place you like . the statement made befor may seem a great idea , you are free to decid evertyt ! , but peopl may exceed the limit of thi freedom so the whole trip can result in an unpleas experi . when thing are not appropri plane , you may spend a lot of time in onli one place and at the end you might skeep some import place that you would 've like to visit . when travel in a group with a tour guid you have the whole trip plan and , for exampl , if you go to europ alon and you get so excit about the eiffel tower that you spend almost two week in pari , when go with a group the time to stay in such a beauti citi is a week , you have alreadi lost a complet week that could 've been great in itali . that kind of thing make the group tour more effect for long trip . anoth advantag of take a tour is that you will be explaind about all the detail of the place you visit . when you go alon you may not know for exampl , that in the mayan pyramid in chichen-itza you can draw a snake by walk around it . personali , for short trip or trip i do with my boyfriend it 's best to go alon becaus of the freedom of time i get to have . but if it is a long trip and i want to visit as mani place as i can in a short time , a guid tour would deffinit be the best option .
