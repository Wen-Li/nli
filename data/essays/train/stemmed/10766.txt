i disagre with thi statement becaus there are a lot of way to travel . you can travel alon or with a gruop , with a guid or without guid , all of these depend of the motiv of your trip . i think the best way to travel will depend of the motiv of your trip . mayb if you want to expend so time quit to relax yourself or mayb to medit , you will prefer travel alon without guid . the motiv in that kind of trip is onli relax and have a good time . some peopl need these time , in thi rush societi where all the thing pass veri fast . some poepl need space to enjoy and have time to theirselv . for these reason i believ if you decid have your time the best way to travel is alon . but in other way is you want enjoy and take a trip for educ reason you will choos go with a group and guid . the guid will give direct and inform you about the place you will go . in thi ocas i think the best way to travel is in group becaus in the group you can share idea , inform and you can learn in social enviro . other exampl that ilustr my point is thi : supos two men decid make a trip for el yunqu ( forest in puerto rico ) . the motiv of the first person is have a good time with friend and explor all the forest , but hte motiv of the second person is pass a good time read in the high of the mountain . the first person will agre that the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid , but the second person will agre that the best way to travel is been alon , without guid . for me thi exampl ilustr my point . thi statement depend directli for the motiv or the intent of the trip . i could n't decid until i can figur whi i want make thi trip . perhap i decid that the decis depend of your motiv , most of the time i choos travel in group and in my experi a enjoy a lot when i travel in group . for me is great go with my friend to other contri to explor . thi is my experi but in conclus i agre with thi statemen : `` the best way to travel is travel that are accomplish with your motiv '' .
