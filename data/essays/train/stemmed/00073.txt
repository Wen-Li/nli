travel around the world is a veri interest and educ experi . in order to fulli enjoy the trip , we should decid wether to travel alon or in a group led by a tour guid . actuallti , i prefer such organ tripe rather than travel by my self for sever reason . the first reason is the posit impact of have a tour guid . tour guid are veri well educ about the histor , and cultur background of the place the group is visit . therefor , the tourist get more knowledg and deep explan of what they see , especi in histor attract . as the result , the trip becom much valiabl . for exampl , i travel to a great histor place in egypt and the tour guid wa veri help to explain everi tini detail of the templ . i think i would have not been abl to get such huge amount of inform if i just travel alon . anoth advantag of have a tour guid is that he or she can help tourist find good place for shop by suggest certain shop area . the second reason is the advantag of have a group . peopl from differ countri , background , and experi are travel togeth doe have a posit impact . for exampl , i had a trip two year ago with a group and i learn alot from them talk about their countri and the best place they saw in other trip . i gain valuabl inorm about place i want to go and had not enough inform to help me . moreov , i can benefit from a group rate while go for shop with the organ trip . the price will be cheaper , so that i can buy more thing . in conclus , travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel . spend the trip with experienc tour guid as well as a whole group of peopl , will give a great oppportun to learn more in an inform and interest environ . the trip will be diffenitli more valuabl if it is spent with such great accompani .
