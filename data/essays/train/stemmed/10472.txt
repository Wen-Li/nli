travel by a tour guid or alon ? some peopl prefer the former while other prefer the latter . to each hi own . howev i am a person who like to travel alon , therefor i am disagre with the statement for the reason below . first of all , in these kind of tour , the guid usual give gener or most interest inform - accord to them of cours - and do not state detail which i may like . therefor i like to have my own book about thi certain place and travel with them and read detail inform which are interest for ` me` . for instanc , while i wa travel around the western europ , i had these book which gave me extrem suffic inform about the place i have seen . secondli , you can take your time when you are travel alon , howev you do not have opportun to spend your time effici when you are travel by a tour guid . therefor you usual do not have time to examin the place that you travel , moreov you do not feel them sinc there is pressur of the guid becaus they just want to finish the tour and get their money as soon as possibl . for exampl , in the same trip i mention befor , i had an experi like that . the guid finish 30 minut tour in 10 minut , use the hot weather excus and then i never attemp to go a trip by a guid . last but not the least , by travel on your own , you have the flexibl of choos place which you do not have if you take a all includ trip . so you would not face to travel all over the place which you do not like or even hate . becaus it is wast of time and money . trerefor spend your energi for the place that you like is more sensibl . to sum up , peopl who like to gain gener inform and like to see most interestingli claim place in a time like blink your eye , should prefer guid tour . howev i prefer travel alon becaus of the flexibl of time and possibl of choos place and the detail inform .
