i disagre with the follow statement . i think that there will be more car then it use to be in twenti year for the follow reason . first , i believ that develop countri and citi will get an increas of their car in a few year . for instanc , prospect of mexico or sao paolo demonstr that the traffic will get bigger and intens in a few year . more peopl are goin in my opinion , car tend to be a symbol and will still be a symbol of wealthi and success peopl . second , even if oil price are get up and oil reserv are diminish , peopl will never stop use their car . for exampl , in the united-st peopl can not live without car becaus public transport have not been develop adquat by the govern . it is necessari for a middl class familli to possess one or two car and they use it on a daili base . third , even if oil reserv are be reduc , scientist tri alreadi to find some alternativ to petrol . in fact bio-carbur will be prehap the new carbur for our car . now , new kind of carbur that are made of bee or other cropswil interest car concession . final , i think that if we do not find ani altern to move from one citi to anoth , car will still be use a lot even in twenti year .
