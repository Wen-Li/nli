our world develop rapidli nowaday . car , build and other thing around us chang from time to time , some time for better and some time for wose , i think that in twenti year the world will have major chang , especi in the transfom technolog . i agre on the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the car technolog is impov rapidli and each year we hear about more develop version of the car , howev , nowaday peopl are concern about the inviron and how car can affect it neg . so , alogsid the develop , i think that car manifactur will take thi problem into account and think about creativ way to prevent inviron problem and solv them , such as : pollut . in my predict , i see the world in an optimist eye twenti year from now , i think that car will be replac by less harmful transform devic , such as : a develop vesion of a bike or even skate . there is also a possibl that car factori may creat car with wing or small air-plain which will keep the car off the earth . anoth reason whi i think that there will be fewer car in use , is the economi and the oil price . the demand on oil will increas which will make it 's price increas , the high proce of oil may make peopl think of other transport devic . plu , the oil resourc may stop produc , becaus their is a possiblti that oil may finish in the futur and car depend on oil in order to run . in conlus , i tottali agre on the fact that car in use will be fewer in twenti year , and i believ that it is an advantag for our world as well as our inviron .
