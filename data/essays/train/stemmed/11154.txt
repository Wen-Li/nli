thi topic is not easi to answer directli . depend on the person experi , everybodi will have the differ answer . some peopl will agre meanwhil some will disagre instead . in my point of view , travel in a group led by a tour guid or by themselv is relat to the condit and person abil at ani rate . both to travel in a group led by a tour guid and go trip on their own have countless advantag . im my opinior , i would like to travel along when i am abov 20 year old . it is becaus that i can enjoy the trip in the process not onli the result . for exampl , i can choos the bike-trip and go anywher i would like to go in china . i can stay more time when i have been interest in it . i can go to the place the tour guid will not lead us to go . i think it is the strongest point the peopl will choos to travel by themselv . the most essenti advantag is that dure the trip , we can improv our skill and abil learn from the school and out of the school . i think have a trip on your own is a unforgett in your life . in contrast , i think it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid when i am just a student . there is no doult that the tour guid will arrang all the thing dure the trip such as where we live , what we eat , where we should go and when we should spend money . it is easi for us to follow . the most signific advantag is that befor the trip , we do n't need to do ani work about the trip and make a schedual . it is a comfort way and conveni for us to have a trip . howev travel in a group led by a tour guid have a lot of advantag , you also can choos travel on your own . it is up to you .
