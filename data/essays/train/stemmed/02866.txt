i disagre intwenti yeat there will be more car in use than there ae today . in moderen countri such as japan they still use cara even they have new modren metroo and transption > aslo yung guyt like to putt it in accat mostli so they like to drive not driven or buy use some sort of new teghnalg that do n't have . in countri such saudi arebia where i am from . we still do'nt have metrro so ido n't think that car will be fewer use of it . becus it take a long time to make road for mettero and line btween citi . so not in twenti year do n't think so . car have alot of use so if they gone to replc car with some new thing it not gio to take twenti year it will take more that . so peopl will still use car i htink not just for the in twenti five or mybe more than that . also compani that amk car are go like a wind i nthe market of car peaopl are wate for the newer in ever year so the butter car look from how strong or the shaepd of it the size peopl will still have to buy it . so ithink big compni are awar if in twent year that if peopl stop use car somthin would came up . i iwoul say the will be more car use then ever in that past that for a fact becus peopl will be more than naw . so do n't think about been fewer car in use inth fetur . there no picter for the fetur what we use to redos the use of car i mean think about go to skool with what use a bu or mettro no way not good at all .
