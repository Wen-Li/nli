first of all , there ha to be a definit of `` young '' and `` old '' . a twenty-year old person will consid himself as be `` old '' when he compar hi age to that of a newborn . on the other hand , a 70 year-old person will think of the 20 year old person as be `` young '' . i assum that the statement on the left think of peopl in their twenit or thirti as `` young peopl '' and that senior at the age of around 60 are refer to as `` old peopl '' . i believ that it is imposs to make a `` ye '' or `` no '' decis on that question . of cours , the gener idea of `` enjoy life '' is that of have parti , drink alcohol , make new friend and not have ani concern about the futur . all of these activ are much more typic of younger peopl than of older peopl . younger peopl simpli do n't spend too much time think about the futur , they `` live for the moment '' . in that regard , the statement on the left is right . onc peopl have grown , they tend to take on more respons and duti in their life . older peopl have to suppli some financi incom , mayb not onli for themselv , but also for their famili . they have to take care of their social life which seem a lot more complic than in the younger day , and they might also have grow concern about their health . all of these factor do n't realli make it `` fun '' to be older . on the other hand , be old also mean be wiser . when you 've reach a certain age , you are abl to defin the true valu of life . and gener , these valu are not parti , alcohol or superfici friendship . the true valu are much more intim . they are in thing like have one best friend , be reward at work or just be love by your partner or your kid . have a love wife for exampl can be the best `` fun '' you 'll ever have in your life , although peopl normal would n't call it `` fun '' , but `` fullfil '' instead . but thi detail would lead to anoth discuss about the definit of `` fun '' . my conclus is , that - just as life doe - the definit of `` enjoy life '' chang dure the year of a lifetim .
