i think that it is more import for the student to learn the idea and the concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason of idea and the concept are more import is that learn a certain subject will be much easier to be understand by student . student have differ way that they learn . some of them learn from fact , but most of them learn from idea and the concept . most of the time the fact can be difficult to understand . teacher can teach the student the basic idea and the concept in order to understand easili and quickli . for instanc , the first few week in my govern class my teacher taught by use fact , but most of the time , mani fact were confus to me . then , i ask my friend for help , but most of my frind that i ask were confus on mani govern system . after , i talk to my teacher on where i wa confus on and the way he taught us . i request to him to chang how he taught the class and he did the next day . my teacher use the fundament of idea and the concept of the whole structur of govern system and law . i learn mani valueabl and interest inform that i did not know . also , my teacher made thi subject easi to understand and more entertain so that all of hi student can focu and get interest into thi subject . if my teacher did not use the fundament of idea and the concept , i would not understand the whole structur of govern system and the govern system and law . in conclus , learn the idea and the concept is more import for the student than it is for them to learn fact . from my eperi , use idea and the concept can , not just fact , improv learn skill . class taught with use idea and concept can be more understand .
