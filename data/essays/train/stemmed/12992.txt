i do agre with the point that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . at thi point of time i would like to cite a veri famou song ' we will rock you ' that prove to me that youth is full of energi , zeal , mischief and livlihood . these all make a young person excit and make him readi to take on the world . when a girl or boy reach a stage to be call young then hi / her parent start give freedom to them which they welcom and like most . when they do not work or get marri they depend on their parent and studi for their aim . thi make them full of enthusiasm which old peopl lack as they had alreadi been to a stage where they can not think of make their career and becom dispirit . in young day one ha lot mani friend to play with , to roam , watch movi and share their view which most of the time a person in old age miss . parti , sport , gossip , food and excurs are all part of the life in young day . with old age peopl start loos their bodi strength and they get overload with respos which young never care in their time . an earn old person have to think about hi famili befor take dicis . he ha to abid of the state law of tax and ha to pay attent to their young for their futur . they need to laid the foundat for the life of their children . young peopl work for the thing they want and when they achiev they find themselv much more happi than anyon els . when they reach in their profession life they start earn and with the money they purchas the thing which they thought of in childhood . so young peopl have an advantag to enjoy life more than anyon els and the reason lie behind the freedom and veri few respos . but as these respos their action get affect with them and their freedom start decreas . with age they becom respos and seroiu with veri less enjoy in life .
