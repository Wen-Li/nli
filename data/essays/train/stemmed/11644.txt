most advertis actual do make a product seem better then it actual is when it is bought and in use . the question we have to ask is not if thi is a posit or neg fact but whi do compani do such thing . in today mostli capitalist economi with a free market one ha a wide rang of offer in each segment of the market . it doe not matter if someon is look just for a bottl of shower-gel or a new tv , the custom ha mani product to choos from . an interest fact in thi matter is that with an advanc sociti the product-life-span is get smaller and smaller . thi fact make strong advertis necessari to be success on a market . furthermor more we have to think about the way we are think as a custom . we all know the situat where we go out to buy our normal suppli of food and toiletri . we are stand in front of that huge shelf of shower-gel and are not abl to decid which of the hundr choic we are suppos to buy . each of them offer us the best skin or the smoothest hair after use them . we tend though to be buy a product we are most familiar with . there two way we are get familiar with a product . the far most common way of becom familiar with a product is to use it , if we are satisfi with it , in our exampl it is the fiction shower-gel `` awe '' . we have been use awe now for month alreadi and got use to buy it at the store with out contempl in front of the shelf . now the second waz of get familiar with a product is come into play . the onli way we might leav our satisfi product awe is if we get familiar with anoth product , and thi is where advatis is come handi for compani . while we see ad on billbord and in tv we are get familiar with it and to go and buy the product we have to think that is better then awe , so adversi make us think it is better , so we buy it . i agre with thi custom to an extend .
