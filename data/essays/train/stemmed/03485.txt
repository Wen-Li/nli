i agre . young peopl sould spend more time to help their commun . in thi essay , i would like to present my idea about young peopl nowaday should spend more time to help their commniti . befor argu about thi issu , the definit of `` enough '' should be state . how much work is enough ? i believ the answer should not be some actual number but a right attitud or a correct worthvalu of help other . young peopl should undertand the mean of societi , the neccess of societi for human psycholog and acut need , and how societi are construct . onc thi attitud is aquir , then it would be `` enough . '' in past fifti year , individualizm is emphas in most cultur . consequ , young peopl nowaday onli care about themselv . their parent do not teach them to help other activ . the school they go do not ask them to pay attent to the peopl in need . even the govern spend littl money on the chariti agenc . could one imagin what kind of soicieti wil we live in when young peopl nowaday becom the leader of our planet ? thu , a heart to care about other is veri import . individualizm should not be understood as isol from peopl . instead , it should be everi one can have the abil to work individu , but also to work with other to creat a better environ or societi . in these two decad , some leader of a busi start to promot `` the spirit of team work . '' thi show that more and more peopl realiz the import of work as a team , in other word , as a commun . each one of us is a tini littl part of a bigger unit , like a famili . mani famili construct a commin . mani commun build up a countri . a countri is simpli a bigger commun . to learn how to be respons to one 's countri , one should learn how to be respons to their commniti . in conclus , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commniti . they should spend more time to help other . it start with develop right worthvalu and right attitud .
