i think the knowledg of a lot pf subject form the cultur of each peopl . a person with a certain cultur who is involv in a discuss , is abl to speak with other of sever issu . thi mean to avoid ignor , and with thi fact mani purpos can be achiev . someon who ha a knowledg of mani subject can speak of everyth , not feel submit to anyon becaus of lack of inform , or becaus he doesn \ t know what to say . thi mean peopl to feel more secur of themselv . it is interest to enlarg the knowledg of a subject more and more , but it isn \ t alway possibl becaus of time and cost . so a person who is special onli in a particular subject can speak onli about that , feel ignor about the rest . it is also interest to improv the knowledg of sever subject in order to form our person and to find alway other thing to disvcov . if you onli know a specif subject you don \ t know veri much what surround you . with the knowledg of onli one subject , you know a littl , if you know less specif mani subject , you know a lot . it is interest to underlin that a wide cultur , the knowledg of mani subject , also give peopl a sort of common sens , give the faculti to understand properli what happen around them , someth like conscious . in fact the most advanc countri have a school system that goe through the knowledg of a lot of subject , and onli after that they have someth improv the skill that regard each person futur work . first of all you have to give the basi , then you can build someth specif on them . if there \ s a lack of basi , there won \ t be anyth els .
