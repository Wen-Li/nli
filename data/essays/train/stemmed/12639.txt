i emphat disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . youth is a time of insecur and uncertain , of tremend pressur to carv a name for oneself and succeed . one often hear about teenag or young profession take their own life on account of fear of failur . youngster are often too full of angst to enjoy themselv . they have to face peer pressur which may detract them from pursuit of their own happi . on the other hand , older or matur peopl are more sure of themselv and clearer about what they want in life . they are also awar about the limit time span that each of us have on thi earth . they learn to enjoy each momemt to the fullest . with matur peopl are better abl to withstand peer pressur and make decis base on what they want rather than on other peopl 's expect of what they should be do . matur also bring a sens of accept of what one is and what one is not ( in term of capabl ) . accept of oneselv can be a truli liber experi and open door toward pursuit of one 's call or special aptitut . age often bring financi secur enabl one to explor one 's dream , hobbi and hidden ambit . the older peopl are also better network social and contribut member of their commun - thi posit impact their self esteem . i met anjali , a retir banker in my italian class . she wa the most enthusiast of all student and end up top the class . post retir she wa fulli explor her love of languag and make full use of resourc such as time and money avail . she alreadi knew german and wa plan to studi next level of italian . when i met her after a year of pass out of italian livello i , she wa alreadi through with her livello iii and enrol in a french class . her zest for life is truli infecti . in summat i would state that older peopl are much more capabl of enjoy and they often do enjoy their life more than youngster do .
