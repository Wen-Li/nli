in my opinon i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis are use to educ and promot product audio visual . product are use to educ consum about their benefit and usag and also it side effect . the use of audio - visual method have advanc over the year and to an extent with the help of digit technolog . for exampl , action figur in children 's toy are shown to be move and fight on their own and kid want those toy which move and interact . but when you buy them they are to be physic move and the children have to do the voic over and pretend . so practic one buy a product by the imag creat through advertis . the color and the textur and the light in which it is project make the product look enhanc . for exampl furnitur , the advertis show the same product in a perfect enviorn it tempt you immedi to replac your exist furnitur but when you actual person feel the wood it chip or it not as desir as it look are not that rich as advertis . it could be true with plastic , fabric even ingredi like color in food use to enhanc the product to promot sale but in realiti it not that good . henc i believ that most advertis make product seem much better for they actual are .
