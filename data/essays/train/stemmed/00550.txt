i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowdledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , becaus today a special is more use than a broad knowdledg . howev , it depend on the kind of job you want to do ; for a children 's teacher , for exampl , perhap it is better to have a broad knowledg . if you are special in one specif subject , onli you and other few peopl are abl to understand thi subject in deep , and so some peopl will look for you and your knowdledg . think about me : i am studi materi scienc and engin ; i have n't a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , but if someon ha problem concern with materi , i am the person for him and i will be pay lot of money for my suggest . thu , special is a good way to have better chanc in find work . otherwis you must n't be an ignor in the other subject , becaus you are requir to know what are you talk about , when you are speak with anoth person . for exampl , if someon speak to me about gear or engin at work , i have to know how they work properli , more or less . also if someon ask me an inform about an import philosop like barouch spinoza , i am suppos to know someth about him . howev , i think that thi broad knowdledg should been given to student by high school , and not by the univers . if you have done your high school properli , you are suppos to have enough broad knowdledg to support all the discuss you will take in the futur . thu , in my opinion it is better to attend the high school in a good way in order to achiev a broad knowdledg of mani subject , and then special in what you like the most when you are go to the univers .
