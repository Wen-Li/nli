to answer that question , we need to ask anoth question '' is success measur by the thing we do or how we do thing ? '' , if the answer wa `` by the thing we do '' then i dissagre , becaus peopl will alway take risk as a fact of success and not as a choic , the reason behind that is that peopl tend and rather feel safe than to take risk with a big possibl of failur , for exampl : if there is a shoemak who work in that field for almost twenti year and have no experi what so ever in ani other field , then that man have two choic , to continu hi work know that it a failur - we agre that success is measur by `` the thing we do '' - or chang hi field to ani other practic that he know noth about , and take a huge risk by chang hi field . fundimintali thi man will have a veri low rate of success , and may lose hi furtun by chang the work he doe to thing he dont . at the same time thi man want success and that what we all want , so in fact he had no choic , he had to follow that path . if that wa the case , we will find that mani of the busi will collaps beacus of the shift of field done by non-specil peopl , the doctor want to be a pilot , the account want to be an engin and the cat want to be the mous . on the other hand ; if the answer wa `` by how we do thing '' , then we can achiev our goal and success , for we will do our work in a well plan and organ way , even if risk is there , it wont efeect our work to the point of failur .
