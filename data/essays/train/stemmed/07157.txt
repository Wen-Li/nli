some peopl might say that it is great to have a masteri of a topic . i agre with them but i do n't think that be special in one specif subject is better than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject for sever reason . first , in my opinion , have broad knowledg of a lot of differ subject is veri import . somebodi can be veri proud to have excel an knowleg of biolog , but is it realli use for today 's life ? doe he live better than hi rel ? i realli do n't think so . i think that have a broad knowledg is import to live in a societi . inde , it 's more than recomend to know about math to look after the spend , to know about polit when time is come to elect a new presid or to give an opinion concern a new law . .. know about all these academ topic that pepol use to learn at school is then definit more use everyday than have a masteri of one particular topic . anoth import point is that some academ subject are a guidelin for peopl . for instanc , histori state the error done in the past , and the person who are awar of them are lick to avoid them in the futur ; generali speak , i would say that all the academ subject help to live in a societi . moreov , i wonder how can somebodi evolu , grow up with onli studi one specif subject . all the topic we studi in class enabl us to creat our person . without them , it 's imposs to decid what we like , what we dislik . .. for exampl , learn difer topic definit help teenag to know what they want to do in the futur . to sum up , to have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject for sever reason : gener knowledg is useful to live in the world and it help to creat the person .
