in my opinion , histori is the most import scienc . the reason is that , it is both explain the idea that peopl were think of and the fact that had chang life forev . in that case it describ the percept of the concept dure period of time , plu their effect on the even . in brief i think it is better to look in both side and then decid the realiti of the statement . histori class are usual base on knowledg of the fact . date , peopl , locat are import to know . if we memoris these materi correctli we can also have gener statement . for instanc all the war were made becaus of differ interest of state . so we assum that same kind of fact , like war , are enough for us to understand the reason or the concept of the war . in additoin to that it is easier to learn the fact than learn the concept . concept and idea have mani consequ or they have even not been realis . in short it is more gener and easi to understand the fact for the student . on the other hand , fact are not usual enough for us to understand the realiti . for exempl big state can make lot of war and can gain or loos land but these war can not explain clearli the reason whi french revolut had realis . the idea and concept emerg and develop slowli and not easili . they have background and a search for a better life . in addit to that they can be capabl of avoid bad thing to happen . to give an exempl , peopl made war for mani centuri but with the help of the philosoph or thinker they understand the import of human life . so they do intern agreement for not to battl . howev , know onli the fact is not enough the have a conclus like thi . to summuris we can say that it is more import for the student to understand the concept and idea then to learn the fact becaus it is more useful for everi situat . we can guess the fact in advanc by know the concept .
