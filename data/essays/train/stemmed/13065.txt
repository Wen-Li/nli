the question if there will be fewer car in use in twenti year , than there are in use today , is a controvers topic . peopl may argu that car get abundand in the futur due to further develop of altern transport method or by concern about the environ . i howev , do not agre with thi staatment . i even think car get more and more import and that car use will increa in the next twenti year . the use of car is an still will be import especi for work peopl . statistik show that peopl have to travel longer and longer distanc to their workplac , and in the futur thi distanc will still increas . a lot of peopl move out to the suburb and consequ have a longer way to work each day . i think thi develop will continu in the futur and will increas the car in use . furthermor flexibl is a charakteristik that is get veri import these day . compani want there employe to be flexibl and let them travel for work a lot . thi flexibl can be given by the car and will increas it use . anoth import reason whi there will be more car in use in twenti day than today is that the popul on earth is increas rapidli . if popul is increas the use of car will increas as well becaus more peopl lead to more car . but not onli workingcondit and the increas popul are reason again the reduct of car in the futur . as well the vacationhabbit of peopl will lead to the opposit . as the world get closer togeht by globalis , open boarder and a common currenc for exampl , travel get a lot easier than it wa in the past . peopl use thi advantag and travel a lot and i think travel by car will get more and more popular . last but not least i argu that becaus of new technolog and product method , car get cheaper in the futur and therefor get acces to more peopl which will defenetli not decreas the car in use . for these reason i state abov i think the statement that car in use will be fewer in the futur is incorrect .
