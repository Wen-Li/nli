i do agre with the follow statement ! i think that older peopl are n't in form enough to do think that young peopl do . . young peopl can do want they want to do . older peopl must alway think of their bodi when they do someth . for exampl older peopl must alway think about where they will do their next holiday . they must alway think about if there is an evali in the hotel or other impot thing refer the hotel . young peopl can go where thi want . most of them never have to worri about their health and bodi ! anoth import aspect to explain my answer is that i think that young peopl alway think about their dream and futur . of cours older paopl do it too , but they know that life can end soon for them and young peopl alway know that they have still the entir life to realis their dream . young peopl also can alway do their sport they would like to do . i think that sport activ are veri import for have a satisfi life . so i think tht old peopl can not do the same sport activ i do and therefor i conclud that a life as an lod person doe n't seem to be excitng and interest for me . all in all the are a lot thing that either young peopl or old peopl can do , but i thing that there are also a lot thing that older peopl can not becaus of their bodi or health . even if they were abl to do the same activ as young peopl do , i think that the qualiti of do the activ is gone . the same is with an old hors . an old hors can run , but it can not run as fast as a young hors and it definet will not abl to jump high in the air as a young hors . refer thi exampl to human i want to explain that when you are old you will loos a lot of the life qualiti . therefor i can just agre with statement , becaus you can just enjoy your life if you have a good life qualiti !
