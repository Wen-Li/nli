thi is a veri common question in pedagog circl . sometim , it can becom a veri polit question . in fact you ca n't realli decid to learn with one method . a student who understand the idea and the concept behind a cours will have a good grade at the final exam . thi method of learn allow a student to develop it own comprehens of a cours . he can develop some `` way of do someth better '' . if he understand the cours , he can also anticip the next class subject for exampl . he can also ask some interest question to the teacher . in gener , thi method of learn develop the student 's brain . he will be more reactiv . for exampl , in a mathemat cours , it is veri danger to learn fact onli . you need to understand the underli idea behind a theorem to understand it . year ago , i onc decid to go to a math exam without pratic and understand the cours . the result wa natur bad becaus the professor want us to understand total the concept of hi cours ! at the opposit , learn fact can be also a good manner to learn . some cours can be veri complex and with veri littl time so the best manner to finish the cours is to learn theorem for exampl without demonstr it . also , in certain domain , like histori or geographi , you can onli learn fact . there are not mani thing to understand . you just have to learn . in high school , i had a histori exam . i just learn all the note i 've taken dure the cours and i final had a a-grad . i realli think that understand idea and concept is the most effici way to learn . i had the chanc to have a lot of professor who teach like that . but in some realli special cours , simpli learn fact can be the best manner to succeed !
