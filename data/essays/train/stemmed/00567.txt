in my opinion , older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do , although both of them have their own uniqu way of enjoy . young peopl mostli spend their time away from home enjoy outsid , wherea older peopl enjoy most of their time spendind at home itself . one reason may be that they are not strong enough to move around at that age or may be they have enough spent their time outsid dure their young age . younger gener are involv with studi and career develop , where most of their teenag is run off . in contrast , older peopl must have either retir by then and so they can enjoy without ani think for the futur . moreov , respons arrest the younger gener from enjoy their own life . thi doe not happen with older peopl as all their respons might have been finish by then . for exampl , a younger person work ha support hi famili finaci and should be respons toward everyon in the famili . so , most of hi time ha been spent in accomplish hi goal and support the famili . older peopl enjoy more becaus of lack of oblig at their age . although , younger peopl pass their time with friend , they do onli occasion . first few year of teenag is spent in studi , after graduat jod search start . later , work tension built up stress in all aspect . so , there is hardli anytim left over for joy in life . in contrast , as the older peopl have alreadi pass through these stage of life , they are absolut free of such work pressur and henc enjoy their life to the maximum extent . anoth factor is money . older peopl are financi more strong than young peopl and so spend as much as they can becaus , they dont need to give explan for the money they spent as do the young peopl . to conclud , older peopl enjoy more than the young peopl .
