with regard to the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' , i totali agre with it is import for student to understand idea and concept . the first reason is that student can hold theori and appli scienc much longer thi way than learn onli fact . the second reason is that student are abl to link differ subject at the univers , and therefor they can understand much more thing in the differ subject . i am studiy at the univers in cologn and i have friend , who believ in the same statement like me . i often ask my proffesor at the end of the lectur , when i couldnt understand a lot of thing in the idea and concept , which he or she ha present us . the reason whi i do thi , is to captur all the thing to understand the idea and concept . otherwis i cant understand the whole lectur , whe i onlz get the fact , e.g number or date . i also would forget most of the fact , when i onli get the fact without learn the idea and the concept . the second reason is that student are abl to link differ subject at the univers . it is veri import to understand the idea and the concept to link theori in the differ subjct as a whole . when i understand the concept and the idea , i am abl to link the subject to each other in mani case . i am quit sure that i will do the same until the end of my studi . i hope that my collegu will also follow me the abov outlin reason are whi i alway agre with the statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept .
