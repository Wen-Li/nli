in my opinion it is veri import to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and , in the mean time be special in one specif subect . i believ that there are a lot of thing that must be known by everybodi . i think that what we learn at school must be the most diversifi as possibl . we need to studi a lot of subject and read mani differ critic to be abl to better understand the peopl and the societi we live in . onli by have a veri wide knowledg we can understand what we realli like and consequent began to studi a specif subject which can help us to work in the right way everyday . i beliv that a lot of subject are link togeth and requir the studi of other subject to develop a complet and good idea on a topic . for exampl while studi a foreign languag i think it is import to studi the cultur , the geographi , the literatur and the economi of all the countriesa where that languag is spoken . in thi case it would be import to studi sociolagi , geographi and econom in addit to that foreign languag grammar . onli by have such a develop knowledg we would realli be abl to say that we know a foreign languag otherwis everytim we go to that specif countri we would not know anyth about it and we would feel unuseful and ignorant . i also beliv that a broad knowledg is import in everyday life . for exampl how could we be abl to read an econom articl on a newspap without know the basic of econom ? accord to all that i said i believ that a broad knowledg is a need that each person feel insid and it is someth that need to be devellop and extend everyday by read book or articl as well as by watch documentari on televis .
