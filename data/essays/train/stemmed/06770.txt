at the moment their are just enouth car on the street . the street are overfil and it is more and more difficult to find a park place , esspaci then you are in troubl . the citi are polut by the car and the air becom more and more dirti with everi day . furthermor it becom more difficult to pay the car and petrol . the `` hobbi car '' , is like a veri expens hobbi and in futur onli rich peopl will have the comfort to use them . as a conclus , the costum will look around for new product which are more atract and the provid ( the car-produc ) have to react quickli , if they want to serviv on the world market . the big car produc like bmw , merced , porsch , chrisler , ford or peugeot must chang their product and their product . when their are no costum for the car , they have to chang the product and built new vehicl with other engin . the car provid have to creat a new , clear , modern and cheap vehicl which is run by ga , electr or oil . so the imag of the `` powerful '' and fast vehicl with mani ps will chang . ( additon , metal get more and more expens on the world market . thi is whi car-produc have to look around for new and cheper way to bild a car . ) anoth fact is , that their is no more place for street , petrol station or highway . the popul is grow rapidli , and their are other vehicl , which do not need so much place and can transport much more peopl in a shorter time from a to b like a car . ( the new transrapid for exampl is over 450 kh/h fast , de n't need petrol and is also quieter than a highway with it car . ) so , in my opinion mani thing will chang over the next few year . their will be a big number of new , quieter and clear vehicl . petrol will be still veri import in industi , but car will have other typ of motor / engin .
