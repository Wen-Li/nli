the statement given here is a littl tricki . it is difficult to state agreement or disgreement becos it vari from person to person . let us take an exampl for thi one of my friend did hi bachelor in mathemat which ha no relat with architectur , or as such like interior design , than he took addmiss in to electron where he speciallis in light product . now after do thi two total differ cours today he is the lead person and expert in light . he ha great knowledg of arrang lite in a perticular space wether it is a garden or planetorium or may be an art galleri . one day he open up the reason behiend hi success he told that mathamat help him in the electron to make and understand the perticular light product for implic at perticular space . and that is the way how multipl academ subject help him to achiev in hi life . where in the anoth case the other friend sinc he wa 10 he wa preeti intrest in templ architectur - influnc by hi father who is an architect - he kept work on the same topic and he took special in templ archtiectur , later on he join a research program in the univers , and he togetherli found a new kind of construct method to construct the templ . after have a kind of two differ exampl in my life i person feel that if a person is keen intrest in a perticular direct or topic they defin achiev in it ; and give someth veri special to the societi . where as if a person is not decid or confirm about hi intrest of field but he is genuin in what he/sh studi , thay may also gener someth veri special after have multideciplinari acadam subject . both the way the import thing is what we , must do the best . but i person more favour of mani academ subject , becos that knowledg may affect a lot in take deciss at later time of carrier select .
