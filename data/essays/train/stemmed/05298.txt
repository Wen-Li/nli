with the recent rapid econom develop , the pace of life becom faster and faster . consequ , few peopl nowaday think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . on the other hand , there are still peopl think that the fact is more import for student to learn . in my point of view , i think to learn fact is more import than the other , which mean i disagre with the topic and i will list my reason as follow . first , the most benefit of learn fact . is that peopl are live in the world all fill with fact . both commonsen and our experi have inform us that the more fact we have learn , the stranger we are . for instanc . a student who work in a compeni for a summer job . he usual get lost of solut of mani differ problem from hi work . nevertheless , under some circumst , if the student just studi a lot in colleg and learn how to understand the idea and the consept he will just solv problem as what he learn from the idea and consept he got in colleg and some peopl may feel they are week . it should be potanti harfuml or at least unprodict , in hi carrea . sencondli , an arguement can be present my idea is that everi peopl have to learn fact in theri life . it is obviou that peopl even can live without learn some idea and consept . a good exampl can give some light to thi point . the old man alway tell hi young the fact that he ha learn , which mean that the fact is more import for the young and for the student . howev , to the contrari , nowaday we can see that lot of univers student more difficult to get the jod than the colleg student just becaus colleg consid fact are importantfor student to learn . in conclus , after the advantag and disadvantag weigh , and the bias opinion cast away , it is not difficult to say that it is more import for student to learn fact than understand idea and consept .
