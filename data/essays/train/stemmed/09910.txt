i strongli agre with that statement . in theseday there is a lot of car . the number of car on street is increas and we can say each famili ha at least one car . but after twenti year i think and i hope that there will be fewer car than now . becaus twenti year , it might be a short time , but now the speed of develop of scienc becam veri fast as well , and i am sure that in our futur we will abl to do most thing of our life and our work at home without move . so we will not need the car as so mani time as now . thank to especi internet now we can do mani thing at home . for exampl we can order some product which we want to buy directli use the e-commerc site , or we can send a letter use e-mail without go out for post offic . person i do n't like drive a car . i get stress easili when i must park my car becaus of absenc of free place or when there is a crazi traffic . in futur i believ that there will be new type of transport such as the `` segway '' which is small , easi and veri comfort . it need just the electr to make it work . so with introduc of these new transport invent i think we will need less the car . but i do n't think there will be much fewer car than now , i immagin that just a bit fewer . becaus twenti year is enough to make a chang as i wrote at the begin , but i must say at the same time it 's not so long period . i will see after twenti year whether my opinion will be right .
