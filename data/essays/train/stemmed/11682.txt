see how much energi a young person ha , in contrast with an older one , you can think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . moreov , a young person seem to have less pressur on him , and the whole life-span in front of him , wherea an older one have alreadi spent a great part of hi time . so the statement seem to be right , but i am not of thi opinion yet . in fact , i think older peopl can enjoy life more than young peopl , as long as they do not have physic impedi which are too big . when you have seen a lot of fact in your life and pass throught a lot of experi , you gain a vision about life which allow you to appreci everi nice moment in your life . you are abl to see the valuabl thing everi day life can offer . on the contrari , when you are young and have still to show what you can becom and what you can achiev , you have a lot of pressur on you . you are alway tri to have more of everyth , fail to appreci what you have . too big ideal or goal make you not to see the beauti which surround you , becaus you are too concern about find your place in life . i can see that observ my parent , and the calm they have when they must front bad thing . they know they have the abil to pass through bad situat , becaus they have alreadi done so in the past , wherea ani problem seem a new and diffucult one to me , becaus my lack of experi . of cours a young bodi is more effici than an old one . thi fact would support the statemet quit well , but with all the improv in medicin and in life style , i think it is not a crucial issu . lot of friend of my parent go bike everi weekend , and they are probabl better train than me . moreov , you gener have more money to spend when you are older , and thi is sure an import factor in how much you enjoy life . you have lot of beauti thing for free or at low price , and money doe not alway mean happi , of cours . but some more money mean the possibl of choos what you want to do among a wider spectrum of thing , and thi is sure nice and help to enjoy life .
