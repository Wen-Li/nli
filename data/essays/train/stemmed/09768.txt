can you imagin a world without car ? i think that in thi societi we are live is veri difficult think about it , becaus we have onli few refer on our life , and one is the car . we use the car for everyth : go to work , to school , for make shop , go to the supermarket , for have a trip . . for everyth . we have lost the capac of think that we can use . . leg or bicycl . we are becom even more lazi that in the past , and we do n't want to spend energi on walk . that is a peti becaus everyon know the import of the enviroment problem . everi day we are read on the newspap that pollut is a real problem for the earth and should be sove . . but is not easi when peolpl think onli for themselv and not for the entir societi . it 's even true that to maintein a car , peopl spend a lot of money everi year . . for gazolin , and assicur , and all paper you have to make in order to make your car abl to be driven . but in contrast , is evid that car are veri useful , and solv commun problem : car let to think nearbi to someon that realli live far away from you , and permit to have experi of life . for exampl permit you to make a cheap trip around a region , or around a contin , give you the possibl of have a sicur place to sleep , and for young peopl ( who do n't have much money . . ) that is an import thing . in conclus , for all these reason , i think that the use of car will not diminuish becaus it is a sours of confort , and benefit for the middl class person .
