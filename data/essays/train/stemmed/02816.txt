i agre with the statement . success peopl take risk at everi turn of their live . they tend to do the unthink becaus normal peopl are sometim afraid , asham , shi or feel guilti do thing that other have not done . in my opinion the one who dream and doe noth to acheiv that dream of hi is not success . success peopl dream and tri and tri and tri to reach their respect goal inspit of the difficulti face them . i will give you certain exampl regard that . a few day back i wa watch news about a handicap woman who couldnot walk sinc she wa young . she attend colleg and by her sheer persever and hard work , she wa abl to make it to the basketbal team and is repres usa in world cup championship . when she wa interview as to how she could do it , she just repli hard work and risk . the other exampl that i can think of is the guy who creat youtub . who would have thought that these guy ( 3 in all ) would make million and million with their new innov . that is what i call risk . they risk their futur by reject job offer from other compani and start a new innov call youtub and the result are there for everyon to see . one more exampl that i would think of is india 's mittal compani . indian steel compani never ventur outsid india . but mittal comapani made a bold move of purchas britain 's premier oil compani . everybodi thought that thi move wa a big blunder . but the compani risk prove to be the best deal ( and big too ) and mani indian compani now are move global . so , with abov exampl in mind i realli think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know .
