i believ , that when student are expos to mani differ inform , mani chose to understand onli the inform which attract their curios . in thi case , the other left over fact which did not interest them , are onli store for a short period of time . usual , these inform are store for sometim , but are eventu forgotten . thi is becaus human are onli capabl of store a certain amount of inform in their brain . due to thi fact , i agre to the statement , and believ that understand of idea are more import than store more fact . student are test , quiz , and mark for their knowledg in everyday basi . they have grade which mark their progress in learn , which affect their futur , such as colleg applic . in order to enter a desir school , student are forc to learn inform which might not interest them . for exampl , if a student wish to major in mathemat , he doe not need to learn about great poet of the english languag . howev , he will not chose to not learn these pointless fact . thi is becaus it will simpli affect hi over grade if he doe not learn them . basic , he is forc to learn fact which are not want . if they are not desir these fact that are learn , will be forgotten . thi is due to the fact that the student will not come back to these fact after learn them . there are massiv amount of fact which are learn , but put to wast becaus they are simpli not interest by the learner . in order to understand idea and concept , your mind must reach the deepest core of it mean . thi is a extrem difficult task , and mani will fail without grasp the goal . howev , if a man understand , it is highli unlik to forget the idea or concept . thi achiv will be kept in his/her mind , and at somepoint in their live , will return to help them . the experi is simpli more real to them , thu they will be abl to use it in everyday life . human are not perfect creatur , and their skill in learn have limit . they can not process , interpret , analyz inform which are too much for them . in addit , if a person learn fact which are not desir , or interest , they will be forgotten . peopl do so , becaus they are forc to earn good grade with their super ficial aquir fact , so they can go to a better school . i believ thi is a wast of time . if student understand idea , these are like to be true knowledg which will never be forgotten . i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept becaus they are memor , and strong knowledg . undesir fact are potenci `` memori wast '' , and should not be obtain forc .
