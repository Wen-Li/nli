the way for mani student to reach good result is to learn fact and reproduc them when they are ask to . in gener , i never wa a friend of just learn fact without understand the background . but i must agre , that it depend on the topic , which is the best way to learn . when learn a languag for exampl , you have to learn the vocabulari . or when studi medecin , you ca n't get along without just learn the whole anatomi . the same case is when learn about histori , there are some fact that you just have to keep in your mind . but : it 's onli the prepar to be abl to work . you will work with the anatomi or the histor fact , that you learn . i think , it is much more import to understand the idea of an concept . that is the onli way , to be critic with idea , to think about it and mayb even to innov or improv it . at the week-end , i 'm an instructor of first aid at the german red cross . i never say to the particip of my cours : that is the perfect way to handl a medic problem . as an exampl , i would like to tell about the `` stabil seitenlag '' , which probabl can be explain as lay a consciousless person in a stabl way on the side . veri import to me is to make the peopl understand , what are the danger of loos their mind . and to solv these problem , we think about possibl against these danger . final , the technic call `` stabil seitenlag '' is a proposit of me , how the danger of bee `` bewusstlo / consciousless ? '' can be handl . but if a person ha understand whi `` bewusstlosigkeit '' is danger and what can be done against it , he is alway abl to find a solut even when he ca n't rememb the technic of the `` stabil seitenlag '' . for an ingenieur , who want to amelior for exampl a car , it is not enough to know about the fact of the car . .. 60 hp , mayb 1.100kg and so on . he must have understood the idea of the concept , how the car work , to be abl to chang anyth . in summari , i think you alway have to learn some fact and keep them in your mind first , but when you want to reach at a higher level , you absolut must see `` behind '' the fact , you have to understand the concept and idea . and often , you have to understand the concept onli onc , and you can solv ani problem by logic think . you can learn all the result of mathemath term by heart , or understand one time , how the calcul function : - )
