it is gener believ that to have a broad knowlegd of variou academ subject is prefer of be specialis in a sole subject . as far as i am concern , i utterli agre with thi statement for the follow reason . first of all , have a broad knowledg of more that just one subjet is certainli more use to find a job . in today 's societi , the marketplac is extrem full , as a result of which it is particularli difficult to find a job . if we take univers student as an exampl , the chanc that all of them will find an occup in their respect field of studi is veri slim . it is inde extrem complic to find the job of your dream . therefor , given the current situat , it is far better to have a broad knowledg of differ subject , sinc thi is like to improv the chanc of obtain a temporari job of ani sort . secondli , to my view , thi first option is better for the simpl fact that it more interest and sensibl , especi if you are interest in mani subject . should a student have as mani interest as i have , he will have a lot of difficulti in tri to decid , onc for all , what he will studi for the rest of hi life . person , i like a consider number of subject which are extrem differ from each other . as a result , it is hard to make a choic , especi if you think that thi is a decis that is bound to influenc the cours of your life in the futur . cope with such pressur is veri difficult . as a third point , i would like to add that a person who is specialis in mani subject will alway have the opportun to choos a more specif field of studi later on . in thi way , instead of make hurri decis , he will be abl to consid all the advantag and the disadvantag that the subject entail , and therefor be better prepar for hi futur work experi .
