i do n't think that it will decreas the number of car in just twenti year . i support my opinion with some reason i descriv below . first , nowaday , car are one of the most necessari thing in our everyday life . japanes peopl sometim express about car into `` leg '' in our convers . for exampl , a man say `` we do n't have leg to go to the station. '' , then an anoth man sai `` we can take a bu . '' . first man said `` lag '' , but of cours , it not about real leg . ordinari peopl have their leg , so correctli , he want to say about a vehicl , but he exchang the word into leg . now , you get an idea how car are import for us like leg . we will keep drive car even in twenti year later . secondli , everybodi think car are conveni . we can move far away , and we do n't need to pay for drive without ga or oil fee . if someth new vehicl or machin invent in near futur , peopl might chang their way to move , but thi invent must be more conveni and cheaper than car . in addit to thi , thi stori is not realiti , so we should ignor thi now . car are too familiar vehicl to throw out , so i think it will noth to chang about car in futur . in conclus , car are veri conveni , and necessari for us .
