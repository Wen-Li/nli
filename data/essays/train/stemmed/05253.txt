enjoy is not age or time bound . it way of live joy , give our best effort to life and extract whatev possibl we can draw from life to make everyon around us happi . in differ age everyon ha hi own way to enjoy life , so i disagre with topic that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do how we defin enjoy , for young peopl ride bike at high speed , late night parti , rock climb and other adventur sport , movi , drink can be way to enjoy life , on other extrem of life bask at the beach , hold hand oh life parten and walk on send , memmoris the old day with photo album can be way to enjoy life . the way use by young peopl to enjoy life can be abhor by old peopl , and the path adopt by old peopl to enjoy life can be dull and monotonu for young guy . a young guy may enjoy to see a person slipe on wet ground , a old person may enjoy give hand to guy on fell the road . enjoy of young peopl are mostli extravag show , full of materi , lewdful , levish parti that all show the adrenalin run in their vessel , it also lighten the impatinc bound with the age concern , on other side enjoy of geriatr person solemnli start and and in spiritu . so i conclud my word by say that both extrem of life ha there own way to enjoy the life and that cant be compar with the age .
