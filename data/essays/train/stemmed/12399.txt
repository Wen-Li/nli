i partli agre and disagre . on the one hand i consid a broad knowledg of mani academ subject as someth valuabl , someth that make you a better scientist or research as you might get a broader view on a problem . on the other hand special in one specif field help you to concentr on specif problem - you have the chanc to go beyond the surfac of a field or subject without get sidetrack . it depend on where you see your career and on your talent . if you want to work in - let 's say - medic research , than a broad knowledg of modern and ancient languag , philosoph idea and school might turn you into an interest convers partner , but it clearli doe n't help you to come up with a cure for cancer . to come up with a cure for a deseas - that is actual hundr of differ deseas - you have to special in your special - and you have to start at an earli point with that . if you want to work as a philosoph than your work will benefit from a broad - but still deep - knowledg . some peopl might ask , what we need philosop for , but that is a differ question . so the question is more should the univers give student the chanc to `` linger around '' , to chang subject , to build an academ person if thi is necessari for their chosen field of career . it seem that today no-on is will to give you the time and resourc to develop your academ profil over a long period . which is a pitti as so mani prais author and scientist found their career and their idea on the broad knowledg they establish over a long period of learn . the trend goe toward shorter educ period as finaci resourc are limit . thi is unfortun a fact that we ca n't chang . sad is , that the decis made toward shorter , special educ system are mostli base on financi consider and they hardli leav room for except .
