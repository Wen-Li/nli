human tend to blame thing , they often look for thing that they can not see , but that doe not help that much sometim . `` advertis make product seem much better than realli are. '' is a product of thi action . it is also a popular but wrong opinion . first of all , if it is true whi do not we act against it . if it is so then it is a lie or mayb a trap . well if they sell you a broken item what if the differ . there is no differ they sell you a differ item than the one in the advertis , therefor they can get su . secondli , there is no point in fake advertis . if they sell a product that way they lose their credibl and that is way to bad . for exampl , a compani sold 100000 unit of a product with some fake advertis , but by the time their next product the public get clever and even if it is a great product they will not buy it and that is way more import than 100000 sale of the previou item . final , if they can sell stuff that way whi do they collect and replac their faulti product . it is like sell two item with half-pric . for exampl , two year ago soni sold their new slim playstat with faulti adaptor but after they realiz their mistak they chang everi adaptor with the new one . they did that becaus credibl matter and fake advertis kill credibl . as a result all of that we can say advertis do not show the product better than they realli are becaus compani are afraid of lose credibl and get su .
