i person do not agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take the risk rather that onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in fact i think that is not a matter of be success that push peopl to tri new thing and to take the risk . actual success peopl are veri much concern about their knoweldg and probabl are not like to risk becaus they do not want to loos their popular . for exampl a brillant manag know exactli what hi \ her skill are and therefor he \ she would never tri to do someth new becaus of uncertain and risk that can lead to their replac by someonels who is better than he \ she is in that particular issu . it seem strang that someon who is alreadi success and know how to do someth well doe n't want to tri or doe n't take the risk . normali these kind of peopl should have a strong charact and therefor the wright spirit to challeng themselv in new thing . but the surpris thing is that they are the one who have hard time realiz that they are valid person and that if they have achiev certain success is becaus they have the qualiti requir . i think that these type of person , unfortun , have a big lack in their person . in fact they seem not to be self confid even if they would not revel to the pubblic . furthermor i beliv that peopl who are not success are more will to tri new thing and to risk . first of all becaus they have noth to loos and second becaus in thi manner they will have a chanc to show their capabl and to creat a stronger charact by challeng themselv .
