an often discuss problem in our time is the pollut of the environ caus by carbondioxid , which occur by the great number of car use all over the world . so to have a look in our futur a lot of well-known scientist tri to answer thi question for us : how would the situat chang in the next 20 year ? will there be fewer car then now ? to discuss thi in proper way , we first have to name some pro and con underlin thi theori . first of all to have a look at the neg site of thi question . in 20 year the develop of the tramsport system will not be far enough to reduc the number of car use by peopl . furthermor there are so mani automot compani which benefit from the profit made by the car industri and there are also thousand of job , so that the govern can not stop the trend of increas number of car , if they do n't want the unemply figur to rise . on the other hand there are some fact support the idea of a futur with fewer car . on of them is the great number of giant project like the `` transrapid '' ( train ) , which show that a movement in an environ friendli way is possibl . anoth , more import fact is : `` we are run out of resourc , like crude oil !! '' , which are import for the product of gasolin . if there is no fuel , nobodi can use hi car , and the secondari resourc like electr , etc. are not enough develop . but the most import , and at the same time worri fact is , that our environ is badli pollut , which mean that we have to face a time where the govern of our world have to react , not like the us , in person of g.w. bush is behav concern the kyoto protocol . there will be new law introduc to our societi , regul the usag time of a car per person per day . or for exempl the regul that one famili is onli allow to have one car . so to sum up , it will be hard to realiz thi wish , but with an optim concept and the co-oper of all countri , a realist chanc exist .
