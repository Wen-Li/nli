it is a common belief that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and for thi reason they help make them look more desider . in my opinion thi belief is true , and thi is whi a lot of invest are made on advertis . the first fact that make product more desider is the way they are present . if the descript underlin the posit aspect of the product , and if it hide neg aspect of them , it is like to happen that peopl would appreci them . for exampl a beer may be advertis describ it flavour and it colour in a veri posit way . besid to make it desider it should be present not mention problem of alchool and drive accid . the second think that help advertis to make it product better is the associ of them with posit aspect of life . for exampl , when you advertis a kind of beer you can present it as the one drunk by veri import peopl , or you can take a photo of a beautiful nake woman with your beer in her hand . the posit of the person link with the product is automaticali transfer to the product itself by the receiv of the messag . anoth aspect relat to thi subject is the absenc of the product . when you are look at an advertis imag or a tv program it is probabl that you have not that product nearbi . when you see it , present in a posit light , associ with a posit event , you want it . the absenc increas desir . the desir of the product make it better simpli becaus it is not present . for exampl if you see a beer on the televis in a hot day , present as a veri fresh drink , by a beautiful young woman , you desir it . the desir make the beer much better than it realli is .
