i feel to have special in one specif subject becaus of variou reason . init , as we are concentr onli on singl specfic subject of our interst , it provid lot of scope to studi in detail of subject rather than , superflusilli . i feel that have littl knowledg is alway danger becaus , it may result in mani problem . for , exampl if i know a drive car partial and i go for a ride then thi may lead to accid . ani student or professor who concentr onli on singl subject produc veri good result . for exampl if we consid scientist `` albert einstein '' who concentr onli in physic and produc great equat ( e = mc2 ) which is basi for famou princlpl `` theori of rel '' .which is use in all nuclear reaction , to measur the rel veloc between to move object ... etc . if we specal in singl subject we can understand concept involv in subject in an effect way . let us consid if i am specilazi in comminc then there would be lot of scope to get recrut in commun compani rather than , the person with half knowledg in that subject . mani universit an colleg suppot to specilaz onli in singl subject as they provid in their final semist or in post graduat subject of student interest i.e .. , elect . thi provid student to encourag in field of hi / her own interest with out forc to no each concept . so , i final feel go for singl subject is the best way to learn and understand as it provid scope for do research in our interest field of studi . i feel that half knowledg is just like `` half cup is alway empti '' it never get fill up . as there are plenti of oppurtin in specif field student should choos subject of their to excel in their academ and be a good citizen to countri .
