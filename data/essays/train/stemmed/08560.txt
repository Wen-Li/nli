i do agre with the statement that succes peopl tri new thing and take new risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . it is the calcul risk that a person take that show hi confid and attitud toward life . tri out new thing keep a person from get bore with the routin type of work . take new risk alway ha a chanc for growth not onli in what he/sh is do but also as a person . i can state my own experi as an exampl . i 've alway been a topper in high school with excel in mathemat . after graduat from high school most were take up engin and account for undergradu . i realis i had an interest in scienc and dare to take the risk to face the compet to enter into a medic school . final not onli did i get into one of the top medic school with 98.5 % but also got a financi aid . all through the way i believ in myself and never let my confid fall apart . and then i realis that i had a tast for music , which led me to becom a disc jockey . i use it as a way to relax my tension from my academ curriculum . peopl thought how can a ` ld be doctor possibl be a dj . well , i know it sound weird , but i want to tri somet new . it wa just the start and the list went on from organis medic camp , awar campaign to start a student organis for sincer , servic and develop . although you need disciplin , hardwork and patienc to reach goal , it is the differ which you make that matter . it show the attitud toward life and the confid with which we move ahead . success peopl are confid peopl with a posit attitud who tri out someth new alway and tri to make a differ in other ' live . everi new task is a challeng for profici and confid . they alway want to see life in a broader prespect fill with challeng . as a matter of fact , everybodi should tri out new thing , which will develop their attitud toward life and will make them a better person .
