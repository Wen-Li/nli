learn concept and fact are two common element in the process of learn . howev , which one is import than the other one ? i disagre with the statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my point of view , learn fact is much more import than learn concept and idea . it is import to learn fact in the begin of a learn process . befor learn a new thing , we have no idea about it . therefor it is import to us know about the fact which are most outter side of a thing . for exampl , when a babi is learn what an appl is , they onli recogn that an appl is a round red thing . he doe not need to know that appl is a fruit which is an live thing and how it grow . anoth exampl is that when we studi histori , we alway have know about the fact first . we have to know what , where , when and how first . after we know the fact , we start learn the concept and idea which are hidden in the fact . therefor , learn the fact is import becaus it is the first step of a learn prcess . moreov , learn fact is import becaus it is a easi and direct way to learn someth . understand idea and concept play a support role in the process of learn . it is becaus understand idea and concept allow us to know more about how the fact work in their way . if we onli understand idea and concept but not focu on the fact , we do not even know what we are learn and absorb . in other word , it is useless to onli know the idea but ignor the fact . fact are concret and solidari thing that we have to know about in lear . in conclus , it is imprtant for student to learn fact that it is for them to understand idea and conc
