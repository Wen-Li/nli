the issu of know mani academ subject or to be special in a specif one is difficult to deal with . on the one hand we have young student who are not alway sure of what they want to do later and who tend to learn as mani subject as they can and on the other hand , firm that are look to hire student that are specif on one subject . take all aspect into account , i strongli feel that it is more valuabl to be special in a particular topic . to begin with , the scholar system ha to deal with student that are go to secondari school or to colleg without know what they realli want to do later . then , we find them be graduat and be look for a job with a determin that would be so much stronger if they knew the type of job or the sector they want to work in . that 's whi , my firm belief is that a young student who know what he want to do after graduat will have someth more than the other student , who will becom oppon when it will be the time to get a job . anoth way to justifi my point of view is to say that know young what we want to do after school is a good way to have a good knowledg on the topic and whi not have a profesion experi by do internship . howev , it is import for a student not to precipit himself in a way , a specif subject , or an option with be to young to decid that thi should be what he will do or learn for hi all life . and have a knowledg of mani academ subject could be a good way to make the good decis . take all aspect into account , my firm belief is that there are so mani student that have a knowledg of mani academ subject , and when you have one who know what he want to do and that he ha a specif knowledg on one specif subject , he ha such a good card to play to get a job and to make the differ with other student . and is n't that what firm are realli look for ?
