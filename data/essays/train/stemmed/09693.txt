i do n't agre with the statement - the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . here i have a good exempl . in januari 2000 , i travl india particip in a group led by a tour guid . mayb fifteen peopl were join in and one guid wa join in . group member should have gone to everi place with the guid and each other . it wa veri tire and sometim had lot of lose time wait for the late member . howev the guid explain specif about the place we visit and it wa ver use , i do n't want to attend such a travel again . one year later , in januari 2001 , i visit india again alon . sinc a month befor the travel , i had plan where to go , and when to move citi to citi . the prepar time itself wa veri interist and benefit for my abil to plan other long-last work . and when i finali arriv india , i wa more free and movabl . and far the more , i could have met sever local freind there . so we travl togeth sever day . and when i move to anoth citi , i could have anoth local freind and learn a lot about the social life of india more than my ex-guid . i think plan their own travel and travel alon is more benefit for young peopl . travel is not just travl there . it is includ plan and studi about the countri befor travl . and after travel , to roll up the cours by note and to think over it sometim . when group tour with tour guid it is n't quit easi to do it by myself becaus th tour guid do it for me. in thi case the memori of tour is not last forev ,
