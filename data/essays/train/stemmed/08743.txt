in thi short respons first of all i will explain what i think about thi sort of behaviour , then , support by person exampl i will state if i agre or not with thi statement . most of success peopl i think they are strongli ambiti and owner of great expect from their life . thi is mainli due to their condit : they achiev lot of goal and intrins and extrins satisfact . well , onc reach such a `` high `` point of their life they do not seem to want to stop and they keep on tri new risk and get new challeng as if everyth they achiev it is not suffici . person i ca n't have an exact opinion becaus i can not consid myself a success person and neither a person who is take new risk . i just can suppos what i would do if i could be the subject in the statement . first of all i strongli believ that thi decis depend on person and type of peopl . for exampl a brilliant and success young man is suppos to continu hi career take more risk than a collegu who ha a famili and henc can not permit to expos himself to great risk . it is also true that an adult who onli ha a great goal probabl will not continu to tri for harder and higher goal . the behaviour in the statement ha a neg effect too : as the past experi of everyon can teach , in a riski busi no one know the result , so it can be neg for most successful peopl too , although they seem the most suitabl person to hold a challeng . to me it would be right to reach a satisfi statu of live , which confer to me suffici both extrins and intrins satisfact . with thi i mean that peopl should not exceed and overr their capabl tri new thing . of cours i have and i will alway have goal but i do not consid myself a `` risk ~ friendli `` person . i think it is more satisfyng to do greatli a singl task than two in an approssim way . obvious thi is whi i wrote that it depend on person behaviour at the begin .
