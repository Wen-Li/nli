i agre with that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i myself is reluct to particip in commun activ . the reason are vari . for exampl , the mid autumn festiv is come , the bar-be-cu seem just not so interest to attend becaus you need to do it with a group of elderli peopl . commun borad often expect young adult to do all kind of chore simpli becaus they are younger and more enget . it is true but young peopl lose their interest in attend under thi logic consequ . if a communitiy onli expect young peopl to contribut rather than gain benefit , whi would young adult join the activ it offer . commun activ are usual design for famili in the neighbordhood . the subject would be natual grandpar , parent and children . it cost a lot to design a program that is suitabl for everyon 's need . if each hous as a unit to decid what they want to do within their own budget , it will attract more interest for peopl to spend their holiday . besid , commun 's activ are veri limit in kind . they may just have kraok , bar-b-cu and riddl . i would believ young adult will chose what is suitabl for them outsid of the commun and have fun as much as possibl , such as ktv instead of kraok or movi . it may be even more excit by go to a bar and drink to their upmost with their close friend . after all , it is much more fun in the world outsid than the daili in and out neighborhood . one major issu in commun is garbag . not everi commun ha a good system of run recycl item . peopl have the tendenc to leav their garbag in a certain spot where nobodi is at the scene see them do that . graduat , it becom a trash mountain . it is veri common in taiwan . with issu like thi , commun need volent to guard the spot and supervis the dump process when trash truck come . young adult have energi to do that but they are not so respect enough to argu with elderli ladi or men . it increas the reluct for young peopl to interact with their neighbour . it is reason that young peopl keep their nose out of commun board . it is just too much to handl to a young adult .
