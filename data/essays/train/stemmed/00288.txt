the success depend on what peopl tri . for sure someon who do onli one thing and the same thing each day will perform in it , but the question we can ask is will he also perform in other activ if he tri it ? it is not realli sure . someon who alway tri new thing is not sure to suc in all thi thing . mayb thi person will have lot of experi in sever activ but he is not good in all thi activ or he doe not suc in all the activ he tri . for exampl somebodi who tri to pass a hard test to have access to a better school he is in but who do not suc or somebodi who take risk and setll a new busi which fail few month latter . are these person succuss peopl ? i do not think so . but thi point of view could be wrong for a person who suc in all the thing he or she tri . the question is : is thi type of person current ? i think that thi type of peopl who suc in whaever they do is extremli rare . that whi on my opinion , success peopl are the one who can do one or two mayb three thing but who do it veri well . as the matter of fact , peopl who are specialist into two or three activ alway suc in it so can be consid as success peopl . on other hand we can say that it is becaus they do alway the same thing so ti is normal that they suc . to my mind , success peopl are peopl who work hard to have what they want . they derserv their success becaus they have work for it . if they tri new thing and take risk to improv their situat or earn more money for exampl but after they work to have it they will probabl suc . so the success depend on the work of peopl . the more you work , the more you will have chanc to suc . without work , you can not go even more far . i realli think that the work is the key of the success .
