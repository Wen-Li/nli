i agre thi opinion that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are three reason whi i think so . first , young peopl spend much time studi and join club . for exampl , they need to enter the good school and get a good job in their futur . sinc i wa 10 year old , my parent had told me to studi hard to get good grade and go to a good school . my friend parent told so to my friend . so young peopl alway have a lot of thing to do , and they also do n't have enough time to talk with their famili . in order to get a good life for the futur , young peopl beliv that they need to make grate effort , even though they do n't have enough time to enjoy their daili life . second , a number of young peopl is get less interest their commun . in these day , peopl tend to talk to their friend through phone , email , chat and so on , and they are get less seriou about the human relationship . some of them may have littl idea how toit is one of the social problem . we need to talk to other peopl directli to solv thi problem . third , young peopl do n't know how to help their commun . they have no good idea what is the use way to help their commun . so young peopl need to tri to join their commun onc . they will understand how to help their commun when they join them . i explain three point whi i agre thi statement . in conclus , young peopl need more time to join thier commun , to be interest in them and know what they can do for them .
