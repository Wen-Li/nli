we are live in a societi surround by variou adivertis which not onli appear on tv show , newspap and internet , but also on other occas , such as subway , bu stop , or even on the bulloon fli in the sky . some peopl think all these ad make them easier to get access to the product they are not so familiar , while other consid it a obligatori input of busi manag . in my opinion , both of the comment are reason . as we all know , with the develop of modern technolog , our life style is more and more follow a faster pace . so when we are consid purchas of our necess , it is a littl time-consum to pick up the product from the other . ad help us to go through the choos process . mani ad mayb exagger their effect , for exampl , the advertis pictur show on the internet do have some differ from the origin product , but sinc all of them are exagger in some level , consid that , they would be equal as well , which is understand becaus everi compani ha to beautifi their product to make profit . howev , sometim some ad boost their product so much that it would be actual undermin the effect , for they will be too good to believ . but thi kind of ad should be prevent in case some peopl would be cheat on that . what is more , it is veri discourag and disappoint to discov that the product you have bought is not as good as the ad said . i can take our wireless internet access for exampl . we instal the high speed internet last year , and we are expect to enjoy the high-spe onlin surf servic , but it turn out to much slower that what it said on the promot handbook . so after that , i am becom more and more convinc on the statememt in the topic . to sum up , accord to my experi , mani ad will certainli more or less exagger their properti , i 'd better choos from them care .
