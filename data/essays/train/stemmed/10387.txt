first of all i have to admit that it is veri difficult for me to say if i agre or disagre with thi statement . in my opinion it is a veri import thing that young peopl give enough time to help their commun . but young peopl do not and neither do i . i do not have ani time to help my commun becaus i spend most of my time at univers and i have to work verz hard in my free time , too . i can understand whi young peopl do not want to help their commun . the first reason is that young peopl do not get money for thi work . perhap if they got money they would help their commun . anoth reason is that young peopl onli want to enjoy their life . they do not think a lot about commun . anoth reason could be that young peopl want to discov the world . they do not want to stay with their commun . perhap it is possibl to lure young peopl to help their commun . if there were good condit they would help . and if some young peopl began thi work other peopl would follow . so if mani young peopl were involv in thi help they would have fun togeth . furthermor it is necessari to make a lot of advertis for help the commun . but from my point of view you have to see the fact . as i mention at the begin of my essay young peopl are not interest in help their commun and i think it would be a realli difficult brief to chang their behaviour or opinion . and i think there are other peopl who have to help the commun , for instanc the major . so , in summay i have to say that i am a littl bit sad about it that i can not help my commun veri much . but i can understand peopl who do not have ani time help their commun or do not want to . from my point of view young peopl have to solv other problem than help their commun . but peopl who do not have a lot work to do might help .
