i agre with the presumpt that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are variou reason for thi , have to do with the pollot caus by car , the diminish space in our citi and the convini of the public transport system . car are fun and exit to drive , they provid a fast and conveni way to get from place a to b. they are also get more and more power with each pass day , with compani come out with 1000 bhp car . these car consum a lot of fuel and our resourc are limit . it will not be long befor we run out of natur oil reserv . also , due to the scarciti , the price of ga ha increas twofold over the past 10 year ( in india ) . for the common man , it is becom infeas to use a car everyday . he is go to have to find some other way to commut , the car is just not a viabl option anymor . the other reason is that there is just not enough space in our citi amymor , for everi hous to have a car is sheer wast of resuorc . there are so mani peopl live n such a small space that there is no room to park the car , same is the case in market and road . the number of traffic jam and snarl is a clear indic of how there are too mani car choke up the road , and peopl are wake up to thi fact . mani peopl have start car-pool which is better as there is lesser wastag of resourc like ga and space and also , lesser pollut . the third reason whi i think that tere will be lesser number of car in 20 year is that the public transport system is catch up in a big way . with the introduct of the metro and clean cng buse , the major of the public ha found a safe , cheap mode of transport , therebi question the necess of car . there will alway be car enthusiast who will never give up drive car , but for the major of the public , these reason , and more are convinc factor to switch to other mode of transport and to econom , by car pool and other way . in conclus , i do agre with the sattefor the reason state .
