i disagre with thi statement . my poit of view is differ . .. i think that there are a lot of car today and there will be more and more tomorrow . . my opinion is that until the reserv of petrol will finish the human did n't stop to make a new car . the onli way to stop thi process is improv pubblic transport and make thi more cheap than use car , but thi will be not easi becaus it mean make a chang in polit 's mind and in big compani 's rule . twenti year it 's a short time for make thi invers i think !! for exampl i had everi morn an hour of car for make 25 km it 's crazi but it is alway less in term of money and time than take a pubblic bu . we also assist at the evolvig of orient state who are densiti popul and they are now use a bikecycl but not for even !! thi will be a problem for earth healt . i hope that my gener could view a societi with less car
