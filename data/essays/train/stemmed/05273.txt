in my oppinion , it is better to special in one specif subject rather than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . person , i like to know all about a specif subject becaus in most of the case it is the onli way to understand the real truth . thi real truth would not be achiev if one do not get to the core of the subject in hand . futhermor , i think that not onli special is desir and necesari for scienc to advanc but also broad knowledg is the reason whi dure sever centuri there ha been so few cientif discoveri . an exampl could be that as scientist special in certain area and subject , they start to make astonish discoveri that revolution humankind . also , becaus i am an economist , i feel urg to know everyth about a certain subject in order to be abl to find the correct solut for the problem i am work on . for exampl , i would not be abl to explain the reason for the high inflat rate that occur dure the last decad in argentina unless i get deep knowledg about the caus of inflat . in that exampl it is clear that a broad knowledg about argentina , or even argentinean economi , would not be enough . on the other hand , it should be said that certain disciplin such as philosophi need peopl who have broad knowledg about mani subject in order to be abl to move forward and have a profund impact in societi . \ in summari , i think that special is the key to knowledg for most scienc beacus it allow the scientist to gain a good insight about all it matter about hi area of studi .
