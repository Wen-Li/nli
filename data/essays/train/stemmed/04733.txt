i disagre with the statement . i think that it is more import for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept . i will aprov my support by educ system and my experi . we could not know real histor matter in school . our textbook wa control by gover and peopl who live as high cast . so , we can just learn what they want student to know for our countri , it is not real . then we feel that we alredi know the idea and concept . even it is not good for our contri , we have to learn the fact for our futur . if we go to other countri , sometim we might have to feel apporog . therefor we have to learn fact rather than just understand idea and concept of our countri . secondli , although it is import to studi at school and home by textbook or drill , it is better to go outsid and get new idea as a school trip or just travel . when we grow up we are taught academ cours , like english , math and histori from our teacher or parent . and we are said that we have to studi a lot becaus of our carrier . howev . it is good way for our life to go outsid or other countri and get new idea and point of view . in my school , we have a one week cours that we can experi new thing at other countri or citi . on the week , we do not have ani asses and homework . but we can get new thing and also reflesh our mind . and also we can spread our knowleg becaus of the trip . accord to my trip , i could know that although just understand idea and concept is import for us , howev learn fact is more import for our life and mind . thu i belev that it is more import for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept accord to the educ system and my school trip .
