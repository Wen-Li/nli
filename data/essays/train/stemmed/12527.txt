no , i will not agre with thi statement that , `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . becaus , if we observefrom last twenti year the car usag ha been increas rapidli . whi it ha been increas iwil explain in the below paragraph . if a person who is work as an softwar engin he ca n't wait at bus-stop for buse and railway-st for train . becaus he ha to spend much more time on that . so if he ha a car he can save much more time . thi is the main reason for incres of car . the usag of car lead to more advantag than disadvantag . while the `` call center '' peopl have to travel from home to offic at late mid night . so if a car is there it will be well safe than a bike or ani other vehicl . in the come year also the usag of car will doubl or may be tripl the time what we have now . becaus thi is the fast move world . to lead a better life in thi fast move world a good car is need to move whereev we want to go . we all know that if the usag of car have been increas it seem that their countri or state is develop . i say that car user will increas in countri where there are few car now . but the growth will decres in some develop countri like newyork , london , australia etc . .. there they will use chartad flight which are now veri fewer there . the advantag while use car are that we save much more time while by spend for train and buse . we can save tht time and spend that with famili , friend or in the offic . it lead to lot of convini by use car . i will conclud that by the abov reason the car user will increas by the next twenti year in thi fast move world .
