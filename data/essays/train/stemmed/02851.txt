i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . rather , i am of the opinion that it is better to special in one subject than to have a broad overview of differ academ subject . have a broad knowledg would give an individu a superfici understand of differ topic which he may not be abl to put to effect use for the societi . special in a field give greater insight into the particular field and an individu can explor further and creat new wealth of inform . thi way he would be contribut to the societi and the civil . differ academ subject base themselv on differ concept and it would also consum more time of the individu in tri to get a grasp of the fundament of differ academ subject . we can draw water from a well onli by select a right place and by continu dig at that point rather than by start dig at differ locat . similarli , an individu would be more product if he spend the same amount of time in explor a singl subject and special in it . a civil need new idea to advanc itself . look at the collect , if everyon tri to gain a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , we would all the sustain onli on the inform wealth creat alreadi and there would not be ani improv in the statu quo . to futher itself , the societi ha to have differ individu special in differ subject , explor the new topic in their special and creat or discov new inform for futher gener .
