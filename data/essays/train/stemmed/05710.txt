gener i agre with the statement . understand idea and concept is exactli what you need when you finish univers and when you are go to work for a compani . there are some fact you have to know but it is definitli more import to understand concept and idea . if you are a busi student and you learn someth about the product life cycl for exampl , you definitli have to understand how the cycl work ( the main idea of the cycl ) when you start a job in a market agenc . if your new boss or supervisor see , that you understand the idea of the cycl and that you know how a certain product perform in the market , he will be glad to have you in hi team . but if you would n't rememb thi concept at all , although you learnd it in univers , your new boss would ask himself if he mayb made a mistak by employ you . if you just forget the correct name of all the stage of the cycl ( the fact ) , he would probabl not even notic it . and if , you could easili find the answer in a book or in the internet . but rememb that it is imposs to understand the whole idea or concept but just look it up in the internet quickli ! of cours it is also import for all student to know some fact . for instanc a doctor must know the differ indic between a littl injuri and a double-broken bone and a lawyer must have a realli broad knowledg of the most common law . but in my opinion the main reason whi student go to univers is that they need to learn to connect the given fact . no-on can be a lawyer by simpli know all the law , he must have the abil to connect the given inform ( law ) with the differ opportun to use them . he must have a concept . he will use a law-book with all the fact to help him , but he goe to univers to learn what to do with the law-book .
