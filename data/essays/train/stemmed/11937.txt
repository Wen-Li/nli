ye i do agre with the statment `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . becaus just learn the fact doesnt give a student good knowledg , and i think it is not a proper way to shine hi knowledg . first the student should expos to the idea and relat concept befor learn it practic . for epitom if an engin without learn the concept and idea if he start start learn the mainten of a car and it part , he might not be sucess all the time becaus he should know the concept and the theori of the part befor learn practic . as in thi case both the theori and practic concept and idea are necessari . suppos if a man ha some problem with hi car , if he goe to a local worker to get it repair , the worker can not find a definit solut instead he repair it temporarili and satisfi hi custom and gain money from him , here the looser is the custom . so intead of go to a local worker he could go to a compani servic center where the technic person are avail all the time who are skill enough and rather they would find the actual problem and give a perman solut to get it repair and give the necessari precaut to take maintain the car . so here both the theori part and the practic part play a vital role . same with the case of other electron good like desktop pc , laptop , televis etc . .. most of the interview conduct by top mnc would conduct the round which would test both the theoret part and practic part so it is import for everi one to understand the idea and concept befor they learn them . henc from the abov mention epitom , it is not fallaci to say that it is import for everyon to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
