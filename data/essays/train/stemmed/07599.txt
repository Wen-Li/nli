i agre with that idea that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special just in one . as we live in a more complex and competit word today , peopl are expect to be more qualifi day by day as we see thi point in the work area . also know just one subject veri much is not enough . through broader knowledg , one societi can contain veri improv individu . today , our world seem more competit and difficult . good job are realli scarc . at thi point , you have to improv yourself to have the best job . then there come the question , how can you do that ? if you are special in more than one subject , then it is obviou that you have a competit advantag over a person who is special in just one subject . and thi is well-reflect in your recruit process of the job that you appli for . also at thi point , i want to give an exampl of myself that i am studi econom , but at the same time i had taken mani class from financ and market depart . in my opinion , i will make benefit of thi situaton in the futur . apart from the career part , by special more , one societi can go through a wider enrich proce . it is obviou that know more can not be consid ashav a bad trait . if individu in a specif societi improv themselv through learn more subject . then thi societi turn out be a veri high develop one . just imagin that in a societi , there is a great number of peopl who are very-wel educ in term of special in more than one subject . then we can say that thi societi will accomplish mani thing on their own . so know more is a veri import aspect in our discuss . to sum up , the decis of have greater knowledg on academ subject is a veri import one for the sake of a societi . i strongli believ that the gener situaton of the world will be much more complex in the futur and peopl who are special in variou subject will the one who are go to surviv more .
