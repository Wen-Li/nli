i can not fulli agre with say thi statement is true nor fals . i think that there are a lot of success peopl with differ opinion about the busi they do . for exampl am i imagin a man who made billion of euro trough sell shoe . i can not see the point whi thi man should stop produc and sell shoe for someth els , someth he is not experienc in . whi should he risk hi money and busi trough tri someth completli new ? on the other hand he mayb just should spend hi money in someth new . be a success salesman did not just teach him how to sell shoe but how economi in gener work . he could use that knowledg to build up a completli new busi . the better he can handl hi money , the more risk he can take . i think it greatli depend in which categori or area someon who is success take risk . if i would be rich trough sell shoe , i would not mind produc a completli new kind of shoe no one ha yet . becaus i would be use to the economi and the busi , i would not be so afraid to take thi step , even if there is the danger i would not earn ani money for my new creation . on the other hand i would not spend ani money or risk in some busi i have got no clue about . for instanc am i , as shoe-produc , not use to anyth about food-busi . the danger i could lose my money trough invest in food would extremli be increas , compar with the rate of lose my money with remain sell shoe . what i am tri to say is , that there is , in my opinion , no gener answer for thi statement . i can not fulli agre or disagre with it .
