i could not agre more with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg on mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i believ that peopl should have knowledg in mani area becaus we face mani problem and mani situat through our life and if we have no idea about them we could face big problem . i am studi mathemat and i am learn everyth about thi subject at the univers . howev besid thi subject i am attend mani other cours to improv my knowledg in other subject such as english , histori , educ and intern relat . i am take thi cours becaus i will be a mathemat teacher after my graduat and i will teach children . my main subject will be mathemat in my job of cours but children will ask me mani question in other subject , too . for exampl they will see someth on televis and as a teacher i will be suppos to have knowledg about what they saw and they will ask me some question . if i can not answer them in mani situat they may loos their trust in me and thi is a veri bad situat for a teacher i think . anoth thing is that i am think about stay at the univers as a teacher and in turkey one ha to take some exam to be abl to stay at the univers and to be an academ teacher . to be success in thi exam i have to have idea about some other subject besid my major subject . to improv my knowledg in thi subject i have to be interest in them becaus it can be bore for me if i have to studi someth that i do not like and do not want to studi . so , becaus of thi reason i have mention abov i am take mani other subject besid mathemat to improv myself and i believ thi will help me to be success in my job in the futur .
