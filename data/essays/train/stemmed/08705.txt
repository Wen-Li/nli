i agre with the statement . infact i believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl becaus they find it more interest , they still have to affront mani life 's problem , they still have to feel everi sensat , they still have to know how life could be horribl sometim , they still have to know a lot of life- part that old peopl alreadi know . for exampl sometim my mother tell me how i could affront a problem becaus she have alreadi affront a situat like mine and i love when she doe it . everyday young guy and girl feel that there is a big and awesom world in front of them which is wait them . i love thi sensat . i love have a lot of dream about my futur , i like think that i can do what i want about my life becaus everyth depend by me . i know that it 's not like thi , there are a lot of problem that i will have to affront dure my life , but i prefer to convinc myself that with my forc i 'll be abl to arriv where i want to . old men and women believ that their life is an habit ; for exampl , they alreadi know what they will do next summer becaus they will do what they did last year and the year befor . i want that my mother and my father understand that they are still young , they have to live their life as i uualli do with mine . what they usual tell me about my life are import inform for me to resolv my problem , but they have to enjoy their life . for exampl they could go away for two day without me and my brother or they could chang habit and go out for dinner sometim . when they talk about what they did when they where younger i can see how much they miss that period and i feel bad . .. mayb next christma i could ask to the big man , as we call him to rememb to my parent
