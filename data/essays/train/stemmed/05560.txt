i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . for the argument , i would borrow the tradit definit of `` commun '' as a group of peopl follow a uniqu set of custom and practic which are visibl in their gener conduct , festiv and lifestyl . `` help the commun '' , henc , should mean endors and spread the belief of one 's commun in the societi and also , specif help member of one 's own commun onli . the world is fast move toward a knowledg base societi where boundari of commun are becom ever more blur and diffus . in thi well-connect world of today , extern influenc on mindset and cultur are larg and the concept of work for one 's commun is disappear fast in the young gener of today . apart from thi , we are now live in a highli competet world where avail time determin success ; young peopl of today are not in a posit to earmark suffici time to devot to their commun ' caus , els they would lag behind their peer . time crunch in gener is a reson for the fact that peopl do not give time to their commun . as for the point of help one 's own commun peopl over other , the youth today are more awar of the concept of `` global fratern '' and of the total time a person spend in help the societi , it is natur that hi commun would reciev onli a part which the latter may well deem as `` insuffici '' . in fact , i consid thi trend of push commun notion to the backburn a healthi one sinc afteral , the notion of commun is a major caus of fu and belliger in the societi today .
