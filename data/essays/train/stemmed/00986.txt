`` if onli had youth the wit , and old age the time , '' i heard onc . the answer to the above-ment question is hidden within thi magic sentenc . impli that young peopl , out of lack of experi , make a lot of mistak and peopl old enough to becom experienc do not have the time to use their experi fulli , one ha to conclud that the old peopl have no choic but to enjoy life more than the young one . young peopl have fun , live adventur , keep fall in and out of love , ye : all of thi is true . yet do they realli know what they 're do ? are they even awar of how they 're wast the preciou time they have ? no . onli after they reach a certain age can they appreci the valu of experi . onli after lose the opportun of live the life they realli want to live can they understand how valuabl their past memori are and valu the littl time they have left to complet their unfinish busi befor they die . do not mistak me , i am not at all impli that the elder have the energi to get up and go out and have fun in the exact same way a young person can . i 'm simpli say that whatev they do , even if it is the simplest thing to do like feel the wind on one 's skin or eat a homemad meal cook by their wive , they do it with utmost intens . after all , it 's not the quantiti that count , but the qualiti . one more reason i believ the older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl is becaus the young peopl , no matter how success they have been that far , still have a life ahead of them , full of worri : are they go to be success ? are they go to be abl to properli support a famili ? older peopl , have live through these worri , are past thi episod of tension and are reliev . if they have grandchildren , for instanc , they know that it is their biggest accomplish . if they do not have grandchildren , on the other hand , they are awar that worri will be useless for there 's the chanc ha pass them . so all they have to worri about is enjoy the rest of what 's left of their live . exampl and situat may vari with person and period . yet one thing stay the same , the fact that even though young peopl believ that they 're enjoy life more than older peopl , it is the exact opposit . therefor even though as a twenti one year old person myself , i tend to wish that i am enjoy life better than my seventi year old grandpar , their qualiti of enjoy is much better than mine .
