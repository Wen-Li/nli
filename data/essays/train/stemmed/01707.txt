the process of learn in a school environ is veri complic and involv that a student will nead to acquir mani habil , such as understand idea and concept and learn fact . i believ that even if both habil are import , understand idea and concept is more essenti for a student than learn fact . understand idea and concept is veri import for student becaus it will give them method to approach problem in other academ file , in the day to day life , as well as in a professionn career onc they will start one . when we talk about understand idea and concept , we talk about an import learn process go on . for exampl , when you understand the concept of the prison 's dillemma onc in your life , you will not forget it , becaus it is not pure factual , your brain ha to connect concept and idea togeth in order to understand it . moreov , you will be abl to use thi concept in other situat , to understand what is go on in a situat where the condit of the prison 's dillema are met . on the other hand , learn fact , even if it ha some import in the learn process of a student , seam to me someth highli mechan . memori is not perfect , and most of the fact that we learn will be forgotten at one point or anoth in our life anyway . howev , if you forget the date when the second world war start , or the scientif name of a bug , you can alway look in a book or in a dictionari to refresh your memori . but is know the date when the second world war start ( a fact ) that import compar to know what the second world war is , what kind of issu where at sake , whi germani want to invad other countri , etc. ( concept and idea ) anyway ? i believ it is not . understand concept and idea is much more valuabl in my opinion than simpli learn fact , becaus it allow you to understand the mean of someth , to make your own opinion about it , and to articul it in order to convinc other that your rigth . in conclus , even if student need to learn fact in order to acquir a good educ , more attent should be given to understand idea and concept .
