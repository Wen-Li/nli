i think it is better to special in one specif subjet rather then have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . so i disagre with thi statement , and that becauc of two reason . first , i think that if you choos one subject , or one major to studi and special in , it will be more comfort to do your best and achiv your goal . for exampl , my father studi financ and law in the univers , and he realli work hard to special in the two subject , and after he graduat he reliz that it is too hard so he could n't do it and he work as a financ offic and never benifit of hi other subject . the second reason is that you will be mix up with all the mani subject that you are stude and you will not be abl to enjoy your . i alway ask my self , whi peopl do it ? becaus you have to work hard and kill yourself to special in mani subject . what is wrong with special in onli one subject that you can do your best in ? . i think that peopl who do thi are crazi becaus they are enjoy their life , and i think that they are destroy themselv . in the end i think that special in one subject is better , becaus we have to devid our life into work and have fun becaus we onli live onc .
