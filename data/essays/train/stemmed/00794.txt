there are some argument wether have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or special in one object . in case of have wide knowledg of mani subjct is more benefi to most of student who have taken rather than student of who special one subject . the first of all , it mean mani oppotun that student choos their major or futur . becaus everi student touch mani field of subject and . it help student choos their specif major . if they have mani chanc to have , it would be happen more less to confus their futur of to chang their major . in long run , thi method can save student 's time and money which reloc their goal . these experi will be good basi for have specif major . anoth reason is that broad knowledg help student in their life-tim . have mani background infomant can help mani bad or good circumst . for exampl , opera which student had studi in class is more attract to them than other who never studi about opera . also other of subjuct is smilar with it . lastli , studi braod knowledg help student to see a variou aspect of subject ( problem ) . unluckli , student who don ` t studi about broad subject might have possibl to see one aspect to other . when i wa young , one of my classmat wa interest in math . he wa also geniou in math . but he did n't do well in other subjuct and had problem with peer . becas he wa not interest in other part and peer . abov the reason , the best option of way of stude subject is have broad knowledg of variou academ subject .
