i would like to start by state that i fulli agre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . '' i will present three argument that support my opinion . firstli i would like to explain that a good advertis alway ha the best pictur taken of the item market . for exampl , when you go to the fast food restaur you usal reli on pictur to decid what you are go to eat . the nice pictur tempt your appetit and make you saliv . but when you actulli receiv the end product , like a macdonald 's hamburg , it never look as nice construct as the pictur show it would be . a nice pictur can speek a million word . my second argument is that most advertis are perform by veri good look individu or endors by someon famou . to util such powerful individu will influenc what you think of the item advert . for exampl , if jessica simpson say that the lead acne medic is proactiv and that she use it herself , then it must mean that it is an exept product becaus she is veri rich and famou and can decid to use ani product she want . we trust the peopl we look up to or wish we could be . my last argument is that a good advertis and brilliant market will undoubtebl bia our own person experi . who can actual tell which product is a brand name if it ha no label on it . if i were to blindfold you and have you tast 10 differ macaroni and chees could you pick out which one is the real kraft dinner ? an advertis is veri brilliantli construct to attract consum . i truli believ that we are all influenc , at some level , by cleaver advertis and that we can all admit that we have been sucker into the latest gimmic at some point . we might not admit it to other though !
