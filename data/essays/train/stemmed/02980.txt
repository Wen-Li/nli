i agre with the statement that success peopl take risk rather than do onli what they know . success peopl do take risk as they want to escap from the ordinari life . i do not call myself a veri success person , but i onc have taken a risk and my life had been better . first , some milionair famou in one area , onc wa a expert in other thing , and i think that happen becaus that those peopl know how to master on one kind of subject . henri ford , the father of car , onc wa a expert on a watch repair . he work as one to earn hi room rent and to studi mechan . then he thought about transport and invent car . next , the success is equal to the risky . which mean that when you have a high probabl of failur , then you have a high reward when you success . i am in middl school grade three , sinc grade two , i like a girl . she is in same school and i still like her . i want to say that i like her , but i got to shi when i stand in front of her . when i said that , i felt like fall down a endless cliff that i could never come up again , but when she laugh , said noth and look at me , i felt like a mattress hold me from the cliff , so i like her , and she know that i like her . lastli , risk are sometim make someth new or re-design some product . edison , the king of invent , onc tri to hatch an egg , and did not to go to school when in elementari school . hi mother taught him . when he were grown up , he made a telephon which wa alreadi made by alexand graham bell . howev , the edison 's phone wa better to hear , so peopl bought edison 's phone . in conclus , success peopl tri new thing and take risk rater than just do what they know and what they can do well .
