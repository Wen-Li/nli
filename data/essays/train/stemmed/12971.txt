i agre with the follow statement . becaus i think the sienc and tecnolog are develop . the oldest age , peopl could not speak word and they did not have cloth and shoe . then they could cook a littl bit . but nowaday , we can have a lot of cloth and shoe . and we can cook lot of food . becaus peopl and sienc and tecnolog have develop each other . if peopl did not find sienc and tecnolog , we can not live such now . so i think we can not live if old peopl could not find sienc and tecnolog and they did not develop . `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i think so . becaus peopl and sienc and tecnolog are develop now . for exampl , now comput are one of the most use thing . and there are a lot of the most use in the world . i think car is one of the most use thing . becaus , when i want to go shop and fish and drive , i can go to there soon . but i think cara are develop . so i may think next car is faster than now car . and i think next car are fli car . so i think in tenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i don not think peopl will hate car . peopl like car . becaus car is more use than pepl walk . so peopl will buy the next new car . and peopl do not need now car . if next car is faster than now car , and more use , i will want to buy a new car .
