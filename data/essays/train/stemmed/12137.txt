i do not agre with thi statement . although i consid it to be veri import to have a solid knowledg of academ subject in gener , which mean a certain amount of basic knowledg of differ topic , i think that one should have a specif subject in which one is special and on which one should set one main focus . long ago , in the time of goeth and schiller or newton and descart , it ha been possibl to acquir an amount of knowledg which offer the possibilti to take part in all import discuss about all scientif topic and even about art , literatur and music . at that time it wa possibl to be an expert in differ area of scienc and cultur and goeth for exampl even consid himself an expert in all scienc . but those time have pass . sinc scientist ha made enorm and unparallel discoveri and invent throughout the last centuri the amount of knowledg which is access today is overwhelm . accord to a studi by the begin of the 20th centuri thi amount wa doubl everi seven year . today it is multipli by seven everi two year . henc no human bee is abl to deal with all of it and consequ it is necessari to have scientist go straight into one specif direct to creat the possibilti to acquir even more knowledg . in mathemat for exampl there are topic about which onli a dozen peopl in the world can exchang their idea becaus nobodi els would even understand the problem those person are deal with . so in order to make new invent and discoveri as well as to enrich mankind 's amount of knowledg it is undoubt necessari to have expert who are special in specif subject and who are constantli - or as mention befor even exponenti - break scientif boundari . so in the end mani an invent would not have been made without the necessari expert .
