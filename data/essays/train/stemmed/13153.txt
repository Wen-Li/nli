i believ that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . obvious some young peopl do , but not enough of them . first , i believ it is veri import for young peopl to learn compass . and what better way to understand what compass is than by practis it by help your commun . adolesc is a shape time for a person . it is probabl the best moment to learn to help other . by do so , young peopl learn to becom matur and good adult . mani war have probabl been declar becaus adult lead a countri had not been suffici expos to help other when they were younger . therefor , train great adult is onli possibl by train young peopl to help their commun . second , if young peopl were spend more time help their commun , they would be better integr in it and they would show greater respect for their elder and neighbour . we can observ mani exampl of what happen when young peopl lack respect for their commun in most develop countri nowaday . in franc , earli 2006 , sworm of young peopl from the ghetto around pari and other larg citi burnt car and broke into shop . thi young peopl do not spend time help their commun . instead , they commit petti crime and spend their day do in their ghetto . it is difficult to imagin that nobodi need help in those area . anoth exampl are the gang in mani citi in the us . there , young peopl spend their time kill other gang rather than help their commun . third , in my experi , veri few young peopl actual help their commun nowaday . if i count how mani peopl have been help their commun among the young peopl i met so far , they are veri few . i guess that the lack of incent and the continu pressur of our societi tend to push young peopl toward enjoy themselv , avoid work and take an easi time . to conclud , i would say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . howev , it would be benefici for them and their commun as young peopl but as futur adult as well .
