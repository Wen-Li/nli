i can say that aproxim twenti year afrer today there will not be more car in use than they are in use today . in the technolog world everyth start to be more easi . the engin work in order to make more suitabl world for peopl . and everybodi know that the car are one of the major reason for the pollut . besid pollut they are seriou threat for the traffic crowd . in my opinion after a few decad they will be fewer car in use . subway will be establish everywher . it ha alreadi been use in most of the place in the world and it will be the easiest transit in the citi . it start to be use more than car in some of the citi which are veri big and veri crowd . the peopl who live in big citi got use to use the subway but in smaller citi there are still mani peopl who have never seen subway befor becaus they are not awar of thi easi transport machin they maintain to love their car and use them . i believ that when their citi are start to enlarg and when they will get red of the crowd they will want to use somet els which is much easier . moreov not onli the subway but also some other vehicl will be use after a few decad such as bycyl . there will be special road for the mani peopl will be more happi than they are today becaus they will be more healtier . they will go to closer place by use them . ofcous there will be still car on the road and somebodi will continu to use them but in my opinion it will be fewer car than today becaus the new gener is more consciou than we are today . they will find better solut becaus they will be awar of the world 's beauti .
