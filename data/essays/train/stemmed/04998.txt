i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do . from the simpl obvers , young peopl have more activit in their everyday life than the older peopl . they go out for travel , go sport , or danc , and so on . they seem enjoy life more than the older peopl . but it is superfici . we ca n't get the conclust just from the more activit they take . whether it is enjoy life or not depend on the qualiti , motiv , emot of entertai and other deep factor . the motiv and qualiti of activ differ between the young peopl and the older peopl . thi lead to the fact that the older peopl more enjoy life than the young peopl when do entertain . the older peopl usual have more spare time than young peopl . therefor , when they do their actit , they realli enjoy their time . but for young peopl , a lot of pressur alway make their activit rush or pushi . most of time , the activ of young peopl just help them releas and relax a littl bit , becaus they will put themselv into tougher situat later or they just are exaust from a veri tough time . the deeper factor affect the conclus come from social and psycholig side . the societi usual give more expect to young peopl . on the other hand , the young peopl are still in the develop period . thu , there are mani uncertainti enfront by the young peopl . they need to develop themselv , recogn the societi , and adjust themselv into the world . therefor , for the young peopl , chanlleng and unstabl are good for them but they realli bring mani difficul or obstacl for them , includ physic and mental . it is realli hard to say thta they enjoy their life while face so mani problem . but for the older peopl , they have alreadi experi most of their life . they are more calm , and stabl . so , they are more enjoy their current time . in sum , young peopl do n't enjoy life more than older peopl do .
