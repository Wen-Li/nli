the given statement is `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' . i disagre with the abov statement becaus , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject seem to be alright when in childhood , but thi seem to be complex and cumbersom as we grow older and older . firstli , if we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , it becom difficult to identifi our main domain properli . for an exampl , consid a high school student . if he need to have a broad knowledg of mani subject even after hi high school , apart from hi person interest which he show at a particular subject , the decision-mak strategi of perceiv higher studi becom troublesom . secondli , if we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , the frequenc at which we do get updat about these subject greatli matter . we need to have a greater frequenc of updat in all area , which is not a simpler task . for an exampl , consid a student studi comput scienc . the other academ subject includ some main aspect from electron , electr , commun and like wise . the frequenc at which he get updat in hi core subject ( comput scienc ) slow down if he need to have broad knowledg of other academ subject . thirdli , have broad knowledg of other academ subject do help , but not at a consider rate . consid the exampl illustr in the abov ( second ) aspect , the student could hardli get bug in other area which he integr with hi core subject . in recent day , debug mechan are in plethora and it can be said that a person need not have a broad knowledg of other academ subject . consid the abov reason , i conclud that i disagre with the given statement .
