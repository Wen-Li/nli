`` it is better to be special in one specif subject , than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . '' today , the societi is made in such a way that it focus on `` equal '' amongst all . thi fact is support and shown in mani part of the societi such as school and sport team . a school is a place where student are enabl to gain knowledg on whatev subject need to live in a societi . the problem seen in mani school is that often school requir everi student to know the same subject and doe not allow them to special in whatev they want to studi . that is , most of the school see valu in build broad , variou knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one . ye , it is a fact that mayb broad knowledg about variou subject would help student learn to live smarter in the societi , but it also ha a great chanc of ruin student ' specif abil or potenti that they origin have . everyon is differ in their own way , and more importantli , they are good in their own way . that is , there is not much of a need to know various-but-broad subject , for they will be provid with shallow knowledg onli . instead , student shold decid to go to whatev field they want to go , and special from there . learn tini bit of everyth would onli kill uniqu and produc same among the student . the exampl and problem of have everyon with the same skill level is shown by japanes nation soccer team . tradit , japanes coach consist on have hi team player have the same exact abil in everi field ; run speed , shoot sens , pass , stamina , etc . the problem with thi is that even though the team might not have to worri about anyon lack specif abil , it will suffer from not have anyon realli good at anyth . in soccer there are offens , middl , and defens player . but what if everyon had the same exact style of play ? what good there is to have a goali who can run as fast as the offens player ? that is , not just that game will be bore due to the way they play , but they will be unsuccess as well becaus they lack player with special skill . striker score goal becaus they are skill in that field , and goali save shot becaus that is what they are good at . therefor , not just soccer player , but student should also learn to be uniqu and special in one field where they can shine . in conclus , it is better to be special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg on mani academ subject . thi opinion wa support by typic school and japanes nation soccer team exampl . to summer up , be uniqu and special in your own field !
