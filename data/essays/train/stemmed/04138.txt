some peopl said that travel with guid are bore and noneffect becaus they have to move accord to maden plan . but i agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . to begin with , guid provid servic for travel to enjoy the well-known place for it fullest . becaus guid have lot of knowledg of place , travel are not need to prepar to know about them . as a result , they can spend remain time to enjoy the travel . for exampl , when i wa in high scool , i went to je-ju island . a beauti guid help me to acquir a number of inform i 'd never known and i rememb the full stori of je-ju island until now . on top of that , we do n't have to make plan owe to guid . usual peopl make an effort to plan where to eat and sleep , and what rout to go through . but guid get rid of all concern . becaus they have alreadi held mani travel and had maden plan . we are requir to just enjoy the travel . we ca n't watch place that are not in plan , of cours . but we are abl to get enough inform . if i have a chanc to travel , i would like to go to america . it ha veri extend territori and mani beauti sceneri . but i do n't know where to go first , sleep and eat . although i can prepar the plan through mani book , but i have no time to spend to it . in conclus , i have to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
