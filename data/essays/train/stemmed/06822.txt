i think in my opinion that success peopl tri thing and take risk rather than onli do what they know . i think that succes peopl are the type of peopl who are not scare of anyth and they are readi to take the risk without look at the neg side of it . and if they look at it they tri to solv or chang these neg thing to posit thing . the succes peopl are peopl who take the risk know that it might be wrong or it might also be right . they are peopl who studi the risk they are take from all side . they know what to do in the right time . these peopl tri new thing and take the risk becaus they know what is correct and they know what to choos . the succes peopl are ordinari peopl who were like us but the onli differ between us and them , is that they have brave heart and are readi to take the risk without look at the consequ . their are a ; ot of exampl in the world of peopl who took alot of risk and becam famou and succes . the most famou exampl of a succes man in the world in my opinion is bill gate . i think so becaus when he and hi friend invent the ` window program'they new that it wa a risk to invent it and sell it . but when he took the risk he wa on the right track , hi money start increas . he becam the world richest man and the owner of one of the biggest compani in the world . so i think that succes peopl are ordinari peopl like us but the differ between us and them is that they are the first in take the risk , without look at what the resuli will be . i think that their a lot of peopl who can be like them . but the onli problem is that they are not brave heart like the succes peopl .
