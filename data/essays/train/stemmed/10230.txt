i disagre with thi statment , i think older peopl enjoy life more then yonger one , becous older peopl have the money , the time the and health . as of the money older peopl have alot of money form their save over the year , form down size as they dont need to be in big hous so they down size as they move in smaller hous and get alot of money from thi , also they have their retier plan which give them good money everi month which they can relay on . as of the time mostof them are retier so they have alot of time to enjoy so you will find them travel alot engag in social activ do fanci sport like golf , sail and fish which need alot of money and time . if we go through the econom magazin we will find alot of atrtic about the elderli peopl and the babi boomer and how much they spend on travel , entertai and sport . also they have exel health servecis they have the most advanc health facil in the world , you can see now that the avarag life span for the femal in the usa is 79 year & for the male is 73 year , so they have everi thing to enjoy thier life . on the other hand youner peopl have to work veri hard to pay their bill for exampl if a graduat student is work in a good job and have good career he ha to work veri hard in order to pay hi student loan , if he dosent have a loan he ha to pay hi mortgag on hi hous , if a young person doesnot have an acadim dgree he or she ha to work in more than one job in order to live decent life so after a hard work day both of them donot have the time or energi to enjoy or do some thing els , and if they want to do ani thing they have to plan it a year ahead charg it on credit card and then pay later over the year with the intrest , also younger peopl have to work hard and plan for their retir . so after all these reson i think older poepl are enjo their life more then younger one .
