nowaday there are two mani car in our citi , almost all peopl over age use one , that mean that a lot of pollut is produc . thi import quantiti of polut wo n't carri ani benefit for our life either for our children 's life . peolp need to move to one place to anoth a lot of time dure a day so they need a way of do thi movement , today car are the onli solut avali . in my opinion we all should stop an think for some alten . we should think in our futur morov , we should think in the futur of our next gener . i think peopl sinc a littl time ago peopl had start to realiz about thi issu , they had start think about other method of move themselv to one place to anoth , howev nobodi is think about lower the number of car in our planet but on the other hand they are think about the idea of build nonpollut car . so the possibl of reduc the number of car is nowaday too far away unless a new way of travel could be develop . in addit not mani peopl is interest in lower the product of car . the car industri is one of the most powerful industri all over the world , it produc a lot of profit to the main countri and too the powerful peopl involv . abov all , in twenti year there wo n't be fewer car in use than there are today . anyon is interest in lower the number of car furthermor a new way of travel is not easi to be develop in such a short period of time , howev we need to consid serious the option of build better and cleaner tipe of car . that will contribut in reduc the pollut as the same time it give benefit to the peopl that have interest on it .
