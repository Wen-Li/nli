idea and concept will play a major role in the develop ani product or compon . so , i strongli accept that a student ha to understand idea and concept . in today world we have come accros mani robust and complic product . for exampl , car , comput and mani autom machin . these product were develop by engin by understand proper background inform of it and it work principl , to get all these thing done we need to understand the concept and idea of it . for exampl , to design a bike , we have to understand the work principl and what is exactli requir in order to make it work in an effici way . when we understand the abov need we can have an idea to fabric it . today we have mani student who are veri dull in their studi and they just memoris the answer and reproduc the same in the exam paper . but they dont understand the concept of the chapter or work of a particular componentand , eventu when they finish there educ they will not have abil to implement the concept to develop a product becaus they have not understood the concept well . so , today scienc and technolog ha mani complic concept were student are find difficult to learn it . sometim , fact also requir to learn from fact . for exampl , when a solid object is immers in water , an equal amount of water is displac out which is equal to the weight of the solid object whic is a fact that can be seen . thi inform is veri useful for marin engin which is got by a fact . so , i alway understand the concept and idea in ani subject rather then giong by a fact . i have done thi from my childhood and help me a lot to learn so that i can implement the same to invent more and more product which is favor to the peopl .
