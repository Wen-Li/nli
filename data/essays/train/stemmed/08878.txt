youth are the back bone of ani nation . the develop of nation is in their hand . so they do lot of thing which includ help to commun . as be of the same group i would like to disagre with the statement . youth have a lot of repons in build strong nation . though they are involv in their restless work they do spend some time for the benefit of other . the strong reason for my disagr is they help the commun with their profess also . they are hell lot of young enterpreneur who are look forward to help the societi by provid employ . i would like to mention the charit organis be establish by variou mnc 's where lot of youth work for it . they concentr on variou basic emin like drink water , lay road , conduct awar camp , oldag home . all these organis are run by the youth in a fantast way . though they do not directli involv inth action the are the back bone of variou organis . i would like to notifi thi exampl from my person life , dure our colleg day we use to dedic 2 saturday of everi month to plant tree in variou commun besid our colleg and we were awared for that and take that spirit we are still continu . the work done by youth do not attract mass media or other mean as they feel it as a duti rather than repons . the awar camp condut by youth against aid ha been a exel program in the histori of our countri . help to other need not requir ani organis and work under it it can be a small help that you contribuit for other welfar and especi for the needi . in a nut shell , i state the be consid as a duti youth are play a key role in improv the standard of the societi by contribut qualiti of work without expos to media beinga reason to supress our effort .
