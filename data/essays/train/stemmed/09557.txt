i believ that everi stage of life ha it purpos . as the say goe , ` there 's a time for everyth ' . a time to enjoy be young and a time to enjoy be old . sure , i can relat to the feel of miss the younger year . those time seem to have been better than the now . when we are young we are usual happier , but , sadli , that is caus by ignor and a lack of respons . for exampl , peopl who are around 20 year old could seem to be happier than peopl over 30 , but that doe n't mean that there are no complic in the younger way of life . when peopl are over 30 they are veri like to have been through the challeng in life that defin a person and make him or her to be call an adult . also , it could be veri stress to be an adolesc or even a kid , with all of those thing that you need to surviv to be abl to call yourself a grown man or a woman . older peopl seem to be less fun i suppos . but that is not the rule . there 's no need for us to expect that everi grown up is bore and not funni . i believ that if peopl can find a way not to lose that spark they had when they were younger it could be a fun way of live for sure . i can see that life could becom more and more enjoy as we grow up , and i bet that it is go to stay that way as my yet young life span into the futur . furthermor , i can recal be a kid and wish to be smarter and more matur , i want to be abl to understand life and the way thing are in the world . and that vision can onli be achiev through experi . in conclus , i would say that i prefer to be old and wise than to be young and silli .
