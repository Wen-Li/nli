major peopl see a lot more advertis . some peopl say that by see the advertis , they are judg whether they are good product or not . hower , when thi topic come to me , i firmli believ that advertis ha a lot of drawback . advertis foster a instant consum , and a lot of compani adapt famou actor and actress with expens model payment . i n addit , through an advertis , peopl do n't think which product is good or not . to begin with , advertis foster a instant consum . when i came to new-york , i wa realli interest in victoria secret advertis , which made me buy a lot more it product even if i had lot of innerwear alreadi . i could not say that the advertis wa the worst thing for me . what is more , a lot of compani adapt famou actor and actress with expens payment . even though , the price of product is pretti cheap , we have to pay it advertis fare invis . we would be pay more expens price , consid qualiti of product . it goe with out say that advertis is realli disadvantag . final , peopl do n't think anymor which product is good or not . especi , the youth prefer to get specif product , such as nike , cocacola and ipot ( mp3 ) , etc . they want to have some product that the famou actor or actress advertis although it cost a lot of money . these event may caus social problem . i may well say that davertis is harm for the youth . to sum up , as might expect , advertis ha mani shortcom as i have mention abov .
