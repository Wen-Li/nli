i 'm complet agre with thi sentenc . in fact i beleav that i live in the gener of advertis . in thi period what the peopl say is more import than the real qualiti of a product . on televis or on the page of newspap there are alway an infin of sponsor product : shoe , t-shirt , cap , but also ham , biscuit or differ type of chees . we can find all type of product . all day my prefer footbal player or the champion of the world of tenni suggest me what is the product better for me and how i have spent my time . and i do n't buy a particular object onli for it qualiti or it price , but also becaus i see it on journal . thi is the scope of market : `` to make product better than they realli are '' . thi is an econom law and some firm know it veri well . the same product with differ brand ha two differ valu , it is caus by contin advertis . realli thi product are not better than other without a famou brand , often they are product of low qualiti , but onli with a good testimoni or a good sponsor .
