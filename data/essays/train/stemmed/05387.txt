i agre with the statment say that it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than yo specil in one specif subjet . i believ that it nice to know mani thing and to learn to mani thing u dont have to be special in everyth you learn but it good to know a bit of everyth . it feel good when u sit somewher and say their talk about polit for exampl beacaus you have a background about rthi field you cant join them in the confers and not just stay quiet and be useless . and if it wa about time that u dont have time to learn all these thing you dont have to learn everyth in one day everyht take time you might stay a coupl of month learn one subject there noth yo be asham of becaus in the end your gonna make a differens even if the thing you were learn you think ise n't somth will make a chane but it will even if u dont note it but evantu u will . if it wa for me i would want to be an e.r doctor to help peopl , a loyer to put all what bad behind bar and to becom an invesig to help solv crime . it funni that i want to be all these thing but in the end if i dont becom workijng inb ani of thow carri i know that someon will and that their do it for a good caus and that they want to help other becaus in the end if everyon put their brain where is suppos to be and by work togeth we will make a differens and we will chang what go and will destro what wa distori us but know becaus we will all stand togeth no one and anyth could distroy us again . so i believ that it is great to be a person who ha veriati of differnet academisc knowledg .
