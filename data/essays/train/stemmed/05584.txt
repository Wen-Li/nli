even at certain extent so call fact itself base upon the particular idea and concept behind it . basic the whole matter of thi world depend on particular idea and concept of it exist or creation . here if we dont understand the idea or concept of particular thing then we take is as fact and we accept it as it is . so i would certainli cent percent agre to the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea or concept . becaus , if we want to understand the thing as a whole then we need to conceptu that thing , we have to understand the content from the grass root level of that matter . then onli we will be capabl to solv the puzzl behind it and can explor the real etern truth base upon the logic conceptu and critic think . as for the exampl , if the student want to learn the math taught in hi class then he need to understand the basic concept from the fundament level itself . so that in futur he can build hi further studi or profession career base upon that distinct concept of hi subject . anoth reason i would like to project is that if the student accept the studi matter or ani thing as simpli as it is explain without get the ration or logic behind it then there are more chanc for student to flunk in their exam , especi when they just mug up the thing as one of the fact or phenomenon . thi kind of attitud toward studi may endang them in their futur prospect whenb they go in thier profession life . thu , i would l ; ike to conclud that student should understand the idea and the concept rather than fact .
