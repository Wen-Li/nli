i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take rist rather than onli do thing they alreadi know how to do well . but is it onli possibl to do new thing and take risk when you have enough money ? normal thing like go to the cinema or make a travel in the own land is to bore for these peopl . mayb they have also made these thing and now they want to see some other . i also think that these peopl do these crazi thing becaus they are affraid of loos there money or do not be rich for a long time . so in these short time they want to see as much as they can and take the chanc . normal rich peopl are in a rich societi . these peopl do not want to speak about a film you saw last week in the cinema . they want to hear about your last adventur trip in thailand or someth like that . some thing you can onli make when you have enogh money . and i think that anybodi want to make so special thing but have no money for that . so it would be onli a dream . but i also think that it is better to have some dream and go work for it , as you have the money and can not join the special thing . for rich peopl mani thing are normal , to normal . they think drive a big car and make an adventur trip everi half year is as normal as eat and drink . when peopl have to much money , so much money that they do not know what to do with it , they often do not get enough from all and that is whi they take risk to be happi . i think peopl who have to much money should give it to an organ who give it to poor peopl for which is it not normal to eat or drink .
