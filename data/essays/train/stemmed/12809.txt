i believ that young peopl these day do not give enough time to help their commun . in next few paragraph , i 'll provid reason behind my belief . firstli , young peopl today are rais in a small famili , an averag size of 3 or 4 . the figur indic that young peopl would have one brother or sister at most . peopl rais in such environ will take less consider of other . in other word , they will turn out to be selfish and self-centr . they do not know how to help or when to help other , not to mention their commun . 20 year ago , when the averag size of a famili were anywher from 4 to 8 , peopl did not have the percept of young peopl not help heir commun . young peopl back then were so use to live in a larg group . they were natur rais in a manner that they would appreci their surround . secondli , young peopl nowaday are so tide up with their normal duti that they do not have to spare ani time for anyth els . they are live in a veri competit environ . they are constantli push to excel in academ , sport , and etc . whatev activ they are engag in , they are under constant pressur to perform . natual , in order for them to compet with other , they invest lot of time and resourc . i know a 8th grader who finish school at 3 pm . after she come home and had a bite , she goe to see a privat math teacher . after math , she goe to see an english teacher . by the time she 's all finish meet her privat teacher , it 's alreadi 11:30 pm . she come back home at 12:00 am , wash up and goe to sleep . she doe thi everyday . kid like her just do not have ani spare time for anyth els . even if they do , they wo n't be abl to alloc enough time . due to abov two factor mention , young peopl nowaday can not give enough time to help their commun .
