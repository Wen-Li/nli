`` in twenti year there will befew car in use than there are today '' . thi statement can tell me a person who do n't beliv in the progr of ani citi . there are the peopl , that say thi , becaus they use the car onli twice on the week , but for exampl , an transport that use the truck or the her car for th eher job , he can not think minim , that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today . in my opinion is that there are will be mani car in use in the next futur . one reason , for my opinion , is that the car is one import part of progr , becaus what will began the world , is there decreas the number of car . i think will there are more problem on the trasport sector , prahp the onli point better of view is that there are littel pollut on the air , that we breath everi day . to resolv thi problem thare are differ solut , that can be an chang of kind of car 's engin , as a engin that ha as power the idrogean or the light 's solar . therefor , i hope a world with few car , but thi is not possibl , becaus the peopl is increas and they need job , and last ring of thi cirl is a transport with car .
