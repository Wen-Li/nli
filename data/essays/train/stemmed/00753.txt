i disagre with thi statem which say that understand idea and concept than learn fact . when you listen to somebodi 's lectur or opinion , you might have question about it . then , you might start research what the fact is . imagin that you are in class , be taught about histori . your teacher tell you one event with read a text book . you becom interest in that histor event . it is proov the event is true , i think , howev , it is not the onli anwser , becaus no one saw it acutu . you can start research to find the fact . you might get much deffer inform about it . that is the fact about that histor event . howev , as you learn the fact , you can have your own opinion about it . i believ that have your own opinion is the most import thing . understand the idea and concept is impot , becaus it give you a chanc to have question . learn fact mean that includ understand idea and concept is more import . moreov , you can see the fact and have your opinion about matter .
