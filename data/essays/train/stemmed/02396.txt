i think thi statement is absolut right . when we face it we have to realiz that there are less success peopl than averag peopl . whi ? the question is whi one peopl is succes and the other is not . becaus the succes peopl have tri someth that no one tri befor or mayb ever tri but not as well as the succes peopl did . thi mean that to be sucess you have to tri someth which ha never be done befor or work and focu more on someth than other peopl . for instanc , whi did the star becom so famou ? at the begin a celebr is a person like anybodi els but to becom famou she ha to make a movi origin , tri someth which is gonna work someth special mayb somethign that nobodi ha made befor . she or he ha to be veri imagin . the risk taken will bring her or him at the top or mayb down but the risk wa taken . an anoth exampl mayb more reliable. a scientist is a person who need to take huge risk to have the chanc to find someth to cure ill or someth els . what would we have discov if none of scientist , chirurgian and doctor took risk . the respons is easi we wouldn t have discov anyth . they tri someth new for the cancer research for exampl and took risk to find someth out . it is the same stori all over again for other sector or other profess , you can t get sucess just in do the same thing than other do . you have to have your own person , you have to be differ in a lot of way somehow , you must take risk , you must tri until you get what you want or until you suce . in my opinion you can t be success is your just get into the stream , you must get out of the stream and follow your own strategi , experi new thing and bet on risk . you might suce or not but at least you would have tri .
