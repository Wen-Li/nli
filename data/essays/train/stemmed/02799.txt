accord to my point of view , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus even they do n't know the concept clearli it is not possibl to solv ani problem regard topic . suppos we have a problem to solv , then first we have to understand the problem clearli and we have to think about idea to solv the problem . then onli we can solv the problem easili . even we know all fact about that problem , we ca n't do ani thing . for exampl , if student ha given a puzzl to solv , then he know all the fact about solv puzzl . he know all the rule in solv puzzl , without implement ani idea he ca n't solv the problem . the main purpos of implement of idea is to choos the shortest way and less time to solv that . here for the student not onli to know the fact within the problem , he ha to know the whole concept around the problem then onli he would get new idea which are to be implement in solv the problem . after the learn of concept about the problem we have to understand the idea which have to be implement insolv problem . not onli to learn fact , definit understand and let them know the concept . the student who have learn fact , ca n't do anyth without practic implement . we have to improv them from the learn stage in practic method in everi aspect . thi practic method contain that understand the concept clearli and think about the idea to solv ani thing . it better to prepar them mentallyt that they are in practic . so as far as i concerncern first thing for student is understand the concept . at final i conclud it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
