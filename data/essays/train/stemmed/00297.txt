in my opinion , young peopl in variou commun from sever cultur becom less concentr on their commun and thi should be conceiv as one of the main sociolog concern for the societi in the world . so i do total agre with the statement put front . as countri develop econom and social and relat within the societi in question becom more complic in variou term . the young peopl are get isol from their own commun . howev thi situtaion is valid for all of the societi . and thi concept is get affect from a wide varieti of sub factor rang from government polici aim the countri match up with the rest of the world , to easi to reach inform with the help of the technolog advanc . in a world surround with above-ment condit , the young peopl are put forward in a race of get the best in everi field . with thi motiv , the young peopl mainli concentr on themselv rather than particip in assist activ toward their commun . rather they do deal with studi a lot , get into other activ toward self develop , attend new class , etc . of cours it should not be assert that thi kind of activ are bad but their role on affect youth should not be underestim . to decreas the neg impact , there should be some incent and courag factor for the youth to associ with their commun and social . becaus by thi way , the youth will find the opportun to get interact with it societi and feel and conceiv the factor and cultur aspect form his/her societi . within these frame , i think , the fact that youth can not assign enough time for help their commun is mainli base on the environment condit as a whole and some measur can be taken by the societi in order to prevent thi alien of young peopl to their societi .
