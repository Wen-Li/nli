i strongli agre with latrer statement that it is better to have knowledg in a specif subject . my reason for the agreement for specil in a specif subject are as follow . it is a compulsori requir for everi one to get well skill in ani field for their surviv . for thi everi one must studi a particular subject of their interest . for exampl , a comput programm , a surgeon , etc , . these peopl who are well train regard to their field subject can surviv better by serv to both compani and public . for exampl a specialist in heart surgeri may serv peopl and often will bring a good name for hi hospit . like that an economist can serv better for hi countri . onth other hand if one have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject like math , physic , chemistri , econom , etc. , it seem great of hi knowledg , but it will becom difficult for him to choos in which field he can serv better . obvious , he can not abl to choos ani two option . if he chooes ani one , after a short period hi mind may think of anoth field that he is familiar with and surelyh might be confus . how ever it is better to have askil on one subject that we are familiar . even the great scientist also special in one specif subject onli . for exampl late sir newton . hei a veri great scientist who wa familiar with physic . hi major work in physic brought a new revolut in the field of physic scienc as they solv mani problem . final , i strongli believ in that the person must be special in onli one subject rather than have broad knowledg in mani subject .
