the issu at hand is whether one should tri new thing and therefor put someth at risk , or just stick to area one alreadi ha experi in . in time of global , economi develop at an enorm pace - peopl do have even less time to , for exampl , invent new theori or machineri . otherwis they will not be abl to compet success in a global economi . thu , it is import to alway explor new area , in order to remain competit . i am strongli convinc that research is one of the essenti key to success for mani industri - research can open new , fascin oportun that will help your compani to be success . howev , research reli on move into field that have not yet been explor . in order to invent someth remark new , peopl alway have to think one step further . if one compani tri to keep to it root and therefor avoid bee progress , failur will not wait long . moreov , get an insight into new , unexplor area is not onli use but also highli interest - not onli for research themselv but also for custom who steadili are long for new technolog in all field of industri . peopl are use to , to alway have someth newer and better than their neighbour - if thi competit end , peopl would loos one of their main goal in live . therefor , compani do have the task to satisfi their custom 's need , by explor new technolog , if they want to remain success . i am of the opinion that take a certain risk , to some extend , is n't even evit . a risk-fre life is not imagin to me , due to the fact that you have to take decisison repeteadli , without knwo what come out . peopl who are not abl to make ani decis at all will definetli not have a good job , a satisfi life and and therefor will definetli not feel happi . to sum up , not onli compani but also individu - so to speak , everybodi - need to take a certain risk , if they want to be success .
