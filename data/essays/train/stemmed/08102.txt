as it ha been shown by histori , countri which have been special in the product sector , have been grow econom faster and more effectiv . in my opinion , thi can be compar with the differa big rang of knowledg in sever academ subject and the special in one subject . concentr in more than one subject , alway mean to neglect some import issu of anotheron . thi caus to a wide knowledg of certain subject , but alway lead to onli an averag understand of the materi . an exampl for it is play mani sport at the same time , and bee an averag player in it , or concentr and focus onli on one particular sport and tri to becom as good as possibl . then you will probabl be one of the best in your team , which is in my opinion much better . but thi could differ among variou charact . but the more import reason whi i total disagre to thi statement , are the chanc in find a job after univers . the better a person is in one sector , the more outstand he will be in comparison to other applyer and so he will increas hi chanc . especi in nowaday peopl , those , who have not a nearli perfect or adaquat practis and experi in a certain section will not find a higher wage job . last but not least , it is much harder to tri to maintain a certain level in differ subject , becaus at least some of the theme can not be compar among all the class and have to be learn by hard singularli . to conclud , i want to claim , that in my person opinion , not concentr and stick on one issu is less effectiv than tri to be good in sever academ task .
