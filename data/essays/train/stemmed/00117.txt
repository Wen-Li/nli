i agre with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . when we travel to some new place for ex pushkar which is in india , thi place is total new to me and i have no idea on what exactli i should be see and look for . the signific of thi place is known to me but other then that i have no clue what exactli it stand for . tour guid are those peopl who will know the in and out of thi place and they will have wide rang of knowledg about thi place and it tourist point . so onc when we reach thi place and visit place like brahma templ which is one of it kind in the whole world , from these tour guid we will get to know more about the templ , the histori , other signific etc . apart from the templ they will take us to all the other place which is famou or ha some other histor stand . and be in a group it alway fun becaus we can have lot of interact and have load of fun . apart from thi if these tour guid are travel with us from our start point ( the place where we depart from ) they will take care of all the hotel book , our lunch / dinner , the number of day we need to stay , the amount of time we need to spend at each place and etc . so we tend to benefit more from them and the extra cost we will have to pay for thi will be neglig . when the tour guid is take care of all the abov thing we as tourist can just relax and enjoy the trip . the whole travel is organis in a proper way and it becom a wonder experi to be rememb for life long .
