i do not agre with the statement express the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , and thi for a varieti of reason . in the first place modern citi plan is partial lead toward a horizont , spread-out model of contemporari metropolitan area . exampl of thi trend are urban develop of citi like | lo angel , mexico citi and san paolo , which have spread over vast area . thi tipe of citi growth is go to enhanc the import of the car in everyday life , as long as we need to take the freeway to go to the groceri store . moreov i do not see chang in cultur that would caus peopl to buy fewer car . in fact car are also import to plan our day as we want to ; so that even if it wa more and more difficult to afford them , they would be still use becaus they would enabl us to be more independ with what we want to do and when we want to do it compar to public transport . car are also a statu symbol , and peopl are go to buy them not onli becaus they are use , but also becaus they can show theit statu by ownig a particular kind of car . it is extrem import for us to move , and be where we want to be at the conveni time . car and modern mean of transport such as buse and cheap flight allow us a grade of freedom in time and space that wa not even dream in other era , and thi is not go to stop . plu , car can give us freedom of movement combin with independ from other - except in traffic jam . thi in my opinion is the reason whi the number of car circul is not go to shrink in the close futur .
