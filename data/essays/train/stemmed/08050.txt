some peopl argu if it is a gener truth that it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than fact . but to be frank , i total think the idea and concept is more import than the fact . here are numer reason whi i agre with thi statement . understand the idea and concept is way more import than just learn the fact . both idea and concept are the two main element for student to understand what is go on and explain what is happen dure their learn period . it is like havin a good background alway make yourself more succesful . for exampl , my best friend and i both doin well in the english class , but when we were test on our toefl , he got lot higher mark than me . becuas he understnad the idea and concept . and i am n when student have a good understand of idea and concept base on the subject they are do . normal it help them to learn faster , and abl to memor it . most of the test question came from one simpl idea or concept , teacher just make chang to the question to make it look more tough . for those student who understand the basic idea or concept can easili answer the question . on the other hand , for those student that onli understand the fact can easili be fool and not get the answer correct . to sum up all of the exampl abov , i definatli agre understand idea and concept is more import than just lean the fact .
