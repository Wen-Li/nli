in my point of view there will be fewer car than today . the main reason for thi is the technolog develop that make the life easier day by day for today peopl . we can also take the oil reserv in to consider for the decreas of the number of the car . the technolog develop is so great and unpredict that one can do someth which might be onli a dream in the past like reach the inform he want just by click some button . therefor the develop may result in the develop in the mass transport and with the benefit of mass transport ; like the cost and availabl ; peopl will be will to use them instead of use their person vehicl . in twenti year there may be some kind of train which can go faster and cheaper than those of today ' or the mankind will invent a machin which can transport the peopl to anoth place in second just like we watch in the scinc fiction movi like ` battl star galactica ' or ' star war ' . there is anoth reason for whi there will be fewer car on the road that it is the lack of oil reserv in the world . when you think that the 99 percent of the vehicl use oil for the energi they need thi might sound more predict unless the man kind find anoth sourc of energi like sun or a kind of an element which can be use instead of oil . it doe not make much sens to say thi becaus the scientist spend more time to find ani other mean of transport than find useful element or sourc of energi to do the work which the oil doe today . henc the activ of the scientist have focus on new invent and new way of make the life easier and comfort . to sum it up ; in twenti year will there be fewer car or ani kind of vehicl in our world sinc the today 's activ of scientist show that the mankind is in search for an effici way of transport .
