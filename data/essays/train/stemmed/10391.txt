sometim they believ that learn fact is import for student . howev , i agre with the statement . thi is becaus understand idea and concept is prerequisit to learn fact and becaus learn fact itself would not have mene . i will explain these 2 reason . first of all , understand idea and concept is prerequisit to learn fact . student would not be abl to understand what the fact mean if they do not understand idea and concept . for exampl , suppos student listent to the news of first degre murder case . in thi case , student onli know `` bad person wa arrest by the polic '' . they have no idea about what the `` arrest '' and `` first degre murder '' mean . it is not use for educ student . on the contrari , if they have alreadi studi the concept of some legal term they can understand the case better . thu , they may be interest in law and they want to know law more deepli . thi is the effect of understand idea and concept . second of all , learn fact itself would not have mean . fact have mean onli after idea and concept are understand . for instanc , suppos that student are take class . speak of histori , if we just know `` presid washington is first presid of unit state of america '' , thi is just `` fact '' . but for the student who do not have ani idea and concept about it , is thi fact import ? who care about it ? they should not understand import of thi fact ( thi would be easier to understand if student are not american ) . howev , if student understand idea and concept of `` independ '' `` presid '' or someth , that fact can becom import one . as a result , studet can studi effect . of cours , i do not think learn fact ha no mean . rather , it will be help to student who are interest in outer world . all in all , though , i strongli believ that understand idea and concept is more import that learn fact becaus of avobe-ment reason .
