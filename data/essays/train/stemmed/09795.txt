onc i took an oral exam and it wa not go as well as i expect . in the end the professor said to me : `` i can see you have learn the topic but you have not studi it ! '' what did he mean with thi sentenc ? well , i learn all the fact and exampl from hi lectur but dure the exam i couldn ' t transfer them to the system he ask me about - it just wa n't enough . so if someon ask me if it wa more import for student to understand idea and concept than mere learn fact . i would tell him the follow : depend in which field you are studi in fact and number chang veri rapidli over the year , so get the whole concept might be the better approach . then it is veri easi to get certain fact use the world wide web , but get the right use out of them or find the right applic is a thing you have to learn and be train with . and then , if you understand the idea behind a process rather than learn the dull fact , the knowledg is preserv much better within your brain . most import of all if you get the idea and concept you can deriv abstract method that can adopt to new situat and system . therefor they are more valuabl than mere fact . but as alway it is n't as black and white as it may seem in the first place . allthough i would put the stress on understand the whole pictur more than just the detail , fact and exampl can help you especi dure the learn process . in the end idea and concept back with a few number and exampl give you a round profil and help you be a good student and becom a compet worker , scientist , engin or what els you choos to becom .
