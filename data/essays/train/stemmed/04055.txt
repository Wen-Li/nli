from my point of view it 's better to have a good knowledg of the academ subject in some specif profess and , insid thi profess , is good to special in one particular subject . so , as usual in live , the radic posit are not alway the right way to choos . to explain my point let me defin a basic framework . you have a set of profess , fo exampl , econom , law , art , etc. and insid one profess set you have some special field , for exampl , insid econom you have microeconom and macroeconom . final , insid a special field you have specif subject , for exampl , insid the microeconom field you have , consum 's behavior or firm 's behavior . in that sens , you have to choos a profess accord your personn skill . onc you choos your profess you have to know , al least in gener , all the aspect insid it . becaus the specif subject you choos alway deal with other gener topic . for exampl , if you choos econom and specif microeconom , you have to know some statist techniqu . final , of cours , you choos a specif subject . there 's an advantag in choos and specif subject becaus you can profund some subject and studi it better . eventu you can do some interest contribut to the theori and becam a refer research . howev , my point deal with the percept of live . if your onli objetic in live is to get some money to pay the bill , mayb it 's a good path `` know some of all '' , so you will never get unnploye . but i think , even with thi point of view , you can have more opporun if you special in one subject , due a few person could do your work .
