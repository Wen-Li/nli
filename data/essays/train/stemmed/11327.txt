i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . as we all know , technolog and scienc is develop quickli nowaday . so there is a big market on product and consum on car . how could human be can drop thi golden opportun to make money ? fisrt , if you live in a big citi with a car avail , you can easili get to the destin where you want to be . you do n't need to get on crowd buse and wast a long time just for wait buse ' come . for exampl , in the late even if you have someth urgent and also we know that it is realli hard to get a taxi or bu , then at that moment you got a car , your problem will be soon solv . second , now car are invent in differ style and even you can choos what content in it . so they are access to your need such as high-qual stero insid the car . then you can enjoy the music dure your drive . and more and more car will be produc by car factori . the price of car must be drop to the level that ordinari peopl can afford it . final , new energi are be invent by scientist . they will soon be use instead of petrol and gasolin . that is to say that car will scarc pollut our environ . so we do n't need to worri about those gase such as carbon dioxid and acid rain which destroy atmospher and constructur of our citi . all in all , we can clearli see that how a car is conveni to our life . my friend alway proud of that their can drive a car and they are veri addict to the enjoy of process in drive . so we can infer that there will be more and more peopl who are will to buy their own car and that will promot our countri 's develp .
