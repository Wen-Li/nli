i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know well . in my opinion when peopl are open to take risk and new challang , they will find more new thing in achiev their goal . in thi process they learn mani new thing and tri to implement it in do other thing . when peopl take risk they will work hard to achiev that risk or that particular challang . in thi way peopl will becom more success when they take risk and challang . peopl who do not tri new thing and do what they are alreadi expertis in will not work hard to achiev the goal or challang . they will not get innnov idea , becaus the protocol alreadi exist in which they are the expertis . the habit of lazi cultiv and by the confid level they have , they will ignor some typic fact and will not achiev what they need . by over confid they will ignor some import fact and will not work hard to achiev the goal and there by becom unsuccess . take the exampl of the invent the aeroplan . if the wright brother would have kept on tri the principl what they know and in what they are expertis , we could not have an aeroplan today . they went forward and took the risk of fli in the air with their model and while do the experi they got some new idea and the idea were implement in the design of the aeropaln as a result they were abl to design still higher model . if they would not have taken the risk , they would nothav been success in invent the aeroplan . take anoth exampl of find the pensulin medicin . if the scientist would not take a risk and would not have work hard and had implement hi old theori , he would not have been success in invent the drug . in my opinion , peopl who tri the same thing in which they are expertis in , they will loos the enthusiasm and zeal in find out new thing . peopl who take risk and challang and tri new thing will do well and are more success rather than peopl tri the same old thing in which they are expertis .
