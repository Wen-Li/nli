i agre that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do , but they enjoy their live in a differ way . young peopl do not care if they go to parti on weekend until they are exhaust , burn out , and physic in a bad mood . youg peopl even do not care , about the further problem of alcohol abus , nicotin abus and other drug , they strongli beliv that nobodi , even themself , could never take their live apart . they just live for the moment and do not take responsibilti , becaus there is nobodi for who it would be necassari . older peopl do enjoy their live otherwis , they are happi , if they can observ grow children , or grow natur with it 's neverend moment of live and death . the just enjoy to be part of a chang and move world . so my point of view is that mayb everybodi enjoy live , but in a differ style . mayb it is not fair to judg somebodi if he is enjoy life more than anoth person . everybodi is individu and that what make live enjoy . so everybodi should be lucki to be part of an individu and fast chang world , it doe n't matter if the person is young or old . my experi is , the the noth els effect the mood of a person more than the surround and the famili , which is respons for life circumst . young peopl may not respect thi matter of fact as old peopl do , they do know how import familylif can be for enjoy life . children , with devorc parent , may enjoy life than other children with work famili do . it is easi to see that the surround are import how and if you can enjoy your life . old peopl may have more life experi and do know what thing they do need to be happi in life , that would explain , whi young peopl experi so much in their teenagerlif until they can stopp and just be happi and lucki about just bee on earth and enjoy life the way life is .
