i think there ' re two group of peopl when we speak about success : peopl who gain a better posit use at best it 's own qualiti and other that reach the goal thank to the luck or to other peopl . in the first case if we pay attent to the past stori of the person who make success we can surelli find an invenct , an idea , a kind of stroke of geniu that chang his/her exist . i do n't state that luck is unus in thi occas , but i can adfirm that it play a secondari role . when we speak about success we gener refer to the world of our job . in my opinion it 's easi to see that often the success is relat to the abil of an individu to be abl to solv differ task in divers field . and these ecclettic can be form dure one 's life in mani way : the most import is tri to have interest in differ direct . risk to do someth we think we can ' t do permitt us to discov our limit and in mani case to trapass them . for these reason i agre with the statement . let 's consid a high-speci person in a job : we aspect him to defeat the oppositor thank to hi knowledg in hi field ; mayb he believ it too , so he doe n't look for new challeng . but nowaday it 's difficoult to find a situat we can solv use narrow skill ; we tri to cohoperact to fin a solut . thi show how we have to depend from other peopl if we do n't have the brave to risk and to aquir a broad knowledg also in field we do n't consid exactli as `` our '' . can we reach the success if our destini is so strictli relat to other peopl ? moreov we have to consid that thi peopl is often in challeng with us for a better posit . if we look for new experi which can enrich our luggag of knowledg , we break the bridg that unit us to our mate ; so we can find an easier way to the success . mayb it could be danger becaus a failur can stand for the gain of a lower posit . when we have the skill and we are brave enough to risk at the right moment we can manag to surpass lie peopl and to obtain success .
