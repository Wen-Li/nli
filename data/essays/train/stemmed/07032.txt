i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i will present a coupl of reason whi i do not agre with the statement . first , as technolog develop , there will be more advanc type of car in use in a varieti of way . . for exampl , in the present time , car are be use on the road , but imagin the car rune under the land , that is underground , or yet better , fli and run at the same time in the air and land . it would be possibl to drive a car on the road and air like fli car as we can see those kind of car in the movi . technolog is becom more and more sophist , and it will make our dream realiz in the futur . second , there will be altern power sourc avail in the futur . peopl who think there will be fewer car in use in the futur probabl consid the current energi problem . it is ture that the fossil fuel are limit , and other energi sourc have n't been yet practic . howev , the possibl of use altern energi sourc such as solar energi and geotherm energi is be intens studi , and near futur it will be much more real than now . in addit , a number of scientist are current involv in develop feasibl futur energi sourc , show a good prospect for the futur . in conclus , i strongli disagre with the remark that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . automobil will be one of the best transport mean avail in the futur as it is today .
