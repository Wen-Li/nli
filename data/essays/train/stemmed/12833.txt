in japan , some peopl think that young peopl give enough time to help their commun recent . howev , i age with the idea that young peopl do not do that for the follo reason . first , young peopl nowaday have seldom opportun to help their commun . for exampl , when i wa a student of secondari school in 1990 , i live in nagoya , which is the fourth largest citi in japan . in nagoya , there were some rule in my communiy that peopl had to gather onc a month , and had to pick up trush on the road near our commun . young person and children also requir to attend the activ . it take about two hour at one time , but i could contribut to the commun . but now , there are no activ like that in my commun and i hardli hear the exist of such an activ from my friend . thi exampl demontr that i strongli believ that there are not enough opportun for young peopl to help their commun . second , young peopl nowaday have littl sens to belong to their commun . for instanc , when i live in nagoya , the neighboor were so kind that there were mani opportun to meet them . i thought that the neighboor were close to me , and that the commun wa import for me . i alway want to help my own commun becaus i felt belong to the commun . but now , the neighboor becom more far away becaus peopl like to spend time more with their friend rather than with their neighboor . in addit , a sens of privaci increas now , peopl tend to keep a distanc from their neighboor . thi exampl clearli show that young peopl nowaday have littl sens to belong to their commun . therefor , i definit agre with the idea that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun recent .
