i agre with thi opinion . i have two reason for thi . at first , we will be abl to think about a thing with broad valu if we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i think that a person who special in one specif subject is apt to think about a thing with one valu . for exampl , we have to use knowledg of develo econom and environ econom at least when we think about how to improv the problem of develop countri . we can not think about how to solv it if we onli use one subject . at second , we need broad valu and broad knowledg in thi time . that is becaus the world is get intern more and more . we have to think about a thing at ani sight . for exampl , it is about problem of war . a war is difficult problem to improv . so we have to approach it with broad knowledg . we have to consid econom , financi and philosof problem of it . there are so mani thing in the world that we can not think and solv them without broad knowledg . for thi two reason , i think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . it is sure that the world ha mani complex problem . and it is also sure that these problem can not solv without broad knowledg . so i assur you that we must have broad knowledg and broad view in whole of our live .
