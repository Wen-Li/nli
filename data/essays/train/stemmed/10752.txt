i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . one of the best exampl that come to mind from my person experi is a mcdonald burger . have you ever seen a mcdonald commerci on tv or in a magazin ? the burger look big , juici and fresh . everi time i see one of their ad on tv i want to run to the nearest mcdonald to buy a big mac ! the problem is that when i get there and actual buy one of their burger i am alway left veri disappoint . the burger look in no way alik to the one you see on tv . it 's smaller and it sure doe n't look as fresh . the tast at the end is ok but the fact remain that their ad would never show what their real burger look like . otherwis nobodi would ever feel the urg to go out and buy one . advertis are therefor mislead . not alway but veri frequent . have said thi , if i were to make a commerci to tri to sell one of my product , i would probabl do exaclti the same thing . if everyon is do it , i do n't want to be the onli one be honest becaus thi would neg effect the sale of my product . the onli way to solv the problem is to help the whole advertis commun to be honest . we should alway rememb that consum are not stupid . they can be naiv at first , but not stupid . you can fool a consum onc , but the consum will never go back to you again if he is not satisfi with your product . at the end of the day , it probabl doe n't pay to delibar fool consum . they will find out sooner or later and they will punish you . thi be said , everyon is alway go to tri make their product seem a littl more appeal to the public . thi will never ceas . but the consum know thi and is awar of thi . in conclus , i will alway go back to mcdonald not becaus of the commerci i see on tv but becaus i like the tast of their big mac even though they look disgust !
