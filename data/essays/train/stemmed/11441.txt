in today 's world young peopl are tri to make their career as soon as possibl in order to get settlement in their life . and to achiv thi task they are work hard to earn good sum . so now a day young peopl are so busi that they have no time to help commun . young peopl are realli not worri about the commun they are live in , all they are worri about their work . it becaus of the stress they are put in to studi to work hard . to justifi thi particular point one of the best exampl is , in today 's world parent are more worri about thier childern futur so they are place their children in those school which give them educ for almost 10-12hr per day , if that is the case then what would the child posit work for so long hour and get tire for rest of the day . then how will he be abl to help commun infact in some case he cant help himself also . now a day educ is so much stress that young peopl have no time to look upon commun , atleast those young peopl even dont know that communit are in search of help . even in collag now a day they are given lost of home work to do that these young peopl are not in a posit to do other activ . i dont say that everi young man is of thi kind but there are some peopl who are realli help the commun for exampl in some colleg they go for camp to some remot area and draw their problem and they tri to sort of their problem by provid some fund to them . but there are some young peopl who think all these are of no use to them . so , as thi the case about the young peopl nowaday , it onc parent and teacher duti to let their young children know about the communit and let them also know about the good and bad , and also give them time to think about other thing apart from educ . if thi is done then iam sure there will be lot of chang in the communit becaus some day the same young man may need help .
