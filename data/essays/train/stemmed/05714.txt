i agre thi statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for follow reason . most of adverties are made of profession comput technit or profession team . and the stuff that advertis is not the onli stuff we can get , we might can get better stuff . first of all , most of advertis of cosmet attract mani women . by use thi lotion , mani women dream that we can get smooth and soft skin like thi model . but the face of model have retouch by comput . so nobodi can get the skin that have retouch by comput after all . i spent lot of money for lancom when i wa young . and i know i am a victim of thi kind of advertis . second , most of advertis of food in the restaur or fast food are better than real product . becaus when they make sampl of food mani profession work for that . for exampl , profession cook , food arrang advis , tabl arrang advis and cameraman work for that advertis . but onli part time staff work in real . third , advertis of fashion cloth or shoe are also better than real product . whenev celebr wear new fashion cloth , mani magazin put that pictur on it . and mani woman of all over the world tri to get same stuff and that caus higher price . if we can get same stuff , we can find same kind of stuff more cheap price at anoth place . when i got a bag that cameron diaz ha , i realis that . unless we have same style bodi or color of skin or hair , it doe not work for us . in conclus , i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
