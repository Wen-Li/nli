i strongli agre with thi statement . when i wa in secondari school i had to spend huge amount time in memor what year what treati wa sign on , what kind of crop wa import or export in and out of korea in what year , what philosoph found what school of philosophi . howev i do n't rememb much of those fact but i still rememb the idea and concept that i learn from mathemat or physic class . for anoth exampl i had attend `` principl of econom '' in korea about more than 10 year ago and i learn the same class in america last year . though mani of the concept were remind to me , i could tell the big differ , too . that wa i wa not expect to memor the name of the scholar or sever characterist of each theori without understand the concept first . i could not quit grasp the idea befor when i read some newspap articl in busi section about busi trend or reason for a new econom polici even after i had finish econom class in high school and colleg but i am smile in my mind pat on my back rememb the concept that i learn in class last year not 10 year ago that i just had to memor short fact and histori of econom . anoth good exampl is even though i wa not good at mathemat and had to spend a lot of time solv problem , that time help me to understand the concept of math and i still can help other student understand at least level of 8 or 9 th grade . howev i do n't rememb not much from histori class or chemistri that i had to memor and memor all those year , name of peopl or chemic . when you get the idea and concept you can util it and it is easi to appli to variou usag or purpos but when you onli tri to shovel short fact and knowledg into your brain it is highli probabl for you to lose the grip of that knowleg and you wo n't retain it long enough to share it with your children or your student .
