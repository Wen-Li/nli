it seem to me that young peopl spend time on someth they enjoy at the moment , but that doe not mean that young peopl enjoy life mroe than older peopl . in my opinion , older peopl enjoy their life more than young peopl do . my father , who is 57 year old and have life time job , seem enjoy the life more than my younger brother , who is 15 year old and still attend school . there are some reason whi i think that way . my younger brother goe to school everyday , yet he still have more time to spend on whatev he want to do . is he enjoy hi life ? the answer is no . he is often worri about the futur and all the problem he ha to face in order to succeed in the futur . he still ha no idea what he would becom later in life , and there are mani concern to achiev what he want to be . on the other hand , my father work at the compani and he is busi all the time . it seem that he ha no spare time to spend but he is enjoy the life veri much . he is more experienc than my younger brother and have more knowledg . when it come to the question of whether person is enjoy the life or not , i believ it is a lot to do with their experi . when you are older and more experienc , handl problem would be easier than when you have to face one in young age . sinc for my father , hi life goal as to get the job that he want and have famili is alreadi achiev , he ha no concern about hi futur . therefor he can enjoy life much better than my younger brother becaus he ha no concern about life that it make the life more enjoy . in conclus , the case of famili is not alway true for everi old peopl and young peopl . some peopl are abl to achiev their goal when they are still young and perhap such young peopl enjoy life more than some old peopl who is still struggl to achiev the goal . despit those case , i believ that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do .
