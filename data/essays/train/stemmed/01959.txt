thi statement which is about travel in group led a tour guid ha alot of opinion . some peopl prefer to not have a tour guid but also other peopl like to be eeith a tour giud . both of them they have diffrent reason and it complic when you want to compar between them . i think or agre that if i travel with group led i prefer not have a tour guid for two reason . first you will be control by the time and secound you will be in pressur if you have a tour guid . the tour guid will let you fowl the plan and and it will let youy control your time and you have to do the plan . maby one day you have a diffrent plan or you disscov a new place and you hav n't saw all the acctiv and you like thi place and you want to go again but , you ca n't becasus of the tour guid and you have to meet all your group with him . so that will caus you to ignor you disir an go with the tour guid . with the tour guid all member in the group will be in presseur becaus of the control of the tour guid . with the tour giud you ca n't do someth that you want to do it becus of the tour guid and you eill fell like you are in pressur . with the tour guid you will feel like you are in prusser in all the tripe even you are in an excit place and you like it and you want to spend more time in thi place but , you have to be careful on that becaus of time and you have to recpectth time so you ca n't waest the other or the tour guid time . inde the tour guid will let you feel in pressur all the tripe . these two import reason are the most mention with alot of peopl when they decid to travel everi where . so i think that the best way it not have a tour guid when you want to travel so , i dissagre with the statement about the trave with a tour guid and it better to you to travel without a tour giud .
