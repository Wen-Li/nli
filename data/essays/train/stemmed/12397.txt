i agre with the follow statement depend on my own experi . there are 3 reason support my point of view , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , the defin of learn someth is to acknowledg whi thing goe like that which is , in other word , to know fundat and the pricipl of it . to learn fact such as `` the sun rise everi morn and set everi even '' is not actual `` know '' someth , to understand whi the sun act like thi which could be explain as `` the earth is go around the sun '' is the real knowledg one can get . that 's whi either tradit school or experiment school both tend to explain clearli to student what 's go on under the consequ . sencond , the biggest differ between human be and anim is human can understand some mind or idea which , unlik simpli fact , are not visibl and make a conclus . some expriment state that , some kind of monkey can learn fact and make simpli conclus of what 's go to happen next . but they can not understand idea abov the consequ . that 's the advantag that human be live and develop . so it is of vital import to let student learn to understand idea more than just know fact . third , the yield of our societi come from creation and the follow construct . creation is a complex thing which base on the accumul of idea . when one have mani idea which like brick , he can easili put some of them togeth to make anoth thing like a build . and idea is also import to construct . while build some construct , to know how can it be stabl on ground is an idea of calcul . so it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
