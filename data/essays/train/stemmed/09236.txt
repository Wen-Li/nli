i dont believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are few reason for thi . firstli , in today world transport is the main import and essenti thing . peopl are use to go in their own vehicl to differ place . they are accustom to the use of their own vehicl . veri few peopl use public transport . almost everi person own a car . they find thi convini . second , if a person use hi own car , he will probabl reach the destin in less time . thu thi is time save and everi person want to save time . for exampl , a busi person who is alway busi in meet ha to attend anoth import meet in just few minut at some other place , he find hi car more convini than ani other mean of transport . he just reach the destin in time or probabl earlier . such is the imporat of car to a person . so it is not possibl for such person to stop use it . third , the person is free to use the car at ani time he want becaus he own it . thu thi give them more convini . for ex , a person want to attend a parti in the afternoon , he can reach the place within few minut if he use hi own car . but if he reli on some other mean of transport ( probabl public transport which will not be avail at our convini time ) , he would probabl reach the place after the parti is actual over . fourth , sinc the technolog is fast grow , today there are a wide varieti of car avail . sinc there is a competet market , the car are sold at lower price . it not a problem for a person to buy it . fifth , there are place which are access or which make them easier to reach onli if they go in their own vehicl . use a car also prevent the person from be expos to hot sun , cold weather and rain . thu a person would find thi more convini and cant restrict himself from use hi own car . thu i conclud that becaus of all the abov mention reason such convini , reduc cost , etc the usag of car will not be reduc .
