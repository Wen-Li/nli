i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is veri import for student to understand thing or idea which are told by the teacher or parent . the understand idea will be immens benfit to the student in mani way . if the student have thi capabl to understand thing they can acheiv ani thing , that mean they can win in ani feild . thi capabl of understand is also use in their futur . i mean thi understand is use while spend with their friend , and with their life partner . if there is good understand between friend and lifepartn , there is no possibl of clash . the student should have thi understand capabl from their childhood . the teacher and parent must have the respons of learn thi capabl to the children . thi understand capabl stand a person in veri high posit in the societi . the kind of peopl can surviv ani where in the societi . and these kind of peopl can solv their problem and they can solv their neighbour problem also . there by the peopl automat give respect to them . and there by they can increas their friend circl . it is benfit to them . ilern fact also import for the student . but it take lot of time for learn fact . in thi mean time peopl may do mani mistak . rather than learn , if the peopl have the capac of understand idea there may be littl chanc to do the mistak . for exampl if we can understand if touch the fire , it burn , we never comit that mistak . if we are not that capac of undersatnd , the fire burn us . that whi the undersatnd capabl is veri import for student .
