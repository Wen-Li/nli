it is a fact that nowaday young peopl do not give a lot of time to help their commun . but thi is becaus the do n't have enough time to spend in that way . school and univers take al lot of time dure the day and they are seen like someth that peopl have to do . for thi reason young peopl usual spend the remain time grow their hobbi , play with friend or go out to relax . the onli way to make them give a contribut to the commun should be to convinc them that thi can be funni and relax at the same time . in the past all the organ which envolv young peopl to commun event were often relat with the church , so today 's indiffer to commun problem or activ is mayb a reflect of today 's lack of influenc of church in our life . there are mani associ ( not relat with the chirch ) that tri to envolv young peopl organ workamp in their citi and give them a place to live and a job as volunt in a specif field like ecolog or social . work togeth with other young peopl and live with them for a while can transform a bore experi in a funni one and convinc more guy to join to the same project . thi is the reason whi thi kind of associacion like the sci ( civil servic intern ) are get bigger and bigger and the number of young peopl join is increas . televis and videogam are probabl make young peopl forget the commun and creat an individu life-styl , and i agre with thi , but i think that thi situat can chang by the action of these kind of organ that join the use work of a volunt to the funni experi which a young guy need .
