well , thi is an interstiong topic to be written about . come to the point of knowledg , it mean that master a field of work at studi . and thi is divid into mani branch like differ subject we take . mani peopl tri to take a few subject or a singl subject alon for their studi . thi also count for the field out of educ system . thi could be for the reason that they are interest in it and like to work on it . and moreov , peopl who are job mind , would work inyens on their subject of choic to master it and a good job base on it , leav the other subject unexplor ! accord to me , the involv of a person in a particular type of job is total need base . but i would prefer to work on all the area ad gain knowledg of everyth around me , then concentr on what i need to . thi could be a pretti way to do our job . you will have the minimum kowledg of everyth . thi ought to be follow becaus , you can not keep quit when group of your friend is discuss about a particular topic . you need not be familiar with it so that you can atleast join the discuss . or els it would look odd if you dont join the talk . afteral our skill are guess by rthe work we put up . and we can also advic some person in a familiar topic we know . for exampl , let take a person who is veri well awar of a subject in which he is interest , but is unawar of mani other thing . and take person who doe know about all the thing he is interest , and also the other thing . for instanc let us assum an interview conduct for each person . and in today world , a person who know hi subject of interest and the other thing also , is onli accept . that would keep him as an allround . though the other person is a master in hi subject of interest , that alon would not help him . lastli i conclud that , `` a sight toward the alround is alway differ from that toward a fish in a pond , which , though know everyth about the pond but never know anyth about thje world around it .
