i do agre with the fact that young peopl nowaday do not give eneough time to help the commun . but i also support the young by say that in today 's schedul they have a lot of other activ which keep them veri engag , be it academ , work , sport or even the responsbl of support their tution fee . in today 's time there is actual a lot of pressur to perform well and stay ahead be it at sport of studi or even extra curricular . one ha to stay ahead henc it is abviou that the time for help the coommun could be curtail by them . spend time in the commun could actual be distract for them and might start affect their project of educ or sport advers . at thi point of time it is more import for them to maintain a good record in colleg and their work place to extract long term benefit and lead a comfor life . moreov the commun ha a lot of peopl to be taken care of by . there are so mani men & women who have kind of dedic all their life or at least whatev time their schedul permit to engag themselv in commun work and see what to be done to maintain it standard . so when we alreadi have poepl volunt , whi should the young also be forcibili brought in to it . i dont say that one should never be engag in commun work at ani point of time , .l after finish one eductaion , have reach a certain posit at one 's workplac , it alway worthi of be activ associ with the commun and commun work . moreov after a certain age one gain enough experi to sort the matter better and in a more appropri and construct manner , which could prove to be actual more benefici to the commun and the societi as a whole than some youngster or amateur work at it .
