it is often discuss in the media what factor are respons for the success of an individu . mani peopl believ that success peopl tri new thing and are more will to take risk rather than onli do what they are alreadi capabl to do . in my opinion thi point of view is correct becaus onli peopl who take certain risk have the chanc to excel in their career . to begin with , an individu can onli grow person by take certain risk . for exampl , i did an internship in new york last year and could not have profit more from thi experi . befor fli to the us i wa feel insecur becaus i did not know what wa about to happen dure my internship . i wa worri becaus of the new languag , the work environ and a possibl cultur clash . inde , the first time in the unit state had been difficult for me but everi week wa easier that the one befor . after complet my internship , i can wholeheartedli say that take thi risk ha been the best decis of my life so far . i am much more confid now and have gain person and intercultur skill that will help me in my futur career . furthermor i am convinc that everi new experi ha a definit impact on an individu ' develop . even if an experi seem to be neg at the begin or a person doe not succeed immedi , i am sure that these neg event onli make a person stronger than befor . by analyz the reason for fail a person is abl to work on certain individu weak . in addit to that , i want to point to the concept of learn . for centuri it is wide accept that peopl have to learn in order to becom better in what they are do . not onli in school , colleg or univers class but also by attend work-shop in the profession life peopl are constantli forc to make new experi and learn addit aspect about differ issu if they want to be success in life . in conclus , i absolut agre that one characterist of success peopl is base on their willing to tri out new thing rather than stick to the thing they alreadi know . take risk is fundament if you want to succeed in life . onli by face challeng an individu will be abl to grow as a person .
