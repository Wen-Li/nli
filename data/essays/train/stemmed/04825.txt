it frequent happen to me that i buy a product i have seen on an advertis . but in the end , it doe not meet my expect . i complet agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i believ thi way becaus there exist sever reason explain whi product are not as good as their advertis . by look at the profit the advertis compani make , the competit between numer compani as well as the way the product is present it seem understand for me that product are not as good as one think . firstli , the product on the advertis shall appeal to the custom . the compani provid the product pursu the goal to make profit . it can onli reach a high amount of money if suffici peopl purchas the product . therefor , the compani ha to make the product seem as best as possibl . secondli , one also ha to take into consider that the compani alway compet with other compani , especi if the product is not a uniqu one . if the product should be sold success , the compani ha to present it in a convinc way . although the product is not as good as other product , it nevertheless should not show it weak but it strenght . the purpos of advertis is to persuad the custom that thi is the onli right and best product . therefor , the compani usual ha to make the product better than it actual is . addit , the compani doe not pay ani attent to the custom 's expect . it onli pretend to want to meet the them , but it is not necessarili signific for the compani . thirdli , the compani want to appeal to a wide rang of peopl in order to influenc their decis to buy the compani 's product posit . as a result , the compani is forc to present it product in a gener way . it can not reveal specif featur becaus the compani doe not know if thi appeal to each custom . in consequ , the compani present it product better as it realli is in order to make money with it . in conclus , all these aspect prove whi product are not as good as the advertis pretend to be . the main purpos for advertis is to make profit out of the product . therefor , the product ha to seem wonder , although it is not .
