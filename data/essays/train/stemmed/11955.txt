accord to me the advertis do make product seem much better than they realli are . the sole purpos of advertis are to promot the sale of a product . in today competet societi , the advetis would do anyth to attract our attent . they put famou celebr in their add and pay million of dollar to the t.v . station to broadcast their add . almost all add are differ and inov , howev they all have one thing in common - they all highlight onli the good point about their product . they never inform the consum what their product lack . often , a person find a differ of day and night between a product seen in the advertis and the actual product . the compani usual amelior the appear of the product when they advertis it , through comput graphic . they make it more appeal than it realli is . onc i saw an advertis of an acn face wash . the result of the product seem amaz . the interview of the user were shown in advertis . they were all happi with the product and ask everyon to use the product . intimid by the add , i order the product . the product seem complet inaffect and useless . i wa dissapoint and from that time on i made a resolut of never use a product without person research . henc , we should not fall prey to the tempt advertis which the compani show us , sinc they are far from realiti
