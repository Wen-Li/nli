in my opinion neither young nor older peopl enjoy life more than the other , they enjoy it from differ perspect . older peopl enjoy life in a more relax perspect , they know what life can offer , they have made choic and they have dealt with the concecu of their action . they can now enjoy their success and have come to accept their error . older peopl can enjoy the compani of their famili and they can observ their young grandchildren grow without have to worri as much for their futur as they did with their own children when they were respons for their success educ and upbring . sinc they are awar that their time is limit they place more attent to those thing that are most import or person reward , which allow them to be more at peac with themselv and enjoy life without so much stress . young peopl enjoy life in a more passion manner , they are start their life and have a great number of opportun in front of them . they have the energi to engag in a larg amount of activ and there is alway excit in do someth for the first time . young peopl know that they might make mistak , but they are confid in have enough time in life to correct their error or to chang their behaviour , point of view or activ in order to have a better lifestyl . when you have the energi of a young person and your futur is still promis and unknown you are more will to tri new thing , experienc life from differ angl and thi make life more excit and appeal . older peopl could benefit from the excit approach to life that young peopl have in order to continu take advantag of life , at the same time young peopl might imit older peopl in order to mantain better human relationship with their friend and famili . sometim older peopl lack the energi and enthusiasm to undertak new adventur and their onli experi are those from their youth . young peopl often live life to quickli , without take enough time to fulli appreci their experi , which can lead to miss import moment in their life .
