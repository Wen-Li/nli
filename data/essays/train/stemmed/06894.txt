learn method , nowaday , are differ . student are more abl to understand idea and concept as they have more support , for instanc book , and the `` new '' one , internet . .. howev , for a student the purpos of the cours is not alway clear . in thi way , he can understand more precis a concept or an idea by use the support and therefor by increas hi knowledg by hi own . in my opinion , a student will be more interest in a subject in which he know the basi rather than in a subject that he will onli know the fact . understand subject will be clearer and easier for him to discuss , to argu for and to interpret . he will be self-confid on what he talk about and will be abl to respond to question , as the subject will be appear more sustain for him . learn fact is not easi for children . it may seem to be a success of import thing to know but without mean for the children . the student must be lost and confus on the subject as he will not understand from where inform come from . moreov , if a student understand idea and concept he will be more abl to take in mind those thing for a long time and will be abl to use it in the futur , wherea , if he onli understand fact , the subject must stay in mind for a short term period . to conclud , from my point of view , learn fact is the basi of confus knowledg , wherea understand idea and concept is the start point of a intellectu cultur .
