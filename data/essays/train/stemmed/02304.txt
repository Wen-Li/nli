i disagre with thi statement that their will be afew car from now after twenti year . car are one of the use inventoin that are scienc ha made . it is one of the use mode of transpot in the recent day . in the recent time car are use by all the class of peopl in the societyi . e , is the middl , higher and the lower class of peopl . it use ha been improv by day by day . i t is one of the most conveni mode of troansport unlik the buss , train , automobil etc . transport by acar is at onc own convin . it not like you have to wiat for or go out pf the hous much earli to get the transport on time . have onc own car is veri convini . in the presernt time peopl are veri busi no time to wast at all you cant wait for abu or atrain to get a mean of transport . in the futher year car user will go on becaus of their busi live to save the time in the recent time mani model of the car have been made which are at ahigh sale in the market . ifeel that mani more model will sure come up in the mere futur to meet the demand . the other factor of mani car nowday and the day to come is that owe or mainta a car is a sign of statu in the societi so all the peopl would like to maintain ahigh statu in the societyh they would buy acar . when the demand goe on a high rate the product of the car will definatli ha to meet the demand not onli that mani bank and other organis render mani sourc or loan to own a car so inspit of sour price also peopl dont stop buy car .
