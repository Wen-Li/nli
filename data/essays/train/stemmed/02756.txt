there si alway the same question between young and older poepl . who enjoy life ? i am a young peopl and i can say that i enjoy the life more than my parent . but it is alway true ? young peopl just begen her life and want to profit from it . they do n't know about dead , about real succ or failur . they onli see all the year come . usual they have a lot of project and dream and how to develop them . for exampl , i take me . i want to go to australia in order to develop my english and i wish to find a good job and perhap to stay overther . i realli do it and i will realli do everyth in order to suc . a lot of peopl say me that i am littl crazi to do thi with all danger . thi argu come especi from adult over forti year old . while old peopl have a long life behin them , they have enjoy life befor and today they are in their habit . they have alreadi enjoy life , or perhap not . i see it with my grandpar , they have had a other life , with the war and other truma . today they do n't want to move . and sometim it is in the other sens , in other word , young peopl do n't enjoy the life and older poepl do it . for exampl , young peopl find a job , take a flat , have their friend and do n't want someth els ( thi is my brother ) . wherea older peopl alway tri to profit and take everyth from life . i have a friend , who is over seventi year old , who travel all arround the world and tri to enjoy all that she can . in conclus , to my mind , i do n't know if we can speak about young or old peopl . each person enjoy the life in her way and with her past . one enjoy life with their habit and other with their dream and realis .
