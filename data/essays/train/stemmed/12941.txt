although i understand peopl who say it is better to special in one specif subject i would prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . there are three reason whi i would prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . firstli if you have broad knowledg you can talk to much more peopl or student about academ topic . for exampl i am studi three subject . thi is a reason whi i can talk with mani differ peopl about mani academ subject . that is whi i met and got to know student from differ subject . we often spend time togeth while we are talk abuot our or one of our subject . i enyoy thi time . secondli i think it is better for your futur when you have broad knowledg of mani subject . it show that you are interest in mani thing or subject . for exampl when you want to get a job it show better when you can say i am interest in differ subject and when you have differ knowledg than have veri deep knowledg in onli one thing . anoth thing is when you are work in a compani and someon ha problem with someth you can help or give solut about that topic . and that is whi a lot of peopl habe a lot of success in their job or in their life . thirdli if you have children i think the children have more respect when you can say i am familiar with differ subject than with one deepli . the children can learn more from you when you have differ knowledg . i think it is veri import for children when the parent have more knowledg than one deep knowledg . to sum up for me there are onli import aspect to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and i would do the same way again becaus it is more import to have differ knowledg of mani academ subject than to one deep . for exampl in a job or to talk with differ peol or for your children .
