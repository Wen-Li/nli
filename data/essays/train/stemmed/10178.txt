'' it appear that they know everyth . hewev doe these `` mr '' or `` miss know-al '' realli understand what they 're say ? after a further disscuss you will get the answer is `` no '' . due to the limit of time and energi , it is almost sure that if a person tri to learn too much acdem subject at a time , the result would be he can grasp none of them well . a better way is to fosu on one specif subject . mayb it is a littl boil but you can learn the natur of the subject . special is what the modern sociati ask for . when look for job , the compani will ask `` what you can do '' and you are suppos to have someth that can not be taken place by other
