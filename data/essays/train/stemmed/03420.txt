there are differ type of travel , those who like travel in group led by a tour guid and the other , more courag , who like travel alon . i my opinion , travel in a group far outweight travel alon . there are two main reason whi i strongli agre with thi statement : you travel peac and you do n't have to worri about where you will arriv . travel is a great experi but sometim it can be a littl bit scari . that whi i prefer to travel in a group , inde you can leav your home more peac and enjoy more your trip . furthermor you do n't have to worri about noth becaus everyth is organ by the tour guid . the other reason whi i certainli prefer to travel in a group is becaus of the tour guid . in a the matter of fact i can be sure that he will alreadi know the place to visit and for sure the place to avoid . consequ i will not have ani bad surpris or bad experi with the nativ peopl met in the new countri . in addit the guid tour can explain clearli the cultur , the import of the monument and the histori of the unknown countri . in conclus travel in a group permit me to avoid the stress due to the trip and to learn more about the countri i visit . it is for thess reason i strongli recommend everyon
