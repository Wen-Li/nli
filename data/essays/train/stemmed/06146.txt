there are sever good reason whi i believ that is better for student to have a broad knowlegd of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first of all , i think that nowaday , work problem are veri difficult to resolv and involv a lot of skill like comput knowledg or to know a differ languag . current , compani need peopl to overcom thi sort of integr problem , and the person ha to have a broad knowledg . secondli , if student have more skill or abil , they will have more likelihood to find a job . therefor , if they becom borri in their work , they can appli to other job becaus peopl with a broader knowledg can do more thing than the other . although it is true that some peopl say that compani pay more to peopl who know how to resolv a specif task , i think that is better for a person earn less money but with a lot of likelihood to get a job , than a person who can earn a lot of money , but work in a onli one type of job . world market today are veri difficult , peopl are hire current and consecu they have to look for a job more than ever , for thi reason i believ that is better for a person to ha a broad knowledg . i can support my opinion with a person experi that i live five year ago . i wa work in cnn as a journalist , and suddenli i heard that the compani board need someon to work in trade area . after a brief hire process , i got the posit onli becaus i had studi a financ cours in univers . in my opinion , i think that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif one , becaus a person have more posibl to get a job , to resolv better the work problem and thirdli , becaus encourag hi knoledg .
