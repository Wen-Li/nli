a graet man said befor in a long time ago `` the small one are the onc who rise the citi up or take it down '' . hi word were right becaus that wa the truth . nowaday kid refus to help other and they wo n't give enough time and effort to help thier commun . i think that thi is a great big fact . so , i agre with the statment for two reson . first , nowaday teenag do n't do what they are suppos to do and they do n't carri the respons of thier behavior . they alway act sush as babi and never care about ani thing exept if they will have someth as an effort if they took care about that thing . that 's a bad act and wo n't help them even when they grow up becaus that effect thier commun . in thi way , thier children will act the same way and there wo n't be ani exampel of coopor . anoth thing is that the young peopl are more activ and have more potinsul , so they can effor more than the older one and they truli can rise their commun by help it and take with it hand . and so , everi one can live in a nice , love and cooporatoin sosiati . in the end , i would refear that young poepl should do thier job and help their commun to rise and be better .
