i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for sever reason state in the follow . one first of all ha to find out reason that could lead to a situat in which fewer car are need or allow . therefor , one ha to imagin condit , make the use of a car for a great percentag of peopl unnecessari or more expens . in the next step one ha to ask whether those condit are like to becom realiti in twenti year . the car is today most use transport verhicl . nearli everi person in the first world one a car to get to work , go shop or visit friend etc. what could make them not need their car anymor ? one reason could be that a more effecitv method of mass trasnport is invent which offer the same kind of flexibl , comfort and secur and which is cheaper . such an invent and the necessari develop of the transport method would take year at least . at the moment no such invent is in sight . therefor i do not believ that it can be accept in twenti year . anoth reason could be that pollut becom unstand so that governemnt prohibit to use car . as the automobil lobbi is veri power and ha a great influenc on politict i can not imageion such a prohibit either , although it may be desir . conclud , i can not see condit in twenti year under which an alternitav to the automobil will have been accept . furthermor , there are other reason that make a decreas of car even more improb : the industri of india and especi of china as well as of some state in eastern europ prosper . the explos of new demand and the increas wealth of the peopl open a complet new group of client to the automobil industri . dure the last year the product enter a new stage as lot of chines peopl bought car . million of peopl of the chines or indian societi belong to lower social class will buy car for the first time ever . therefor , the number of car will increas dure the next year . at the same time , there is no reason i can recogn that could prevent the first world countri from produc car . especi the usa have a great need for automobil as there are huge distanc to overcom , especi in the inner countri . the german will not stop buy and use car either . eventhough some more peopl might use mass transport method in the futur . becaus of the state reason i come to the conclus that in twenti year there will be even more car in use than there are today .
