some peopl might say that tri new thing and take risk to suce . but i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreay know how to do well . becaus those who are work like profession , they have confidec and dream when they work . first of all , they are not alway success either they tri new thing or not . i think the most import thing is confid for success and without knowledg , it is hard to tri new thing and take risk . for exampl , one of my friend studi econom but now he want to transfer to art school . doe not it make sens ? he had not been drew about 20 year , so that he gave up . like i said , when we tri someth new thing , even we should have basic technic or knowledg . in addit , we have to have dream for our success life . there are so mani peopl who tri to new thing without dream . in my opinion , if we just work without dream , we need more time to suce than peolpl who have dream . for instanc , in korea , peopl tri to suce everyday . but it is extrem hard to suce , even they have skill . thu mani korean surrend their job then they have their own busi and they are more success in life than peopl who go to compani everyday . in conclus , we all want to suce . but in order to suce , we have to have confid and dream in our mind and also we have to know how to do veri well . if we alway tri new thing without know-how , we alway might be behind .
