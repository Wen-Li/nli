although some may assert that know the fact is the most import thing when studi , i believ that it is much benefici for student to actual understand the idea and concept for their better studi . to begin , it would be much time-sav for children to grasp the concept befor studi the fact of the subject . if they memor the fact initi and then tri to understand the idea , it would take them more time to obtain all the knowledg in that area . sinc peopl usual forget the fact they memor , after go through the concept of the studi they are work on . for instanc , if i memor the term use in water circul and then tri to understand the concept of it , i would have to go over the word again , sinc i have to fit my knowledg into what i have learn right now . while understand the idea in the first place can make me onli fit the term in to what i have alreadi done understand . on top of that , it would make the studi much easier to know the concept first . when one understand the thin and then learn the fact relat in it , it come to person 's mind in more influenti way . the studi of math can be a good exampl . if a child in a kindergarten learn that ` 1 plu 1 is 2 ' , they would know that ` 1 plu 1 is 2 ' but do not actual understand the term of plu . while , if they initi learn what plu actual mean , then they would know that ` 1 plu 1 is 2 ' and ` 3 plu 2 is 5 ' and so on . by understad the idea of someth , it lead peopl to learn in more effici way . by grasp the concept of the subject , one can save their time and effort . all in all , i believ that learn idea and concept of someth in the first place is much benefit and profit for the peopl to actulli learn and studi a subject .
