i total agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time for uplift of their commun . the reason behind thi is that thi young gener do not have enough time to devot it to their commun becaus of their busi routin and immens pressur of work . our societi ha chang dramat in last coupl of decad with grow popul and increas pressur on our exist resourc . thi grow popul ha impli immens pressur on young peopl for their surviv becaus there are limit number of job avail which are veri less than requir , so what happen is that these young peopl devot most of their time in studi and compet with each other . as a result there is no time for them to think about the commun they live in . for ex : a person look forward for hi bright futur will be more interest in hi educ & job opportun and will not be much concern about hi commun . i person think that our commun ha chang to such a point which is not much suitabl for young peopl . earlier there wa less competit and less pressur as compar to now , so at that time peopl were more concern about their commun and had the time to devot it to for the uplift of their societi . secondli , in today 's context everyon is look from hi perspect onli and care a damn about their societi . there is a lack of interest in public particip from young peopl . for ex : young peopl prefer watch a movi whenev they get time instead of help for a social caus like awar camp for aid , which will benefit their societi . so i think time ha chang , condit have chang , mental perspect of an individu ha chang which ha result in thi situat .
