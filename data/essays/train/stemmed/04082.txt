advertis have such an import place in our live . as soon as you switch on the tv or the radio , you are bombard with a weatlh of inform on product rang from basic necess like food and water to household comod like utensil to the extent of luxuri like car . but , do advertis alway potray the right inform ? in my opinion , advertis are all about the hype and they seem to inflat the use of the product to the extent that it can harm an individu both physic and psycholog . thi is becaus the maker of the commerci are expect to be perfect in portray the good qualiti of the product that can bring huge profit to the compani . the neg point of the product are entir miss and ignor until the consum fall into the trap of `` buy the product '' . one exampl of physic harm can come from the advertis of say , an anti-depress drug . peopl see the advertis that potray inform about how good the medicin is and how well it will take away depress from your life and at the same time not caus ani harm . the individu absorb the inform and if he/sh keep on have the medicin , it can ultim caus harm and sever depend . anoth exampl can be given from a simpl situat . a girl who ha curli and frizzi hair see an advertis of a shampoo that show how curli hair can be transform into smooth and silki hair . when she use the product , it fail to deliv result . thi can have a psycholog impact in that she is made to beleiv that she ha bad hair that can not be chang no matter what . therefor , i fulli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are and one ha to use both common sens and person judgement in analyz the util of the product or as they say `` take them with a grain of salt '' .
