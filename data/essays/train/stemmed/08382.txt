thi can be true or fals . it depend on how you see it . you can think that in few year time car will desapear becaus we will use other kind of transport such as train or plane to travel far away or the bu and the bicycl to go around the citi . nowaday more and more peopl are consern with the environ so in my opinion , there will be a larg increas on the peopl who will use other kind of transport in state of car . on the other hand , it is true that sometim it is the most cheaper , confort and quicklier way to travel becaus you can take it when ever you want , with the peopl you want and go exackli to the place you want to go . becaus thi reason i think there wo n't be fewer car in twenti year time . now i am studi to have my drive licenc and there is a lot of peopl like me becaus it ha been a thing that everybodi need not onli to go on big trip but also to go to work or to univers when you do n't have buse . to conclud i will say that the thing i suppos it is go to happen is that peopl will continu use their car like today or more but the car will be environmentanli friendli so they will consum less petrol than now or they wo n't consum it . mayb they will use solar energi . thi would be grate . so last but not least i need to say that i expect myself in twenti year which a solar car travel around the world and look that everyon ha hi car .
