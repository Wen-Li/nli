centuri ago , a writer could also be a doctor , a scientist and an economist . peopl use to have broad knowledg of mani academ subjetc as it is illustr in the book gargantua by rabelai . nowaday , peopl becom more and more special . let 's face it , our knowledg is so huge in everi academ subjetc that it is imposs to know everyth in everi topic . there is a common joke in econom that point out that everi economist get special in a veri specif topic and doe not know anyth about the rest . it is a consequ of the special of peopl that took place in the nineteenth centuri . inde , progress ha been made in mani area and the knowledg ha increas . in thi respect , medecin is a case in point , peopl use to know veri littl about the organist of the human bodi but nowaday , the knowledg is so broad that doctor have to get special to be effici . furthermor , the onli doctor who remain generalist ca n't cure everyth and they often send you to a specialist to resolv your problem . howev , a bad consequ of thi special is that peopl do n't know ani more everyth about their own subject . if you have a broken leg , a neurologist wo n't be abl to do anyth to help you . but anyway , accord to me , thi evolut toward specialis is use and , moreov , ineluct . it is first ineluct becaus as i have said the knowledg is now so broad that a human be ca n't know everyth . furthermor , it is use becaus it allow us to better understand a veri specif point of our subjetc . for instanc , all the progress that have been made in the research for the cancer would not have been possibl without thi special . to have broad knowledg of mani academ subjetc is pleasant but it also mean that thi knowledg will remain limit and it 's whi special is need .
