the problem to discuss in thi essay is if in the next futur the number of car will rais or not . i think it will be . to explain my opinion about thi argoument i will consid two fact . first the number of car , all other equal , is relat to the growth of world popul . while popul is rais in the major of the countri it 's veri probabl that the suppli of car will increas . it 's also import to consid the fact that mani countri are leav their statu of poorti . well thi can lead to a better situat for all peopl who first live with onli elementari good . thi mean a high probabl of rais the number of car sold . a second reason . that at a first view can fight the idea of an increas in the number of car in the futur , is the neg trend in the product of oil . it 's well known that in the next decad the oil will finish but there is a real possibl that through hydrogen we will continu to drive our car !! let 's view at the problem that the car 's industri will look at . at sure there is an increas trend of governa of mani countri to support the use of public transport and to fight the use of car . otherway i think thi is a veri slow process tha will give good result in more than twenti or thirti year . a second problem is the fight support by world organ like onu or greenpeac . it 's import to point to the differ problem these organ have to face , like obstacl introduc by the most advanc countri who support industri . at the end i think the problem that the car industri will fight are veri weak so the number of car will rise in the futur .
