i agre with the most advertis ( ad ) make product seem much better that they realli are . there is two reson such that ad 's pictuer or tv comashal are not same as real product , and ad have to show that the product are look nice . the first of all , most ad are over act becaus ad 's pictuer are veri butiful and look nice . for exampl , some buger chane restrant give us the ad on tv . in the tv , the buger are veri big and fresh , but real one is not look a like ad 's . also , car ad is as well as the burger ad becaus the car run in the mountan for faster but in the real life , nomal car can not do that . so ad are shown much better that real one by creater . the next , ad have to show the product that are look nice , so ad are made much better than real one . the ad have to grab or cach peopl 's interest , so ad are made nicer than real . for exampl , if a restlant give an ad to peopl , they make some food pictuer . the pictuer are have to look nice . the picter can not smell so creater make some trick to look smell good . popl look the pictuer . they think the restlant make such nice food and then they would go . so the ad is made nicer than real one becaus it have to look nice . most ad are made much better than real onc becasu ad 's and real product are not same becaus for exampl , the humbirg is not look same as ad 's . and the other reson is that the ad have to look nice becaseu of advrtis . the ad have to foock the peopl as mani as they can . therefor ad ' product and real one are not same .
