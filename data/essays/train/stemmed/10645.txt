while there are thing that can suggest thi can actual happen , i dont consid the idea of have less car than there are today in twenti year veri possibl . there are variou reason whi i consid thi to be veri hard . the first reason whi i consid thi not to be easili achiev is the rapid popul growth we are go through . popul ha been increas rapidli over the year , even though in mani develop nation popul rate are either stay the same or reduc , in develop nation such as india , china and mani other the histori is veri differ , popul grow everyday . even though govern are tri to stop thi by take drastic measur , these will take time and by then more and more car will be need and produc . anoth reason whi i consid thi to be someth that can hardli happen is due to the fact that develop nation have peopl with extrem amount of money . even though thi peopl may need one car or two they will purchas a ridicul amount of car . technolog is someth that is advanc everi day . befor car compani need a larg amount of peopl and time to produc one car , now with the help of technolog million of car are produc everi day , in some procedur human are not even involv . thi suggest that car are be made at a more rapid rate and mani more car are be sold everyday all around the world . as i mention befor there are some point which are veri import to these discuss . oil is so expens now that even though mani peopl can afford a car not all of them can afford ga , therefor thi could support the idea of less car be made . i sincer belliev that have less car in 20 year is veri hard but there are point which suggest the opposit , therefor i can onli hope and wait to see what actual happen .
