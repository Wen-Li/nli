i agre with the statement that , young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do . there are 3 reason whi i agre with that opinion . first of all , for young peopl most of the thing they experi are new and they facin young peopl . young peopl have curios and it motiv them to do thing and tri mani thing . i believ that tri to do someth is essenti for my life and it is the best way to enjoy my life . howev elderli peopl know what is interest and what is not , and they easili give up tri . secondli , young peopl often worri . they worri about their futur , love , relationship between their friend or famili and so on . while they are worri about these thing there are lot of talk , laugh and cri and that make peopl grow up . young peopl often have more dificulti than elderli peopl do , and it is becaus taht young peopl have less knowledg . but i do not think have less knowledg for life experi is bad thing . it also can motiv peopl . usual , older peoopl use their knowledg of their experi and avoid have difficulti and chose easier way . it is not an interest thing for me at all . third reason is concern about physic problem . when peopl get older , that is natur that you have more physic problem that you use to when you were young . physic and phycolog effect each other , so when older peopl get physic pain , they might be nervous and do not feel like do anyth . actual , my grand mother use to play golf until about she wa 55 , but sinc she got a pain on her knee , she stop play golf and the more , she stop go outsid . i wa veri sad i saw her alway sit on a chair and watch tv . but young peopl have much less physic problem so that we can tri anyth we want to . young peopl are hopeful and have lot of energi . when you get older and reflect yourself for not to do anyth you want to , is what i hate the most . challeng is the best thing to satisfi your life . for those reason i believ that young peopl can enjoy life more than older peopl do .
