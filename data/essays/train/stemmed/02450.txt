enjoy life depend on a decis and not on a the age or the circumst that a person is go through . i have known mani old peopl who are happier and healthier than mani teenag and adult . i know , for exampl , a 60-year-old woman who ha more energi than two teenag togeth . i might be exagger , but her attitud toward life impress me a lot . she swim everi day , she goe to the beauti parlor all the weekend and she ha her own busi . in fact , she told me last time that she won the first place in a 2000-meter swim competit in the atitlan sea . she is also the most hyperact person that i have ever known . she like to joke and she is smile everytim i look at her . on the other hand , i know a 30-year-old man who alway wake up tire and upset and who hate hi job . when i go to visit him , he is either eat or watch tv . i sometim do not like to talk to him , becaus he is alway speak neg . hi bad attitud sometim scare me . becaus of thi two exampl given , i believ that enjoy life doe not depend on someon 's age . i am sure that the woman , whom i wrote about , wake up everi day expect someth new and that she is thank that she ha a new day to experi . she ha a possit attitud and she is the one who decid to have a special day . the other man could have a terribl job and a terribl hous , but if he want and decid to make of them someth pleasant and enjoy , he will make a paradis out of it . it conclus , i disagre with the statement . happi depend on the person 's attitud and decis .
