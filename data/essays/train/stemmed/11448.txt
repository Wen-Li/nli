i disagre to the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . thi statement contrast with the quot `` jack of all trade master of none '' . not onli academ thi state is fals for everi kind of work . i would tell my certian person exampl . in my colleg i play footbal , cricket , weightlift , powerlift . despit of play so mani game i have not been select till today in my ani of the colleg team . when i am drop out by the select committe then i feel that it would have been better if i would have devot my entir time on a singl game and do masteri in that instead of play mani game . when we talk about the world famou author they mostli have specialis in a singl subject . for exampl william shakespear wa famou for english literatur , issac newton wa famou in scienc , etc . there are endless exampl about differ person who have achiev success by do special in one specif subject . so i would conclud thi paragraph by state that for get renown in your school , state , countri or world you should have special in a specif subject unless you put in your best effort in that . most of the peopl face unemploy becaus they tri to put their hand and leg in mani work which reduc their chanc of success in that . it is just as a person stand on two boat and tri to navig the river . so i would end with a famou quot that `` singl bird in a hand is better than mani bird in a bush ''
