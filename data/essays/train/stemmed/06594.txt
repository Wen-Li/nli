the issu at hand is whether to have a baisc knowledg of mani acedem subject or to speciial in one subject . in my opinion it is better to special in one subject rather than to have basic knowledg of mani subject . thi is becaus alot of time and energi will be spent on studi mani subject . on the other hand by special in one subject a person can have full knowledg of that subject and advanc in that field . first reason of my belief to special in one subject is that the bounderi of knowlegd is too larg for one individu to cover . knowledg is an infinit ocean and is veri difficult for an individu to acquir it even the basic of it . while studi one subject will be much easier and use sinc then a person can appli hi or her knowledg . secondli i think one should special in a subject becaus by studi too mani subject the individu might get confus . the individu in the process of learn mani subject might not be abl to learn even one subject properli which wiil render all hi studi useless sinc hi brain will be distract by too much inform . studi one subject will not distract the individu sinc he will have onli one subject to concentr on . lastli it is better special in one spefic subject becaus studi one subject will make an individu better and better each day in that subject . the person will command an expert on the subject , which ensur hi progress and develop . thu for a person to advanc and progress in life he or she should special in one subject rather than acquir the knowledg of mani subject and end up in learn noth .
