i agre the statement of `` young pepl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . '' i would like to explain the reason of my thought in the follow passag . in my home town , there is an event for clean up the river in the town everi year . parent usual join to such annual event . and they alway complain us that more and more young peopl should join to the event , becaus they are also respons for such task by use their river . the young peopl are more power than the elder peopl , so their join would be help . but the young peopl , includ me , are not will to join such event . one of the reaseon whi they are not in such event is that there are no disadvantag or punish for not to join to such event . if there are some disadvanteg in such attitud , it is most like for young peopl to join such event . thi is becaus they do not think that give their time to help their commun are their duti or oblig . young peopl are less depend on their commun , becaus social system for help all the peopl in our countri ha been introduc so they are not requir their commun 's help . so they do not want to wast their time for the commun . the young peopl today is busier than those of the past . the busi world today is veri rapid and young peopl today in such world are requir to spend almost their all time for do their own busi . so it is veri like to that young peopl today do not have enough time to share time to help their commun . from the factor and reason abov , young peopl today do not give enough time to help their commun .
