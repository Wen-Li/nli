the statement declar that success peopl take risk instead of onli do what they know to do well . i partli agre with the statement abov . i believ , in fact , that to defin a person as success is a difficult purpos . apart from thi person belief , success can be defin as a situat where a person reach a wealthi way of life . in thi case , i believ the statement present some weak . to reach success peopl need to take risk although there are some other qualiti and factor that need to be mention . a person to be success need to be lucki in life and healthi . peopl that take risk are usual brave and curiou , i strongli believ thi two qualiti are fondament to reach a success situat in the profession life as well as in the privat life . on the other side , there are mani other factor and compon that interf in life . for exampl peopl need to be help by the fortun . i strongli believ that , in most of the case , take risk is not the onli compon that defin a success situat . a second factor that need to be mention is the factor of health . a success profil , usual , is base on a stabl person situat . for thi reason , i believ someon that have an healti life have a big chanc to reach a high level of success . in conclus , i do not agre with the statement abov . eventhough i consid take risk an advantag for peopl to be success , i trust that a stabl profil ha , in the same way , a full rang of possibl to reach happy in life . to sum up , there are too mani compon that one person need to take into consider while defin a profil of a success person therefor the statement can be consid too semplicist and not true .
