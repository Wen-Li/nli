thi is a complic question and the answer depend on the region and the technolog . in more develop cosmopolitan , i feel quit sure that the use of car will decrea or be forc to reduc ; in some poor area , on the contrari , more car will be use under the fast construct of transpot equip . the problem of over-crowd is alreadi seriou in some larg citi such as shanghai . though the gover is plan to build more road and bridg , there will be fewer car eventu . peopl are more and more annoy with the slowli crawl traffic . i have heard a lot of peopl say that they do n't like car as they did befor . they prefer walk , bicycl and use public transport . they rare drive car on the street not onli becaus they have to drive in a veri low speed and spend much of the time wait , but also becaus they can hardli find park space . in fact , they can not easili stop while they ca n't go veri fast . base on those inconveni , i dare to predict that there will be fewer car in use in larg citi . on the other hand , thing happen differ in some under develop area . there is not even one road suitabl for car in some rural area . peopl there are struggl for a better life . if they want to flourish , they should commun and trade with the world outsid . consequ , when road are readi , car will go . peopl there will be abl to earn more money and enjoy a higher life standard . villag will develop just as the onc rural citi did and will own numer car . in the futur twenti year , there may be one more impredict factor about the car . the car can be replac with some unimagin transport like float plate . no one can tell what crazi scientist can make in the futur . car are so endang . more gener , car will go to the right place where they are urgent need . it is quit normal that car owner get fed up with the traffic jam and abandon their car while the prospect car owner are look forward to drive in their own car and do some busi . that will be how the citi get rid of car and the develop region earn car .
