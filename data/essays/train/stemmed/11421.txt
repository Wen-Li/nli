some peopl agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept , while other agre that it is more import for them to learn fact . although both view are valid to a certain extent , i person prefer the former view for the follow reason . first and foremost , a student can expand their knowledg by understand idea and concept . for exampl , when you are solv a math problem , you have to first understand idea and concept of the situat to appli the right formula for the question . memor the formula doe not get you to solv the problem . you first have to understand what question is ask for , and find the right formula to appli for . by solv a problem , you can expand your knowledg of math . second , understand idea and concept can allow student to have right veiw . for exampl , the holocaust is one of the event that should never be repeat . by understand what nazism is and understand the concept of discrimin , student can have the right view of the event , and the same thing as the holocaust can be prevent by them . fianlli , simpli learn fact doe not get student understand skill . of cours , it is import to learn fact , becaus some understand are base on the fact . howev , learn fact doe not get student understand of the idea or know the fundament concept . in conclus , i think it is much more import for student to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact .
