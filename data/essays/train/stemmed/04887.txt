in my opinion the statement is too simpl . there are also argument demonstr that older peopl may enjoy life more . older peopl have a lot of experi . they can judg and analyz certain event better than younger peopl . older peopl are often in a better financi posit than young peopl are . so they often have the opportun to buy thing or to realiz project younger peopl mayb ca n't afford . with so much incertainti in the world today recent poll in germani for exampl demonstr that older peopl feel more secur than twen or even teenag . in a certain age one is abl to review your life and to look back includ the goal you achiev , but al the disappoint . young peopl are sometim to optimist about their opportun and goal they can achiev , but with a certain experi of age some peopl gain a certain kind of realism that help them to organ their life in a proper way . as newspap articl and the tv show mani young peopl do have problem and are veri sad . on the other hand younger peopl are gener healthier than older person , so they can be more activ and dont ' need to take much care about ill or risk . they are mayb even not awar of the risk , what can be an advantag and a disadvantag at the same time , becaus you do n't realli care about smoke or drink risk . becaus mani experi in life can be neg , younger peopl are often less preoccupi with thing than older . they tri thing that are new for them instead of think about neg event older peopl automat take in mind . in gener you cant ' say that younger peopl are better off than the gener of parent or grandpar . enjoy life is a matter of charact and person situat , not a question of age . in all gener there do exist happi and sad charact . everi age can be enjoy , but everi time in life also cover the risk of disappoint or even pain . life is life .
