peopl will alway ask themselv what 's the best way of learn thing and what 's the best way of teach thing becaus these question are essenti . the world evolv and so doe the way of teach , educ is one of the most import thing becaus although it may sound a littl bit ` cliche` , today 's children are tomorrow 's adult , henc , it is wise to ask ourselv if understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact , when i thing about it , there 's no good answer at thi kind of question becaus understand concept and learn fact are both import . of cours if you studi philosophi , understand idea is vital and if you studi law you 'll have to learn fact but in most of other field the best thing to do is to understand and learn . when i wa in highschool i hate learn fact becaus it wa extrem bore , i thought that what matter the most wa understand what the teacher were talk about , that 's whi i wa alway pay attent in class but sinc i hate fact i wa n't studi much at home . i wa an averag student with averag grade but i think that had i spent more time learn basic fact i could have had much better grade . of cours onli learn fact is n't veri helpful if you do n't understand concept . some peopl onli care for fact and could n't care less about what 's behind them , i think it 's quit sad becaus you ca n't base your opinion on fact alon , you have to understand what 's the true mean of the fact you 're look at , now , when i learn a fact i alway tri to understand the idea that it 's impli and when i come to understand a concept i tri to learn some fact that can be relat to it , in a word , i think that student should understand concept and learn fact , they should n't have to choos between both .
