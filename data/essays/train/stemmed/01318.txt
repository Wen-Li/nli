i disagre with the given statement . accord to me the statement is not veri precis . i think that peopl should hold on to what they alreadi know how to do . it is much more benefici that tri new thing . the common say `` jack of all trade but master of none '' appli here veri well . the peopl who keep do the same thing through their life are more success accord to me . the peopl who concentr in the same field increas their experi vividli in the respect field . they can becom more effici by further train and support . where as those who are tri new thing everi time can never be satisfi with one thing and can never be settl in life . their life is spent tri new thing and there is no particular job that they fit into . they are alway chang job and are veri unstabl in their life . for exampl , a person who know all the job os repair but doe not have enough experi is no better than a person who know onli wheel align but is wide experienc . moreov , the employ are alway look for hire wide experienc crew member . thi type of experi in a certain field can be gain onli by do it for a long time and attend train session . the practic of do onli one thing over and over again can also lead you to becom an expert in that field of work . thi again contribut to an individu 's success rate . in today 's world of high popul a person stand out onli if he ha a certain specif knowledg . the chanc of a person who doe the thing he alreadi know are higher of be select for a certain job . most of the compani avoid risk-tak to avoid the chanc of loss to the compani . thu the peopl who prefer do thing that they are alreadi familiar with are , in my opinion , more success in their life rather than those who tri new thing and are adventur . i complet disagre with the given statement .
