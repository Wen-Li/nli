if someon ask me if i prefer to expect from the univers a broad knwledg or a special one i will answer that i prefer a broad knowledg . obvious in five year is not possibl to studi all the exist subject . the knowledg should be devid in scientif knowledg and humanist knowledg , so univers should offer in a studi cours a wide knowledg in one of that categori . these will make everith more interst : stude the same subject for a long time could be bore . anoth fact that make a broad knowledg better than a special one is that a wide knowledg is necessari to face work problem better . specialis knowledg will be improv dure the rest of one person 's work life . univers will never know which particular subject a compani need so it can onli offer a gener knowledg , therefor the factory/societi that will employ that particular person will teach him the specif knowledg necessari for hi futur task . gener knowledg provid more flexibl to everyon . flexibl is necessari to find the right solut to everi kind of problem . infact if someon ha broad knowledg could solv a problem choos a solut that ha alreadi been use to solv a completli differ problem : brainstorm requir a broad knowledg , thi let to present a most wide rang of solut . anoth aspect that must me said is that in a more fexibl work market peopl cuold chang sever time their work , { in america thi fact is well kown } so a specif knowledg will not support thi sort of evolut . everyon ha to be readi to adapt to sever kind of job !!!! that all . . w
