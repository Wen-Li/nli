from the first glanc more peopl see that car help peopl to achiev their goal faster and more safe than ani land mean of transport . car save in time , go to the goal quickli and return to home quickli , and if the man ha a sudden event happen at deep night he can take a quick decis to go some where rapidli to solv the problem . now aday there a huge number of car for all the purpos mention abov but on the other hand car are the sourc of pollut and sourc of pay alot of money . so , car have advantag and disadvantag but with the progress happen in the world and the high technolog in the field of it , commun and transport make peopl if they anyth they call by phone or send by email to ask their need either they need to buy good or to acheiv a servic . an exampl : for man : if someon want to know hi account in bank so he will enter via the internet and go through the web site of the bank and enter with hi account from hi offic or home and make all trnsiaction he want to do . for housewif : if sher want to buy ani anyth from the supermarket , she will call buy phone so her movement outsid the home will becom less . for student : in the summer vacat and the student want to know hi result or grade , he will know the result from hi home via internet . and so on so the need of car will be less than befor . also , enhanc on the mean of transport and the suitabl price of their ticket make peopl do n't want to buy car and use the train and buse more than car . so , in my opinion , i see that these factor which are - progress in the world in it and commun field - enhanc in the other mean of transport like train and buse and they becom more comfort and safe. make the no.of car - suitabl price of ticket either for buse or train . at the end , i am agre with statement which said that the number of car will reduc in the next twenti than today
