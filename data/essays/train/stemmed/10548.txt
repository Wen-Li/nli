there is a growth in popul . year by year , the estim number of peopl on earth is multipli . with thi pupluat outburst , more car will have to be present to meet the need of the peopl . also , peopl are get lazier each year and they will need a form of transport to move them around . for those reason , i think that in twenti year there will be mani more car in use than there are today . it ha been mention in more than one offici estim that there is an uncontrol popul growth in the world . in under-develop countri such as the south asian countri , for exampl india and pakistan , a normal famili consist of six to eight children . in gulf countri such as saudi arabia , kuwait , qatar or bahrain , a famili is consid big onli if the number of children exce six . now multipli those number with the number of famili in each countri and calcul how mani peopl will be present in the world in twenti year . imagin how life would be if fewer car were use . how will peopl move from one locat to anoth ? some argu that there are law these day prevent famili from have too mani babi . for instanc , the chines law that state that no famili should have more than one child . even with those law , one can not stop the rapid growth in popul . anoth arguement propos is that women these day are choos not to marri for they have more job opportun and can live independantli . new estim show that the number of women is larger the number of men so even if 25 % of the women in the world decid not to marri , there will still be 75 % who are will to settl down with a husband and have as mani children as he want . popul growth will continu to be a problem and more car will have to be produc to satisfi the peopl . unfortun , each gener produc is lazier than the gener befor it . by the time we reach the year 2026 ( keep in mind that the year now is 2006 ) , the level of lazi will reach it peak . thi is realli sad but it is a fact that we must leard to deal with . peopl at that time in the futur would n't want to move around on foot , or bicycl or ani other form of transport that would tire them . the onli way to solv thi problem is by have more car to satisfi the need of the gener will come . as my mother would alway say , `` what a lazi gener ! '' if that is what she keep on say about the present gener , imagin how it would be twenti year from now . it ha been said that becaus of the popul growth , there must be fewer car . imagin life with so mani car ! pollut will certainli be a problem , the street will be much more crowd and peopl will have problem reach their destin in time for import meet or deadlin . as much as i am awar of thi problem we have to shine light on anoth import point . men are veri lazi . they would n't want to walk to reach their goal or ride the bike . unless a new method for transport is invent that will not tire out the new gener , more car will have to be present by that time . popul growth and the lazi of new gener are two main factor that will increas the number of car that will roam the street in the futur . i am fulli awar of the problem that will occur becaus of thi but one can not live in denial all of hi life . we need more car . how els are we go to move around ? unless a new solut is propos for transport comfort from one place to anoth , car will continu to multipli in number as peopl do .
