it 's up to peopl and what they want to studi in their current life , they choos to studi more than one subject and some just focu on their one and onli subject . i am a undergradu student , i had my long time choic up , i have one last semest , and i have chosen that i want to studi electr engin , but , i have considerd that i dont onli want to studi electr engin , i also want to studi languag , there are these two type of languag that i realli want to learn , which are japanes , and italian , it 's caus when i see peopl talk other languag i say to my self that they are brilliant and clever peopl , it 's not as easi as you think it is studi more than one subject , it make you look more expieranc and much clever when you mention that you talk more than one or two languag . my basic point in the last paragraph , is that i want peopl to think and consid the same thing i am think about , i am sure if they do think the same way i am think , peopl would studi more than two subject 's . right , peopl ask themselv that we are onli good at one subject , for exampl which is busi , so we cant studi engin caus it so hard and complic , what i say is that thi is the point of the reason whi peopl should go for more then one subject , it doesnt onli teach you about engin it also teach about expier for exampl , now you have a hous to build for your famili and you dont have ani clue what to do , you cant let a person rip you off by sell you equip that you never heard of , so if you had that knowledg , you could get the thing you want and how you want it . i am not basiclli talk about engin thi goe out to all the other subject 's . the main reason i am talk about is that , it is import to studi more than one subject , becaus it give more knowledg and expier in life .
