i realli enjoy travel . in my life , i would like to visit the most countri in thi world . howev , what is the best way to travel ? i have experienc travel in a group led by a tour guid . also , i have travel in a group without tour guid . so , i can say that i do agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i will talk about both way of travel . when i graduat in high school , some student and i plane a trip to pari . we choos to travel with a tour guid when we arriv in pari . thi is the best trip i have ever taken . the trip guid know almost ani kind of entertain in pari , with him , we discov pari and hi surround . he brought us to visit the effel tower , the champ elyse . second , the tour guid brought us to a small citi surround pari , and we enjoy the natur , the architectur of thi part of the citi . the advantag of travel with a tour guid is that he know the map of the citi , therefor , he ha no difficulti to guid us . howev , the most signific disadvantag to travel with a tour guid is that it requir addit money . i also travel with some friend without tour guid . we decid to visit the citi of quebec . it wa realli difficult for us to read a map and visit the citi becaus it wa our first time to travel in thi town . we did n't enjoy the trip as we did when we were in pari . must of the time we were in quebec , we frequent ask direct to peopl around the street . some of these peopl were will to help us , but other were to busi to take a time to guid us . fortun , it wa cheaper to travel without a tour guid . to conclud , there are sever advantag to travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus thi person pocess knowledg relat to tourism . howev , as i enjoy travel , travel in group without a tour guid can be great especi when i do n't have enough money to pay for a tour guid .
