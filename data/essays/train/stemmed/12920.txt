i agre with the statement wich say it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than learn it as fact . also , i think they have to learn how to use the idea in thier life not to deal with it as fact . there are mani reason support my opinion . first of all , when a student deal with the idea as fact he will be not abl to use the idea in hi real life , and he will be act with it like fact with out understand . for exampl , when i learn some idea in the chemistri lap i feel interest and i can use the idea in my life . on the other hand , when i studi some idea in my book without understand the concept , i feel bore and i feel that i cant use it in my real life . secondli , when you studi some idea without understand the concept will do veri bad in the test . let me explain to you , my friend ali just memor the idea as fact and he did not understand the concept , when he took the final test he did veri bad and he did not pass the subject . thirdli , mani research prove that know the concept help you to understand the subject more than deal with it as fact . becuas when you understand the whole idea you can imagin how doe the theori work . in conclus , we can say that understand the idea or concept is more import than deal with it as fact . so , when you understand the entir concept it is easi for you to use it in your life also it will be easi to unerstand how doe the theori work and you will feel enjoy when you studi the subject . mani peopl think in thier that learn idea as fact is more import , but i think my opinion is the right one .
