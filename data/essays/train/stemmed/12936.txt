i dont agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl . the given statement can be accept onli to the extent of physic strength . the older peopl can not do all aspect of work physicali as activ as young peopl can do . but in other aspect they can be on par with peopl . befor say how let me categoris differ type of enjoy life . it could be in term of spiritu , philanthropi , through experi which come along with age , percept of life etc . an older person can how to reliev from stress compar to an younger person which lead to hapi or unhapi in life . well i believ that an individu can enjoy hi life onli when he ha peac . an older person can better deal the traumat stiuation that everi one face in life than a younger person . the younger person enjoy hi life mostli through matrliast pursuit which is onli temporari and not the real joy . but at the most an older person who swam accross the age of youth is more inclin toward spiritu bliss . he is more religi and he can see the path between him and the god and that is the real and true joy . what is so sick about among peopl is that they dont have time to enjoy differ aspect of life like natur , literatur and art in their busi schedul of life of accadem and carrier . an yong person may not experi the same qualiti of joy as an older person can while jog or listen to music or show concern and understand peopl come to them . what iiwant to conclud is that the definitio for enjoy may not be same for all . each individu can enjoy life accord to the way he perceiv it . so i dont agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl .
