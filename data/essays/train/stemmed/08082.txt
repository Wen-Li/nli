the abil to understand idea and concept could be consid the base of educ . thi skill is necessari to learn effect fact and rule , but also to develop own opinion and draw consequ on what learn . for exampl for schoolchildren , learn the mechan that are behind the basic rule of mathemet , is the first step to be abl then to solv problem and find solut . it 's therefor import that they understand what it mean , for instanc , ad number , befor know the result of the oper itself . fact and rule learn without know their signific risk just confus student , who may have a lot of inform , but can not organ them into a logic framework . the further you go with the level of educ , the more import abil , other than pure knowledg of fact , will be . fore instanc , while write a thesi in higher educ , you start from reasearch and collect materi and inform from mani sourc , but then what realli matter , and what you will be evalu for , is your own contribut : develop idea from fact that are just the base of a complex studi . i would also add , that nowaday , the internet made a lot of inform easi access to peopl . what is import then , is find the relev inform , organ and develop it . rememb fact , data , number , is not anymor so import when a lot of sourc are avail and so easi access . unlik the oral-bas cultur , where memori wa essenti for knowledg , today other skill are becom more and more import . i think that understand idea and concept , mean also be abl to understand peopl , differ opinion and choic : it is not just studi , it also help to live and handl cultur conflict that are inevit in the multicultur societi . therefor the capac of understand other point of view , is more and more import to manag the cultur differ , which is now part of our life , and which i believ , in most of the case , repres a rich .
