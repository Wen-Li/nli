i fulli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my mind advertis is just the invent of some smart busi manag who want to increas the money they make through the sell of their product . of cours advertis is also a possibl for a compani to present their product to a wide rang of peopl through televis . but i am of the opinion that , if they would tell the truth about their product less peopl would buy it . they have to make peopl believ that their product is the best product that they could buy , and that it would improv their life . i think especi product such as wash powder seem much better in the advertis than they realli are . do we not all know the advertis about the `` new incred wash powder '' that is abl to clean all our cloth and make them look brand new ? there are so mani of the advertis that claim that they have found the solut for our daili problem . honestli , i have to say that none of these product ever work as good as it should work . it is a well-known fact , that most of the peopl believ in the advertis . the compani use the belief of the peopl that it is not allow to lie . everybodi know from hi parent that it is not polit to lie and so the peopl think that the advertis can not be wrong . i also notic that the peopl who produc these clip use the lack of knowledg of the peopl . in germani there is a clip for yoghurt with sugar from fruit . for the peopl who do not know about fruit sugar , thi yoghurt seem much healthier than a normal yoghurt doe . a lot of parent want to give their children someth healthi and therefor they buy thi kind of yoghurt . if my mother ha n't told me that fruit sugar is almost as unhealthi as normal sugar , i would also have believ that thi product is much better . especi thi inform from my mother made me believ that most of the product seem better in the advertis than they realli are .
