i disagre with the idea that these day children do not have enough time to contribut to their commun . there are two reason for my opinion ; activeti in school and activeti by govern or commun . first , activeti held in school give childeren a lot of time to engag in help commun . for exampl , evey year in japan school hold a school competit . parent of children come togeth with their famili . they enjoy with see children run or play sport . they commun with other famili in that that competit . in addit to that , volunt actuveti asoci by school also help children to help thier commun . 90 % of school in japan hold at least one volunt activeti in each year . in that activeti children contribut to thier commun . farthermor , in school children learn about their commun . they have to learn about their commun and do ani activeti for thier commun . second , activeti held by govern or commun also give children a lot of time to help thier commun . for instanc , govern also hold volunt activeti in each year . in total govern hold twice ativeti as mani as that held in school . govern and commun give children more oppotun to help thier commun . concequ , i think young peopl have a lot of time to help thier commun becaus of two kind fo activeti ; school ' activeti and govern 's or commun ' activeti .
