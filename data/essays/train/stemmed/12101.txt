peopl learn a lot of kind of knowledg in thier school . educ is neccesari point for all peopl to have good life . there are mani controverci topic about school and teach methord . the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact '' is also big topic in educ . i have studi sinc i wa child , and i have expeliens of mani kind of teach methord . from my experi , i agre thi idea i think that teacher can not teach everyth , educ give abil to think . first , teacher can not teach everyth . in the school , there are time limit . it imposs for student to learn everyth in that school . for exampl , nurs student studi in a nurs colleg for three-four year . do they know everyth about nurs ? i do not think so . knowledg that student receiv in the nurs colleg is just basic knowledg . in addit , knowledg are chang as research is done . in hospit , nurs need to studi nurs in depth in the critic area ; nurs methord are chang everyday . therefor , i think that teacher can not teach everi fact in the school ; student need to understabd idea and concept . late , educ give abil to think : how to deal with a situat , how to solv that problem . if student onli understand fact , they could not solv a differ situat . howev , if student know the concept or idea , they could use those concept to fit the situat . in nurs , nurs care a lot of kind of patient : differ age , gender , diseas , race and cultur . if nurs know concept of nurs care , they would chang their nurs care that fit patient ' condit . if nurs did not understand the idea , they could not provid good nurs care , and patient would not have good outcom . i think that fact show peopl one situat . yet , ide and concept give us a lot of possibl . in the educ , teacher are not abl to teach everyth . student can not deal with differ situat if they onli know the fact . therefor , i agre that statemnt .
