but you for your profession work you have to be specialis in a specif subject . becaus today you have to be one of the best in your field to success and to be abl to answer to all question . but their is not just the professiopn world who is import . and you ca n't progress if you are just abl to speack about your job in my opinion it 's veri import to have a gener cultur to be abl to discuss from all topic with other peopl , to be abl to understand the world , the art . you have to be awar on the world . but gener cultur isvit in the all day life . histori is veri import for exampl . and you ca n't forget the histori of human . it 's a question of respect but it 's import to do not make the same mistak as in the past too . anoth argument is that to have knowledg in some field can help you in other subject . for exempl you ca n't studi art without have knowledg in histori . and i think that studi mathemat can bring the logic you need to understand philosophi . that 's whi i think it 's import to have a minimum of knowledg in all the field and to be specialis in one of them . i think that the studi have to bring thi balanc betwenn the gener cultur and the specialis . it 's the key of the satisfact of a person .
