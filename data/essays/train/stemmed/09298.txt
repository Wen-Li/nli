in my opinion , in some situat it is better for peopl to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , while other specif circumst , peopl need to special in one specif subject . for exampl , if i plan to go out for a camp , it is probabl that i need much more knowledg from differ area , such as geographi , some of the medienc skill and a good sens of surviv knowledg . to learn knowledg form a broad part will help me to solv the problem which we will catch in ani delimma . in addit to thi , it is better for peopl who learn mani skill to find a descent job in the competit job market . on the other hand , if i want to fix the broken televis , i need to be control profession and accur electron and mechan knowledg , thu help me to recov the televis . especi , in the part of advanc techonolog area , most scientist must studi in a potienti degre that help them to creat the new thing . differ job also need the knowledg differ . for a saleman , it is more than possibl that they should learn a broad knowledg . if a salema studi phycholog , market and busi , it must have a big merit than other peopl . they can sale too mani thing than the peopl who not know broad knowledg . but as a teacher , they should special in their subject , so that they can teach student profession and accur knowledg . but the student would be better to learn broad knowledg in the school , they can find their interest on some subject and develop it in the futur . in conclus , the knowledg for peopl whther learn broad or specif is depend on their situat . if peopl can control the good scale on that , they must be success in the futur .
