you did your reseach and chose a veri good tour . you brought your map , your back pack , your camera and some candi for the trip . you expect to cover everi singl citi that the program includ . sound great ! ... but you just found out ( alreadi on the bu , train , whatev ) that you have 30 min to spend in each place , and you start to think that it is not what you expect . .. well , that is what commonli happen when you travel in a group , with a tour guid ( policeman ) , check on you everi step of the way , fix your schedul , tell you not to roam to far and sometim even tell you what to eat . travel in a group mean that you are part of a bunch of peopl go to everi place togeth , sometim have to hold convers that you do n't want to have , and observ a schedul that is not even suitabl for you . even though travel in a group could have good thing , as for exampl , you can cover a lot of area and place in a specif time , becaus everi thing is schedul , you should also have to deal with the contraint of it , that commonli get traduc to frustrat and that sens of `` not enough time '' in certain place , museum , citi of even a sidewalk . for us that like to have more time to spend freeli while travel , and be open for the espontaneu stuff , it is certainli not the way to go ! i prefer to travel by myself , in order to have the liberti to decid what i would like to do in a specif moment . if a would like to stay for one more day in a specif citi i can just ask myself ( and my wallet ) to receiv an answer and that 's all . in conlcus , i believ that if you want to visit a lot of place in a short period of time , and have somebodi to control your agenda , travel in a group is for you . but if you want to have a more local perspect of place , and the opportun to decid in the moment wether what to do , stay away from the travel group !
