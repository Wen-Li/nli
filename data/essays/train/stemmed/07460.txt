nowaday widespr discuss exist as to whether student should focu on a specif subject dure their studi or rather tri to gain knowledg in mani field of academ interest . i have given thi question some thought myself as i start out attend an interdisciplinari cours at univers and then decid to refer to a cours sole about econom . on the one hand , divid your attent in between lot of differ subject , you do not run the danger of becom a narrow-mind academ complet endors in their own field of studi as you interact with mani differ point of view and opinion . some of the brightest research you meet might not be the nicest compani as they are not open to other peopl ' point of view . secondli , focus on one singl topic you might miss out on a lot of interest thing you could learn in other field . as an environment engin you might also be interest in art , just as an artist might want to know how a power station work . thirdli , if you have chosen one subject you want to concentr all your studi on , it may be hard for you to chang direct and you may end up have to stick to a subject for the rest of your life . especi in the fast-pac world of today it is essenti to stay flexibl and a knowledg of mani academ subject certainli help to do so . on the other hand , it can becom quit exhaust tri to accumul knowledg about a wide rang of topic at the same time . i found it veri hard tri to rememb all the paragraph dure my law class and , half an hour later , have to recal the most import date in german histori . wherea if you stick to one subject , the amount of work will be less overwhelm . furthermor , by devot your time to one specif subject you will be abl to studi it in depth and gain distinct knowledg that will be more valuabl than just a broad overview you get if you studi that subject besid mani other . thi valuabl knowledg , that put you apart from other student , will be what compani look for if they are tri to hire peopl for import job and , what is more import than improv job prospect in a world like today where well-paid and highli regard job are scarc ? to conclud , i think it is better to speical in one specif subject rather than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , becaus , although there are a number of advantag in accumul broad knowledg of mani subject , the gain from focus your studi on one topic clearli outweigh these .
