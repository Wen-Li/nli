ye i agre with the statement , becaus logic of the car in a citi is alway base on the fact that there is a fuel present in , on which it can run . so the basic fact should be that - presenc of fuel in abund . but that is not the case , as we all know fuel ( petrol , diesel ) are non renew souc of energi . the fuel take thousand of year ro come in to be , but they are reduc faster as compar to their presenc with us . so in return their price are increas day by day . and peopl have alreadi start take for differ altern like cng ( compress natur ga ) , lpg ( liquifi petroleum ga ) . but the ironi is that these option are also non renew . so somewher down the line the price of fuel wether in ani form which i have talk about will be so high that middl class and upper middel class will not be abl to afford it and henc they will use public transport to commut . so that class vehicl will not be prent on road wether car or two weheel . after sometim say 10 yr more the fact will hit the upper class too and we will not have ani car or vehicl on road . the time line about thi danger , which i have alreadi given in the abov discuss is so predict that one can have even calcul about it if he/sh ha both the popul and exist fuel count . they should also have the rate at which fuel are get deplet . so the best way to tackl the proablem is to find out renew sourc of energi through which one can commut to differ place . sure the work ha alreadi been start , becaus the affect of thi fear is alreadi notic in the current scenario .
