i complet disagre with thi statement . i think that the whole world is mainli depend on the life fact . mr. gandhi had said that if their is fact and truth in your life then you are on the verg to win the world . in a class room when mani student are listen a perticular lectur . they mainli concentr on the lectur . they listen to the onli part which the lectur is say . as a part of the studi , lectur provid them onli the idea behind the topic . and accordingli the student follow the instruct of the lectur . at thi time student can not understand the topic becaus they have not ani real exampl to support the topic . they just mug the topic and leav it as a part of assign and some may think that it is onli a part of our syllabu . on the other hand some student go in deep . they analyz the topic . they dont mug the topic . they approach each other or go through the book to understand the concept behind the topic . but in book , it is not compulsari that everi book ha mention the realiti of the topic and from where it come . but some book conceptu explain thi veri well . variou concept are provid for a singl thing . now student ha multipl option for a singl thing . fourtun their topic becom more clear by use thi much amount of the concept provid by the book . but when they come in real life these concept are worthless becaus there can not be a ' idea ' to handl the situat . they do not know the fact about the life and by that they can not surviv in thi confus world . most of the time , the fact of the life are use than idea and concept . for do scienc and mathemat studi idea and concept work but in real life the student should be awar of fact of life . life work on fact and truth not on illus idea and concept though they are use in studi and in do busi .
