it ha been such a long time sinc i complet my academ educ and ha been work as a profession that it is imposs for me not to agre with thi statement . sooner or later school come to an end and profession world start . in the turkish educ system you have to decid on what you want to do at a veri earli age and that decis doe not alway turn out to be the ` right ' one for you . what are you suppos to do when you realis that you have made the wrong decis at the veri begin . it is veri hard to start from all over again . as an experienc profession i beliv have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is alway better than special in one specif subject , for it give you the space , in other word the freedom you need until you decid what you realli want to do . it will be easier for a person with mani aspect to get a job in the profession world rather than wait for the ` specif ' opportun . when one appli for a job it will be to hi benefit to be awar of mani subject , for the boss are usual look for young peopl with a broad vision , eager to learn and capabl of appli what they have learn . i also believ that after decid that one is on the right path , special in that field is inevit if one want to promot . i would like to finish with give an exampl from myself ; i graduat from busi administr , i work in a travel agenc , in a factor compani and at the moment work for a non-profit organ as an expert on the european union and i owe all thi to the broad knowledg of mani academ subject i learn in school .
