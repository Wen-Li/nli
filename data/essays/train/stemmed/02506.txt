as a matter of fact , it is imposs to know everyth on everi subject . everyon ha to make choic . we can choos to know a littl about mani subject , to have an overview of each academ subject . or we can decid to becom an expert in one specif area . in my opinion , becom a specialist in one subject is a better issu becaus we will realli understand the purpos of the subject and we will not obtain onli a superfici knowledg . it is trust to say that when somebodi doe n't know everyth on a subject , he can arriv to the bad conclus concern a problem . then , hi knowledg is useless . what is the aim of know a littl a everyth ? thi is n't useful . for exampl , if we studi a part of the french law , we ca n't solv ani situat becaus a lot of element will miss us . we must know all the articl refer to the problem , all the previou situat which look like the one we are studi . otherwis we are certain to make an error . by know major issu of mani purpos , we can seem veri bright for a while . but it is a superfici knowledg . somebodi like that seem veri interest but in fact he ca n't assur a real convers on ani of the subject he pretend to know . all hi knowledg is a superfici one . decid to special in one specif subject is the best way to be realli useful and to obtain an advantag from our knowledg . learn littl part of everyth is a wast of energi . be a specialist is be profession , effici and useful .
