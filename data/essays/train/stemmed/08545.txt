i complet agre with the statement . out of my own experi , i can say that it is much better to understand the idea and concept behind a certain topic . it make no sens to learn fact onli be heart without understand the real content and sens . when you simpli learn someth without realli understand it , you are like to forget everyth soon . after a few week , you will not be abl to memor what you have learn anymor . but when you realli understand the idea and the concept , you will probabl rememb it much longer or even a life long . i experienc that phenomenon myself . it is now nearli one year ago that i pass my `` abitur '' . and i have to submit that i forgot a lot . .. thing i learn by heart for instanc in biolog have disappear nearli complet . but on the other hand , i can rememb almost everyth in math . that 's becaus i realli understood the concept behind all these math oper . in my opinion , it is a shame that you learn so hard and in the end you forget everyth again . that can not be the object of effect learn ! so the onli conclus from thi can be that it is essenti to understand what you are learn . at the moment , i 'm studi busi studi and in order to use all the concept i learn at univers ( like audit method , account , portofolio diversif etc . ) in my later job , it is import that i understand them . there is no other way ! you can onli be good and success when you know what you are actual do . consequent , i can onli recommend everyon not to simpli learn thing by heart . that make no sens ! teacher should support thi idea as well . they should n't ask their pupil to learn fact and figur , but to understand the thing they have thought them .
