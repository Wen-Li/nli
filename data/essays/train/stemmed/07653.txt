i agre when it is said that success peopl tri new thing and take risk to reach their purpos . but i think that thi is just one side of success . in fact nobodi could ever have success if he is not lucki too , neither `` success peopl '' . obvious if you alway stay attach to thing that you alreadi know , mayb you could live a normal life , but sure you will never have success and thi is whi i agre with part of the statement abov . success peopl alway tri to reach new goal and tri to be involv in differ situat . thi is a risk , becaus they leav someth known for someth but as i previous said , you have to be lucki . even in literatur there is a good exampl of what i am say . if we anal the `` malavoglia '' , book written by g. verga , we could find exactli the explan of my thought . when ` ntoni , one of the main charact of the stori , took the famili 's boat `` la provvidenza '' and sail to a new harbor look for success , the fortun were not with him . in fact he lost everyth dure a storm , broke the boat and that had been the begin of a lot of problem for hi famili . mayb thi could be too much strong as exampl , but i think that it give the idea of what i think about the statement to argu . so , i certainli agre with the statement , but if i could , i would complet it say that success peopl are even lucki peopl .
