enjoy the life is more depend on the factor like age , cultur , workatmospher and mani more . if one count all the abov factor it 's more obviou that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . a young person will be have the zeal to develop himself among the competit world , here a person undergo lot of pressur and stress may due to the work or due to the climat they work under . so most of the peopl tri new way to relief themselv 's from stress and strain so they outmost tri to opt entertain such as movi , parti and everi possibl way to get relief from the day to day work . young peopl enjoy not onli with the peopl of their age group , or of the same cultur , but they mingl with each and everyon , they find out new way for entertain . they tend to locat differ place and attend parti . on the other hand old peopl tend to a similiar age group , they enjoy sit with togeth and particip in religi function 's . they donot feel that much stress or strain as the young peopl do . as youngster 's would be more energet than the old peopl thay do have lot of aspect 's for entertain and fun , they have their uniqu way to celebr , share their idea and cultur which most of the old peopl would'nt prefer . mostli old peopl constrain themselv to a limit part , it doe n't mean that they wont have fun and they do n't enjoy . they will have their own way of life and their own prespect of live . they constraint themselv to the religi function 's , or els with the small get-to-geth with the famili member 's . most of the old peol prefer pleasent and stress life after their duti 's , they prefer clam and pleasent atmospher arround them . in my point of view the statement given can be state as the contradict of the past and the present life of a man , sinc everi old person is a youngster onc a time befor in the past . as a conclus i want to agre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy the life more than old peopl do '' . sinc it 's not the compras of past and present but it 's a comparis between two race such as old and new face of a person . i would end thi by conclud that `` young peopl enjoy more than the old peopl do '' .
