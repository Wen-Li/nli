i agre with the statement . i will chose the group travel led by tour guid . first , use a tour guid take us less time to search the detail of the place we will visit and the way how to go there . if we do n't have enought time to studi them , thi becom a convini way to travel . secondali , a tour guid may know the special place which ordinay tourist do n't know . i think it is veri difficult to find out the place which local peopl onli knonw good . so if we travel led by a tour guid , we may more apprici the tour . fainali , travel led by a tour guid provid us with more safli tour . for exampl , foreign countri travel is the case . when we go to the countri , if we do n't know what the languag spoken or how safe the region is , that may ocuur some danger situat . so , if we do n't have a confid we get along with them , use a tour guid is good select .
