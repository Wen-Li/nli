histor , to have a broad knowledg of subject wa perceiv as part of a cultur enrich societi . if we take a peek at the ancient greek we see that all their main philosoph ( platon , aristotel or socrat ) were consid to be expert in mani field . but time ha chang and nowaday special ha becom more and more import . have said thi , i ca n't total disagre with thi tendenc . i believ that in our modern societi , if you want to stand out from the rest you need to special and becom an expert on your area or field . a good exampl of thi is what the labour market is current demand . if you do n't have a job becaus you are not special or expert enough , how can you wish to have a broader knowledg ? differ is if , in your spare time , you devot it to persu other academ knowledg , that 's fine . but i believ that the real reason whi mani peopl choos to a veri specif academ knowledg and a certain career path is becaus thi will assur them the sufici ` know how ' they will need in th futur tu secur a job posit . educ author and respons should have a say in all thi . from my perspect the educ law should provid the opportun to the student to choos a wider spectrum of subject as longer as possibl . to be honest , thi will not be possibl alway , there will a time that the student will have to focu in which path he or she will like to continu in . but the later we prolongu thi decis , the better . to summar , if we live in an ideal world we could all know about a lot of subject but thi is n't like thi . the realiti is averi differ one and we have to appli to it . the societi want ` expert ' and we know it , so we play by the book .
