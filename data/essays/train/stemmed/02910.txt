as a high school student , i am often pretti upset and even a littl irrit of the gener misconcept of the young gener ha becom more selfish if compar with the previou gener . that is , frenquent heard from adult that young peopl have no contribut to other and even the commun they belong to . that is complet wrong ! take my school for instanc , we do care about our commun and in fact spend plenti of time to do all kind of voluntari work in out commun . almost everi weekend , student from differ grade gather togeth in front of our school at seven in the morn . you may be quit curiou what we are go to do ? it 's saturday ! student then be divid into sever group by teacher and after that , it 's time for us start our mission . actual , we are assign differ job to do everi weekend ; sometim we clean the street which we do most frequent ; sometim we visit some chariti in the commun to do voluntari job for them ; sometim we clean the park , locat next to our school ; sometim we hold band perform as entertain for peopl in the commun who have no idea what to do on the weekend . sound interest and tempt ? absolut . stuent at my school are encourag to join these activ becaus our tescher stress that school is n't the onli place for learn . to tell the truth , thi is excatli what i think and the most import reason encourag me to give up my holiday . i still rememb clearli onc we were to visit kid with similar age with us but suffer from mental ill or other disabl . i wa quit afraid becaus i thought they might be scari in both appear and behavior . but what i had seen wa their most sincer smile and enthusia to make friend with each us . from then , i start to visit them frenquent with some book and cloth as gift for them . i come to realiz there is never a border between peopl , onc i 've decid to open my mind to accept and respect . these activ held by school to encourag student to get involv in their communitu are n't unheard form other shcool and other part of my countri . young peopl are n't careless about involv and help other in thier commun but rather entusiaist and will to help , onc we know how to step out our first step .
