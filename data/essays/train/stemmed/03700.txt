some peopl say that as the technolog advanc 's so will the manufactur of the car 's while some peopl beliv that the manufactur of car 's will reduc and there will be an increas in other trasport servic 's apart from car 's . i beleiv that there will be an increas in the product of car . firstli as there will be an advanc in technolog there will also be an industri develop . due to thi more amount of peopl in today world a shift from use bike , two wheeler vehicl 's to car 's becaus it increas the safeti of the peopl . as time pass by old car will be replac by newer car which would work by a hydrogen cell which is extremli harmless . by then technologli would have advanc and instead of use pertoleum as fuel product water will be use as sourc of fuel . thi explain the reason as to whi there wil be an increas in the product of car 's in the next twenti year' secondli as time pass by technologli will be so advanc that everyth will by handl by a robot . so an increas depend on robot and robot car 's will be the main aspect after twenti year their depend will be the main reason whi there will be an increas in the product of car 's in twenti year . in contrast to thi there may be certain other problem face there may be shortag of steel which is most import thing requir for the make of the car moreov there may be problem like the shortag of fuel which may obstruct the the develop of the car 's becaus as time pass by our petroleum reserv may die down and thu the make of the car 's may be reduc thu i conclud that no matter how thing are may be there might be no petroleum reserv 's in the near futur the technolog will be so advanc that there will be an increas in the develpop of car 's and peopl depend on them will increas to .
