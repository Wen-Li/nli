sinc the birth of civil , the young have alway been accus of not respect tradit , and of not bee as good as their parent , or even elder brother , were . in thi essay i will argu that the main reason for which we may consid that the young inde do not give enough time to their commun is that they actual do not feel that they belong to ani commun , wherea strong commun still obtain the same behaviour , respect and work from their younger member . while walk in the center of a big western european citi these day , one can not help be stricken by the fact that most peopl do not look at each other . they usual wear headphon , or are talk on their mobil . they rare pay attent to what is happen around them . i think that thi show that peopl mostli care about their own self and not about their commun , much less present in everyday live as they use to be . most peopl nowaday lack a real sens of what communitit they belong to , what are their oblig toward these commun and what benefit they get from take part in them . for exampl , the strength of religi commun in western europ ha been declin steadili over the past centuri . church servic use to be a common oblig for the young , and religion wa a sourc of a lot of hard work due to the commun share that religion . thi observ ha nevertheless to be contrast with the situat in the unit state , where veri divers religi movement are aliv and activ , involv mani young peopl . howev , my own experi in pari show me that whenev a strong commun is present , the youth do respect it and give time for it . i think for exampl at jewish commun , which have alway been veri strong . young peopl see commun as a structur that protect them and give them part of their ident , and are thu eager to particip in it . i thu believ that , whenev a strong commun is present around some young peopl , they are grate to it and are will to give time help it , in exchang for bee help by it elder member , therebi gain experi , a ressourc much sought after by the young . unfortun , there are not mani strong commun around these day , and the young thu have no one to give their time to , except themselv .
