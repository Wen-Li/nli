i think that nowday there few young peopl that spend some of their time to help someon els . so , i can say that i am agre with thi statement . i do not believ that young peopl know that wrong . in fact i think that is the societi that grow the young peopl . everyday i see thi lack of help in differ situat . in order to they think onli to theirself . there is not help and thi is possibl to view in our famili , or in our commun . when there is need to do someth , young peolp do not think . young peopl do not to be abl to help their friend . when there is a difficulti in a commun all the member tri to resolv the situat but nowday also the adult tri it . young peopl spend a lot of time to play with their friend , to studi , but alway alon . an exampl to explain what that i say is thi . think about at the bu stop , there is an ancient woman that ha some difficult to take the bu . near to her there is a young boy that see her but doe n't help she to take the bu . indiffer nowday is at the basi of our societi , and thi is veri afraid . there is n't comun in our societi : internet , the tv , ha modic our maind and all seem to feel as a fiction . return on the principi that must stay at the basi of a good societi is veri import . nowday also in our famili we can see these situat of no help . help should return at the basi of our life becaus it is better to give that reciv . societi must chang for a better futur .
