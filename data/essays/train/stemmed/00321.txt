advertis is a major categori and a fast-grow trade in today 's world . it is a wide field that ha manag to gain control of how we view everyth around us , from polit to groceri . we see advertis everywher ; on televis , in magazin , in newspap , on the street , we even listen to them on the radio . adveritis ha becom a field of competit between compani , each compani tri to present it product in a perfect pictur to the consum . but is that product realli as good as the commerci claim it to be ? i agre with the statement , that most advertis ( if not all ) make product seem much better than they realli are . for i have been a victim of such fals commerci repeatedli . i recal buy an expens shampoo upon see it advertis that promis and guarante longer hair in one month . of cours , i did n't notic ani differ to my hair growth rate , even after two month of usag . i wonder whi most compani ca n't releas a product they are confid enough about , so they would n't need to add mislead inform to their commerci . i do n't think it 's fair to the consum ( or to the consum 's pocket ) to be fool into buy someth that doe n't match the descript he/sh had in mind . i think product should be profession compar to their commerci befor view them in the media . that would , no doubt , decreas such misguid advertis . but i guess that , over the year , one gather experi , and eventu know what to believ and what not to .
