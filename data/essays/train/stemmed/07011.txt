as the year pass by , mani univers , school and other institut are tri to teach the futur gener and provid them with the wide varieti of scienc which make them readi for the futur challeng . the question that alway rise in these institut is whether it is more import for the student to understand the idea and concept or to learn the hard fact . in my person opinion , i think it is more import for the student to understand the main concept of the subject than to learn fact . as for a student to learn a fact , all he ha to do is to memoris it . memoris someth without understand it will lead to forget thi fact as soon as _or shortli after _ the stimulu for memoris it is over . fact are onli memoris and store in the long term memori if they are constantli use in everyday life . for exampl when a medic student ha to memoris all differ type of drug . if thi student wa n't ask about these drug in everi morn round , where he had to revis them everytim he made a mistak , he would otherwis forget them . on the other hand , understand the subject make it easier to rememb . for exampl when the same medic student ha to memoris some inform about the physiolog of the human bodi . he can understand it onc , and answer ani question relat to thi topic year after he had studi it . thi is whi i prefer understand the topic over learn the fact . as the fact are easili lost over the year and what remain is what we understand of that particular subject . understand the idea and concept requir far more work and process by the student than onli memoris the fact . so it is alway up to the student at the end to choos between understand and memoris .
