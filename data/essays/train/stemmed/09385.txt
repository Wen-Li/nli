there are differ opinion regard whether adolesc recent day do n't give enough time in help their commun . although it is true that there are a lot of exampl of young peopl shown on televis or mention on internet that give a lot of help to the commun they are involv in , in my opinion teenag do n't have enough time to give ani hand to their commun as well as no will to help the commun . in thi essay i will briefli give reason support my opinion . most of all , the adolesc nowaday are all confus and complic in their commun as to the quickli chang societi . what i mean by thi is that , although some children may have thought to help their commun but that they are not capabl as to the lack of time they have . modern day requir student to spend more time in school and also to go to institut for extra work . even for small young nurseri kid and significantli more for the teenag , their parent want more and more from their children . some student suffer from mass of work due to school , institut and sometim privat tutor . they do not have time to give support for their commun . further more , as to thi busi life they have they lose power to help their societi . after spend a hard time in school . the institut , a privat tutor and finish their day with neverend home work on their desk , they will be absolut exaust out by the end of the day . it is obviou for those student to feel less tempt and enthusias in give support for their commun . moreov , young peopl in modern day are more like to be selfish than those in the olden day . as i mention abov their are lot of student who work extrem hard , some who prefer to work hard nd some who are forc to work hard . howev in either way the competit among adolesc ha increas dramtic . i am not say that there wa no competit at all befor , but there were truelli less tension among friend and less silent fight among them . and the chang of thi in the societi had made the young peopl more selfish , less understand , not care of other in order to surviv in thi terrifi world , so they have thi think that help other will get them down from surviv in the world . in addit , the parent also gave a great impact on adolesc ' person , characterist and behaviour . in modern day a significantli increas number of parent nearli obey their children . they do anyth what their child ask and want , and as to thi children are more like to turn out to be selfish and think that they are the best in the world and that they are not to give ani help to other peopl but to be love and help from the other . as to the reason i mention abov , it is difficult for young peopl nowaday to give enough time to help their commun sinc they lack time and physic strength to support them and also chang in their person as to the chang of the whole world and their outer effect such as parent . therefor in my opinion it is not adolesc nowaday do not give a lot of amount to support to their own societi .
