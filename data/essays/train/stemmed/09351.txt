we are live in a particular period ; we are hitten by advertis : when we walk along the street we can count a big face with same product on his/her hand , or when we are listen to the radio we can listent to a particular voic that tri to convinc our to buy someth , when we switch on the tv there is alway some spot with a funni music . .. in each place , in each situat we are cover by advertis . it is easi to ask ourselv if the product that are present are so brilliant . i think that a lot of time it is so : most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are . i can say thi for differ reason , first of all becaus the obiect of the compani is to sell their product , and so they use all the way that are necessari to convinc peopl to buy it . second becaus a lot of time peopl buy a particolari product not for it qualiti but onli for it mark . for exampl we can think about food : what are the differ between one biscuit to anoth ? a lot of time the differ is the price : the prodoct that is well-known is more expens than the other , but if we tast the qualiti we can ' t understand the differ becaus they are equal . anoth exampl that i could consid is about cloth . there are a lot of peopl that want wear onli one type of , for exampl , trauser becaus there is a littel spot on it . probabl it is onli to be faschin , but thi trauser , that cost a lot , isn ' t differ from anoth . the last consider that i can do is that advertis hit our unconsci attitud and so a lot of time we choos prodoct that is pubblic in unconsci way . i
