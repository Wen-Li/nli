car are freedom and independ ! that 's what mani peopl think about car offer them the opportun to travel individu everytim and to whereev they want . i think that therefor in twenti year there will be at least as mani car use in the world as there are nowaday , and i 'll tri to show some more reason for that in thi essay . first of all , peopl are veri slow in chang their habit , so even a new technolog would not suddenli stop them all drive car . and there is no technolog to expect in the next few year that could challeng with that flexibl of a cabin that can be freeli driven by one person , in other word it seem that there will be no altern to car for year . if you think about car in the futur you should definetli take a closer look at asia . china and india develop quickli and will soon use a lot of car , and rememb that we are talk about nearli one third of the world 's popul ! noon could stop them from use that easi and quick transport technolog , so they will be happi to start use it like the western world wa in the middl of the last centuri . some peopl say that there would not be enough oil for futur use of car . but expert predict that the oil would last for at least anoth 50 year and in addit everi year more field are discov . to come back to the first and most import point , the flexibl of car offer independ to their driver , it ha to be ask if you would be give up that opportun just for save the environ or stop the traffic and nois on the street . while everyon know that car serious pollut the air noon would stop use them for that reason , becaus they are not abl to see the consequ of that pollut directli or do not recogn them . all at all , there wo n't be fewer car in the futur and in twenti year we have to expect an even bigger number than today .
