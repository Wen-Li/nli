i strongli agre with that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , i have 2 reason to surport my argument which are `` parent are busi '' and `` onli forcu on studi '' firstli , the nowaday ecolomi increas , parent are usual need to work , some parent could be work over 10 hour per day 5 more day per week , the reason for thi , they do n't realli have enough time to talk or commun with their child . in my opinion the young peopl 's commun sill mainli come from their parent , they do n't talk with their parent , shell they talk with anoth peopl automaticli ? i do n't think so . secondli , most peopl from nowaday forcu on studi , they studi at school more over than 8 hour , some student probabl spend more hour studi after school , 24 hour mine 8 hour to sleep and mine more than 10 hour to studi ? how can they learn commun ? everyon believ studi is most importand becaus is help for the futur , but they forget the humen is sort of group work class , can you suriv onli yourself ? final , i believ that nowaday young peopl do n't have much time to learn their commun and it will becom veri shi not as lievili as befor . so my comment for thi is i think parent have to spend some time to talk with their children to improv their commun skill instead send them to school or onli studi at home , and also we need to teach them not onli studi is main but also to commun with anoth peopl is also import .
