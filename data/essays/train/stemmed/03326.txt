nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i agre with thi statement . i will argu my viewpoint by give exampl and explain the import of the commun . it true that not all the young now dont give enough time for their commun but other young have a particular devot for their commun . for my view , the a larg number of young are individu . nowaday peopl in gener and young particularli focu on individu success . for exampl life go fast and ha becom veri difficult that young have to work hard . there are onli face to new individu challeng in order to satisfi their need and there familli . for exampl me , i know that i could help my commun with my academ experi , but it more import for me to find a job , to work hard to keep my job , to be marri , to have a children and to take care of them . it onli after that , that i will think about how to help my commun . therefor it veri import to think about the commun . the question is how to help my commun ? by give my viewpoint on some important subject , contribut for school buld , by undertak research project in order to develop my commun etc . so i would like to advis young to pay attent for the commun , even if there not interest to particip for the develop there are to take care by not destroy what the commun ha built . i would also like old peopl to understand the young becaus now life if more difficult than befor to focu on mani think at the same time .
