the issu at hand is if young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi is a veri interest question becaus the industrialis countri face an increas averag age of their inhabit and an increas life expect . thi acceler an age societi with less younger peopl . but doe thi mean that there is less fun in life for these peopl ? in my opinion , old peopl can enjoy life as the younger one do . in fact , older peopl enjoy a lot of free time which they can use to take part in variou leisur activ . for exampl pension have a lot of time which they can use to travel not depend on their compani or school vacat which make their travel more relax and their destin less crowd . furthermor , a major of the elderli possess larg amount of money which they can spend on their hobbi . have probabl paid off most of their debt and not be forc to rais their children anymor they can use their save for themselv . for exampl , older peopl can buy good which they have alway dream of while the younger one still have to work and save money . addit , as medic treatment are more and more develop , the older peopl can still enjoy their live by continu to do sport , improv their qualiti of life and health . for instanc , compar to drug in the past there are more soft treatment , suppress the disadvantag of the age process by use hormon , enabl them to do mani sport the younger one can do , too . lastli , more and more product and servic for the elderli are creat , make their daili life more enjoy . older peolp are seen as `` silver market '' by sever industri , be offer mani product develop exclus for them just like group travel in which peopl of the same age meet and explor foreign countri . all in all i think that i have shown that be old doe not mean that older peopl can not enjoy life . they might even be abl enjoy life a littl bit more than the younger one do .
