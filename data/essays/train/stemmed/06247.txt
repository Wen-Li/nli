the issu of whether we should travel in a group or alon ha been widli debat spcialli after the event that happen around the world . some peopl like to travel in a group led by a tour guid . other peopl like to travel alon and without a tour gide . both approach have advantag and disadvatag . although , tour guid give more and easi inform about the place , sociti , peopl , and the histori of the countri that we visit , i would rather travil alon and without tour guid . some peopl may argu that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . it is more easi to descov ; so thi argument goe , the place and avoid ani trubl . howev , travel is an enjoment that icloud discov new thing and know differ peopl and get in touch with differ cultur . therefor , if i travel in a group led by a tour guid , i will be control by the guid 's direct and i wolud not be abl to act and get in touch with other by my own way . moreov , travel alon or with a good friend not with a group that i do not know provid me with a uniq experi . for exampl , three year ago i travel to the unit arab emir with my best friend , jack , . eventhough non of us use to live or be there befor , we had a veri good time and experi . we rent a care from abu dhabi , the capit citi , and we almost went everi where in the countri just by use the mab and ask peopl in street . in concluss , i believ that travel alon and without been attach to ani group give the most wonder experi in the life .
