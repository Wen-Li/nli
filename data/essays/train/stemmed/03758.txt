i agre with the statement becaus of sever reason . it is veri casaul and normal to not help their commun in thi societi . as our societi is get more comlex and busi , we can not care evri sigl thing . it is veri true that peopl do not give a enough tension to the commun , but i do not think it is bad at all . the follow statement mention that young peopl special , whi is that ? do you think old peopl give more time to help commun ? i do not think so . as i said befor , thi is dog-eat-dog societi . even children have no much time to play , they are veri busi to learn everyth they can . sometim , each famili member do not know about what their famili do . also , from the statement , it say ' do not give enough time ' . i am sure they are so mani good peopl in thi world and tri to help the commuiti out . i know some peopl who realli do that . they do help them out becaus of not they have less busi time . as we know , a lot of peopl help thier commun . they have to satisfiy with that . me as a repres from all young peopl in the world . we have so much big dream and big list of what we want to do . our brain move to think even we are in bed . but the problem is the world is not give us enough time to do all . so we have to select a one thing to do . what i say is we are still tri to find that last selction . to get enough attens from peopl , especi young peopl is too much . it is not beacus we do not want to help them , it is onli beacus we are deadli busi to do other thing .
