there is an argument concern whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . some peopl might say that learn one special subject is more effect way of studi . howev i agre whit thi statement . becaus peopl can build their carrer and social skill . i will present briefli two reason support my idea in thi essay . first , peopl are abl to develop career through have variou subject . in other word , if someon studi onli in hi area . he/sh onli know about hi field . so his/her skill can be narrow and limit . in my experi , when i wa a univers student . my major wa the studi of vietnames . so i could speak and write vietnames well . but when i graduat from school . it is not necessari . most compani need peopl who have variou skill . so i should studi again . at that time i studi broad mani subject such as econom , english and so on . final i could get a good job . therfor have broad knowledg is good for show peopl 's abil . second , student can improv their relationship with other peopl thank to take mani subject . what i mean is that when student have variou class . the they can meet differ kind of peopl . so it give a good chanc to build their social skill . for exampl , one of my friend take a lot of cours in hi colleg . so have mani kind of friend . when he ha a problem . they tri to help him . and he can be a veri sociabl person . that is good in hi job . consequentri , through have variou knowledg , peopl can make good relationship with other peopl . in conclus , i completli agre with the statement that have variou knowledg is good way of studi . becaus of the reason that i mention abov .
