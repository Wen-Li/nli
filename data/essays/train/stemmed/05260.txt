in essenc , i total agre that a broad span of knowledg of mani subject is better than special in one subject . a broad knowledg span of mani academ field contribut to the overal scholarli statu , or level of educ , of a person . the world we live in revolv around everyth we can perceiv from scienc to literatur to gener knowledg . for exampl , a physicist who can onli talk about physic and the veri technic area of hi field of studi is , at least to me , veri difficult to be call a scholarli person . it is true that he may excel in hi own field of special but he will find it to earn respect from peopl in the societi in gener , partli becaus hi lack of knowledg of ` other ' subject implicitli impli hi disregard for the peopl engag in these ` other ' subject . to me , thi physicist can not be call an educ person . in my opinion , no one field of special can evolv and flourish sole on it own . after all , whatev idea , howev abstract , that are involv in that field are develop and perceiv by human be who live in the real world that compris of all differ thing . it is inevit that even the most abstract of idea in one field should have the slightest associ to anoth idea most like in anoth field . sinc these can be link in some way or anoth , it is appar condus to know other field in order to see these link and perhap also to better the field of special . anoth advantag of a broad knowledg span is differ approach and perspect to view a problem . differ academ area implement differ way of think about problem . for exampl , math mainli adopt logic and reason , while literatur may use a more eleg and artist style to view the world . realiz thi should make a person more flexibl in solv problem in gener and better understand the thing around us , or concept in hi field of special , in multipl perspect . the abov re-emphas the fact that singl special is not desir .
