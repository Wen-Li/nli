the statement say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . we dont know for sure whether thi statement is true or not . twenti year is a long time , and anyth can happen . with all the new technolog that are be invent everyday , it is possibl to have fewer car in twenti year . today , we see that there are too mani car be manufactur than the amount that is need . in kuwait for exampl , everi hous ha about two to three car , if not more . have too mani car can caus disast . as a result , more accid will occur , and peopl would have to leav their home earlier becaus of ani traffic or accid that would caus them to be late . in twenti year , we could have fli car , or a differ trasport system that would result in less car . more peopl might start use other form of transport . in my opinion , i believ that there should be less car in use , and that peopl should use other form of transport to get from one place to anoth . some other form of transport are the use of buse , subway , or carpool . if more peopl use buse and subway , there would be less car in use . carpool is also a good method that can be use to reduc the amount of car in use today . if there wa a rule state that each car should have a minimum of three peopl , less car would be in use . in conclus , a possibl solut is that in the futur , peopl would realiz the amount of money they are spend on ga , and how danger drive ha becom . and who know how much ga will be avail in twenti year .
