from my point of view , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are mani reason that suppport my opinion . now there are more car in the citi than habit , so it will not be suffer more time , too mani traffic jam , slow traffic . .. that disturv the citizen ' life . they probabl , in twenti year , will not buy more car . the public servic are improv everi day . public buss , train . .. make the life easier in the citi . peopl do not like to wast time wait in their vehicl , so they are use public transport more and more , thi fact show that in mani year , peopl will not buy car . moreov , gober are intellig , they offer excel prize in the public buss , with good conect betwen the citi and that make easi the life without car . futhermor , nowaday , we are suffer a lot of car ' accid , peopl are scare from that and the author will take decis to stop it with pay lot of money if somebodi drive so fast or if driver are drink and drive . .. in some mani countri they can take your car off . . in addit the air commic are be improv a lot , it make faster travel around the world and through everi countri . i believ that final peopl will not want to spend five hour in the car in order to visit a rel if they can do the same trip in one hour by plane . also i think that citizen are conciou of the huge pollut that car produc to the enviro . in contrast , i believ that in twenti year will be more motocycl in the citi , becaus these are vey helpful in there . base on the argument that i have expos about , it can be infer that i am agre with the statement .
