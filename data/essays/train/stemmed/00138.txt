student are teach how to think but not what to think . ye i total agreewith the statement that the student have to understand the idea and the concept than it is for them to learn fact . till the time student wont understand the subject and wht he is studi that subject it is wast for ani teacher to teach that subject to a student . thing which are byheart can slip from the mind is veri easi but the thing or the subject whcih is explain to student and tell what is the concept and the idea behind the subject then that is sure that will stay for longer time in student mind . mani mani of us follow that same concept to explain the student then ask him to learn on there own . the idea and cencept is not all time understand by student by him self but he or she need some one to guid and to expalin the concept . there is a small exampl to support my answer , the are two student one is studi on it own mean not attend the class but by heart the syblus and the other who is attend the class reves onli onc . so who is better well i feel the person who is attend the class and read one then the person who is read mani time but not understand the fact and the idea may be he will gain more mark in the exam compar to other one but later the will be diffrent . becaus in colleg u go to learn how to think but not for what to think . so i will like to conclud the topic by say that everi one scienc or about space or of ani subject but at tne end there r onli few who pursu the career in that feilf there r mani who dont have to do ani thing with that but they learn about that but the school are made the student to think about the concept and the idea
