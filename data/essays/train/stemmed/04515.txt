the older the peopl , the more enjoy the life some peopl believ that young peopl have a lot more to do with life than older peopl wherea some other think that it is the opposit . i guess as a young person i am in that second group think that older peopl enjoy life better than we young peopl do for a number of reason like have more free time , more conscious about the valu of the time concept and have better financi condit . peopl are born , grow a littl and start school in a usual life cycl . after that begin , they usual start work immedi after school and can not find the enough time for an enjoy life . unfortun , they find thi time to live more enjoy onli after year and year , at the time they becam old peopl . old peopl are usual retir peopl who have more spare time to live as they want . in addit to that , old peopl usual are wiser than the young peopl and as a consequ of their experinc and advanc opinion about the life , they know the import of time concept and how valuabl an effect time usag is . i believ that thi would help them in think twice and have a more enjoy life in a better-manag time period than young peopl can do . final , sinc old peopl are usual retir peopl and have money from their pension fund or their own save from their invest done in the previou year they would have a bigger chanc the enjoy the life in that old age . at that point , i know that peopl not necessarili have a lot of money to live more enjoy but money ha a consider effect on well be and more money mean more opportun to evalu to have fun or to enjoy in life . to sum up , all these reason make me believ that old peopl have more opportun to live their live more enjoy than younger peopl can achiev . more free time , more conscious about time manag and an amount of money that can easili spend on better opportun of an enjoy life rather than onli surviv would be good asset for a better tast in life .
