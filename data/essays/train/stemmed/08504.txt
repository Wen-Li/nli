the issu of is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than is it for them to learn fact is difficult to deal with becaus you can not understand abstract concept without fact but on the other hand you can not understand fact without explain . it remain that i think thi is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact without understand . to illustr my point of view i am go to give three argument with exempl . firtli , by understand idea and concept you keep a criticis view on the world . we know that to the govern the franc we need a presid . thi is a concept . after we can think about who could be the good one among peapl who would like to becom presid . secondli , thi is evid that to understand how our world work , we need to learn gener concept and idea . and after that we can do our own life in start from thi base . for exempl if you want to learn thing at school , befor you have to learn how to behav in a school and which are the rule of the school . final , understand idea and concept suppos that you use your brain , you have think about these concept and idea . it choos that you are clever if you tri to understand concept befor learn exampl becaus thi is the logic way of do . at the opposit , there are peopl who learn supidli fact and exampl without understand anyth . thi kind of peopl are good at tv game but that all . they have not a critis point of view on the world . we could even say that these person are danger for the societi as they can as extremist feel . to conclud , i would say that as i am a scientif thi is logic for me to learn concept . mani peopl say that thi is too abstract but i think thi is the good way to understand the world : first concept and them fact which support the concept .
