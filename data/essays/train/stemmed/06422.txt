nowaday we can watch at televis a great deal of advertis for a lot of product . consequ , we can wonder whether the product we see at televis are realli good or not . i total disagre with advertis becaus they turn peopl to be stupid . most peopl buy product onli becaus they have seen them at televis and think that they are good . most of time the product are not realli so good . for exampl , there are a lot of advertis for food wherea everybodi know that these product are veri bad for one 's health . that is whi i think that advertis is realli a con and is here onli to attract naiv peopl and so that businessmen might make a lot of money on those poor peopl . moreov , in my opinion most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . western countri are live under the reign of money . money attract money , that is capit and thi is one of the reason whi advertis exist . in the other hand , food scandal are more or less the consequ of advertis product . for exampl , i can quot the foot and mous diseas or the mad cow 's diseas . it can also be ad that becaus of the bad qualiti of certain product , some unscrupul peopl dare to send these '' rubbish '' to lower develop countri and it is a shame
