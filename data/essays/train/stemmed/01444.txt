the domin idea of the 20th centuri wa to have a wide rang of knowledg about a lot f subject area . howev , within the new centuri or with the rise of the autom age we confront with complex machineri which need it own specialist to oper . when we think of in thi sens we see that for the new centuri it is better to have specialist rather than peopl who know a lot about a wide rang of subject . it is the same also in the case of an individu studi . the reason whi i claim thi is that the the scienc of physic have subject us to mani strike discveri such as the particl quark which is smaller than an electron and we have seen the implic of thi discoveri in the field of technolog . we had machineri which oper with nano technolog which is the discoveri of the centuri . thi discoveri have fund it reflect in a wide rang of the area from health to consrtruct . the crucial thing about thi technolog is that it need highli qualifi professionel who are part of a team work on the variou differ section of the same project . these profession in question spend their time mere on the area of their interest and thi enabl them to focu on the whole aspect of the phenomenon that they are concern . in thi case the effort is flew into one direct and consequ more quick and effect result are taken from the experi or the research . the notion of special in one specif subject enabl resarch group to get better result in the sens that everi member of the team ha hi or her own space to do the necessari search on hi or her topic and can arrang time without have ani distract or worri of complet variou task in order to reach a result . to sum up , in my opinion for quick develop and effect result team work and to special in one topic is necessari . by divid the subject among a group or basic by canal oneself into one spacif topic success is more guarante .
