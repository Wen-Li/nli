i think that in a certain way you can learn more from place if you go with a tour guid but probabl will not be much funnier than go with your friend . also if you go with a tour guid you need to wake up at an specif time and be at that moment in the place he told you or if not you will miss that trip . i think that if i want to travel to a place i will need to analyz for what purpos i want to go . if i want to go onli for pleasur or if i realli want to know the turist place and their histori . probabl i will decid to travel with friend but i will go to the tourism offic to get inform about the tourist place of the citi and select which place we like the most and visit them . if the place will requir a tour guid we will pay for it if not we will onli enjoy the place and the moment . sometim go with a tour guid make you feel bore becaus you can not go to eat or sleep at the time you want becaus you need to finish the program he have . but for exampl if i go to a citi for few hour or onli for a day i will choos to go with a group led by a tour guid becaus probabl if i go by myself i will not have enough time to visit mani place and know the citi . in other word i can say that if you want to stay for mani day in a place you can go visit place that seem interest for you and later pay for the attent of a tour guid to talk you about the histori of the citi .
