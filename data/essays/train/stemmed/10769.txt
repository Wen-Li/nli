here the topic is about , is it more import to the student to understand idea and conceot than it is for them to learn the fact . i strongli agre with the point of understand the idea and concept . everi student should have the concept and understand the idea rather than learn the fact about that . by lern the concept the student can understand the subject veri well and can be easi with that subject . if we understand the idea of the subject the student can proceed with the subject veri well , and go deeper into the subject of which he is understand . for exampl if we take the mathemat we need to have concept in the math than the fact regard that , the idea are more import in mathemat than the fact . if we have the fact know about the mathemat then the real concept is not concentr . becaus in mathemat practic is more import than know the fact . the student who is concern about the fact it is of no use , becaus if he concentr on fact he can not be in the competit world , as the oter student are go fast by know the concept and idea . if you take a class room in which a student is intrest in know the fact rather than the concept and the idea then he will certainli loos someth which other student are gain , be a conceptu and know the idea is the encoureg way then know the fact . at last i state that be a conceptu person and understand the idea rather than to be know the fact . understand the idea will not featch a lot in the student life
