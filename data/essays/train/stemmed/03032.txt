most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is extrem true in our modern day becaus the competit in the market is so high that busi are will to do anyth to sell their product . i agre with thi statement becaus i person have bought mani thing base on their advertis but wa shock later on by what i bought . thi is a success way to make the consum loos trust in the produc compani becaus when cheat and deceit come into the issu there is no way a person can depend on the seller . the market is full of other option so the buyer is not limit to thi specif place especi after be treat unrespect . i , person , have an issu with trust and when i put my trust into someth i expect to get what i ask for with honesti and puriti . as soon as i realiz that i have been trick then that is the last time i buy anyth from that place . i do not think that i am the onli one that think thi way becaus if someon is will to put their money into someth than thi thing better be worth it . whenev money is involv the topic becom more sensit becaus money is someth that peopl work hard to tri to earn and they will never just blow it away on someth useless , unless they have a lot of it , then that a differ stori . on the other side , though , the purpos of advertis anyth is to make it more appeal to the peopl and by give it a littl `` push '' of superior make it attract more peopl . so you ca n't realli take it against them becaus that is their goal . although there is a differ between trick someon into someth and convinc them that thi is the best product . if a person is deceiv into buy someth than he is n't veri happi especi if thi thing wa not realli worth it price . but if a person ha satisfact from what he bought becaus he wa convinc and appeal by it then he will not realiz ani default in the product becaus of hi over joy with it . thi issu can be argu in two differ perspect and i do n't nessecarili think that ani of these two point are wrong becaus they are both legitim . my stand on thi issu is that i do n't mind be convinc into someth but i would never toler be trick into it . fake someth and mislead someon is the worst thing to me and i serious would never put up with it .
