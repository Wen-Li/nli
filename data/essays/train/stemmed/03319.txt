`` knowledg is power '' is the great say that everyon know it . one can be succes if he have wide rang of knowledg . i person feel that it is better to have knowledg of all the subject upto high school level and at univers level it is better to go for special in a singl subject area accord to the interest of the student . if a person opt for a singl subject he better understand the subject . he may put all hi effort and keen interest in a singl subject . he go deep into the subject and can play with it . thi lead to mani innov in that particular area . for exampl a person like charlesbabbag invent comput which is the popular instrument that world is use today if he had not dedic to the physic scienc thi might may not happen . if a historian is not dedic to human we might not know the past cultur . thu opt for a singl subject lead to mani advantag . there are also some benefit if peopl have a broader knowledg of mani acadameci but fundament of all subject are enough to becom a master in a paritcular area . lot of subject lead to confus and one may not adopt a complet knowledg of all subject . so what i think is knowledg in one particular subject is more benefici than to have a broad knowledg in all subject though there is a necess of have basic knowledg of all subject
