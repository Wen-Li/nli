i agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . actual , both of them enjoy their life . but , there is differ between young peopl and older peopl . older peopl doe n't have much energi like young peopl . they 've work hardli for long time , and it 's possibl that they alreadi saw mani good thing , and had experi befor . therefor , they 'll not be interest in do or enjoy mani thing . some old peopl realli enjoy their life , but i think youung peopl can enjoy more than older peopl . for exampl , mani old coupl ha travel to some other countri becaus their son or daughter bought the ticket or tour plan for them . after the son got grew up , and when they can make money , and they can make some nice plan for parent . becaus parent work hardli for famili . howev , parent realli ca n't enjoy the tour . the travel ha busi schedul , and they need to walk a lot . so , it can be a littl bit tough for old peopl if somebodi is not healthi enought to do . i saw mani time when i had travel . whenev we walk to new place , they sometim said they did n't want to go becaus they 're are alreadi exhaust from anoth place . mayb , they can enjoy differ thing with differ style . howev , i do n't think they can enjoy like young peopl . i thought about that befor , and actual , i hope i can travel to mani other countri when i 'm younger . even though i do n't have enough money , but i think it 's good idea to tri it . i have differ view with older peopl . and , i can see mani new thing , and can learn . there are some place that older peopl doe n't go or are not allow for entranc . i want to have much more experi befor get older . of cours , i can enjoy my life when i 'm older , too . howev , in my opinion is young peopl ha more varieti of chanc to enjoy differ thing , and more activ becaus they have more energi to tri everyth . after the time pass , it wo n't come back again . so , i realli think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
