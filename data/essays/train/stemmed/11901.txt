i agre with the statement which say that the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . although there are some legal rule for advertis to prevent it from be advert with wrong inform , there still are some problem . for exampl , when you were to do onlin shop , you can easili find some product which are advert complet differ from they actual are . onc i bought a necklac onlin from a store in other countri and when i receiv it , i wa veri surpris how differ it wa from what i thought from the websit advertis . i am sure that mani other peopl must have experienc thi kind of situat . i think thi onlin shop exampl clearli show that mani product are overli advertis to seem much better than actual product . when you do the onlin shop , all you depend on is their advertis and mayb it pictur . sometim pictur show onli the good angl of the product which attract buyer . even the advertis on tv have the same problem sometim . tv advertis for food product are one of the exampl . usual , when they advertis about their food product , they would not say the food doe not tast good or they are ok to eat . they alway have to show that the food product tast veri good . you see a advertis of a food product and you expect it to tast good from the impress of the tv commerci but sometim when you actual eat the food product , you think ' it doe not tast as good as i thought !! ' . i think it show the fact that those advertis on tv make the product seem much better than they are often time . it would not be an advertis if it make you an impress that the product is not good , but i think that they should at least not let the buyer to surpris a lot . they should either produc better product or not to advertis them at all .
