regard the statement , i disagre with the statement . i believ that peopl should studi one specif subject for their knowledg and it make your life enrich . becaus you can learn a specif subject deepli that you are veri interest in . also if you have a lot of knowledg for specif subject , it will be your asset and you can be a specialist at work . first of all , you usual select a major from your interest . it indec that you are interest in your subject basic so you can learn lot of thing from the subject . so onc you can enjoy to learn the subject then you can also get lot of knowledg . on the other hand , if you learn mani subject that you are not so interest in , i suppos that it could not be use knowledg . second , it would be expand your career option if you could get a lot of knowledg of specif subject . accord to the recent news pepar , call nikkei , mani compani tend to hire specialst than generalist . becaus specialist alreadi have knowledg for specif subject so a compani doe n't need to provid a train to them . but for generalist , they need get train when they start a job to get specif knowledg and skill . for conclus , i would like to say that it is better to special in one specif subject that make your life mean and enrich .
