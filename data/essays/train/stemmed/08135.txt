no risk , no fun ! i believ that the statment `` success peopl tri new thing and tak risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do '' is a veri wise adic . it seem that peopl with a new busi tend to play on the safe side , instead of take risk . it is often argu that if one make chang in a slower manner , one 's busi will be safe and success will be guarante . it may be a slow process , but it is safe . unfortun , peopl that have such think also tend to forget that play on the safe side , will not guarante success . there is not one method or formula that lead to succ . such thing doe not exist . with everi decis we make , we take a risk . if one truli `` play on the safe side '' , there are no chang made . everi singl time that we make a choic , me make a risk . so , if even play on the safe side , turn not out to be so safe after all , whi sould one not go for the whole ? take risk and play with new idea and sturctur , can be veri help to a success busi . the odd of fail by take a risk , can high or low , it depend completli on a particular situat . you should not forget that the outcom of someon who is take a chanc , and is succeed , will be much more valubl , than from someon who took the `` easi '' and `` safe '' way of make veri small chang over time . if you would graph the failur and success of two differ busi , one who make small chang , or even none , over a long period of time , and then of anoth busi who is make constant chang and is play with their possibl and the freedom they have avail , you will see that busi one will have a postivi rise curv , and that busi two will have a line that in - and decreas from time to time . but eventu if you would compar these graph , busi two will be the one with the most success . if you want to have a success busi , you have to go beyond your knowledg and experi and be will to discov new , and perhpa , even better method and structur .
