`` live life kingsiz '' . thi is the statement which i alway relat to . so i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . happi and enjoy in life , doe not fade away with age but more to do with the person of the person . firstli , there is not ani age limit defin for a person to enjoy hi life . i have seen peopl who in their old age fulli enjoy their live as compar to their young counterpart . so enjoy in life ha more to do with the person and natur of the person rather than hi age . if a person is veri jovial and fun love , he will like to socialis with hi friend , go for vacat with the famili and will do thingg that will bring happi to him . these gestur of happi and enjoy can be done by a person of ani age . but a person of seriou natur , would like to spent hi time alon rather then enjoy . enjoy mean differ thing to differ peopl . for some it might be spend time with famili or socialis with friend . for some it go on vacat and explor new place . some peopl enjoy do activ like paint and drama , which make them happi . so there is no specif age to enjoy these thing in life . although , one of the reason that can be state in favor that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is that when you are yough you are more physic healthi to fulfil your hobbi and activ , which make you happi . there are certain thing that a youger person can do , which an older person might not be abl to do which so much of passion and energi . in conclus , i would like to state that age actual doe not matter for a person to enjoy life . it depend on your own outlook and the way you want lo live . so if you are young by heart , dont count your age and enjoy life to the fullest .
