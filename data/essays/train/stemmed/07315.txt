when it come to the statement `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' , i alway think of my father 's childhood . compar the societi when my father wa a child and today 's societi , i get a feel that young peopl in nowaday are too busi with their own work and i often expereinc the cold of peopl , theseday . in my father 's childhood , peopl were not pressur by time . he tell me that there were more chanc to clean hi town and to help old peopl who were live soley . howev , in our modern societi , you can alway see young peopl watch their clock and run around with a number of heavi bag . peopl in today 's world , are work when they should be help their commun . my father often remind me that there were noth more import than famili and neighbour when he wa a child . if one of hi neighbour wa get marri , all peopl in hi town came to hi wed to celebr , even the student and the school teacher ! but now , young peopl do not even have time to celebr hi or her own birthday . therefor , when it come for young peopl to help or celebr other peopl , they are not so willing becaus they hardli ever receiv these kind of warm befor . due to the rapid chang of the societi , young peopl have a load of work to do in stead of help their commun and young peopl are lose their friend when they should be social with peopl in their commun . may be , it is the time for young peopl to be relax and have a look around them .
