i agre what the statement just said , success peopl tri new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . waht is the correct mean of success is that you need to tri your best , and you also need to learn new thing to improv youself . if you want to prove yourself into success , the way you do it 's that to learn more thing and whaen someon is ask you , you need to abl to answer them . when you solv someon 's problem , i think that guy will think you are good becaus you know the thing they do n't know . the success person 's person must be veri confid , problem solver and be intellg . thi kind of person will like to learn more thing , and they will tri to find out the problem they ca n't even figur it out . they have to be not veri pround of it , becaus if someon is tri to ask you question and you start to have the feel like you are the power , wise peopl . i promis abou that next second you will be in the deep cave , and nobodi will think you are a success person . actual , been a success person is not easi as you are learn somth . learn is veri basic to be success , but the way and the attitud you face is veri hard to understand properli . such as you are a veri wise and you know lot of thing , but you alway think you are the onli success person in the world and you don ' like someon ask you question . how do you know that everyon know you is a success person , they will just think that you do n't know the question so you are not abl to tell them . `` to be or not to be is a question '' , thi greet is veri famou and import to the person who is success . just to learn as much as you can learn , then you will be the success peopl .
