in our world , advertis are mayb everywher , and therefor our live are strongli influenc by thi form of commun . i think that veri often advertis tri to present a product in such a way that it seem better than it realli is . thi can be done in mani way . for exampl , last year i had to chang my car and i saw the commerci of a veri cheap and beauti car at the tv : i suddenli fall in love with it . when i saw thi car in my citi , i discov that the appeal of the real car wa veri differ from the appeal of the car in the commerci , and obious i chang my opinion about thi product . the * real * car wa tini , and not veri pretti . sometim , commerci triy to amelior a product by other method : for exampl , the advertis of an expens product could not speak about the price of thi product . or the commerci of an experiment product , could not metion that ( import ! ) fact : in my countri , a few year ago , it ha been a case of thi type , concern the sell of a diet drink which were not complet test . i guess that the strategi of commerci that tri to amelior a product is logic , in a strictli econom sens . in fact , the purpos of the advertis is to push a person to buy some product . but , sinc i am a person , i think that thi strategi is cynic and sometim sordid . i guess that if commerici were made honestli and care , then they could becom a veri use and quick way to learn about new product . advertis could be , in thi case , a sourc of inform for everi person , becaus they 're everywher and they 're easi to understand . but if a person know that veri often advertis make a product much better than it realli is , then thi person could not consid commerci as a sourc of nice and simpl inform . thi person will be diffid , and - as an intellig person - he/sh will not be too much influenc by commerci .
