i disagre with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject firstli becaus it is impract to have knowledg on mani issu , and secondli becaus broad knowledg may not be enough for the solut of a problem and it doe not promot develop . i think have a broad knowledg of variou differ academ subject would be a veri time consum attempt . for exampl in my studi of expertis which is psycholog , noon can be expect even to know the subfield of the area . there are veriou area under the larg area of psycholog like cognit psycholog , development psycholog and social psycholog . it is imposs for a person to learn all from these issu sinc there are manay issu that need cover even in a broad way . and if we think wider of academ subject like physic , chemistri and not the subfield of a specif subject it even becom more impract to possess a gener knowledg about them . anoth problem with have a broad knowledg is regard to it suffici . most of the time we can not expect broad knowledg to help in specif case . if we take the area of health and medicin we can see alot of special . when we have a health problem we are usual redirect to a specialist by the gener doctor becaus the amount of knowledg of the gener doctor is not enough to help us . we need peopl who are special in their area to help us sinc they are the onli one with the adequt amount of inform . have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is also problemat for the develop of scienc . we need more special on a subject becau we need accumul of knowledg for a develop . accumul of knowledg can be maintain onli by special on a subject howev with a broad knowledg you can not expect to come up with someth new and to contribut to the knowledg pool . special on a subject is better than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it is more possibl to achiev that knowledg in a life time , it is more effeci and suffici for the solv of a problem and it promot the develop of the area by give a chanc of discoveri and to the accumul of knowledg .
