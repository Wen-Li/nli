look at thi statement everi student would be happi ! he doesn-t have to studi anymor but he just have to understand the idea and the concept but he will not be ask on how much he learn . what i think concern thi statement is that the student should for sure understand the idea and the main concept and their teacher should give them all the time they need to deepli fix the topic in their mind . so if for some of them is take longer they should not be afraid that somebodi will get angri at them , but on the other hand if for somebodi the subject is realli easi and they get frendli with it immedi is a wast of time to get on it sever time , take the risk that they will start hate it . but what i also beliv is that expeci now a day is import to have a good knowledg about everyth , otherwis is realli difficult to compar ourself with other peopl and to go on in common life , more and more we are ask for fact . the knowledg we need we can onli achiv it with learn fact by stude them and repeat them . let me also say that there is noth that make you more proud of your self as the possibl to show that you could learn fact and that you are abl to repeat them to other peopl correctli . know thing is someth that make you feel better with your self and with the other peopl , it make you feel complet . in conclus what i think is that it would probabl be nice not to have the task of learn fact , becaus sometim stude can be veri bore , and would be much better just discuss and tri to understand the concept all togeth , but i dont beliv it is possibl , becaus you can now have the feel that is not import to learn fact but at the end you will notic that without ani background you will easili feel lost in the futur .
