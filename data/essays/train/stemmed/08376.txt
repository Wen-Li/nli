in gener i agre with the statement . i onli agre in gener becaus i think one ha to take lot of thing into consider . it is is true that especi nowaday young peopl do not help commun a lot . '' help the commun '' is a veri broad term , when i read thi i understand contribut or becom activ involv in a commun . especi in these day it seem to me that peopl in gener , young peopl includ , expect more from a societi and commun than what they are will to give . there are certainli variou project and possibl to becom involv . howev , especi in the last year the develop of media , video game and good of consumpt in gener desensit a lot of peopl , especi the young gener . thi lead to unawaren of problem that might exist , or even when recogn to an unwillingn to act . also i think one ha to consid the social background and sorround of young peopl . if a young person grow up in a societi where nobodi care about contribut to societi and their commun , how is he or she suppos to learn that it is necessari to be involv in the commun ? on the other hand , it is common sens to becom activ . it is a take and give , if the give aspect doe not work properli , the commun will not be abl to uphold the servic it offer . especi young peopl are not awar of thi process . therefor , i do agre with the statement . howev , instead of blame the young gener , someth ha to be done so that young peopl get encourag to be a part of a commun and get activ .
