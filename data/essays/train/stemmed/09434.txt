to answer the question , i have to defin what `` success '' mean first . to me a success person is someon who is in control of hi life and abl to live it the way he want it to be . he is not limit by variou barrier in hi job or social life and ha alreadi achiev a high posit in hi profess as well as he ha a larg and stabl circl of friend . one import barrier that stand in your way to fullfil your dream is fear . if someon doe n't dare to take a new job opportun or to meet new peopl at a parti , how could he possibl improv hi profession or social situat ? we live in a societi that is confront with chang constantli : may it be a new techinc innov like the mobil phone ten year ago or the latest fashion in cloth . the creation of new thing mean that there are new product to sell which lead to a growth in economi . and thi is good of everybodi . someon who adopt all the new thing show that he want to be part of market-societi and will be success in it . peopl who do n't will be recogn ( as they were unfashion cloth and are not abl to send sm ) and exclud . especi the technic develop open a wide rang of new possibl ; for exampl in transport and commun . peopl who are the first to tri these innov can take advantag of the improv transport or commun the longest . they have a head start . on the other hand , take risk can be danger . all those peopl who bought new economi share in the begin of thi centuri will agre with me . if you start someth new there will alway be the chanc of fail . so i can also understand those who stay with what they know they 're good in . i guess , a trueli success person is abl to tell what is a risk worth take and where they should keep their hand of . all in all i am more or less agre with the statement . in the world of today it is better to go one step to far than to be left behind .
