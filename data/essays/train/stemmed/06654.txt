i total agre with the statiment . the compani that want to advertis their product is make everi effort to make it look better . they have to make it look better than the product of the other compani to sell more . otherwis , they will loos costom . i agre with thi effert to some point , but there shoud be a limit . they can make it look better , but they should not make it look differ , or say someth differ . for exampl , a frozen food compani can advertis their frozen veget dure the tv commerci by make look good with some special lightn , but they should not cheat on their vitamin that the veget contain . scientif aspect of the product must be true to the real data . like thi , there is a need for the test group . sometim it is a non profit organ , sometim it is govern , that do all the research if the compani is not cheat in what it say . after i move to germani from japan , i found an interest aspect of gemani . there are a lot tv program and magazin that make test and research to compar product . i have never seen such thing in japan , but i think it give you a lot of inform . it will be use in a case like when you do not know which hand cream to buy , becaus all the advertis make them all look good , the inform give you scientic data that help you to decid . a normal person , who ha no scientif background , can never compar the ingredi of hand cream , but the test program or magazin do the comparison for you . like that , you can decid on the product with a scientif base , and at the same time , you know how better the compani are make their product look good . sometim , the product with an advertis that did not succeed in make the product look good is better than the other with advertis that made them look much better than in realiti .
