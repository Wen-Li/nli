in the world some peopl say that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject instead other peopl are in contrast with these other peopl . the first categiri think that it is not import the knowledg about a specif subject but how mani subject you know becaus if you know onli one thing you can not speak with other peopl about a differ subject . at the contrari they say that they can speak with all the peopl in the world . at the contrari we can find a differint way . here the peopl can not speak about everyth with all the peopl but they know all about the specif subject . accord to me is better the second categori than the first bacaus in thi way you can speak a lot about an argoment . at the contrari the other categori can not do it . two axampl axplain my opinion . the first luca , e friend of mine , is on the first categori but last week there wa a good argoment about the histori in our countri . he did not know all about the leader of the countri but i and other peopl like me know all about them . the second exampl is paolo . he is on the second categori and when i speak with him about the comput he know all about it . i like so much to speak with them becaus he can do everyth about the comput or some thing like these . accord to my experi about these two way i think that the life style of paolo is better than the life style of luca . the peopl do not like a person that do not have a specif knowledg about an argoment .
