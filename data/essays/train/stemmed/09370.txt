it is often said that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . when you are young , you are less awar of the difficulti you can meet in a life . i think thi sentenc is in some way true . but i also believ that when you are older , you can enjoy life more than young peopl . first , when you are young , your life is ahead . we can say that anyth is still possibl . you are not consciou of all the realiti of the world and your mind is still full of dream . when you do n't have a famili to feed , life seem so much simpler . moreov , you are still healthi , health matter are not there to stop you . what can depriv you from go in club all night then ? if you do n't do thi now , when will you do it ? when you are young , you still have illus that you drive into do thing without much concern about the implic of your decis . howev , it seem import to me to notic that nowaday , the realiti of the world ha chang and young peopl are probabl more worri toward their futur than the past gener were . second , i guess that when peopl get older , they find other way to enjoy . i think it is difficult to compar the joy of go to a club everi night and the joy of take care of his/her young grandchildren . i believ when you are more experienc about life , you do n't see the thing from the same point of view and you can enjoy some littl thing in your life that you would n't have notic when you were younger . if enjoy life mean do crazi thing , then you have to be young to enjoy it . if you understand it as feel happi to live , then i think you could be as happi at ani time of your life .
