i do not agre with thi statement . thi is becaus that help their commun includ to spend their time to see their friend , i think . young peopl join a lot of event of their univers . we can not say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . actual , a lot of student spend their time to work rather than help their commun , but they have enough time to join their commun . young peopl can manag their schedul , so when they want to join them , they can go . there are a lot of club and circl they can join their commun . and also univers give student a lot of oppotun to particip in commun . dure high school and junior high school , student have a littl time to help their comun realli , but it is not student ' fault . that is becaus the govern desid to the system of school . if they had enough time , they would give time to help their commun . after univers , we are abl to have a lot of time to cope with our commun . in japan , we should help our commun . we have a lot of kind of help , for exampl , to help some shop of their home town , clean up road , river , and station . throught those kind of experi , japanes young peopl are abl to learn how they join their commun . and after that , they help their commun by themselv . final , i think that all young peopl give enough time to help their commun on their own way . from someon ' point of view , it doe not seem to be like that . but , we have enough oppotun to help our commun , we can not avoid them . and we think that we have to that . so , i believ that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun .
