some peopl think that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid , becaus they can get more imform from a tour guid and also they can make some friend through the tour . howev i do not agre with thi idea for these reason . first of all , i like to prepar the travel schedual by my self befor the trip such as i would like to go thi restaur , visit thi museam , buy thi shop , and so on . without a tour guid i can get a lot of imfom from internet befor i go to a trip . second of all , i can decid how mani time i should spend in the place . if i find the realli realli good place , i will decid to spend a lot of time to be there . on the other hand , if i go to a trip in a group led by a tour guid , becaus it ha alreadi dicid how mani time i spend where i go , so i shoud leav the place within the time . i can not stand !! i would like to enjoy my trip ! so i realli think peopl who want to spend great time in the trip , they should go a trip which they made schedual themselv . third of all , it is my challeng time to speak local peopl where i go to the first place . i like to comun with fore countri peopl . if i go to a countri which is spoken english such as the unit state , canada , the uk and so on , i can develop my english through the experi . on the other hand , if i go to a travel with a tour guid i think i will depend on him becaus he alway appear besid myself ! for these reason , i can not agre with the statement , the best way to travel is in a group
