i do agre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i have sever reason to support my argument but it is not easi to make an accur decis becaus enjoy life mean differ person by person . firstli , young peopl usual have more free time than older peopl do . becaus of the fact that older peopl have a job and have a famili to support , younger peopl tend to have more free time . for exampl , young peopl are usual refer as children , student and adult who is not marri yet . they have planti of time to do excit activ and enjoy their life with their friend . howev , older peopl need to go to work and feed the famili . they do not have time to do excit activ becaus their tire bodi need a rest dure holiday and weekend . secondli , young peopl have healthier bodi than older peopl . younger peopl are more elig to do variou activ than older peopl . such as sport that need a lot of physic abil like rock climb and weight lift . although if older peopl are experienc in those activ , they can do it but it is not that common . when young peopl can start ani kind of activ , old peopl need to measur their abil otherwis they might get injur . on the other hand , older peopl can also enjoy their life more than young peopl . if they are financi free after the retir , they will enjoy life more than young peopl do . such as cruse around the world , travel to the unknown countri and live in a beauti place . thi is someth that young peopl can not do becaus they need to work . howev , i believ that both young and old peopl can achiev joyfuol life .
