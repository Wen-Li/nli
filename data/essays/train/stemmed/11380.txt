thi is a veri difficult question , which i ca n't answer by say `` ye '' or `` no '' . there are argument for both opinion . on the one side , you have to think of the less devolop countri of today . they will clearli have econom progress and more wealth for the peopl within the next twenti year . for exampl , the qualiti of life in countri like china or india ha been improv within the last decad . and qualitiy of life mean have your own car , as it is common in europ or northern america . so , in the year 2026 , the world could be face with inhabitan of former `` third world '' countri who drive their own car . one the other side , the problem of carbon dioxid , such as global warm or more tornado , will leed to a differ way to consid the use of energi . the `` green hous effect '' is more and more acknowleg among scientist , and mayb someday also the govern will consequenti deal with thi problem . car are one of the main produc of coarbon dioxid . so , if you want to tri to stop global warm , one possibl could be to reduc the number of car . mayb the govern - instead of make it possibl for their citizen to have an own car - will improv the public traffic system like buse or train , or they will tri to develop new technolog which are n't depend on fossil energi , like solar energi nowerday . in germani , also the tax on fuel are veri high . the govern tri thi way to make the peopl becom awar of their use of fuel and mayb to reduc it . final , no one know what the technolog or econom develop of the world will be like within the next twenti year . but these develop will extrem influenc the number of car . i think , the second version is more probabl and therefor i agre with the statement abov . the idea of million of chines and indian drive their own car and produc much more carbon dioxid than today is n't veri conveni .
