knowledg is a complex process that requier both theoric and practic concept to be present , in order to take place . that is whi , i strongli disagre with the statement that indic it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . i have been teach `` introduct to civil law '' at my univers to first year law student and i can assur your that , from my person experi , student can onli understand properli concept and idea , if they have an exampl from real life , from everyday life to support it . sever reason explain thi situat . first , student are familiar with fact , becaus they are involv in all kind of situat where fact are present . also , concept and idea are necessari in order to understand the fact , but if you do not have a fact that can ilustr a real situat , then your student will probabl forget the concept or the idea , becaus they are not go to find it ani practic use . as a matter of fact , i have seen that the leason i give to student that includ a fact as an exampl of a concept or idea , are the leason that student not onli like the most , but show more interest in . i am not say that concept and idea are not import . of cours you need to teach student concept and idea , due to the fact that an import part of knowledg is base on them . but , if you do not add fact as a great resourc in order to explain a concept or idea , then your student are not go to be abl to relat both theoric and practic knowledg . bear all thi in mind , i have to say that i believ you can not choos between teach concept or idea , or fact to your student , if you want them not onli to understand what your are teach them , but find it a practic use in their life . you have to combin concept and idea with fact in your teach method and that is the hardest part of all , but that is a differ subject .
