i realli agre with thi statement . i am sure that one day there will have fewer car than today or that these car will be differ than today . car produc so much pollut and caus dammag to our environ . the problem is that everyon use hi own car to go work , go to school , or other activ . it could be so much better if peopl use one car for four person . at firt the pollut will be reduc and also that is cheaper to share the cost of transport between four person . an other way to reduc the number of car is to not use it too often and use it onli for long travel , if it is possibl use a littl moto or bycicl for short travel . take the bu or the train can be an other good altern to the car , but in thi case the govrnment must give more money to these public transport for allow them to reduc the price of a ticket . futhermor , have more tax on the oil , tax of circul , and give a reduct to worker who use public transport can influenc behaviour . there will be fewer car , but i think also that they will be differ than today . we must look for other oil , more respectful of natur . as an exempl we can not the sun ( but the problem is that in everi countri the sun is not shine all the day and more , not everi day ) , the wind but it is the same problem , it 's depend too much of the climat condit . today there are some hybrid car , that 's show the a begin of a changement but not the end . if we want to save our world , everyon must do someth , it is a sociti problem . more car , will reduc the problem of pollut and heathl .
