i feel that in gener , today 's youth do not show much concern for the commun . howev there are a few except , and by gain inspir from such peopl we can chang the current situat . let me illustr thi with an exampl . in my institut there is a social servic group call nso . all student are suppos to work for a minimum of hundr hour for thi organ over a period of two year . the nso carri out activati like educ poor children , tree plantat , cleanli campaign , etc . howev , as a secretari of thi organis , it is extrem dishearten to see the apathi of the student toward such activ . whenev we plan someth , onli a few volunt come up . ultim they run short of complet their hunr hour and ask me to help them in an inappropri manner . what are the reason for such lack of concern . one could be , lack of time . there is a lot of competiton amongst student . as they strive to achiev the result they aim for they forget what they owe to societi . often student are motiv to do commun servic just to make a statement on their resum . howev , i would be wrong if i said that thi appli to all youngster . i have a friend who is just the opposit . he is veri passion about commun servic and doe it becaus he feel for it . recent the colleg cultur festiv wa organ . it is time for enjoy and fun for most student . i wa amaz to see my friend run a stall dure the festiv to rais money for an ngo while the rest of us were have fun attend rock concert . to conclud , i feel that although most student feel the need and the urg for work for our commun , it is onli a few who turn that inspir in to action .
