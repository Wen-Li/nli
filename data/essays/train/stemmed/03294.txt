i disagre with thi statement becaus i think to have a special qualif is better than a broad knowledg . on the one hand ist good to have a broad knowleg of mani academ subject becaus you might find a job easier . and with broad knowledg you may stay between two typ of an industri branch . but on the other hand threre are three argument to spesifi in a subject . at first there is the point that when you have onli one subject you are better in thi like anonth person who know onli a bit of thi part and so from the view of a compani you are more interest to them like the other . the second argument is that when you might loos your job you will easier find a job in thi subject like the person who know onli half of the subject . fir instanc when you go to a compani to appli for a job and you have a higher knowledg if the boss of the person manag ask you some question about the subject you will have a better chanc to get the job . last but not least when you are rearli good in your subject you will have the opportun to get a lead posit in a compani an give instruct to those who onli have a bit of thi knowleg than you . and as a result of thi you might earn more money becaus you are a specialist in your job . as a conclus of these statement i will take the way of special in a specif subject becaus i want to have these three typ which i wrote abov and not onli bee a normal employe with a boss . i want to be the boss .
