enjoy ha noth to do with the age but ha lot more to do with heart , abil and more importantli with the condit that a person is in . and for that reason i think that even the older peopl get to enjoy their life mayb in differ way but they do enjoy their life . young peopl get to enjoy on the danc floor or in the colleg cafetaria . similari the older gener get to enjoy and spend their time in their own thoug and entertan way . one and easili see lot of older peopl in the park , enjoy walk , chit-chat or enjoy variou other activit their such as garden , laugh club etc cetera . the park next to our societi is one such live exampl . one can easili find lot of older peopl lotter either alon or in compani of their friend or grandchildren . again older peopl are free from most of the tension and duti such as money matter , famili matter and thu lead more carefre life with ampl amount of free time to spent as they pleas and in fullfil their wish and invent new hobbi . for exampl their is an old coupl stay next to my hous who have take clay model as their new hobbi . lot of other prefer either read , write , travel or enjoy spend time in variou social activit , at religi place or play around with their grandchildren . some peopl argu that older gener are weak and lack enough energi to enjoy life . ye old age do come with it own proplem such as health problem and low eneri level but thi is old time stori . one can easili find out the number of older peopl enjoy and live their life to fullest . for exampl the prime minist of india , the presid of unit state of america along with lot of other nation and intern exampl are openli challang thi view . for the abov state reason i feel that even older peopl get to enjoy their life mayb in their own way and not as the yong gener but their do enjoy their life ,
