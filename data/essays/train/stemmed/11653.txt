we all have been in traffic jam and mostli it is due to the fact that the number of car increas a lot recent , rather than that it is becaus of road . due to the imporev in manufactur technolog , it ha becom possibl to produc cheap car in shorter time . in return , the number of car increas . toyota now can produc a car in 2 minut with a cost of 2000 dollar , less or more , of cours depend on the type of the car . thi indic that as technolog develop more and more , peopl will buy more and more car . so in the follow 20 year , in my opinion , there will be more car instead of the possibl that there will be fewer car been driven than we drive today . one reason for the possibl increas in number of car within close futur is , as aforement , the technolog improv enabl manufactur to produc cheaper car in shorter time . cheaper car mean that almost everybodi can have it . attract by extra promot and suitabl purchas conditiono , even a famili can have more than one car . and thi attract that the manufactur present for their custom will be even more attract as technolog contuni to improv , as a result ; more automobil will be on the road . other than that car are get cheaper , the peopl are get richer as well . the economi of countri grow with the impact of global , especi in develop and develop countri , which in turn bring money to peopl , and i can say that the global is just start . so what can be done with the money ? of cours if you have a hous , you will buy a car ; if you have a car whi should not your wife or son have a car next . it can be seen that have automobil is not accept as luxuri properti in some countri , especi in devellop one . and consid the popul of develod countri and they are go to be develop , there will be a signific inclin in the number of car . also there can be disadvantag of drive a car in the next come 20 year . the time consum in traffic jam , and environment problem relat to pollut can disatract peopl , or even law can be decid by gover that are limit automobil usag or number of car in a famili . but all these will not stop the increas in the number of car , at least 20 year . to conclud , it can be said that car are get cheaper and peopl are gettin richer in the follaw 20 year due to technologicalso the world is go to be wealthier and car , of cours , are the best candit to show the wealth a person have . therefor , i believ that number of car will increas .
