i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are two reason to support my disagr . first , the travel in a group is limit for time . there are mani peopl in group travel and it mean it 's difficult to control . thu group travel need to be schedul exactli to control easier . if i find the nice place , where i want to stay and enjoy more time , i can not afford to stay there . second , there is no dicis to where we go . tour guid also dicid the place to visit . most of the visit place are onli famou sightse place . of cours it 's imprtant , i think . howev if you want to learn and touch with local cultur through travel , you should visit not famou place such as coutrysid . when you go to contrysid you may meet local peopl more and it provid the opprtun to becom friend . i think it 's realli good souverior than ordin one thar becous of these reason , i disagre the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
