i complet agre with the statement . success peopl tri new thing and take risk becaus they want to invent new thing . for exampl indian presid `` abdul kalam '' he is a great scientist , he invent nuclear weapon but still he doe not give up hi research in hi 80 's . success doe not total base on economi . for exampl `` mother thersa '' who came from other countri to india to serv the peopl . she took risk all over her life to serv the peopl . now she is call as `` mother '' by the whole world . i dont think that ani one call her unsuccess . success peopl tri to get success in almost all of the busi . they are not satisfi by do onli one busi . for exampl ambani who came from a poor farmer famili , he did a small garment busi . he wa success in that busi , but he wa not satisfi with that . he took risk in hi life and did coupl of busi . now he becam famou world wide as we well known him as `` relianc . '' if he would not take risk he would becom famou in india not in world wide . therefor i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
