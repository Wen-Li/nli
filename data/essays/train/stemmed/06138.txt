it is obviou that peopl have more energi and desir in the earlier time of their live , howev thi doe not indic that young peopl would enjoy life more than older peopl do . i think that it is possibl to enjoy life at all age , provid that we keep our spirit and mind contemporari and young . most peopl say that there are certain thing that can onli be done when we are young . for instanc , extrem sport , parti late hour , eat excess or even fall in love . i agre the fact that there are certain activ that we can not perform after a certain age , nevertheless i believ that it is not onli a matter of activ that keep us young but it is the state of mind we are in . basic , i think that there are differ joy peopl get from life when they are young and old . when we are young , we search for the unconvent , unfundament and extraordinari and we can go for it no matter what . as we get older , we begin to think of the result , effect and evalu situat more care . these are the differ level of joy that we can get when we are young and old . youth bring along lot of energi , excit and desir to reach the unknown and accomplish the undon . thi ha a certain joy factor , but onli as long as we are young . tri to act such cluelessli in older time may lead us to alien from life and societi becaus we have more respons as we grow older . even though our respons increas and we may be limit by the societi as we get older , i do not think that we would be enjoy life less . if we could accept get old and adopt ourselv to the chang environ , we can alway enjoy life becaus there is an endless energi in life , we onli need to captur it and connect with it . no matter how larg the number get on our age , we alway have the opportun to enjoy life if we have the energi and the mental to do so . be dynam and have a love and care famili and friend that connect us to life would alway enabl us to enjoy life at all age .
