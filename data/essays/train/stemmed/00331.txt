thi is a veri diplomat statment to say that the usag of the car would be decresec in the futur . as the gener chang took place , the comfort and the benifit also ha been incres in the mordern societi , so i would strongli condemn that the say of number of car would be decres in the cours of next twenti year . there might be mani advers environment conseques due to vechuliar emisson of harm gase and find short of the resoures of the petrolium product , but all these would not stop the usag of car in the mere furtur . sinc , as the technolog improv sour also will improv , and the next gener car would be batteri oper or bio car . thi would be best substitut of the car which are run today . the other main purpos for which , the number of car would be incres that , the popul on the earth is incres day by day , it would be veri much difficult for the mass transpor to transport as mani as peopl who are there , therefor mani peopl would be have an eye toward the car which would lean them toward it . in thi fast grow societi , car do play a major signific role , as they do be veri help for quicker transpotaion , becaus time onc lost can not be regain , and for the world twenti year from now , time would play a veri promin role . their are mani experi go on now to make the veri best batteri oper and bio ga car , which would would becom a major resourc for grow up the usag of car in the futur . by use thi type of car their mani advantag like as we disscus the faster mode of transport , which not onli improv one onli statu but improv the whole econom develop of the countri . becaus to compet with the develop of the countri the citizen should be use their time to the fullest . and the other one is pollut free environ , which is veri much import now due to gobal warm come as a major consequ in the natur . in addit it realli veri hard to ani citizen to wait for govern mass transopt , who is in an emerg , or plan to go for picnic with hi famili member or so and would be perfer to have hi own car than reli on ani other . the onli thought which bring us to the conclus that in the next twenti year the number of car would be decres is the problem of pollut , traffic conjuct , or scraciti of petrolium product , but their are mani altern which have been taken as substitur to these problem . and usag of the mordern improvis in thi aspect would captur the imagin of the nation for the altern use . and these have been prove through analysi of the last 2-3 year in most of the the part on the world . so , i would final would say that the number of car usag would not decreas in the futur but , the way in which usag would be chang , which would be veri freindli scenario .
