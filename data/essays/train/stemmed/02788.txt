in thi world , it is better to have a lot of knowledg especi in acedm subject for exampl take more than one subject or concentart on more than one subject in school for your next year in the univers . i agre in take more than one academ subject for mani reason . one of the reason is that when you take more than one academ subject you will have more knowledg and more idea and these ofcours would let you be accept by mani compani and so you will have a better futur for you , when you marri and when you get kid , if take one subject you will have less idea and less knowledg and so less experinec and so you will be less accept by compani and so will not have that good futur . second reason is that when you take more than one subject you can enter mani cours in the univers and ofcours you will be abl to studi what you want so have more and more knowledg and inform . when take one subject you would not be abl to studi a wide rang of subject and so you waould face aproblem is that you would face aproblem when applli to wok and so you would affect your futur . third reason of whi have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special on one subject is that most subject and materi are relat to each other and so when you concentr on one subject onli leav alot of subject that you did not take say in school for exampl you would face a big problem in univers or in colleg is that you will see that most subject relay on each other even if it wa a small percent and so would face problem in what are you studi and so you would have a big probabilti to fail in what you are studi which make your futur and life affect especi if you fail , but if you took alot of subject thi will help you in your univers and so you will not fail and your futur can be save , and even if u you fail , you still have alot of knowledg and so you can do your own small bussi which would save your life and futur . there are mani reason but they need alot of explin , both have their advantag and disagvantag but for me i agre on studi more than one academ subject and so thi would make me feel safe and comfort .
