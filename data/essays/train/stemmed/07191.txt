i think that it is more import for student to learn fact than it is for them to undestand idea and concept . my choic is base on two reason . the first reason is that , if you learn fact , you have a direct contact with the realiti . for exampl , in the univers , you can learn more skill if you follow a laboratori than you follow a lesson of theori . thi is a good way not onli for a student , but also for a worker . in fact , if a worker ha work all of the day , he or she learn more thing than he or she follow a lesson of theori . i know my uncl 's experi that can be taken as an exampl . in fact , he ha follow a cours to work in a chemistri industri , but he ha learn the real way of work onli when he ha start to work in the chemistri industri . the second reason is that learn fact help a student to understand in a better way the contest in which he or she is studi . for exampl , i rememb that , when i follow the cours in the `` way of transport '' , the professor help me to build a naval motor not spoken me of how a naval motor is compos but he did to see me the naval motor and we built toghet . to conclud , i do n't agre with the sentenc becaus it is not true that is more import for student to understand idea and concept than for them to learn fact .
