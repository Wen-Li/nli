i would like to agre with the statement that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ' . the reason for my agreement with the topic is there are plenti of advantag when there is a guid when we travel in a group . the major problem which we face when we are move in a group is that defenit the group includ peopl of differ behaviour , the time punctual and there will be no coher between the peopl , if we are led by a guid defenit everyon in the group listen to him and follow him as he is lead them . anoth advantag is that the guid will be familiar with the place we visit and so we need not wast our time on find the way to that place and we do n't miss the place which are of greater import . some peopl may think that hire a guid will increas the cost of their trip , i think it is not true infact we will save alot of money we can ask the guid to take to the motel which we can afford and there would n't be a chanc to e defraud sinc pepl tri to cheat the tourist who are not nativ to that place likewis we can even save our valuabl money and can use for anoth purpos . . guid also show the import place of that area as we may not be familiar with them . for instanc , when we plan a trip to canada on last summer we are familiar with the place over there we got onli one week to visit all the place and we got plan to victoria and vancouv , as we know thay are locat nearbi but some of my friend doe n't like to lead our group by a guid they think that they will loos privaci but they did n't realiz that we are lack of time and they decid to go seper and we do n't want wast our time as the semest begin after the weekend , decid to hire a guid and we success complet our trip within time visit all the tourist place over there , unfortun our friend who went to the trip without a guid fail to return back intim , afterward they appreci our opinion . henc i would rather suggest a group to be led by a guid on vist an unfamiliar place , which would save money , time and provid us with the facil to enjoy the trip with more ecstaci .
