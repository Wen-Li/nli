someon say it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ sudject than to special in one specif suject . i ca n't agre on thi statement . becaus obtain special knowledg is more inport than obtain broad knowledg of variuo subject . my statement mainli base on the follow reason : first , with the bloom of the inform develop , it is mostli imposs the obtain all the knowledg of one specif subject , not to metion obtain all the knowledg of a broad rang of subject . what wa the use of a person who spend all hi life in learn all the knowledg in the world , but do noth to use what he learn to contribut to the societi ? second , to obtain that mani knowlegd is a veri time consum process . sometim it could be a wast of time . and to choos a wide rang of subject mean to secrifi the depth of the thing you learn . thi may lead to a person difficult to live in a world that most , if not all , of the work are specificli cassifi . and the most import reason is that , what a person will focu in hi or her life , is usual one or tow field , it is realli not nessesari to studi too mani subject , learn too much may not do ani good to our futur . whi do n't we use the time we spend on the knowledg that may never be use in our life to someth more relat to ourself ? who will need to know how to cure aid when your job is the program softwar to a supermaket ? in sum , i think that knowlegd are import to all of us , and it is a good thing to know more of the . but the more import thing is how to use our limit time to learn the specif knowledg that will more like be use in our life , but not wast our life of what may come useless to us .
