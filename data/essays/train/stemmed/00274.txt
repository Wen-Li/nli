i agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . follow are my reason and exampl . social competit is seriou today , in order to surviv in societi , most young peopl have to spend most of their time on school . after class , they have to studi for exam and work on term paper . therefor , i do n't think they get time left to help ; sometim it is not enough for sleep . anoth reason is that young peopl may think it make them sound old if they help the commun . as we know , most of the work in commun is done by old peopl who have been retir . in order not to be regard as one act oldli , young folk avoid to do so . take myself for exampl , i am 21 and admit i do not give enough hour , but i am not like peopl i illustr in the third paragraph . often i go to the commun librari to help out the librarian . due to the lack of hour , i can onli go there onc a month , for i have to prepar for my school work . sometim peopl are just be too busi to help rather than unwil . in addit to what i mention abov , there is still a limit for young peopl to help their commun , that is , there is no pay . it is a of wast of time to do thing without wage . tuition fee is extrem high today , young peopl have to earn more money to pay . therefor , peopl would rather work a part-tim job than commun work .
