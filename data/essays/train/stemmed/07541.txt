travel in a group with a tour guid is gain poular nowaday and some peopl do consid it the best way to travel . howev , it is not for me . i am a person who believ in self-discoveri and i like discov place on my own and at my own pace . for me , travel is a discoveri and make friend with local peopl , get to know them and live their cultur is the true experi of travel . i believ in take out time to underst the cultur nuanc of the new place and attempt to comprehend the true cultur of everi new citi that i visit . i have heard quit a few stori from peopl who had a fantast time in group travel with tour guid . i myself have sent my parent to such trip when they come to visit me as they are old and have a tour guid is the easiest way for them to have a comfort , safe trip in a foreign land . but , for me , with age on my side right now i do n't feel the need for a guid . i believ that when you travel to someplac new you should be in that mood - will to explor , tri new thing and meet new peopl . travel on your own give you the opportun to convers with the local peopl and the `` authent '' stori that you hear from them are incompar to the pre-plan , oft-rep stale inform from a guid . so far my experi with a group led by a tour guid ha been fairli limit . it wa onli on one occas that i opt for such an arrang and that wa on my trip to kerala in india . the group wa well organ , our itinerari fix and lot of place plan for in the short trip . i do n't think i got the real flavor of the state as the pace wa too fast for me to understand the divers and the tradit valu the countri is so famou for . there are benefit of a group-travel . but , person i am all for travel on my own . i like to set the pace of my trip , relax on some day and explor a lot on some other day and most importantli , get the true flavor of the countri and not just visit the so-cal `` point '' of tourist-attract that group travel arrang usual entail .
