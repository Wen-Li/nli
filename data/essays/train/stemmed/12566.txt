i have to admit that concept and idea are often neglect next to all the fact that student have to learn . histori lesson are a good exampl . if you know all the date , name and place that doe not mean that you have understood the complex interact of caus , consequ and motiv . sometim it is not even necessari to know exactli on which day or where someth happend . import is that it happen . what led to it and it impact on the futur may be of much greater interest than it exact date . is it not much more import what einstein discov than know on what day he wa born ? is it not more import to know that hi invent led to the nuclear bomb than to know the place where he wa born ? of cours , without fact noth work . you could not teach histori without date , name and place . you could not explain ani concept or idea without the fact that it base on . fact are the foundat to ani think beyond . you can onli understand whi einstein gave hi idea to the american if you know the fact that he wa a jew . that is whi i think that there should be a balanc between fact and more . student should get those fact that are necessari to understand the concept . in my eye they are both equal import . one without the other is noth . if you know all the element of a comput you still can not put them togeth correctli . if you possess the instruct but do not have all the element it doe not work either . and even if you have both it is not easi . but if someon explain it to you you might succeed . thi is what teacher should do . they should give student the fact , some materi about how to understand them and explain the big connect . i do not think that idea and concept are more import than fact , each is import in it own way . idea and concept are base on fact . student should learn both to be prepar for life .
