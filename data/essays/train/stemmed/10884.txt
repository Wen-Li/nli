it is complex to clasifi young peopl . some are realli conciou and help while other are just selfish member of societi , consum the money of their parent and wast time . commun servic is now a veri well recognis activ , special by univers . that 's whi so mani student get involv in help other , to get point for their cv . from my point of view peopl who do that are realli mean and unfair . it is realli beati to say that everyon love help the poor and the disabl , but actual not everyon like to spend their free time in treat thi type of peopl . i do like go some weekend to the nearest home to help mental insan peopl . my school organ thi actit , and i 've seen so mani peopl who onli went there to get point for the commun servic program . it is realli deceiv to see thi young peopl , sometim your friend , stand there doinmg noth and basic not help , but disturb your work . but apart from help in home and special center , communitiy servic also involv keep clean your street , the park you visit in your free time and help in your particular home . with thi i mean not throw garbag everywher ( just becaus you think someon is go to pick it for you ) , help your mum to make dinner or wash the dish after it , and so mani other simpl activ . young peopl do n't seem to be veri interest in thi activ either . they think their onli oblig are to get home , do their homework and studi ( even though mani student do n't even follow thi direct ) . in conclus , gener young peopl , special teenag , do not give enough time to help their commun . go further , the one who actual give , are expect somekind of benefit . onli a few youngster follow the pattern of `` good member of societi '' , and sadli those one are consid the freak , instead of be encourag . sure better educ could chang thi common selfish attitud ; even though you can not make a silk purs out of a sour ear , and some peopl wont chang in all their life .
