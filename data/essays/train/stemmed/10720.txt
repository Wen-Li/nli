i agre with that idea but not at all becaus i have a person opinion about what is go to happen with car in the futur . it is obviou that petrol is go to disappear in the next twenti year so the human race ha to find other sourc of energi that can supli thi petrol . the big car compani are develop other way to make a car without petrol but that is not veri seriou becaus they are go to continu make petrol car until the moment it will disappear . so in my opinion we are go to have car for the next twenti year but the number of them will go down becaus nowaday peopl is care about the enviro and everi day we prefer to go by bike or use the public transport befor use the car . that 's whi i agre with the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . but i am not sure that thi is go to happen becaus young peopl like my case , we were wait for have a car sinc we were child . i care about the enviro but i want to have a car when i get the licenc . thi is onli one of the reason whi i am not sure that in twenti yera there will be fewer car . on one hand peopl everi year is get more concern about the enviro , ecolog , natur etc but on the other hand everybodi want to have a car . we live on a crazi world and anybodi is sure about what is go to happen from here to the next twenti year becaus everyon is look for it 's own interet . on conclus , if everbodi work togeth we can make that possibl .
