the statement that the young peopl do not give much time for help their commun is a genaralis statement which ha to be debat upon . i feel that the young person 's tendenc to help mainli depend on the kind of atmospher he dwell in and the basic nurtur that ha been provid to him in hi younger year . a person who ha seen the difficulti of life in hi young age is prone to actual understand the situat of the helpless . that empathi is the drive forc for the youth to help peopl . we have seen mani person all over the globe . some of them be mother theresa , hellen keller and mahathma gandhi . if we look deepli , it wa their young day that facil and ignit their mind to sacrific their life for their commun . thi point rightli speak for the youth . we saw a lot of protest and activ particip from the youth right from the twin tower tragedi to the katrina . young peopl hae alway been there for their commun in the point of distress . the other side of today 's youth pictur student roam around with gun and the rapid addictionof today 's youth to drug and other habit . empathi can sure not be expect from these youth . where there is no empathi there is no place for servic . the young peopl today can not be catogaris on a gener scale in thi aspect . there are a lot of young peopl who take up their life 's aim as servic at the same time there are a lot of them who act in the opposit direct . furthur more , the increas terrorist attack and the increas hostil of the surroundind serv as a catalyst to the youth of today to stand up for their commun . so i think that a sensibl part of the youth is rightli give it part for the commun
