in be succes mani condit are import . i will take as exampl the condit of be a good professor and research at the univers . you have to be compet and self confid in your topic , so you can use the proper knowledg and the necessari skill you need in order to respond to a critic dure a public asses or evalu , or reach an object such us fulfil a research project or prepar lectur for the class . thi is often the reason whi professor special in someth : they choos a specif field , concentr on particular aspect , start to studi , work and reserach and they develop a deep compet in their special topic . so , the usual prectic and teach at the univers what they know better . but sometim , and thi could be the condit of a rel young reseach , you might open to new field that are relat to your main topic of research but less known and explor . thi evenu could lead in gain a complet new and innov perspect on the same topic , and make him realli succ in the academ faculti . so it 's alway import to take in account risk and explor in of thingh we do n't alreadi know becaus thi can provid a great opportun for new find , for instanc in scientif research , where new invent and innov have often been the result of a combin of consciou thougth , accid and of an explor full of risk . in take risk anyway , it shoud be done with respons and prudenc : you have to be clear the object , even if you do n't know the way to reach it , or in other word : even if the more conveni way is the direct one , sinc no suffici and relev find have been deriv from a previou research which follow thi direct , you might chang it with a more unusu one , at least sustabl but mayb more effect . in the scientfic method scientist often use thi strategi call transitori pattern , which mean explor the similar and then tri to transfer and verifi the new knowledg in you field . so thing for me work like that : to be succesful you have to start with someth you know veri well , but onli if you take some measur risk , you can make the differ which bing realli you a step forward among the other .
