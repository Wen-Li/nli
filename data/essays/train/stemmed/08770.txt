do the elderli enjoy life as the young do ? from a psycholog standpoint , it can ben claim that the way peopl perceiv the world chang as they get older . in other word , they get more realist as year pass . thu , i am inclin to believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . to start with , younger peopl expect more from life , and , to a great extent , peopl believ in the possibl of realiz their dream in younger age . as a resut , thi inner drive make peopl to enjoy the life in all mean , sinc they feel that they still have time to do what they want to do . howev , as they get older , they start to think that they will never be abl to be the person that they have dreamt of . secondli , younger peopl have the energi that is need to enjoy the life . that is to say , they do not have to worri about their health situat while think about an activ . for exampl , it is almost imposs for older peopl to attend activ that need more energi and attent such as surf , raft , and ski . on the other hand , some peopl claim that older pepl enjoy life more than young peopl do , sinc they have more time than the young . in other word , they do not have to worri about anyth els apart from make themselv feel better , and enjoy the life . howev , thi argument can be consid as right onli for a small percentag of the elderli , sinc they are not even abl to find someon to accompani them for most of the time . take these point into consider , obvious , young peopl have more opportun , and chanc to enjoy life when compar to the old . howev , i strongli believ that thi situat can be improv in the futur for the advantag of the elderli .
