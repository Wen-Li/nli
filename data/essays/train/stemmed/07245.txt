ye i agre with thi statement . i think that young peopl have so much time to spend how they want . tipic young peopl do not work and they can do more thing than older peopl . they can dedic time to their hobbi , meet some friend , go for a walk , play a game or go to the the cinema . young peopl have no specif time that can constrain their action . unlik , older peopl have it . a yuong guy can go out in the even with hi friend , go into a pub , come back late in the night and if he doesn ` t want , the next day he can stay at home instead to go to work as older peopl do . older peopl , anyway , can have some advandag . the most import is that they have a lot of money that younger peopl don ` t have . with that money they can buy what they want , as : car , comput , vacat and travel in gener , hous and etc . .. all thing that can improv their live . older peopl have a lot of respons that young peopl don ' t have . they have mayb a marrig to maitain some children to grow up . young peopl in contrast have more indipend but is true that at least they have to respect the order of the their parent . in conclus i confirm my opinion ( that is the same of the task question ) : young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
