nowaday , it appear that young peopl do not give enough time help their commun . i agre with thi statement . as a teenag , i have wit these fact . for instanc , young peopl are more preoccupi by leisur time than anyth els . when they come back from school , their main wish is to let off steam , to rest or eventu have fun . parent do not necessarili forc them to help their commun , so it just doe not come to their attent that their help might be need . instead , they had rather watch televis , go shop or gather in group of friend to just hang around . young peopl do not realiz that even the smallest action can be of great help . for exampl , help nurs to make inventori , care for old person stay in hospit or even babysit can be of genuin help . i believ that they are not consciou of their inner selfish . the problem is , their parent probabl never point it to them . so who is the one to blaim ? true , most teenag would conscious refus to give up their plan to go help peopl in a hospit , but on the other hand if their parent forc them to do so onc or twice , they might becom awar of the need for their help . sometim forc somebodi to do someth he doe not like can have posit outcom . person speak , thi is how i realiz i wa becom a selfish person . one day my parent told me to do someth use instead of sit on a sofa and watch televis . sinc i am a rather good student , i figur i would spend most of my leisur time help other who had difficulti . i have been do thi for about two month now , and i truli do not regret it . in addit to put an end to my selfish , it also taught me how to be patient and care with peopl . most of my `` student '' have now becom friend . so , to sum up , be forc to do someth for your own good is use , and i strongli advis peopl to do so .
