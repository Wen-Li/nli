if young peopl enjoy life more than the old peopl do ? there may be mani deffer answer accord to defferr peopl 's indent exprenc . in my opinion , i do n't think that young poepl enjoy their live more than old one , becaus of sever reason follow : first of all , young peopl have less time to enjoy their live comprar to the old peopl . peopl spend their earli life on stude , work and mani other thing that can promis a goog futur . old peopl in the other hand , almost retir from the bus that call hard-wok , so they have a plenti of time to enjoy the live . secondli , young poepl , sometim , dont't realli undterstand what is the best of live , so they alway spend their time on someth they do n't realli like . when they think they are enjoy the live , actual , they dont't realli feel happi . for exampl , mani young peopl believ that big citi can make their dream becam true . they go to there to look for good job . but alway they ca n't get the job they want , becaus there are so mani young poepl there and the compet is veri sharpli . but the old men who have a lot of live exprenc may be more clare whith what they want realli and spend their time to get it , to enjoy it . finnal , old peopl have less pressur than yuong peopl . their yuong children have grown up , their career ha complet , their life push ha slowdown , so they have a releas haert to enjoy the life . yuong poepl , on the contrast , have vari of pressur , such as childen , career and even the old parent . they have mani tast to do . they do n't releas heart to enjoy the life . in a short word , the old peopl may enjoy their live more than yuong peopl do . it is fair , becaus they have spend for their enjoy dure their erlier live .
