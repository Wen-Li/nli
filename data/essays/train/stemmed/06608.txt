i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . our world is chage veri fast . there are so mani amaz stuff in the world . and i think that young peopl have more chanc to use these stuff such as electorn stuff . and i would like to give some specif reason whi i think like that . first , older peopl usual do not know some new technolog product well . even they do not understand what these product is and how to use these new technolog stuff . the world is chang veri fast so if you do not know these new tech product , you can not enjoy your life more than young gener . for exampl , when i went to a mall , my mother said to me `` what is thi ? '' that wa mp3 player . nowaday , all most of the music are made by mp3 plie . so if you do not know mp3 player , you may lose your chanc to listen music which you want to listen . second , our world is make someth new constantli . everyday , new thing are gener becaus mani peopl want someth suppris . and , usual , young peopl reciev someth new stuff better than older peopl do . young peopl usual can understand how to use these new thing . for exampl , when i travel to japan with my parent , we went to a japanes restaur . at that time , i had to order everyth for my parent becaus i tri to everyth to order . i did not feel shi becaus i wa young . so i use english , my arm , and my face to order . whi i wa abl to do like thi becaus young peopl ha spirit of tri .
