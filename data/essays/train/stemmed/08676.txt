i agre with the statement that understand idea and concept are more import for student than learn fact . if a student invest hi time to understand the basal idea and concept on a matter rather than just learn the fact he can use these in similar subject . gener human tend to do just as much as neccesari to solv a problem they face . so mani student are just learn the fact to pass exam . but they often seem to forget the import of idea . as an exampl in my first year in mechan engin i learn in my materi scienc cours not onli the fact or calcul for the exam . i use veri much time to understand the consept of structur of materi . after i pass the exam that i could realli understand the basic of solid mechan and it help me veri much for my prepar time for thi cours . i have seen that my invest realli paid back . in other hand the concept or idea are more like to be remind in later year . the learn fact can replac by new one and you could not remind them even after some day . as we are student and learn the subject to use them we have to call them whenev we need . for exampl i have been a veri good student in high school and especi in physic . after i begin with the univers i have seen that i could not remind some formula in physic which i use to know . but with my understand for physic help me to deriv them for veri basic formula . henc when tri to learn a subject it better to use more time for understand then just learn fact .
