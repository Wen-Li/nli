human have been alway against riski situat , but those who have abandon their fear have , at least , succeed . so , i think that the spirit of fight against yourself is one of the most import qualiti you could have . first of all , if you do n't progress , you will be alway at the same level , you wo n't reach for higher posit . unless , you are happi with thi situat , thi wo n't be a problem , but in my case thi would be a disast , becaus i alway think the way of get better until the perfect and i think that is the feel that move the world . you onli have to rememb everi morn that if it ha n't been for cristob columbu , that decid to take a new rout to the west indian , probabl now we would be not learn english . second , if you get use to do some process or task that everybodi is abl to do , then you becam one of them . but in the moment that appear somebodi who could do it better than you , then you get replac . you are dismiss . for exampl , if you work in a compani that ha just stablish in china , and you are the first who learn chines , then the next that come behind you , wo n't be abl to pass through you . and at last live the same kind of lifestyl could be veri bore , in the sens that you sink into the routin and it becam veri difficult for you to go on sinc you do n't have incent . to sum it up , riskless way of live is not permit for me , becaus you have to be self confid of your possibl and tri to use them in the most effici way in order to prevent yourself of the attack of the other and then you will reach your own limit .
