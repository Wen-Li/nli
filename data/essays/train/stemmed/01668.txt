my grandfath wa alway said to me ; ? f you wanna swimm , then go to the occean rather than the pole . at that time i didnt understand what doe it mean . but after mani year , when i came in a big citi and saw mani succesful peopl , i understood that ; curois , hardwork , good plan , and risk take are common factor of succesful peopl . at first sight , do same thing seem mayb easi , compfort and safe . but after a while it ll be bore . and you fell yourself probabl lone and unus . on the otherhand ; if you are curio peopl , you ll declin to alway tri to find new thing . that make you happi and ensur you selfconfid which is veri import of success . but tri to find new thing and curiostiy are not enough for success . you should also make a good plan and hardwork on it . final risktak . i think ? ts the most import thing for suceess . everybodi can work hard and make a good plan . but too few peopl can take risk to implement in real life .
