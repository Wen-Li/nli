i do not agre with the statement that young peopl are not give enough time to help their commun . thi is a rel statement and like all rel statement , it is bug with contextu inconsist . when compar two time period from a perspect of societ contribut by young peopl , we need to understand that the challeng and expect var wide and thu the statement ca n't be empir justifi . moreov , the current societi is a result of the action of past and to blame it impli that the valu enshrin by the societi of the past were not that great , thu challeng the underli process on which the statement is made . just like organ , societi also evolv . as such it ha becom bigger , more vari , adapt and faster . the valu system it espous is radic differ from the past and thu are the action . to compar the action of young peopl in the current socitey from the valu lens of the past societi is do great injustic . the current young gener is expect to perform well in all sphere of life , be it a home , school , colleg , work , friend circl , societi . thi is put a lot of pressur consid that the time need to perform all thi activ ha not increas . such wa n't the case in previou sociti . despit that , the young peopl are veri motiv and conceren about the scoceti and it 's well be . thi is visibl if you look at most of the social orient organ are staf by young peopl , be it peta , greenpeac etc . there are a lot of demonstr around the world to stop the ravag of war that drive their forc from the youth of today . the younger gener is look at novel way of make a chang . the new breed of social entrepreneur are form non profit compani that are run in a profession way to contribut to the better of societi . thi can be ascertain by the fact that there ha been a mushroom of social orient busi cours all across . the work place are provid outlet for their younger employe to engag in social relev task , besid their normal task and they are lap it up . the younger gener , in my opinion is more awaken and sensit about the need of the societi . they are do all their veri best to fulfil the social duti in a more effici and effect way . the onli differ be that the area which concern them are differ from that of the previou societi , which reflect the challneg of the present and not the past .
