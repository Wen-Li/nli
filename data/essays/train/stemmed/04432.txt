peopl have differ opinion on whether young peopl do not give enough time to help their friend . peopl who oppos thi statement argu that help friend is most import role in friendship . howev , i support thi idea for two reason . let me explain reason in detail . first of all , nowaday youngster have lot of thing to do for their own . for thi reason they usual do not pay attent to their friend ' problem and just concentr their own work . let me take my experi as an exampl . when i wa in high school student , i had an car accid near my school . that day , our school had an import midterm examin . although it wa not seriou accid , i had to be care of by someon . howev , for prepar test anyon help me . my friend had to hit the book befor the exam . so they just call teacher for me and went back to their class . i disppoint from them . therefor , nowaday teenag usual deal with their own work . next , recent peopl can find easili to solv the problem not from their commun but also from other special institu . in the past , if teenag had a hard time to studi , they ask their best friend and solv togeth . for exampl , if student who are not good at math , they can share the inform how to studi math . thi is becaus they were same situat . howev , today we have a lot of academ institut and privat tutor agenc . therefor , young student have abund sourc which can help them to solv their problem effect . they can ask them how to studi , what they have to take , and how to solv the problem . thi show that young do n't have time to share theirtimt wiht friend . in conclus , i agre with the idea which is that recent young peopl do not have enough time to concern their friend . as i mention abov , they are suppos to focu on their own job . in addit , they can solv their problem by contact other sourc around them .
