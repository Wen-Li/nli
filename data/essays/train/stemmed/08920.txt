in my opinion , a choic between understand idea and concept , instead of learn fact , can not be made . both clearli appear to me to be import , for differ reason . understand of idea and concept is the final purpos of the studi , and it is what student will retain for all their live , even if they would have forgotten fact . knowledg about main polit idea , or major histor process , will alway help them to understand the world they are live in , even if they could have forgotten what happen in pari on juli 4 in 1989 . know all detail and date of french revolut is not help in itself . but on the other hand , without fact , idea and concept are onli empti box . one could not understand where they come from . e. g. in the case of french revolut , it would be difficult to recogn contemporari french patriot 's root in the countri 's modern histori . moreov , connect concept to realiti is veri help in memor . student can be best help in learn if a complet frame is provid them . the best way to teach could be to present student with fact , and then stimul them to draw their own conclus . anyway , it must also be notic that the weight of these two skill - understand idea and concept and learn fact - is differ accord to the matter or subject of studi . for exampl , in a physic cours , the most import thing is learn physic 's law . in thi case , understand concept would be more use for student than know how scientist formul a certain theori . on the contrari , without a strong knowledg of fact , mani theori of anthropolog could not be fulli understood . final , what is the prioriti , must be evalu differ case by case .
