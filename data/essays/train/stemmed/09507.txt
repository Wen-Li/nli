i am agre with that and i hope is go to be in thi way . it depend to us , what we want to do about our futur . we are live in thi world and we have just thi world , but the problem is that we are not live in a sostant economi , we can not go on in thi way and base our societi on the oil becaus the oil will finish . so i think it is time to have a world wide energet polit that think about the futur and not just about today . i know that it is not go to happen soon , becaus money are more import that the environ , but everybodi can see that the clima is chang . for exampl , anybodi know that you use the termometh to misur if you have the flu or not and you can do the same with the world : the result is bad becaus the temperatur is higher than the past , that mean that our world is sick . so , what i hope is that in the next year all the car that use oil will disappear and instead of thi tradit car we can move with hidrogen or electr car . it will be a world with less car and more train and share veichol . it wo n't be an easier or more econom world , but it will be cleaner for sure . it is time to chang and everybodi care about our futur , so for thi reason it is time that all the govern of the world start to think about that and not just to have a better futur , but to have a futur that permit human be to live in a safe world . i know that it is just a dream and noth is go to happen in the next twenti year , but i know for sure that i am not the onli one that think about that . i think we are grow and we are convic other peopl that we are still go in the wrong direct .
