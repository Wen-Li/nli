`` a specialist is a person who know more and more about less and less '' . i rememb come across thi statement when consid whether i should go for doctor studi and then drop my plan . i decid i want to be a generalist rather than a specialist . i believ that it is more import to have a broad knowledg of mani subject rather than special in just one subject . there are mani reason whi i think so . let me discuss them one by one . the purpos of educ is not just to learn about specif topic , but to learn the process of learn . let me take technolog as an exampl to illustr my point . technolog chang so swiftli that what we learn in colleg soon becom outdat . so , how doe know everyth about one particular technolog benefit a person ? instead , student should concentr on learn a breadth of technolog so that they can quickli adapt tp new technolog . broad knowledg of a number of subject also broaden the student ' perspect . they learn to appreci a larger varieti of thing . think about hypothet student who never studi american histori . would they be abl to enjoy the comic histor refer in the movi `` forrest gump '' ? think of how children would appreci and rememb the name of planet if they knew that these were deriv from roman mytholog . would it not be interest for student to know that jupit is the the king of roman god and that is probabl the reason the largest planet in the solar system is given the name ? these exampl might be trivial , but they indic that broad knowledg increas the abil of student by broaden their point of view . anoth reason to studi mani differ subject is that real-lif situat requir an inter-disciplinari approach . we need to know about a lot of thing to be abl to solv real life problem . for exampl , for peopl to figur out how inform technolog can help in busi , they need to have some understand of both inform technolog and busi . while it might be argu that a team approach to such problem need not requir peopl to know more than one subject , i disagre . an interdisciplinari team will onli be effect when each specialist is learn from other and in effect , becom more and more generalist . final , onc a foundat of a broad academ experi is laid , it is understand that some peopl may want to special . doctor often special in heart , brain or the bone . but each one alreadi ha a foundat of learn about the whole bodi and how it function . ever saw a doctor who know onli about heart attack and doe not know what bodi temperatur impli fever ? so , in conclus , a foundat of broad knowledg of a number of academ subject need to be laid for the reason of master the learn process , broaden world view and be abl to solv real world interdisciplinari problem . onc the foundat ha been lay , it is upto the individu to decid whether to go for more special in hi or her field of interest .
