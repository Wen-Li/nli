plan to see fewer car in use in twenti year is a good perspect but i can hardli imagin it . i can onli consid it as an illus . basic , peopl enjoy drive to go work , shop or to the beach . if you live in a citi , i would encourag you to observ and count as mani car as possibl for one minut . i guess you would be surpris . it appear to be quit clear that some peopl realli need a car . first , a car , it is use . it is use by the fact that you can get anywher , at ani time , the way you want . the onli thing that may slow you down is traffic jam . and when you live far from ani citi , ani shop , ani bu stop , a car is veri use . then , a car , it can reveal someth els . thi is part of the thing you can also notic ( when you are observ on the pavement ) , it is the number of peopl in the car . you can hardli see more than two ( except when it is a famili and when they are two children at the back ! ) . ye , becaus own a car ha alway been a sign of power . we live in a societi where peopl feel like buy and own new and often expens thnig in oder to be proud of them and expos them . peopl who make advertis know that and have use thi idea so mani time . and especi the clich about middle-ag men drive a fast and power car . it is said that you could describ peopl accord to the car they 've got and vice-versa . i guess in our current societi , it is a sign of power , of prosper and modern . and thi is not go to chang . .. and the last but not least import fact it the evolut , over the last year , of the mean of transport in ani citi all over the world . bangkok is a good exampl . the skytrain as well as the undergroung are sometim crowd but not so much . there are seat avail quit often . the onli thing you can notic and you have probabl been notic it for a long time now is that the road keep be flood by car ! it may be better and less than befor but befor see fewer car in use , we will probabl have to wait more than twenti year .
