i agre that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid even though some peopl might prefer travel on their own . first , peopl can make new friend in the tourist group . when one person travel alon or with hi or her famili member onli , it is quit possibl that he or she willl get bore . if peopl travel in a group , they can meet differ peopl and make new friend with the group member dure the trip . gener , tourist will remain in the group till the end of the trip , which provid adequ time for peopl to get to know each other and make new friend . second , to travel in a group would bring more fun . when peopl travel alon , they might feel it is a piti that nobodi share thi experinc with them . while in a group , peopl can share thi wonder experi with the group member . the last memori of travel would be enrich by the happi ad by the group member . third , it would be effici and organ when the tourist group is led by a guid . the guid would arrang the travel in the best way , which mean travel need not spend a lot of time to plan for the travel . travel do not need to find inform themselv and they do not need to worri about where to sleep at night , how to find the direct or how to take the transport . in addit , the tourist guid can provid adquat inform for the histori and uniqu of the scenic spot . the tourist onli need to listen to the guid and enjoy themselv . becaus peopl can make new friend , enjoy and share the travel experi with other and tourist agenc would offer the best arrang and high effici for travel , i support the idea that the best way to travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
