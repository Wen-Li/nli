i agre that to have broad knowleg of mani academ is better than to special in one specif subject . i have two reason whi i agre thi opinion : the goal of educ and featur of modern societi . first of all , the goal of educ make a good person who is adapt the societi . to make a good person , the school teach mani academ subject . becaus the person must studi the mani academ subject , he would be adapt the societi . for exampl , two high school in korea had anoth curiculum . the one had mani academ subject in curiculum , and the other high school had a one specifiec subject in curiculum . which high school 's student were succeed ? answer is the former . also , the modern societi want to multipaly who perform variou task . as one might expect , to specil in one specif skill is better than to have broad skill of variou field . howev , thi societi make a multiplay . in my experi , i work my compani which ha mani task . becaus i do n't have no variou academ knowledg , i can not promot the manger first time . it is commli beliv that to specil in specif subject is better than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . but , thi opnion is not avail nowaday . to know mani thing is allow to victori the competit .
