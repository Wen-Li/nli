nowaday , it is more common to travel in a group led by a tour guid , but it doe n't mean that it is the best way to travel and discov a countri . the fact that you are depend of a group and that you have not the possibl to meet nativ peopl are reason which explain whi i do n't think that travel in a group is good . firstli , when you travel in a group , you are not independ . you can not visit monument and place that you want . you have to follow the group and the schedul which are provid by the tour guid . for exempl , if you want to eat in a specif restaur , you have to ask the permiss to the guid and come back in a specif time . anoth thing is that if you are exhaust and you need to have some rest , you can not not do it becaus of your apparten to the group . secondli , travel in a group led by a tour guid doe n't permit to discov the cultur of a countri and to meet nativ peopl . in gener , when you stay in group , you have to go in a specif hotel . you have not the opportun to sleep in an bed and breakfast . tour guid will show you the most common or famou place , but not the secret and amaz place of a contri . in tourist trip , you can not be immerg in the cultur or be in relat with the abit of the nativ . even if yo are in a differ countri , you stay with peopl who are the same heritag . to conclud , i think that the best way to travel is to organ a trip by yourself . even if it requier more effort , i am sure that you will apreci your trip much better than if you travel in a group led by a tour guid .
