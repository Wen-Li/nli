i basicli think that young peopl have enough time to help their commun . it should be understood that the young are the major sector of the commun . if the commun , for exampl , offer school and public servic to the young , then the young would respond and cooper with their commun . they take part in public ceremoni , social campaign and mani other assist servic . thi , of cours , would creat a mode of trust , confid and cooper between the young and the commun . gener , the young peopl are of highli percentag of student and less of worker . in other word , most of them are liter and they recogn the need of their commun for them . i realli appreci the young who have a mutual integri between their effort and the commun 's . they form a one bodi where they find each other ' need , and it help solv their problem and to share the same experi under the same medium . one may wonder where is the young peopl 's time run out if they do n't give enough time to help their commun . in fact , i do n't find ani excus to secur those who pretend that they have no enough time to be dedic to their commun . actual , live in a commun is not a tragedi of the common . benefit must be common among all the young as well as the old . final , the young peopl are the core of all commun , and the commun should serv them and give them the most opprtun avail to develop their skill and potenti . in thi way , i think , the other side - the young peopl - will take care of their commun and share it experi cooper . thi woluld make the young give much of their time to help their commun .
