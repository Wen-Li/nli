i agre with the statement `` it is more import to student to understand than it is for them to learn fact '' . as we can need some prior knowledg likeconstruct , work , advatag and disadavntag of a particular instrument to handl and oper a highli sophist instrument other wise it can caus either fals result or some time it may also effect the work condit of the instrument . not onli in practic but also in theori of variou subject like mathemat we requir the basic concept and idea as without know the concept of right formula in right situat we never get an appropri result . when we take an exampl of a medic student if he doe n't know about the basic anatom term like superior , inferior , posterior , anterior , dorsal , ventral , superficici , deeper , distal , proxim , phrenolog , cardiolog , heamatolog , dermatolog , like basic concept are basic for understand the physiolog and also the patholog condit of a particular part or organ . come to the pharmaci without have the basic knoledg about formul we never develop a new formula where we need the concept of ingredi present in the formul . in physic we never understand the how to solv a problem in forc or work or power chaper until we have a basic knowledg of the concept of newton 's law of motion . not in onli in a particular subject like physic , chemistri , biolog we need basic of the subject in everi field . even though it is easi to understand and rememb the fact veri easili than learn the the main idea and concept it is suggest learn the basic idea and concept .
