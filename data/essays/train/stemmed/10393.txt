i both agre and disagre to thi statement . first of all , i believ that a person who live in an academ environ should have a broad knowledg on a number of subject . becaus the solut to today problem requir a broad knowledg from variou area of scienc . and those area are usual interrel to each other . whilst tri to find a relev solut to an issu , a person could face mani problem from a differ area of scienc . so , the person should at least be familiar with the most basic principl of the relat area . i also believ , peopl with a broad knowledg on variou subject can easili understand the problem , find out the relev option to solv it , and refer to the right fellow academ to get the right answer . if one doe not have a broad knowledg , he/sh can not find the way out of the difficulti he/sh may face . on the other hand , the in depth special in a subject is a must in today academ studi in order to be abl to get to the right solut of the problem in a particular subject . today scientif problem requir so good and in depth knowledg that one should be a subject matter expert to conduct relev procedur in order to get relev solut . who would think , without the special knowledg in the subject one could be success ?
