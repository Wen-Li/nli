thi quotat about success peopl is not an easi question and i do not have a ready-mad answer . on the one hand , i think that it is true that success peopl tri news thing and take risk . inde a manag who decid to set up hi own busin take risk . he is not sure that hi shop or compani will be a success . consequ he take a risk that he will not make money , wherea in the compani he work as an employe he wa sure to obtain each month hi wage . nevertheless , if hi busi perform he will make money easili . thu , the remunert he will have is the conterparti of the risk the manag took . in my opinion , i consid that ambiti peopl are often the same who are success . on the other hand , thi affirm might be refut . inde , sometim peopl becam popular and success not becaus they took risk but rather becaus there were at the good place at the good time . it is rather a question of opportun . whi do not take into account the case of a son who becom success just becaus of he is the son of hi father / he ha done noth but he is well-born . moreov , there are peopl who take risk but do not automaticali becom success . then , if we analys the case of a singer we can also critic the quotat . the singer is famou and rich and everybodi speak about him . howev can we say that he is success becaus of the risk he took / what are the risk in thi case / as far as i am comcern , i do not agre to recognis the risk he may have taken . then , there are also peopl who take risk in do what they alreadi know . for instanc , the pilot or the driver of a bu take each day some risk becaus they may creat a danger for the passag . in a certain way , they are success person .
