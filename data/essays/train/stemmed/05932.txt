mani peopl , mostli from older gener , fecklessli assert that young peopl lack the virtu of self sacrific and the will to make better commun . howev , i would like to point out that we can not even prove that time consum of young gener ha declin nowaday if we look at the situat in sever perspect . therefor , i do not agre nor disagre on the statement . firstli , there is a difficulti on actual measur the time spent among young peopl for help the commun . we could gather some sampl data from public organ on particip of young peopl . howev , the statist could ignor some hidden contribut from them . mayb the younger gener got wiser and follow the virtu of humil which will make them to hide what they have done form make better societi . even if we disregard the unseen contribut , and prove that the time consum is declin , we should look at the environ the younger gener are face today . the older gener did not have the notion of `` unlimit competit '' which the younger are face with . the young peopl could be split their preciou and import time to commun contribut while older peopl , when they were young , had much more free time to contribut . from these point , i would care disfut that the younger peopl are not contribut much of their time to the commun .
