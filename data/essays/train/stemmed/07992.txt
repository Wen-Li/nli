concern the fact to impli oneself in commun life , young peopl probabl feel a lack of trust in the author and do n't want to particip ani ; ore to the social life . the first thing to notic is that we nowaday live in an individu societi . it mean young peopl have to do their best to succeed in their own life and do n't have to care about other . of cours , it would be quit disappoint to state that everybodi behav thi way . i think there is a feel of solidar which is grow more and more . howev , we should face the realiti . help other is a form of generos , and generos is gener total free . the problem is that it is the onli free thing in our way of life . young peopl have to work hard , either at school to get a good employ later , or just alreadi as an employe . and you guess that work take time . so should young peopl prefer help other for free or work to make a livind and assur themselv a better life , to live in our current consumt societi . help other wa appar a kind of tradit befor , and as said abov , the way of life ha chang . that creat a major mental gap between young and elderli peopl . we now assist to a seriou misunderstand between gener , becaus our prioriti have been remad . help for older peopl is , i guess , accomplish small action , as for exampl , support someon who ha got some physic problem , in daili life . young peopl obvious can do it , but if a survey would compar behaviour of differ gener , there is no doubt that kind of behaviour ha decreas . howev , i think through work and studi , young gener is plan the best solut for it futur . by product , sell , buy , i should say work , that is to our nation economi that we provid an advantag . and i am sure the countri surviv will enabl to creat appropri servic . or even , if young peopl are glad to be thi countri , they will be grant of a new qualiti : generos !
