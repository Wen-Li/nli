i think that the advertis is what realli push you to buy someth that you need , or think you may need . becaus of the way the product is show . some advertis show just the product advantag , but doe not show the disadventag , so the client or the posibl client ( you ) are convinc that is what you need , without serch for other product that offert the same porpus but in differr way . some time we buy befor do ani research in differ product of the same kind . the price is someth that realli make the differ , becaus if bysid the advertis show just the adventag and it ha a realli low price in compar with other product of the same kind , that realli influen your desit , becaus you alway want to save some money , at least if you are a normal statu person . the advertis are good to show you the differ kind of product you can find in the market for a certain porpus , alway if they tell you the trurth . some compani just made their advertis incompl , as i said befor they show you just the good part of the product , and sometim they overful you of their advertis , so you will make your desit base on what you seen more often , you get to tell youself `` if you see it everi where it most be good , so i will buy it '' . that is what push us to make mistak , we can not leav our desit on the compani 's hand , we have to do some research to make sure that what they are offer is what realli is , and what i realli need , otherwis you do not need to buy it . so my adventag is that alway make sure the product you are buy it what you think it is , you can check with friend of your that had bougth it , or with differ store that sale it , do not let the advertis convinc you .
