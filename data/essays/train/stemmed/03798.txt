i am not quit agre with thi statement becaus we can not be so radic . it seem like all the young peopl would not help enough their commun . i recogn that some teenag tend to be lazi and peopl would like them to provid more effort but it is unfair to say that everybodi act thi way . now if we focus on the vocabulari use in the statement , one word retain my attent : nowaday . implicitli it would mean that they were help more their communit in the past . that can be true . if we go back in time , we would realiz that our life style wa quit differ from thi we have today . peopl wa more helpful , they spend more time togeth . now young peopl are more independ . i am wonder what commun refer to ; to the famili , to school , to friend ? young peopl use to spend more time with their friend than with their rel . in that case , i can understand the point of view of the person who wrote the statement . now if we talk on a mondial level , i think that young peopl are interest in help commun abroad . i read an articl in a magazin whitin they explain that more and more young adult would like to take part in worldwid exchang program such as humanitari help in south america . they stay in for exampl peru to give free english lesson to children in primari school who can not afford to have an acad ; ic educ becaus of their poverti . i think that young peopl give time to help their commun in some way that other peopl , mayb , can not see at first sight .
