'' henc , i agre with the statement . although fact can be seen as a short cut toward studi , i beliv it is more import to teach the student idea and concept then lead them toward the know fact . go though thi process , the student may have a changeabl mind and an abil to turn idea and concept into fact . if the teacher in school teach onli fact , the peopl who studi there will becom comput , for they onli have to rememb the text and they can pass the exam . on the other side , the student have more challang and will learn more . for exampl , if a biolog teacher onli teach a frog is a slimi kind of anim that can live in both water and land , can the student pick the right anim when a turtl and a frog is present to him . on contrasi , if the student are given the idea of learn by experienc themselv , the differ of the two anim shall be easi . anoth reason that i agre more on learn idea and concept are , most of the great invent are start . young should learn how the great scientist achev their success by start on idea and concept other never or do not dare to think of . explain the reflext of a water base on the idea of light that run between the water and the face is more educ than just tell them , `` becaus there is a reflext it is true . '' most importantli the student need to learn is the process between the idea to the fact . it is how thing work and knowledg form , from the question you find to the solut you make after cut out all the other posibl . onli if they get thi abil , they can learn more and learn deep into the subject , and they can find the use fact for life . therefor , by onli understand the process between the idea and concept to the fact , the student may realli learn someth use for their live .
