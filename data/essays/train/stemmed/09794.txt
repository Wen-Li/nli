i disagre with the stament that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . life is becom shorter everi day . time is everyth and everi minut is worth a fortun . peopl have more thing to do , much more respons and activ to perform within societi . work demand more everi day that goe by , and product is an everi day word in our vocabulari . new invent and equip is constantli be creat to help peopl save time and energi . time fli and we keep fli behind it tri to catch up . a car is one of the most import invent that save us time and energi . it is the basic main of transport in thi world of instant result . regardless the fact that is also a luxuri and a pleasur to some peopl , it 's main purpos is to take us to a specif place in the less amount of time possibl . that is the basic reason whi i believ that the amount of car will keep increas in the next sever year . howev , i do think that the size of the car is go to chang . vehicl will becom smaller and more compact . so that there can be more space in the street . the car will no longer be seen as a luxuri or an object of comfort but as a practic machin that save us time , just as a comput or a calcul doe . i strongli believ that the amount of car will not decreas twenti year from now , on the contrari i think the car popul will increas more and more , but a car will no longer be seen as it ha been these past year . it will be a necessari instrument of our every-day life , like a toothbrush or a refriger . it will prevail and be even more popular . it will becom smaller and more practic , more econom and less exclus . look will be a secondari thing while economi , space save and good perform will be the main characterist to be consid within the next decad . the car will stay with us as long as no other machin take it 's place .
