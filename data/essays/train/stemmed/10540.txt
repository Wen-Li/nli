`` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . my decis to agre or disagre on thi topic might depend a lot on the definit of young peopl and old peopl . let us decid , for the sake of clariti that a young person is someon who is below the age of 25 , who is still in undergradu colleg and older peopl are peopl abov the age of 50 who have achiev financi secur in their live and are about to attain their retir age . still with thi definit too , it hard to actual quantifi enjoy . look at the situt from a broader perspect though , i would sure say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . let me put forward a case which might explain my point in detail . take for exampl , the thing that young peopl do in their leisur time . they hang around with their girl friend / boy friend and other close friend , they parti out , they go for movi , discothequ and they take pleasu from all sort of entertain avail on thi planet . on the other hand , you would n't expect the same behaviour from older peopl . they would rather stay at home and enjoy the pleasur and warmth the home ha to provid . sip by the sunday afternoon 's tea , eat biscuit , watch their grandson play in the garden is how mani old peopl visual their leisur time to be spent . they have actual wit a lot in the 50 year span of their live , that these littl thing in natur bring a great deal of enjoy to them than anyth els . also , older peopl benefit a great deal through their experi . they know how the world work . they are better equip with deal the up and down of life . also , they have financi secur and are more cautiou in the decis they make . thu , a great deal of your happi depend on these small thing in life . older peopl are better organ in sort out these small thing in life . on the other hand , most youth are in a confus state of mind . they 're still matur day by day learn how cruel the world can be at time . also , they are not financi secur . young peopl often take decis in hast for which they repent later . thu , as we have seen abov , `` enjoy '' depend a great deal on how it is quantifi and defin . it rather depend on a particular individu as to whether he ha enjoy hi life more in hi youth or when hi hair turn grey . but it so happen , that your best year are your undergradu year when you studi in colleg and are away from your parent . thi is the time where you meet new peopl and foster relat that you rememb them for the rest of your life . so look object at the situat , young peopl can get a great deal out of life than their older counterpart can .
