i disagre that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today by the follow reason . first , mani peopl who live in local place will be not abl to use the offici translat system , train and buse . in the near futur , mani railway compani and bu compani will cut thier local line in order to cut the cost to move train and buse . to get profit from the local line , they need mani passeng . but now the number of passeng are veri few . so they can not get profit from the local line and they have to cut the line . if they wo n't cut the local line , they need to increas their fee . thu , the peopl who live in local place want to and have to use their own car . when i wa elementari school student , i live in hokkaido in japan . at that time , the servic of mani line of japan nation railway in hokkaido wa stop . thu , my father had to buy a car . second , the new technolog of car 's engin will invent for save gasolin . mani peopl think that the cost of gasolin will increas and they will be not abl to use gasolin to ride a car in the near futur . but nowaday , some car dealer sell new car which have a hybrid system ( gasolin and electr ) , for exampl , toyota puriu , honda insight and toyota estima . in europ , mani car manifactur is tri to use diesel engin instead of gasolin engin . at last month , ceo of volkswagen came to japan and announc that they will sell mani diesel car in japan in the near futur . thu , i think that fuel will remain in twenti year as abov the reason i show , i can not agre the number of car will decreas in twenti year .
