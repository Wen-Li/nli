there are those who tri new thing and take dangeou risk , and there are other who tri thing which are alreadi know to do well . from my point of view , it is better to do new thing even though there are a lot of heavi risk . there are sever advantag of do new thing ; new experi and sens of achiev . first of all , i can experi new thing and gain my knowledg . as i tri and challeng new thing , i would find someth import and valuabl lesson that i do not know . for instanc , i am join in swim club right now . sinc my coach move to new swim club , new coach came my club . of cours , new coach did n't know my major stroke which wa free style . i told him about my major stroke , but he recommend me that i should swim at competit as breast stroke swimmer . i wa surpris becaus i never challeng to compet as breast stroke swimmer and that competit assembl veri expert and elit swimmer . but i want to tri my best . befor the competit , i practic so hard and ask my coach how i can swim breast stroke fast . as a result , i could swim the fastest breast stroke in my life at the competit . i learn from thi happen a lot . second of all , when i tri new thing that are never experienc , i would feel sens of achiev . if i tri same thing that i know how to do well , there is no feel after i finish those thing . i would feel bore and tire of it to do . but when i tri new thing , i would feel excit and passion to finish those new thing as perfect . i would collect data from intrument such as internet and book and ask friend how i can do well . if i finish my work to do new thing perfectli , i would feel sens of achiev and exhaust . consid all of abov reason , most of peopl think it is better way to tri thing that i alreadi know becaus they want to do well , but when it come to me , i believ that peopl should tri new thing even thought there are a lot of dangeou risk and difficulti . peopl should learn valuabl lesson from new experi and feel sens of achiev .
