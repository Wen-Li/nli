i do n't agre complet with the statement . i do n't believ that in order to be success peopl have to take risk or tri new experi . i mean , it would be more correct say that these kind of peopl are brave , but i realli rather not to use the word `` success '' . let me explain myself : it is extrem complic to defin what doe it mean be a success person , peopl have such differ goal and perspect in life that there is n't a clear definit of the term ! i can feel that i made it or that i am extrem success for someth that mayb would be seen as a total disast from someon els 's view . so , i guess i admir both peopl who are alway tri to make chang or experi new practic , and also , on the other hand , i truli respect those who feel much more confort and self secur by repet thing they alreadi know . howev , i must confess . .. i think i am more a `` new risk everi day '' type of woman ! i love to feel the emot when i do n't figur out what am i do or i tri all my best when it come to deal with new circumst . so , that is probabl anoth reason whi i do n't see as success peopl who tri new thing : becaus i do n't see myself that way , use the word `` success '' . mayb sometim i wish i wa wiser , more tradit and not afraid of everyday routin !
