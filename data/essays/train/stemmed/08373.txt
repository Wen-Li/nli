i agre with the statement that `` it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . basic mani peopl do not know the fact of certain reason or somth els . they agre with the fact onli when some other have strong reason to prove it . but if they are familiar with the concept and idea they can think of the and they can decid of it whether it is correct or wrong . consid the follow exampl to prove my statement . in the earlier day when technolog wa not in the advanc state mani peopl thought earth to be a flat surfac and they follow it for a long time . but later on when a scientist discov that earth wa in spheric in shape the whole world wa against him . he tri to prove it by certain law and principl . but the peopl in those day were not abl to understand hi idea and concept . so , they argu with him and did not agre with hi statement . later on when peopl began to understand hi idea and concept agre with him . anoth exampl is consid the subject like mathemat or physic . if the student doe not know the concept of the subject or doe n't have an idea in it , he will not be to understand anyth in it . suppos in physic we tri to prove mani fact use certain law and concept . the student should understand the concept to know the fact of that law . now a day mani student are familar with the idea and concept . so , they tri to obtain the fact from tere own concept and knowledg . nobodi are requir for the to prove the fact for them . so instood of tri to prove the fact for the student make them to know concept and idea of the fact . so , that they can understand the fact by themshelv without prove for them . so , if student understand idea and concept than know the actual fact , they can onli conclud of the fact without other tring to prove the fact for them
