i support that there will not be fewer car in the futur twenti year compar to these day . the reason that day to day life is chang depend on the cost of live and the easi way to move from one place to anoth with more safeti . sinc the technolog is be advanc in all the feild , peopl prefer the differ technolog car in the up come day . as we know that there are lot of accid on two wheeler . these car provid the safest way to reach the long distanc in shorter time and safe . some countri like india , japan , china etc still peopl prefer the easiest way to reach by walk is use a bike or motor cycl but fastiest way other than bike is car and it safe too . i too say that the day to day life the resourc of petrol and diesel have been hike sinc the quantiti is low , nut in the futur the technolog bring the differ way to use the car without fuel and exit resourc . for exampl compar to the compani like merced , gener motor , ford , honda etc. , the research are do they research on differ field to develop they compani in differ way like safe drive , with low feul consumpt , sleek design in interior and exterior , the technolog use from one car to anoth in there own product . some research orient compani do there project on automobil that use less fuel , some on without fuel and some on drive without a driver with the help of gp ( global posit system ) , and in engin too . these research help the compani to move it to built new product in market . these technolog make the consum attract in buy a new car and henc increas the rate of use the safest car to move from one place to anoth , thi way the usag of car may lead to increas more car in the futur twenti year so i think so in futur definit the usag of car will increas with differ technolog than compar to these day depend on the way there use them .
