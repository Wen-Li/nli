car are one of the modern transport nowaday , which are commonli use by everyon . car can make our live easier by save our time and energi . as car are get more and more commonli use , the energi need for the car is get lesser and lesser . as in result , energi crisi occur , and which becom one of the most import daili issu to us . i believ in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , becaus of the scarciti of energi , and the innov of technolog . it is obviou that there are more and more car on the street nowaday . but ha anyon awar the huge lost of energi ? probabl not . car will not work without gasolin . as more and more gasolin is purchas , it becom more scarc . in econom view , when a good or servic is get scarc , the price of the individu good or servic will increas . that is what 's happen to the gasolin nowaday . as the price of gasolin rise , the live expens also increas . in the end , peopl will not use car as common as we do now . and thi is becaus of the scarciti of energi need for the car . when the situat of scarciti of the the energi is happen , peopl tend to find mani way to solv thi problem . the innov of transport might be the solut to thi problem . scientist who work on energi develop might creat new energi instead of the tradit energi , gasolin . with the help of these scientist , the solut will either be have new form of energi , or new form of car that consum less gasolin . therefor , tradit car will no longer be use in twenti year . in conclus , the scarciti of energi and the innov of technolog can reduc the number of car in the next twenti year . scarciti of energi lead to the rise of live expens , which will final forc peopl not to use car as much as they do now . the innov of technolog will help develop new form of energi that will not be use by car , and new tool of transport other than car . therefor , i believ there will be fewer car in use than there are today in the next twenti year .
