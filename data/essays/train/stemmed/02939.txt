although much peopl may agre with thi statement i disagre with it for sever reason . the first point is that there are no reason to support thi statement . whi should an older person enjoy life less than younger peopl ? older human have the same possibl to enjoy life as younger do . they are abl to go shop , to go to cinema or whatev they want . furthermor i may say that older peopl enjoy life more than younger do becaus gener they have more money and know exactli what they want . becaus i am young i have to tri out what i like and what i dislik . for exampl , if i travel to austria and after the first three day i realiz that i do not like thi countri . in thi situat the whole holiday will be bad . if i had been older , i would have known that and would not been travel there . it is also the fact that older peopl are have more pastim when they are free from work . so they have much more time to do what they want . due to thi they would enjoy their life more than younger peopl which still have duti like go to school or work . moreov , younger peopl are stress more often becaus they want to have success in their job or in school . so , even if there is time to do someth enjoy , they just will not do thi becaus they are too stress . the third reason whi i disagre with thi statement is becaus of my own experi . nearli all the older peopl i know are enjoy their life veri much . my mother is an exampl for that . sinc she is older than fifti , she is more often in bar and club than i am . she also ha mani friend and enough money to do whatev she want . my last point deal with the danger of deseas in age . i do not think that thi fact consequ prevent older peopl from enjoy their life . in my opinion , know that life is short and may also end in the next year is an argument for enjoy life . in that situat peopl perhap will care about their time and use it as well as possibl . in the end i think that older peopl may enjoy their life even more than younger peopl do .
