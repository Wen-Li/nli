car is one of the most import invent . car have help our human be veri much in mani aspect . nowaday , peopl can not live without the help of car . but , at the same time , car have caus a lot of problem for our human be . as we all know , everyth ha it pro and con . we ca n't burn the candl at the both end . some peopl have pai much attent to the disadvantag of car , and they think we should get rid of car . and they also believ that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . in my opinion , i ca n't agre with thi statement , bucaus we can find anoth veihcl to take the place of car in a short time . peopl who think car are usless may have forgotten a fact that the invent of car realli chang our live veri much . with the help of car , our life becom easier . everi morn , mani peopl choos car to drive to work . it is hard to imagin a world without car . i think peopl will use more and more car . the second reason is that it need a long time to invent a kind of new veihcl . invent a new thing is a long process , and need a lot of money and effort . if one day , a new veihcl wa invent , it would take a long time to put it into practic . twenti year are not suffici for that long process . car in deed caus problem , such as pollut , traffic accid . but we can do someth to avoid these side effect . we can develop a new energi sourc , which would cost less than invent a new veihcl . i believ traffic accid is not the fault of car , but it is the fault of our peopl . numer peopl do n't pay much attent to the traffic law . and there are also a lot of driver that do n't take care of other road user . we should chang the way we behav now . as the reason i given abov , i insist that car will not be fewer in use in twenti year . car are still pali impot role in morden societi . mayb , mani year later , they will be replac by other veihcl . but it posit ca n't be chang in a short time .
