in these day mani topic have becom import point of discuss . one of thi , is the belief that in the futur less car will be use becaus of consequ of differ reason . in my opinion , we will still use car in twenti year time but no for so much longer and no as much as we use car now . the main reason whi i think thi way , is becaus obvious our natur resourc are decreas veri quickli , especi , the petrol and everybodi know that thi it is a limit resourc . anyway if we still have some , in twenti year time , the price of petrol will be so expens than just a few peopl will be abl to afford it , and it would be reflect in the number of car in use . anoth reason to support my idea is that hope , harder law in relat to enviroment and ecolog issu will be apli , therefor peopl will be more concern about the danger we are expos earth just use our car everytim we want to go someher . but , probabl , more than anyth els , the reason caus i thing car will no be in use as much as they are today , is that import chang in transport , distribut of the citi and new energet resourc will come soon . mayb new discov about the use of nuclear energi will help to develop new way of tranport or will increas the privat use of the aeroplan . if we think , that probabl the citi will be situat far away from each other and in more isol area , with no road , the use of the aeroplan as privat transport will be veri useful . summar , if the volum of car will remain the same , will reduc or increas , is a question that will be anwer in a veri short while . meanwhil , i think we should start reduc the use of automobil and bid for altern way of tranport as the train , tube or tram which are more favour to our enviro .
