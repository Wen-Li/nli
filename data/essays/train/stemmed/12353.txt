nowaday , risk is a part of our everyday life . while some peolpl are more like to take risk , other are just readi to practic what they alreadi know . but , i notic that peopl who tri new thing and take risk are most success . in fact , risk is a compon of success . usual , there is `` no success without risk '' . peopl who take risk are alway innov and think about new project and new strategi of success . for exampl , if my field of studi is biolog , i have more knowlegd and experi in biolog than in ani other field . but i decid to invest my money in a coff shop , which is pure busi . that is a huge risk becaus , obvious i do n't have ani specif knowlegd and experi on how to run a coff shop . now , becaus i want my busi to succeed , i will hire a specialist in coffe busi to guid me and help me run my busi . by work day after day with the specialist , i will learn how to run the busi by myself . howev , take risk can turn into a bad decis sometim . for exampl , i can take a risk and not succeed right away . but the failur is a good experi becaus i 'm learn from it and the next step will sure be better . in conclus , i think that take risk is a good decis in most of situat . by take risk , we innov , anticip and we are more like to move forward in our life .
