thi statement is in my opinion a bit to widerang . so i think that the peopl in our societi are split in two group : the one who never help somebodi and the one who care about the well bee of other . i will elabor thi in thi essay in two paragraph . on the one hand , i think that today societi of young peopl becom wors in help each other becaus they tend to be more and more sellfish . the kid prefer to stay at home alon to play comput instead of go out in parc and play footbal with other in the same age . meet other is the begin of creat a commun : share free time with other . then , in school , mani of the pupil do n't want to help their classmat becaus of the fear to loos someth . after that , when the young peopl begin to work , they want to earn alway more money . at the same time , they do n't want to spend a bit of their spare-tim to those who could need it . on the other hand , there have been done mani thing to get peopl more involv in help their commun . often they are in form of voluntari work and mani peopl do n't hear about it even if they would like to help . in germani , they have introduc a `` civil servic '' . it wa made up for those who do n't want to make the militari servic , so it is obligatori . sinc it wa creat , they are mani young peopl who work in hospit , hous for older peopl , for handicap or drug and alcohol ill peopl . today , the govern think about put the militari servic away and instead of that make the civil servic obligatori for all , boy and girl . thi would be great , becaus so everyon get an experi in help other so that these peopl would give help next time easier . i think most of the peopl do n't go and help peopl by their own , but with a littl experi in social work , they will chang their mind on that point .
