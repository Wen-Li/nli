you can not know everyth , that is a fact . but should we tri to get a wide spread knowledg of mani differ topic rather than be a specialist in onli one certain subject . in the end it depend on which solut is the best match with your person . i am a medic student and i spend realli a lot of time studi but there are so much thing to know about medicin that i can onli learn a small part with my limit brain capac . henc , i tri to be at least a specialist in a certain area with determin outlin becaus a doktor who knew a littl bit of evertyth but noth exactli is absolut redund . so in order to get a job i am inevit forc to concentr on a few certain topic . by contrast , i think that beyond the job , it is veri import to have a wide spread knowledg of lot of differ thing . an urban person should know mani differ thing about other cultur , histori and literatur , becaus in that time we are live in so much inform and knowledg is offer to everyon . special would be insular in my opinion . as far as the knowledg beyond the job is concern it doe not make sens to tri to know everyth about one topic , becaus if you have a broad knowledg you have mani topic to talk about with other peopl . for instanc , i will tri to teach my children thing about world histori as well as differ languag so that they know a littl bit of everyth and can deepen their knowledg of these subject they are most interest in singl hand . in conclus , i propos to special whenev it is neccessari , for the job for exampl as i alreadi mention . beyond the job i prefer a broad knowledg of mani differ thing , but that is a matter of person . ..
