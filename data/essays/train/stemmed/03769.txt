i complet agre . that is the purpos of an advertis , to tri to make thing look better than they realli are . our societi is base in capit and consum . the more you make peopl buy thing ( even the one they do not need or work as they should ) , more money is made and compani are abl to grow and expand . if a compani sell a specif product want to be profit and expand , it need to let everyon know that it product is the best . now , if you are tri to sell a product but you just realiz it ha some flaw , would you tell the customm about that ? most peopl would n't . it would impli to invest more money tri to make the product better and capit is about make money not expend it . after all , if a compani can make money sell qualiti product they will do it . in advertis , market peopl look at the good point of a product and focu on them , make them look like the best option for the consumm . obvious , they wo n't say anyth about it disadvantag or problem they will tri to make peopl want to buy that product . howev , that 's whi some countri have aggenc to keep track of customm complain made about bad product . if they find there 's a problem with the product they might contact the compani respons for that and make it fix it or do someth els in order to compens the customm expens . i think the import point here is the ethic of the compani tri to sell product . if the compani onli care about make more money , they will tri to sell low qualiti product , howev if they have good ethic , they 'll tri to sell alway the best product even if they need to expend more money
