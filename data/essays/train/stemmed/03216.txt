the issu at hand is whether to succeed in life is it worthwil to take a risk or continu with routin standardis pattern of do think . the issu is import becaus it directli relat to how doe the behavior of human may effect in their be success . i believ that by tri out new thing and take risk there are more chanc to becom sucess in life rather than do a routin task or repetit task at which a person is good at . the reason which make me beliv that take risk is essenti for succeed becaus by tri out someth new we come up with new set of result which can be help if we comprehend these result properli . in past peopl use to beliv that earth wa the centr of univers and all bodi like sun , moon revolv around it . if copernicu would not have thought the idea that it is sun which is stationari then peopl would have continu to live in ignor and no major astronom discoveri would have taken place . thu think in routin way or do thing thi way present seriou obstacl to develop of man kind . secondli by do thing which we alreadi know how to do we are wast the immens power of human mind and it creativ . suppos if a student is thaught in class to draw line , box after sometim the student will probabl would have learn it well so there is no new thing which can be done but if student tri to experi with differ pattern , curv and probabl use differ colour he may come up with a new kind of art form , do thing like art requir peopl to use creativ and think out of the box rather than routin task . furthermor i feel that by do some experi and risk take behaviour is essenti for new scientif discoveri . the basic aim of practic session conduct is to prove that the practic result compli with theori . when dunlop wa work in hi lab with rubber tyre he mix some sulphur while heat the rubber which led to invent of vulcanis rubber , although not sure about tough and properti of it he fit these new tyre in hi son bicycl , thu he found out that new qualiti of rubber wa much better than old rubber and henc he use hi idea and thu wa abl to esatablish new compani with hi new invwent . thu hi risk take behavior had truli paid off , had he been do same routin tak he would have never succed . thu take risk and do experiment to challeng establish theori and rule play a pivot role in success of human be rather than just do routin thing . i believ that success will follow those who challeng the establish thing rather than those who like to do onli same thing and are unidimension in their appraoch toward life and work .
