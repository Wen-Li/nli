i do not agre with the idea that it is more import for the student to understad idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i mean understand the idea and concept will help the student in some way but thi will not be enough for them to learn the thing elabor and accur . learn the fact in an oper way is much more better for the student than onli repeat some concept in the textbook or memorizig them . i think all the class should should includ an applic part of the lesson which is given in it . imagin that you are in a biolog class and learn the anom behaviour . will it be satisfi for you to read the passag in the text book ? of cours not . it will be better to see real life pattern on anim behaviour to learn the concept adequatli and accur . so in such case student might visit a zoo or a nation park by the control of the teacher in order to see the real life fact in a natur way . anoth good exampl could be a comput scienc class . we all know that comput program is an oper thing and the best way of learn it is to use the comput in the comput lab . you may use the textbook again to understand the concept but that will not be enough to imagin the proggram in an excel way . you should use it and learn it by make mistak again again much more better than read it usag in the text book . anoth cricual point on thi subject is the fact that it is alreadi proven by the educ psycologist that learn the thing by real life experi is much more effect than learn the one which are previous prepar by the teacher . suppos that you are make a cake from a cook book . will your cake be excel in the first time or will it get better by the time you make it again and again ?
