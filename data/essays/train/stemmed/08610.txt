student who learn to understand the metholog of a certain process have enough capac to quickli identifi and solv a problem , eventhough chang were done in the exampl use to explain the new topic . i agre with the fact that state that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is more relev when a person solv a problem by understan everi step done , than by follow all the process by memor . for exampl , a mechan engin student who is take the cours of static ha a better probabl of get better grade if he understand all the main concept of the class . teacher explain the theori in problem veri differ from the one util on test . so , when a student onli learn the fact about the stress appli to an object with certain geometri , he will not be abl to answer the problem if the teacher chang the geometri of the object on the test . the student should be abl to understand how to appli the relat concept in ani given situat . in my own experi , i can appli thi statement to one of my hobbi , play golf . two year ago when i start practic thi tricki but fun sport , i need two take class everi week . my teacher alway rememb me about the import of do the movement , `` swing '' , think on it , not just do it automat . thi concept help me a lot to understand my mistak dure the swing . so , thi left me the reflect about understand everi step of the movement and not just do it mechan . after some time of play golf , i learn that when you just learn the fact and do not analyz them , you start repeat the same error without identifi them . as a conclus , thi two exampl show the import of understan idea and concept over just learn the fact . understand the concept give you the abil to easili recogn ani error .
