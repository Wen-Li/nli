i disagre with the statement and i believ that the number of car would have increas manifold in the next twenti year . thi conclus stem from the belief that our ever increas popul variou technolog improv will contribut greatli in accelar the demand for newer and more effici car over the year to come . the next twenti year will see a tremend growth in technolog thu provid the necessari stimulu for variou innov that will benefit the automot industri . these will spurt an unrestrain growth in the number of car thu lead to a far greater number than what is in exist nowaday . altern fuell car such as hydrogen fuell car will becom popular and will be sold extens with the ad benefit of be environ friendli and safe to drive . these measur will onli attract custom which would otherwis be dissuag from buy car due the the global oil shortag and environment concern . the growth in popul ha no limit . in the come twenti year , i see a tremend growth in popul thu contribut to a larger workforc . thi would have a two fold effect . firstli , the increas workforc will requir a conveni mean of transport and secondli , they would have the power to purchas due to the ever increas salari . aall thi would obvious lead to peopl indulg in the purchas of car . thi scenario will be preval in a countri such a india in which peopl consid a vehicl to be a statu symbol . so in the near futur i not onli see a car for everi home in inda but also a car for everi famili member in most home . in view of the abov reason , i 'm convinc that the number of car in the next twenti year wont be declin but increas at such a rapid pace that i can imagin the decis to buy a car at that time be taken with the same amount of serious as the decis to buy a music system nowaday .
