in my opinion it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowladg of mani academ subject . there are mani reason to agre with thi statement . first of all , to appli for a job you need to know specif inform about one topic . for exampl if you aim to be an ingen you should know a lot about phisic , otherwis you will not work as an ingen . there are no posit in where you can work if you do not know ani specif subject . be special in one area give you the opportun to find a job where ever you want . anoth reason whi i consid true thi statement is becaus it doe not exist a person who can earn a lot of money work , and doe not been special in a specif subject . that is whi is so import to make a good choic when select a career , if not whi it is so difficult to find an posit with a good remuner . it is becaus if you are not a knowledg person in a specif subject you will not show superior in comparison with other peopl . it simpli consist in make the differ . last but not least , i consid vital the thing that you need to know in deep about a subject becaus otherwis you will never have the incet to keep on know even more and more . if you have a broad knowladg of mani academ subject you are not abl to go on learn more thing . a person need to learn everi day someth knew about a specif area in order to build up hi futur expect about hi life . in conclus i consid it is much more imort to special in one specif subject than to have a broad knowladg of mani acadm subject . that is becaus is vital in appli for a posit , also to be abl to earn a good money and final to have alway the ambici of know more and more .
