`` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . i agre with thi ststement . nowaday , young peopl are restrict to limit number of activ by their parent . in thi present world young peopl are almost oper by their by their parent or in gener elder . they are not allow to think pragmat . they alreadi have been allot with a time tabl or routin in their life like what is to be done at each age in their life and most of them are kept in control without deviat from their track . so most of the young peopl donot give enough time to help their commun , the task which is not present in their curriculum . societi and the environ of the young is also influenc them in a greater way . most of them are not even awar of the present scenario apart from the studi and they not know exactli about the problem face by the commun . most of them nowaday are narrow mind . everi one feel and in fact are made to feel '' whi should i care about other ? what are they to me ? '' . almost everyon is live with the sane mind set . everi one ha the same uniqu vision of their life that is to studi well and earn money for themselv and their famili . no one want to contribut for the societi . in olden day problem were the part of everyon life . so young peopl who are the futur of thi world knew their respons to be discharg for the commun . peopl at that time use to lead a practic life with broader vision . they alway did thing think how thi effect and help the societi . so i feel that young peopl nowaday are be greatli influenc by their parent and they are not contribut to the societi even though they have got a great potenti . young peopl who are the futur of thi world should be properli guid in their associ with the societi for a better tomorrow .
