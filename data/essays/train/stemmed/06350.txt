i agre with the statement that the success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i think tri new thing would make peopl success . thi is becaus you can get to know more about differ thing and expand your view from mani perspect . seek more into one subject is a great thing , but tri to do new thing would be more benefici in the futur . by do new thing throughout your life can make them experienc . it 's a wonder thing to be an experienc person . by be an experienc person , peopl can solv more problem than those of the peopl who onli know one thing and ha interest in one thing . i think expand your view and be experienc would lead you to gain relianc from peopl . mani peopl respect those of the peopl who have their own point of view and experi . so by be the one who is respect , they would be surround by peopl who are respect and reliabl . take risk rather than not will make that person 's heart strong . i think to be an success person , you would need to have some kind of risk . larger the risk , the stronger you 'll be . it is becaus you can not get stronger if you do not have courag to take the risk . it 's is not the risk that is import . it is the courag that is import when you take the risk . it is hard to be courag at first , howev , after you have taken that risk , you would be veri satisfi with what you have done . there are mani way for a person to be success and these exampl are onli few out of those mani way . i alway think that experienc and courag peopl can be success with their life in a lot of differ way .
