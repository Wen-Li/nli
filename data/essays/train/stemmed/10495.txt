the rapid growth in the usag of car , especi in the last ten year , ha caus lot of both social and environment problem to increas ; howev , becaus of the fact that there is an rapid increas in the world 's popul , the peopl are get involv in sever issu within a same day due to the increas challeng , and that the car is known to be a symbol of so-cal ` prestig ' , i believ there wo n't be fewer car in use ; rather an increas in the amount could be expect in twenti year . first of all , the rapid increas in the world 's popul is unfortun can not be prevent in most of the countri . if we just think of the case that the world economi will not undergo sever damag in twenti year ; then it is a clear fact that the more the human born , the more the number of car that will be use will increas . if the newli built up , wide road are taken into account , we may even say that the demand for car will increas in a consider amount . secondli , the life challang ha acceler for peopl dure the last year , make them get involv in sever task even within a singl day . for exampl , you could imagin a mother who ha ha the follow task to do in a singl day : bring her littl son to school , then go to work , complet lot of issu even by go somewher els to trade and final go back to her son 's school to get him back for the guitar lesson that he will have . without a doubt , she will prefer to use her own car , not the public transport in order to accomplish her target in the fastest , most comfort and conveni way . final , in today 's world , it is unfortun a fact that the car are seen as prestig element for the live of certain peopl such as bussinessmen or youth . they think themselv to have obtain a certain degre in public if they use their own , expens , luxuri car . although thi is veri nonsens for a lot of us , we can never skip thi fact in the increas of the car within the next tewnti year . as a conclus , though the use of public transport and so the decreas in the usag of car will solv most of the transport , traffic-jam , sociolog and environment problem ; it come out to be a fact for me that ; there will not be ani decreas in the usag of car within twenti year accord to the problem of rapid growth in popul , increas in the life challeng and the prestig that is thought to be obtain by use a car .
