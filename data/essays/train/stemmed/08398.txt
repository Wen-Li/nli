in my opinion , it is better to special in one specif subject in an academ studi . there are sever advantag of both path , howev special in one topic would enabl us to concentr on one subject and to deal with it detail closer . the main reason behind my belief is that there is not enough time to learn everyth and have a deep understand of everi subject . by the increas in the knowledg in acedem subject , we have to have more time to consid all sphere of one specif subject . for instanc , a polit scienc student could not have a deep understand of the middl east cultur and polit in an educ period of four year . in addit to hi undergradu educ , he ha to have a research in middl east and should attend to a univers or an institut which is special on middl east . actual an avareg life of a person is not suffici to have a perfect knowledg of one specif subject . in modern societi , the divis of labor demand more special individu and the societi is evolv into a hegemoni of technocrat . begin with the movement of ration in the nineteenth centuri and with the improv of technolog , we have more detail subject to deal with , contari to pre-modern time . so , there it is not onli my prefer to get special in one specif subject , but it is a necess for the societi . the detail are increas and we ought to get consist with thi develop . we also need to consid that special in one specif subject would be meaningless , if it is so independ from the context which it is belong to . for exampl , it would be meaningless to know everyth about the histori and the cultur of the middl east , if the person would not have the enough inform about the histori of the whole world and the relat between civil . in conclus , as a result of the develop of the modern societi , peopl have to special in one specif subject . becaus there is not enough time to deal with mani academ subject .
