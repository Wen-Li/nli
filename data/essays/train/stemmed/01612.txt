in my poinnion , i think it is more impot for student to learn fact than to understand idea and concept . firstli , we live in the real life , if we do thing base on the idea or concept we may lose our mind . becaus sometim , thing is go to chang at ani time , but we do not know when it chang , or how it chang . for exampl , there is a ancient stori in china , say that there is a master of armi who learn veri well through the book knowledg , he can even memor all the concept of the book . onc , the enrmi attack hi area , then he use the concept from the book to fight with the enrmi , final he fail . becaus the enrmi use a trick dure the battl while the master onli know the solut in the book . thi show us we should learn fact instead of onli learn the idea and concept . we should be more flexabl to deal the problem which apper in our real life . secondli , fact give you more impress . for instanc , onc you write a wrong solut in the exam , after you know it is wrong , it you will have a serv impress , and you will never do it again , becaus you have the experi . therefor , learn fact is more impot for student than onli understand idea and concept .
