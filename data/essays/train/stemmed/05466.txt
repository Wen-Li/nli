i think that travel with few peopl and without a tour guid is the best way to enjoy your trip . i believ that a tour guid is necessari just if you plan to visit a countri whose cultur , habbit or languag are realli difficult to understand . i consid that the peopl you travel with are the most import issu when you plan a journey . togeth with my wife , we onc went to mexico with two friend of us who had never travel befor . we invit them to come with us and we contract a local tour guid even if we both speak spanish . we realiz , after few day , that it wa a bad idea . as our friend were not use to the mexican high temperatur , they got sick after visit the chichenitza archeolog site . dure the follow day we visit the south part of the countri and we realiz that the tour guid wa explain us the same thing that we would have found written in a tourist book . consid thi bad experi we decid to organ our next travel by ourself . next summer we are go to japan were my wife spent a whole year learn japan dure an intern exchang program . thi time , instead of contractct a tour guid , we are go to ask to the peopl she met there , to give us a tour around the countri . we will visit the most famous japan place with local peopl and we will be abl to schedul our journey without depend on the group ' s plan .
