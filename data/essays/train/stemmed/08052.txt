today almost evey adult ha a car . most peopl use their car eveyday , for essenti thing such as go to work or drive to a supermarket to buy food . a car is an element of daili life . of cours in citi where there is a good public transport system , peopl do not need a car for their daili life . but in more rural area or citi where puplic transport is not veri effect , there is the need of car . reason to reduc the number of car are to protect the environ and the fact that car and fuel are get more and more expens . mayb in some year there are no more as mani peopl as today who can afford a car . on the other hand there is the fact that busi and work life get more and more flexibl , spontan and individ , and the need to get to a specif place in a short time increas . and we should not forget the industri branch that produc car . weigh these point , i came to the conclus that i do not think the number of car will decreas . i want to point out that i think it would be a better develop for life on earth if there would be fewer car in twenti year , but i do not think thi will happen . today industri that produc car is still a grow busi , and i can not imagin that thi would chang in the next few decad . i studi geodesi , and someth that i could do later is develop navig system . an exampl where navig system are commonli use is in car . mani peopl and compani work and research for new develop in car and compon for car . so i do not see a financi reason whi fewer car should be produc in twenti year . to sum up i want to say that i would be veri happi if there were fewer car in twenti year . the reason for thi opinion is the protect of natur and the environ and to reduc pollut caus by car . but i do not think thi will happen becaus busi and earn money encourag the product of more and more car . and i can not imagin that busi interest will step behind in favour of environment reason .
