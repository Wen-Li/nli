in my opinion thi statement is right . i think if you alway do the same thing , that you have done sinc year you have to work harder to succeed . thi work becom bore and you can not imagin chang anyth if you alway do the same thing . for instanc , if you alway work in a compani check car , thi can becom veri bore and monoton even if you earn a lot of money , work hard and you do your job well . but one day you will feel senseless and hopeless for a better futur . if you do not risk or better take the chanc and appli for an other job , there will never be ani improv of your situat . in thi situat , success will be deni . you will never get a better job with better condit . in thi situat you should chang your point of view and tri new thing . with an applic you could get a job with better condit . but you have to risk that the earn can also be lower . thi fact bring me to my point of view . in gener , it is better to take risk . if you are felix and tri new thing you have the opportun to altern your work and even improv it . these chang lead to new idea and point of view , which can have posit impact on the work and especi on the person . as an exampl i can mention student who do not want to go abroad but can be convinc , that it is good for themselv as a person and for their curriculum vita . thi can be call person success . go abroad mean to take the risk of be alon at the begin , of start a new life in a foreign countri and even of speak a foreign languag . thi way they have to learn self-reli and becom more self-confid . these valu can lead to success in applic in big compani . thi access can bring them to rich and satisfact , which can be experienc as success . peopl who stay at home studi well with gain the best grade will probabl not be as sucessful as peopl be abroad . i think thi is veri convinc for the right of the statement .
