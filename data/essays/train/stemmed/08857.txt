i not agre with thi statement . i think there is much young peopl that help hi commun and spend a lot of hi time for it . for exampl there are some volountari in mani place : in hospit , in center for old peopl . .. and so on . i know some peopl who work for the ambul : they are volountari who stay , some time also all night , at the ambul to give hi help in case of need , and the day later they are in offic to work . there are also some girl i know who give their help to center where old peopl stay becaus they 're seek or need help . thees girl have a big sens of respons in help other , i think . moreov , my cousin is alway around the commun of her church ( she is much religi ) to give her help to guid and educ children . in her blood and heart there is the forc to do thi . she say me she feel much better when she help the neighbour . i talk about some peopl i know , but i did n't say noth about myself . that 's whi i have never done someth for my commun . thi becaus i 've never had the occas , or becaus i do n't think to be abl to give help without noth in chang . i think that are veri admir peopl who do thi , but also that you must feel it . i could give some time to my commun for exampl clean natur park when the commun of my town organ the event of clean the citi . .. but i am sure i will forget it or i will decid do do someth els that day . .. that 's whi realli i do n't feel to give my time to the commun . .. i 'm not a good person like my friend . so it 's true , there are mani peopl like me who do n't spend enough time for the commun . it would be a better world if anyon would spend more of hi time for that . i think also that thi behaviour of peopl is not onli of nowday , it ha alway been so . but today there is more peopl who need help , also becous the number of old ( and so seek ) peopl is larger than some year ago
