have you ever been mislead by a tv or a web page advertis , and bought someth you were not completley statisfi ? i have , that is whi i beliv that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion , i think thi occur for simpl reason : peopl want to sell , and internet and tv make it easi . sell more mean win more money . acut , the purpos of advertis is to sell more , they do thi by make the pruduct attract . the thing is that there is a difer between advertis the product and trick peopl into buy someth that is not true . the sad part is that there is lot of peopl that are will to risk their reput in order to win more money . latley , buy through internet ha becom more and more popular . it is cheaper , easi , and you can do it right at home . the problem with on-lin and tv purchas is that you are unabl to see the object that you want to buy fisic . there are mani well known web-pag in which you know you will have no problem . for exampl , i bought the toefl test onlin , and reciv exactli what i bought . the problem come when you are deal someth less formal . for exampl , if you are plan a vacat and are plan to stay in a home and breakfast , you must check twice the place . the owner alway take the best pictur of their hous and even use photoshop . some time when the chang is so drastic that you feel that it is not the place you saw on your comput screen , so you feel deciv . all in all , i beliv that most advertis do make product seem better than they realli are . i beliv it is in their natur , sinc it purpos it to sell more . . i do not beliv that most advertis want to deciv peopl , but i strongli recommend not to buy onlin unless it is a recogn webpag .
