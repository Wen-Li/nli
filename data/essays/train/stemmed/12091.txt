some poopl in japan , where i live , disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . howev , i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help commun for the follow reason . first , school often say that young peopl have to spent their time stude . for exampl , my son studi at shudo highschool , a privat achool in hiroshima where locat western part of japan . he want to commun wiht our neighborhood . but , he alway have mani assign and can not attend a commun meetig . in japan , exam score are most import so young peopl have to studi hard to get high score . in consequ , young peopl have no time to help their commun . second , there are few commun in our neighborhood so if young peopl want , they can not spend thier time help their communitiew . for exampl , when i wa a junior highschool student there were mani commun around us and spent much time to help our commun . now , in japan , peopl often do not know who live in thier neighborhood . we do not know each other so there are few commun around us . becaus there are few commun , young peopl do not give enogh time to help their commun . if there were mani commun , young peopl would give enogh time to help their commun . terefor , i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
