i do n't believ thi question can be answer by ye or no . it all depend on the peopl , on the activ of these peopl and in the period they live in . in the industri revolut for exampl , you had to tri someth new to be success becaus the activ were chang . an activ in which one might have perform well suddenli got surpass and that person wa forc to chang hi activ . the peopl who made the right chang becam rich , other who had put their bet on the wrong hors becam poor . in the actual time both way are possibl to becom success . the first way would be to stick to someth you know you can do well , but you have to do it better than everybodi els . that usual is n't possibl without invest and the risk that go with it . so i think that , in most case , there is no success without take risk . anoth path to success would be to tri someth new . in that case the risk are usual higher , but if it wa the right thing to do , the reward are higher too . the difficulti here is that you have to get into the right thing at the right time . the advantag by tri someth new is that if the new thing doe n't launch off , you can still go back to what you can do well . if that happen you probabl wo n't get realli success , but you have tri . but to tri someth new is n't possibl to everybodi . to get into a new thing request the right idea and much braveri . most peopl stay in what they 're do , even if they 're unhappi , becaus they do n't have the gut to make a chang . in conclus i would say that the most import factor for success are braveri , to take risk ; luck , to be in the right activ at the right time , the charact to want to be better then the other and fantasi , to have the idea . of cours , you also need the skill to then lead your activ to success .
