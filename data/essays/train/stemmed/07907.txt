in my opinion , the main differ between understand and learn is that everyon is abl to learn someth but not necessari abl to understand it . for sure , in my point of view , the most import is to understand thing . it is the main featur which diferenti two student in term of intelig . i will explain whi in two point . firt , accord to my own experi in school , i can assum that it is realli easier to learn someth when you understand it than it is to learn it by heart . for exampl , if i tri to learn the econom theori of keyn , i will mayb succeed for the exam but for sure , 10 day later , i will be unabl to explain and to rememb it , otherwis , if i tri to understand how realli thi theori could be appli on the econom system and if i can use it on my own , then i will rememb thi theori for a longer period . moreov , for the exam , student are more and more ask to understand the concept and not onli to repeat them . second , what is the most import thing in the work area . my boss will not ask me to learn someth by heart . he will expect me to think and to develop idea . all peopl with high job in a compani , do not spend their time to learn fact but interpreat them in order to find solut . for those reason that i mention abov , i realli think that the most import is to understand concept . moreov , it is so gratifi for yourself when you understand someth veri hard and it is a personn reward .
