i would like to go with the idea that younger peopl can enjoy life more vividli than older peopl do . there are mani signific factor to support thi idea of younger peopl explor the life as much possibl as they can and how they go about life in a manner to have sweet memori for their rest of life . if i consid a teenag boy/girl , he/sh will be have vigor and enthusiasm to go out for parti and hang around with friend which account for their extrem extravag event which they can cherish later at somepoint in their lifetim after get older . older peopl may not have that much energi as the young peopl to do whatev they want . their physic health may not support their idea to enjoy even though they are veri much readi to enjoy . though enjoy doe n't come onli in physic form . they can also enjoy . older peopl will have to depend upon somebodi in their famili to go around explor life as they did when they are young . but thi may not be possibl alway as the other member in the famili will be have work and respons of their own such as take care of children , go to offic and prefer toward their own enjoy in life . as a result in some societi , the older peopl are be sent to retir home where they share their rest of life with their peer . but thi is not a good cultur as it deni the fact of be togeth in the famili . the older peopl can not enjoy their life as they feel alien from the societi which can worsen the situat . they should be regard as an import part of the societi as they love their famili member for whom onc they care and gave in all the possibl way for them to enjoy life . in my opinion , enjoy lie in one 's percept toward it . although younger peopl can enjoy life more than older peopl do , they can consid for older peopl 's enjoy by mingl with them as they get chanc to make the rest of older peopl 's life live .
