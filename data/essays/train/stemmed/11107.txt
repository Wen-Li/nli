the issu that in twenti year the number of car in use will rais or drop is difficult to deal with becaus there are differ argument involv . some peopl think that there will be fewer car becaus of the environment impact in wich the use of car is su . on the contrari the increas of the number of car in use can be partli justifi becaus the number of inhabit on earth is still rais veri fast . most importantli , reject co2 car are respons in a wide proport for the atmospher pollut . everi bodi know the consequ of a high grade of co2 in the atmospher ; warmer temperatur , climat chang and so on . so most of the govern , act for the well be of it citizen , are write new law and invent new solut tend to reduc the use of car . for instanc , in pari , dure the summer , onli the pair or unpair pattern number are allow to circul . secondli , we can stress the lack of petroleum or ga resourc today , and the rais of pump price . as car are big user of petrol , their utilis involv that car owner have the financi power to pay it . as the resourc are not etern and price are get higher and higher , it seem as an evid that the number of user will decreas in the next twenti year . anoth import argument would be that the automot industri is veri big enrgi consum . inde , to make a car requir lot of product such as platsic or iron wich consum a lot of energi to get in avail form . then the assembl chain , mostli compos by automat machin consum also a lot of energi . so , in the next year , govern will probabl realis that provid veri effic popular transport would have a good impact on the countri energi consumpt . to conclud , my strong belief is that even if the populatt is grow all around the world , the trend of environment legisl in the preval car use countri will be to decreas the product and the traffic of thi type of vehicl in the next twenti year .
