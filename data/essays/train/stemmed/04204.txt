life is full of divers , not onli of individu , but also of experi , subject and situt . at the same time , it is also full of uncertainti , noth is secur or grant ; which mean that no one know what is go to happen in the futur or what obstacl a person may encount in hi or her life . peopl alway have goal which are frequent base on their interest and belief . howev , much peopl tend to concentr onli in their interest and never acquir knowledg about other thing in life . for me it is veri import to have broad knowledg , to know someth about everyth in life , especi of academ subject . educ is the basi of opportun and the amount of subject in which a person ha knowledg condit hi or her opportun in veri import aspect of life like work and even help other . for exampl , if a person studi onli subject concern with scienc and he or she need to work and there is no work avail in a scienc area , but he or she know someth about busi then there is anoth possibl for work . at the same time if someon need help in someth about histori or even if there is a competit about histor fact you can be abl to particip or help the person even if you are a chef or a doctor . i think it is import to be prepar for everyth in life and to acquir the broad knowledg that will help you confront ani challeng especi in educ or work , which are basic for surviv . lament as the old say satet `` life is a box of chocol and you never know what ysometh happen unexpect and if you are not prepar to afront them you are not go to be abl to move on .
