some peopl agre that we should broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject and other peopl believ that it is better to have deep knowledg in one specif subject rather to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . both of these point of view have advantag and disadvantag . to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is veri import in our social life , on the one hand it would let the person to particip in convers where ever he is and with whom is talk , on the other hand it will let him understand what he read about those subject in newspap and what he hear about them in news . the disadvantag of thi is that he know onli some idea and ca n't go in deep when talk about a specif subject . to have a deep knowledg onli in one specif subject rather than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject have advantag that the person is veri understand what is go on in the detail of thi subject and that can let him to do research in thi field and mayb to help the societi if someth come up with him . the neg aspect of thi statement is that the person doe not know what is happen in other field and do n't have a good cultur which is requir in our dayli life . although , both of these statement have advantag and disadvantag , i do strongli agre that a person should join between these two statement and not onli tri to special in one specif subject but also to have broad knowledg in other academ subject .
