i do not agre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . in fact , i believ that these day young peopl feel more respons toward their commun and tri to contribut toward them . these day , becaus of the advent of faster and better mean of commun and transport , young peopl stay well connect with the world around . by mean of tv channel , internet etc , young peopl are more inform about what happen in their commun . thi awar , ha also made them more respons . for exampl , whenev some accid or a catastroph occur somewher then the news is spread veri fast becaus of the faster mean of commun . and one can see that there are sever young peopl who willingli provid help in such situat . they provid servic to the hospit , are readi to donat blood and what not . clearli enough , in thi case they are contribut a lot to their commun . the current young gener ha grown in an atmospher which is more free and liber than ever befor . they have alway experienc thi freedom of choos what they want to do . and so they also choos the kind of commun which they want to belong to and also in what way they want to connect to their commun . obvious when a work is done by free will and not by forc , it is done more willingli and in a more inspir way . so in thi case sinc whatev the young peopl do for their commun is done out of free will and not by forc , so they do it in a more inspir and dedic way . and henc they spend more time help out their communti . for exampl , these day young peopl have open up differ kind of commun center or group for help their commun or societi in differ way , for exampl center for anim right , center for educ for the poor and so on . all these group or center are made out of interest and motiv , and so the young peopl who work in it work with great devot and zeal which is clearli visibl in the amount of work such center do these day . so clearli young peopl these day are more inform , free and motiv and it clearli reflect in the amount of time they devot to help out their commun in their own way .
