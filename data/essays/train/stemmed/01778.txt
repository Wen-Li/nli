i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . to discuss it , i need to difin the mean of `` success peopl '' for me . success peopl are peopl who found out their mean of life . to discov it , the process of seek is neccessari . the process is the same as tri new thing . tri new thing take risk . i call peopl who are do same thing without take risk as `` unsuccess peopl '' . it is becaus they do not live their life thoroughli . they alreadi stop seek . it mean they are loos their chanc to find the mean of life . it is difficult to find out what is the best thing to do for them . therefor search it is veri import factor for thier success . for exampl , michael jodan , one of the most famou basketbal player in the world , wa use to be a basebal player when he wa a child . when he enter high school , he start to play basketbal . then he realiz it wa the best thing to do for him . howev , he wa not sure about he could becom a profession bascketbal player . but he tri it and made it . he retir alreadi , but everyon of basketbal fun remenb him vividli . anoth exampl is roger feder , no.1 tenni player in the world . like michael jordan , he also did not know he wa good at tenni until he becam a journior high school student . he wa not a strong player befor then . final , as i state abov , i believ tri new thing with take risk are import element for success peopl . life is not an easi thing . to succeed in the real mean , i have to keep serch the mean of it .
