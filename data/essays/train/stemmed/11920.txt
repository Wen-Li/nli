there are a lot of reason to support thi statement , but , in the other hand , there are also a lot of reason to show big disadvantag in thi type of knowledg . firstli , at the day of today , it 's veri import to have a good special in evri type of work . in fact more and more special are requir in job relat not onli to high tecnolog but also in all type of work , from offic worker to scientist . if you are special in your work you will reach better posit and certainli you will have a big pay . but there is also a big disadvantag in thi type of special . in fact in that way you often do n't know some import thing also relat to your work as a result of the type of studi that you have had . and there are a lot of situat in which onli a more larg view of the problem could solv it better than a special one . anoth big disadvantag is that it 's certainli better to have a knowledg of a wide rang of subject becaus it allow you to understand real societi and the real knowledg of human be . it is useless have a veri special understand of complex argument if you do n't understand all other thing . so i am convinc that with a broad knowledg of mani academ subject you can live in a better way , becaus you are realli awar of the societi that surround you . for exampl , have onli knowledg base on technic you do n't have cultur inform about art and literatur and so on . and , in conclus , the clever man is not the one that know all of someth , but the one that know someth of all .
