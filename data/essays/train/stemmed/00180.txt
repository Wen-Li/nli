thi philosoph question , to know who is enjoy the more life between young and old peopl , is a current one . an often answer is that older have more experi , and had to solv more problem , to recon each new hapi moment and enjoy it as it should . but , i do n't think so , becaus to my mind it 's onli a way to not be threaten by our futur . in my opinion , young peopl are quit naiv and not reali awar of their environn . for them everyday is a new one , they are n't bori accumul problem , their own are essentiali about their boy or girlfriend . .. moreov i think that a lot of older , like my grand-grand-moth , wa reali traumatish by the second world war . and , even if they did n't done it , their children to . becaus , in mani famili thi feel of constent threat and fear from the human genr wa quickli transmit from parent to children . but , nowaday , we could see that all over the world , young tri to make extrem action , like be violent , practic extrem sport , preaper atemotat , drinkng alcool and in mani other way . .. so can we say that yong are happi and enjoy life ? i reali do n't know . my final opinion would be that not more than the older . ..
