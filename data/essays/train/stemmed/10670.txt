when we come out the idea we can creat the idea and and the concept . sinc that we must care about the fact . as far as i am concern , i am strongli disagre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to lean fact . first of all , in real life , fact includ mani unfornseen troubl . the diffic fact will becom valuabl experi . they will tell us how to do it and what we need to do . the hard fact will allow us to endur hard time in the futur . it also provid mani inform for us to think deeper and more close to the real life . secondli , fact is veri import in the real life . even you can realat the idea and the concept , you can think that as well as you can , you still need to care about the fact . if the fact in the real life did n't work veri well . no matter the idea and the concept is well , the fact also play an import part in the real life . third , fact state the import posit between the idea and the concept . the fact can let the idea and the concept go through fluquent . without the fact , all the idea and the concept is empti . the fact will let peopl think deeper and more comprehens . it provid a broader rang for for peopl to explor it by themselv . all in all , i strongli state that for peopl to learn fact is more import for them to learn or underst idea and the concept . fact is so import that it play an veri import posit in the real life . it connect the idea and the concept to make it into real .
