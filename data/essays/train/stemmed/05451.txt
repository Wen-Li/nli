what is realli be young nowday ? we often talk of the problem creat by young peopl beak the law and respect noth and no one in the suburb . but it is not the major of young peopl . we talk less about quiet young peopl just tri to do their best in life and who do help their commun . thi lead to the last point , even for the one will to help , it is not alway easi to do so . they lack opportun and time . when we heard about young peopl nowday , what do we hear ? we hear about the law that were broken , the policemen that were attack , the car that were burnt . of cours it is a part of the problem but as it is often the case , the wors aspect is veri well known and mani peopl tend to forget that it concern onli a minor . so we should focu on the major of young peopl , the one we rare hear of . in univers or graduat school , there are club or group . these are about music , theater , art , sport , game but mani concern the help that can be given by student . for exampl , in the school i went to , there wa at least a dozen of such club . some student gave lesson to children , some got toy for poor children , some spent time to give food to poor peopl and some even went to india to build a school . these club were among the most popular one as mani student thought it wa normal to give an afternoon per week help those who need it . the last point i would like to develop is that , even it is alway possibl to say that the young one do not help their commun enough , it is not alway a question of lack of good will . when you are young , you are explain that you have mani respons , a huge number of thing to do in order to prepar your futur life . all these problem , that might seem easi to solv afterward , are difficult to face when you are young and without experi . they often leav littl time avail or no strengh to face someth els . the conclus could be that young peopl 's reput suffer from what is be said about a minor of them and that the other most certainli do what they can , even if it might not alway be enough .
