i complet agre with the statement . i think that the onli way to be success is to fix a target and , onc it ha been achiev , to move it forward and tri to get it again , even if there are a lot of possibl to drop . mani peopl think that the fortun ha a big role to the way of success and i agre with them but i also think that fortun kiss just few peopl . i also think that success ha not to be , alway , link to the money : there are a lot of good exampl of doctor who are , of cours , success person , but they are not rich as a big manag or owner of a multin compani . i also do n't think that success peopl are better than not-success peopl : there are peopl that natur tend to the success and other that judg their life good enough without ani kind of success . it happen that not-success peopl are happier than the other . i think i 'm a person who is forc to tend to the success : i do n't want a normal life as a lot of my friend have . i 'm fight everi day , fix target , sometim imposs to get , in order to be abl one day to say : `` ok , that ' s enough for me '' . i absolut do n't think to be better than the other , as i said befor , but i feel insid someth that push me forward everi singl day : it 's not a good sensat becaus there 's alway someth i have to do or to run for . after the univers , i move to china for work : it ha been a big chanc for meut a lot of my friend disagre with my chois becaus china wa too far and i did n't need to go there to have a job . the problem wa that i did n't want a normal job and it 's exacti what success peopl want : they want to do someth that is not common to other peopl in order to build a good career .
