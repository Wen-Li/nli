it is a well known fact that in nowaday societi , youth is thought to be the best age [ use of young peopl in advertis , thi willing to appear young , and so on and so far . .. ] howev i am convinc that be young is harder than be old and , therefor that older peopl enjoy life more than we do . in fact , it is a period of life in which we are worri . it is well worth mention that both in shool orient and in love we are total lost . we are stress by exam , think that it is too import for our futur to fail it , so we have constant pression , rel are anoth seami side of the question , they realli want us to succeed in life and want to be pround of us , such a respons for a young man , or a young woman . besid , we do not know ourselv , how can we know if thi boy , or thi girl is our soul mate ? shakespear said in '' all the world 's a stege '' that a period of life wa the lover one ; i deepli agre . from all thi thing we understand that be young is close to live in our mind , it stand for a life in which question are the privail activ . we have to build our personn , to know how to live by our own . then , we are like prisonn who can not do what we want to : we do not have enought money to provid for our need so we have to cumul both school , and job . with the issu of find a good job in our societi , most of student have to go through a work experi , and we can not help think of the futur . as a consequ we don not enjoy present and turn to what will happen then . as for me , be older is a sourc of seren , we have a job , a famili , good friend and are abl to keep be healthi with do some sport . travel around the world will be , eventu , a possibl thing . as strang as it can be for a woman of twenti year old , i want to be older soon .
