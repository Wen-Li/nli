some peopl disagre with the statement most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i guess the peopl are just lucki . most of the time the good look much better than they realli are . for instenc , when you go tri to tast a new menu of food , or when you buy fornitur . for the first exsampl , when you watch the advertis about the fast food on tv , it look flesh , and look homemad . howev when you tri the menu at the fast food restaur , the vesit is not flesh , and they do not tast the same as the tv sai . second , you see fornitur on the catalogu . they look veri gorgiou and beuti . howev when you go to the store to see the fornitur that were on the catalogu , they look so differ . they look cheap , the color is differ , and the shape are a littl differ . i think the display on the catalogu make them veri fasin . although most adveetis make product seem much better than they raelli are . they complim about the good too much on tv , and also they take veri good pictur of them .
