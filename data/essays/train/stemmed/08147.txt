i total disagre with the statement ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' , be in my youth at the age of seventeen i trulli feel my level or energi of enjoy is way greater than that of my uncl and aunt , but thi dose n't necessarili mean that peopl who are older do n't enjoy life . young peopl have differ kind of enjoy in life , as they have a lot of vigour , passion , aggress to do someth or to be someon and to enjoy life simultan , wherea older peopl have vigour , passion and aggress for other thing which do n't show as they have been through all the age , they use to enjoy life differ and now they enjoy life as they have attain most of their goal and dream . i would like to tell you about an exampl , my dream is to have a hous in australia for which i have to work hard , wherea peopl who have alreadi achiev thing are enjoy their life . there are differ type of enjoy life by young peopl and older peopl , i would certainli call river raftin , trek , play in the snow , watch movi etc. enjoy life to the fullest , wherea my dad and mom would call cruis , go to meuseum , go for classic music concert enjoy life . so there is a gener gap , but thi dose n't mean that my parent are enjoy life lesser than i am . it not about how much you enjoy it about how you enjoy life , and that can be same for young peopl as well as older peopl . young peopl have the time to enjoy life , wherea older peopl have less time to enjoy it , but all of thi depend on how much you are will to sacrific just to enjoy life . so at the end of the day you are just tri to enjoy life and not measur who actual enjoy more or enjoy less .
