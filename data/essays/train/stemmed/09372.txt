what i feel is it depend on the level of educ we are in , for exampl if we r in a under graduat stage it better to learn about variou academ subject when we come to graduat stage it better to studi the subject in which we want to special in futur at undergradu stage it good to learn all academ subject , we r never awar that how the other subject influenc us in futur for exampl myself be an undergradu student i wa ask to choos differ subject and i had a choic to studi both math and scienc and when i came to graduat stage my subject wa comput scienc and it is no were relat to physic and math but when i wa given a paper for my nasa project , math and scienc help me a lot to slove arthemat problem relat to problem slove in programm languag and next physic made me to slove some climat problem thi had a big impact on my paper present becaus i could do it veri quickli with out ani error and when a man reach to a gradut stage he should be special in onli one subject becaus the cours we do mainli deal with mani practic more over sinc it is the most crtical stage in our life becaus after tat we final end up in ani work , we dont continu our studi again so unless until if we r not master in the subject which we need to do it , then we will end up in a confus stage so what i strongli beliv is when we reach graduat stage we need to work strongli on the subject we choos , tat lead us to work for a good compani , it like jack of all art and master of none it a famou quot it say tat be jack in all art is wast than master in one art thi will strongli support my statement when come to student who r do graduat so the peopl who r undergradu can work on all subject , but when it come to the matter of graduat we need to master just one special subject .
