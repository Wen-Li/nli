i believ that is better to have a strong knowledg about a specif subject , rather than a superfici and wide one of lot of academ theme . i 'm go to explain my reason use a person exampl : my academ choic . in itali there are two type of univers : - one type is for the student that have a clear idea of what they want to do in their live . if you studi medicin , that mean that you want to becom a doctor ; if you studi law , it mean that you want to becom a lawyer ; - the other is for the peopl who doe n't know exactli , or at all , what to do . for exampl , scienc of commun give you broad knowledg about mani subject : literatur , psycholog , busi , art etc ... , but doe n't prepar you for anyth in particular . i chose to studi public relat , which is veri similar to scienc of commun , becaus i did n't know exacli what i want to becom . well , at the end of my carreer , after my graduat i ask myself : '' and now ? '' i realiz that have lot of knowledg about noth is absolut useless . i had mani interview , but i did n't exacli know what i want from that job . the truth is that i did n't know anyth specif . thi is whi i decid to forc me to understand what i realli want to do , and , onc i realiz that i want to work in event , i appli for a master , that would 've gave me all the knowledg and the compet i need to face the real world . i think that all the high school should help more the student to understand which is the best job for them , not to make the mistak that lot of peopl do : attend a univers random , that give gener knowledg , but noth concret .
