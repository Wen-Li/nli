i do not agre the opinion of the statement . i think there is an advantag to a person who ha one specif subject rather than a person who ha broad knowledg . if a person ha broad knowledg , of coures it is better htan limit knowleg . but a parson who onli ha broad knowledg seem miss directon of life . thi is my feel from my ecperi . whithout aim of util hi knowledg , even if the lnowledg is wide , knowlegd doe not make sens in hi life . on the other hand , a person who special one specifif subject seem that hi vision of sutudi is much more clear . even if the studi is just a fun , consentr on a one topic interest in will have much more oportun to make brake through of new vision . some peopl may say , special somethin is not flexibl , but i think for anybodi experi of effort made in the process and feel of achiev to be special are veri valuabl , univers and applil to other field . my point is that , specal in academ is like a backborn of studi attitud . and to improv of pepol life , special is more import .
