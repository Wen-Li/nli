i disagre with the statement . travel around the world is an experi that give you the opportun to open your mind and develop new point of view . travel is not alway connect with as much inform you can add to your knowledg , travel is more than that ! it 's connect with emot . a new trip is like a new person in your life . you can imagin how could be thi relationship if it 's led by someon els , a guid ! you can not plan in advanc exactli what you are go to receiv from someth that you do n't know yet . of cours you have to make a plan of your trip especi accord with your time and budget avail , but it 's alway import have the opportun to chang if you find someth that you do n't enjoy . a guid may be useful for old peopl , becaus they have no more the energi to organ all the trip . and travel with other peopl can be an opportun to feel more secur . the sens of freedom for me is import . it 's a wast of time wait for other decis . i want travel alon is also cheeper , becaus you can choos your own
