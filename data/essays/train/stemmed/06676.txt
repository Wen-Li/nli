i disagre with thi statement . i believ that there is a better chanc in have a success career for a person when that person special in one specif subject rather than have broad knowledg of mani academ field . as i write thi essay , i would like to explain to the reader whi special in a certain field is a good idea . eventhough it is import to have wide rang of knowledg , it would be pointless if you do not know how to use them wise . your knowledg from differ field could spread out all over the place and lead you to noth . that is the last thing you would like it to happen . for exampl , learn differ kind of languag . you know basic greet and could understand typic everyday convers in five differ languag might make you feel smart . howev , you would not be abl to do busin in those languag becaus you do not have enough knowledg of that languag . in other word , you can not have a carreer use those knowledg . in conclus , i would like to strongli state that to be special in one specif subject would help lead you to have a success carreer . in other word , a brighter futur . the more knowledg you have , the better . howev , the import point here is how you are go to use that knowledg in your life .
