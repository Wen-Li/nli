i agre to the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are three reason to support my opinion . first of all , especi where i live in japan the popul is get smaller everi year . some peopl estim that the popul would be half in the futur . of cours , when the popul get smaller , peopl who use car will be decreas . second of all , the focu on the environ is get bigger everi year . without doubt , the fossil fuel that car give to the air are veri bad to the environ . so i think that the use of car would be restrict intern in twenti year . lastli , it is more danger to use car than to use train . the number of the traffic accid increas , so peopl might get to think that they should use train to move becaus it is much less danger than to use car . for those reason , i definit agre to the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
