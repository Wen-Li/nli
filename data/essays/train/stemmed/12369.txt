when student have to prepar a test they studi on note they took at lesson and read the book to well learn the topic . we can split two method to learn , one use the fact and one use the idea and the concept . mainli student at first learn the fact , in fact is more easi for a person store a fact than understand a concept , but sometim it is not enough to be well prepar for a school test . sometim is ned to know the idea and the concept who are back on the fact , they are more difficoult to learn becous the person can understand and compar the main idea of the fact just onc a person well know the fact , . i think that is more import for student to undersdtand the idea and the concept than it is for them to learn the fact becous if you know the idea and the concept it mean you well know the fact , and sometim if you forget the fact you can rememb the idea and than rememb the fact . anyway , in some particoular situat is better know the fact than understand the idea and the concept , it appen rare for me , for exampl when i am delai with my studi and i have a veri few time befor a test , so i need to studi the topic as fast as is possibl for me . for someon it is a common way to studi but i think when a person store just the fact he will be not abl to rememb it in a larg scale time , becous the human 's memori is more abl to store idea and concept than it is abl to store fact for long time . a person exampl is what i learn in the past when i wa a child , i well rememb the idea and the concept but i realli ca n't rememb the fact , it can be just a characterist of my mind so it mean that my idea is wrong for anoth peson .
