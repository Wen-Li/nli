take risk and tri the new thing are the most import key that are go to open the door of the success to us . success is match with risk and the experi . if there is no risk , there is no success . success is like a fish that as long as we tri hard to catch it and take a risk of drop in the sea and to tri new method to accomplish , there is no way to miss it . i would like to express my opinion with one proverb in turkish that the peopl who are not brave enough to take a chanc are go to stay the place where they are without move on while the peopl who tri mani new thing by take risk are go to reach the top of the success . without tri , there is no way to learn and it is not possibl to find out if we are on the right track or not . for exampl , my father like to play safe rather than to take a risk . he is so afraid to fail . as a result of thi , he ha been stand the same place where he is . he wa go to open a restaur coupl of year ago he wa almost done with the process but then he chang hi mind and he did not put in a practic . becaus , he wa afraid to fail and go down . now , he ha been work for someon and he is not happi at all . if he had open the restaur at the time that he got a chanc , now we may have been well-off . addit , now he regret that he did not take the chanc that wa offer to succeed . there is a say that `` use it or lose it '' and he lost it . all in all , if there is no risk , there is no success . if we want to be call as a success person and not to regret and not to say `` i wish '' later on in our life , we should tri new thing and take risk without be afraid in order to accomplish .
