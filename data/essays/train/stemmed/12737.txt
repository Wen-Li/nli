i think that it is more import for student to understand idea than it is for them to learn fact , and i will take a controversari exampl , which is histori . first , when you learn histori , it is import to be abl to give their rel import to the differ fact . for exampl , it is imposs to understand differ fact of french polit life , such as the popular front , without ani idea of what the left and the right mean . moreov , sometim idea happen to inform realiti . it would be absurd to learn a factual histori of the ussr or the histori of the cold war without ani idea of what commun is . more profoundli , there is no discours about fact without an interpret of the fact . nietzsch and , more recent , michel foucault have explain that all the fact are construct . there are no `` natur fact '' that we should examin without a theori . even the select of the fact reveal an idea of what is import and what make histori . econom provid us with countless exampl of theori that are necessari to explain fact , and even to construct them . howev , it doe to mean that there is no escap to gener relativ , and that there is no necess to learn fact . it is import to cast light on the hypothesi that are made in econom as well as in histori , but it is also import to give some inform about the fact . at the same time as they improv their critic view , student should be abl to learn precis fact . to take anoth time the exampl of histori , the chronolog is veri import : it would not make sens to explain the facism think that it occur befor world war i. as far as econom is concern , it is import to test empir econom theori to demonstr that they are use to understand real econom relat .
