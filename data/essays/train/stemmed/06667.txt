it is more impot for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact i m agre with thi fact becaus if a student just go for learn the matter he/sh will never abl to understand the thing . in order to answer a question a student must have to understand the question , becaus sometim teacher did't go for straight forward question they would chang the languag of it . so student get confus , if concept is clear than he/sh can answer but if the concept is not clear than he would not abl to answer . it is veri essenti to understand the idea of the topic becaus if u have some idea about that topic than u can write some point about it . and it 's also better to clearfifi the concept of the topic becaus mani of the time teacher will go for the indirect question , eg.if a indirect question came the studunt who learn the thing will not be abl to answer but if the student have understand the idea and concept is clear thea the student would be abl to give good answer than the student who just learn the thing . anoth one of the good exampl is math student . math is one of the tricki subject . in math some question are veri easi to do , but in some question student must have to use it 's own tricki mind . some question just requir a formula to solv the question but in some two or more than two formula 's can be use to solv the problem which can be done by a student whose who understand the question and whose concept is clear , if thi type of question is given to student who just learn the fact he/sh will not abl to answer becaus that student will use to solv that question by use just one formula which is not possibl . so i think it is more import to underst the concept than to learn fact .
