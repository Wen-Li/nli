if it is more import for student to understand the idea of a topic or to learn fact can be seen from differ point of view . there are posit and neg side in both way . understand the idea and concept of a topic often make it easier for student to learn . they do not have to studi as much . mani peopl think that thi way of understand is more import than learn fact . of cours you have to understand the idea to be abl to understand the whole but topic but a topic can be too complex and contain too mani detail . a veri import accpect is also how a teacher explain a problem . some teacher are not abl to teach and student are often confus by their theori . other teacher are realli good and everybodi understand the concept . but if a teacher is not good you have to studi on your own which often mean to just learn the fact . it also depens on the topic given . if student have to studi for histori for exampl it is often enough to just learn the fact but on the other hand stude for physic or math need the understand of the concept . some subject you can not learn , you have to understand them . anoth point is that peopl are differ and that peopl learn differ . some student understand the idea and are so abl to understand or realiz the other part of a topic . other student do better by learn the fact , by read thing over and over again they eventu get the whole concept . all in all both theori are necessari to understand a problem fulli . understand the idea can help learn the fact and learn the fact can help understand the problem . in my opinion wether understand the concept or learn the fact depen on a topic is better is better , i could not choos becaus for me it alway depens on the topic or the problem . sometim i need to learn the fact and on other occat i understand the idea and it help me to succeed .
