`` play it safe. '' is the thing we often hear from our famili , friend and from other peopl . we see mani peopl regret about their past , for they live in a routin and never took the chanc they had just becaus they thought it wa riski . it is well known that the richest man in my countri wa broke and homeless in hi childhood . to me , take risk is the main gate to success and happi in your life , sinc that may be onli chanc for you to make your futur dream come true and not to regret in your prospect life . in three month , i will receiv my diploma and becom a physician . the tendenc of medic graduat is to specil on a clinic branch and practic privat . i have not appli for the graduat exam yet and i will not , instead i am appli for a research scholarship in japan and plan to complet a doctor cours there . it is obviou that it will be more challeng and time consum , but i think that onc i receiv a degre in japan , a door to studi abroad academ will be open . but the door may permenantli be close ; too . i am act in an unorthodox way ; but as robert frost say : `` i took the one less travel by , and that made the differ . '' `` if onli i had the chanc ... '' , `` i wish i could use thi chanc ... '' are the word i never intend to use and in my opinion , regret is the worst feel one can ha in hi life . time pass by and there is no chanc to revers it . the onli thing that one can do is to anchor to that chanc and go for it no matter how riski the situat is , so that he will not find himself in a routin life and he will never experi the feel of regret . not to feel regret in ani of the step of your life is actual what i perceiv from the word `` peac '' . in summari , i can say that take risk is the main tast of life that lead to success and the sourc of happi hide in a mind that ha no idea of regret about the past .
