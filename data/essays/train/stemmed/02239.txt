the fact that most concept and idea lead to a fact make me agre with the previou statement . when i wa a child , most of the fact were explain to me as : `` that is the way it is '' . that is whi i saw the world veri big at that time . grow up through year to reach thi level , know so mani thing make me wonder about that say . actual from my studi in the univers , i found that most the fact that were not explain by thier concept are strang thing . we usual start with idea and conceot to reach such fact that no one can say it is wrong or there is an adoubt about it . for our brain , the fact that we can not explin is not worth to think about . thi thing is invalid for ginou pepol . an exampl of what i wrote so far , if we consid the earth with it circular shape came from the believ that we can cross the world from east to west . but know one can explain whi the peopl in the sothern region of the earth do not feel that they up side down . thi exampl show how idea and concept will yeild to fact and how fact sometim can not be explain . final , when the studet concentr on the idea and concept he will learn the abil how to match the fact togath . on the other hand , if the student focu on the learn the fact he will learn the abil to memor the event which is not a charact of thi gener good learn . a match between them will be better although i consisit that know idea are more use than learn fact .
