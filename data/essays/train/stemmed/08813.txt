some peopl tend to say and believ that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their communit . in my personn point of view , it is a fals statement , becaus nowaday we see more and more young envolv in the public concern , and mani new associ establish by and for young creat . and i have a personn experi as a young women work with sever associ that are mainli compos by young , and we tri to do social work by help poor children in their studi , by tuitor them , collect fund to buy schoolbag , book , copybook for them , we have even convinc a rich club ` rotari club ' to sponsoris a whole day in the swim pool for 200 kid . and i know mani other associ do realli great work especi by youth , not onli in my countri but all over the world . in anoth hand they may be some young who are not interest in help their commun , and who just foccu on entertain them selv , but it doe not mean that it is a gener situat , and i think that it ha been the case in all the era : they have alway been awar young who face the problem their commun are have and who tri to solv them , and other young who just do not care . final , i think that what lead to thi misunderstand , is the gap that appear between the gener , becaus everi previou gener tend to idealis it youth and is not satisfi with the new gener behavior , just becaus it is not on their way , while the adult should understand that time chang and so mental , and they should tri to help young to find out how to help their commun by their own way , not the way they want them to act .
