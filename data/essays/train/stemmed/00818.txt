i would agre the observ that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid if i have to select either `` agre or disager '' . the reason whi i can not clrearli express my observ is that it depend on the situat such as the countri or the length of the stay . though mani young peopl may also think the free travel better , i prefer to travel freeli if possibl sinc i do not have to care about a tour member regard a meal , appoint time or place to go and i can go everywher i would like to go . in thi regard , if the tour member wa consist of onli my freind , it did not matter . howev , when i travel in a counti where i can not commun with local peopl by myself due to languag reason , i am reliev to accompani with a tour guid . in addit , if the length of the time to stay in a countri is limit , i think that it is benefici for me to be guid by a tour guid to know the locat or way to stay rather than to struggl to know it by myself . of cours , i can get these merit by hire my person guid . but , from my experi , it is difficult to find a good person guid as well as expens compar with a tour guid . due to the abov reason , the best way to travel for me is to do in a group with a tour guid in the first day of the trip and after that , i would like to travel freeli without care about other tour member . also if i have to select either travel in a group or alon , i will take travel in a group led by a tour guid .
