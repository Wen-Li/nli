i have mix feel about the statement `` mostli advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . not all ad are same . they may be made to lure the peopl for purchas the product but may be educ and of help too . advertis are alway made fansi and appeal for pull attent of the gener public make them awar about the presenc of particular product in d market . but at time when the product are not advertis it never reach the custom even though they are there in the market . i can suggest the abov view by the follow eg : my mother alway use to complin thi creepi sensat in her leg which would keep her from sleep at night , we did everyth even went to the doctor but he also could not help her much , till the time i saw thi advertis on the tv for restless leg syndrom and a specif medicin for cure it . i went back to see the doctor , spoke about it , got that medicin prescrib to mother and now she ha much better relief . so in short i can say that an advertis educ me and help my mother . they can be deciv too like if it say for eg that a particular will remov all ur scar or mark it may not be complet true though it may help to some degre . in the end i would like to conclud by say that advertis are basic made to market a product but it total depend on the the wish of the consum whether to buy one or not . so be an intellig buyer and make smart choic , never buy anyth by just see the ad but buy onli when u have reseach about it and are convinc to go for it .
