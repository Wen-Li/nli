i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact , i believ that in ani matur market , thi embellish of the truth on the part of the advertis is inevit . it all begin from the fact that usual , most compani do n't have the luxuri of be in a product space where they have a monopoli . thi mean that they are contin compet with each other to sell their product . thi mean that they have to constantli innov to tri and make a better product . but the innov doe n't stop just at the product , it continu into the sell stage and that 's where advertis come into the pictur . now in an ideal world , an advertis would be indistinguish from the specif of the product . a compani would just state the featur of the product in a technic accur manner and let the buyer decid . unfortun , in the real world , usual , the buyer is a human be , which mean that he most probabl doe n't have the time , patienc or even at time the expertis to make a decis base on just the specif . thi mean that the inform provid to the buyer need to be summar into simpler and easili digest form . it is thi gap between the real specif and the inform provid to the custom that advertis realli becom an import tool in boost sale . thu while summar the inform , advertis give the compani the opportun to smooth over the defect and accentu the good qualiti of the product . to take an analog , the same way make-up enhanc a woman 's beauti , advertis enhanc a product 's appeal . also , consid that onli that much can be done to improv sale on the product side ( for exampl , how much innov can realli be done in a tooth-brush ? ) after some time , advertis are left as the onli viabl altern to push sale . and onc one compani start advertis , the other have to natur follow which soon degener into a rat race of who can bend the truth more . therefor , one end up with ` new-improv ' shampoo where the onli thing that ha been improv is the label , health equip which can make you lose weight almost instant , and tooth-past which can land you that dream-job or man .
