i agre to that statement . becaus young peopl have more power than older peopl but they have no experi . and young peopl do not know how to use their energi wise . so they behav which they want to do . most of that is playng . but i 'm not sure that playng out side , danc and play video game are enjoy their life . there 's few peopl that work hard is enjoy their life . young peopl have not to work earn money , they onli know about spend money . but older peopl have to make money , most of them have famili . they have to make money and save them . so older peopl know that enjoy life when they are adult is go to bankrupt . but young peopl do not have to worri about that . studi is the biggest enemi of young peopl , but mani of them do not know if they studi hard , they can enjoy life more than young peopl . when i go to the shop mall or someth like that , there are mani young peopl more than older peopl . some young peopl spend more money than older peopl , play a lot , and have a parti with their friend . but mani older peopl think that enjoy life is not bad for young peopl so they let their children play . but if older peopl have the time like young peopl they might be enjoy their life like young peopl . older peopl want to enjoy their life . there are mani older peopl that enjoy their life . young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl , but i wish young peopl studi hard dure the childhood and enjoy their life when they becom a success man . it is better than play dure the childhood and becom fail about their job . i saw mani wise peopl that studi hard , do not play and be a success .
