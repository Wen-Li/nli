along with the develop of mass media and mass cultur came the develop of advertis , help to creat what is call `` the consum societi '' . advertis is suppos to make you buy a product , it is a messag that make the product appeal so that you buy it . in order to do so , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it is a veri common experi to be disapoint by what you just bought . i just bought an mp3 player becaus it look great on the advertis but i discov that it doe not work with mani comput . thi is the time when one say `` it look so much better in the commerci '' . advertis are not to be blame for that becaus it is their veri purpos : to make you buy . in order to do so , it ha to show what is best in the product . it is veri rare to see a commerci that will ill-speak of a product . it doe exist and it is call `` neg public '' but even thi is a form of advertis . most of the time an advertis will just focu on what is great about a product . if advertis sometim make product seem much better than they realli are , advertis are not allow to lie about the product . if they do , the advertis compani can be su for `` fals advertis '' . that mean that an advertis never realli lie but just show the product in a way that make you want to buy it . have realiz that it is the veri role of advertis to show product under their most appeal appear , perhap one should consid the consum 's respons . inde one should not alway take for grant what is said in a commerci . it is hi respons to use hi critic sen and not be misguid by advertis . thi is a lesson i learn the rough way !
