there are a lot of larn style . depend on the purpos , the lean style would be differ . each person ha differ poit of view ; howev , in my opinion , i agre that to understand idea and concept is more import that to learn fact for student . i believ that the import poimt of learn is how we can use that knowledg in our life . if we ca n't use the knowledg practicali from studi , it is no mean . i think that to understand idea and concept will help to use the knowledg more effici way . first reason for my opinion is that we can learn a lot of thing more deepli from understand idea and concept . for exampl , when i learn histori , if i think about the reason and concept , such as whi our ancestor had a war or whi they made a the low , i can learn a lot of thing from the past . i believ that such a knowledg would be help to choos for the futur . the second reason for my opinion is that it is more easi to memor . for exampl when i studi to enter univers , i just memor a lot of knowledg such as histor date or vocabrari , howev i forget these knowledg easili . i believ that if i did n't think about connect about fact , it is easi to forget and such a knowledg will be patent knowledg . if we think that we better use our knowledg more practic way , i think to understand idea and concept is necessari . from understand these thing , our knowledg will be use usu thing .
