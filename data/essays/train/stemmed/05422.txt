in my opinion , it is more import for student to understand idea and consept than it is for them to learn fact . i have some reason to support my opinion . first reason is student can not learn fact if they do n't understand basic idea . for exampl , if student are studi about world war , they studi whi the war happen , how mani countri were in the war , what wa happen afrer the war and so on . then , student start learn the detail fact such as how did peopl live dure the war , what kind of strategi did each countri have . second , if student have understood idea and concept , they can easili guess more detail fact . for instanc , student can guess peopl were forc to join the war if student have knowledg what is war . to understand idea and concept can help student guess fact . also , it is easi for student to aim their goal if they understand idea and concept . if student make some robot , they need to build robot accord to the manual say , how to build the robot . on the process of build the robot , student recogn some fact that the robot ' part are need to add some oil in order to let robot move more smoothli . like thi exampl , student can build robot becaus they read the instruct . if studet follow the instruct , they will be awar of more inform such as ad some oil . of cours student can make robot without ad some oil , but their robot might move slowli or even be unabl to walk . in conclus , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus : to learn fact , student must understand the idea ; student can guess fact if they understand the idea ; it is easi for student to aim the goal if they know the idea and concept . these three are the reason .
