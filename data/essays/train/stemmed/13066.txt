student all around have to obtain learn facil . but it vari from a person to anoth the way they should obtain thi inform . i agre that it is more import for a student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact due to alot of main point that support my decis . and it is support with futher explain throught out my essay . for student to learn the fact they are provid with . it is veri easi for them to forget the inform later on . the student do have a rate of accept for inform , if he/sh can not be abl to understand the idea these fact are base on , they simpli are forgotten by time . anoth point to discuss is the amount of pleasur takin in when the student is reciev thi inform . it is veri dull and bore for a person to sit and accept alot of idea into hi head and simpli just memoris them . it is more fun to understand the concept , discuss it and then understand it so that it would not becom temporari . student should be reciev inform in an orderli manner . for exampl a physic class , it start off wid introduc the topic and then orient the student to the type of inform in thi cours so they are abl to understand the idea and concept faster . rather than give then the formula and let them memoris these fact and tri to solv on their own . it is veri conveni for a student to understand first and then tri to work the rest out by himself . the last and main point is , that understand the inform enhanc the student self confid . for exampl , if the student is ask about a specif topic he could easili recal it and explain it from hi understand rather than recit what he learn befor . i agre that it is more import for a student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact becaus as i mention befor it is easier , it is no temporari and mainli it is enhanc self confid .
