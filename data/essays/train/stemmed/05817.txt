in my opinion i am not complet agre with these sentenc . there are mani reason in order to support thi thing , and other in order to destroy thi . the thing that support thi teori are , in my opinion , that in the futur mani peopl will think about theyr own healt and accord with thi , for istanc , they will go to work by walk , by their feet . in some citi , for exampl in own town , in order to prevent the use of the car the gover , everi sunday , keep out of the centr everi form of car and bu , if you want to go to the centr you can go onli by walk or by bike . in my opinion thi is one of the reason for the situat of the presenc of few car . anoth thing that can support thi opinion is the use of pubblic transport , in fact if you want to go to work in a citi like milan or rome it is a good thing will go by bu or by train or also by tram ( where is possibl ) , in thi way you could arriv to your work earli becaus you do not spend some time in the traffic and the travel should be better becaus you will jump the noisi and the same traffic . but on the other way there are more reason that destroy thi teori . in my opinion the use of the car are more confort that the use of pubblic transport , for istanc , when i go to my univers it is better for my to go with my car becaus i have a park near my colleg , if i go with the bu or walk with my feet the time to arriv to my campu will be more than if i go with my car . sometim mani peopl work in place where is imposs to arriv with pubblic transport and for thi reason they think that it is more comfort to use their own car . these thing support the idea that in the futur will be use mani car . for thi reason i am not completli agre with the teori in which in the futur will be fewer car than thare are today becaus there are more reason that support thi idea and more that destroy it .
