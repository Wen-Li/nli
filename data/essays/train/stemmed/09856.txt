i mainli agre with that statement . i think it is obviou that advertis make product seem better than they realli are , becaus thi is what advertis are there fore . the aim of advertis is to make peopl buy the product . to succeed best in thi , advertis have to make the product seem as good as possibl . now it is clear , that with some technic support , it is quit easi to make a product seem better than it actual is . for examl , advertis often use veri bright and shine color , but if you compar the product with the pictur , the real color are much more ` normal ' . furthermor , advertis often use graphic , tabel or word that appear scientif to make the product seem more special , but if you know a bit about the fact display , you realiz that they onli tell veri common thing ani other similar product also ha . apart from make the product seem better , advertis also use psycolog mean to make peopl buy the product . especi , they often tri to implicitli convey a messag without let the custom realli be conciou about it . for exampl a laugh person on a photo make peopl think use thi product make them happi . or they tri to make it plausibl to peopl that they absolut need thi product becaus they belong to a certain groop . so advertis often specialis to reach a distinct group of peopl like young parent , elderli women or middle-ag men . howev , i think , sometim advertis can also help to make a new product known or to inform peopl about special qualiti a specif product ha and how it can serv them . from a custom 's point of view , i think a middl way is best : one should not complet mistrust advertis becaus they can realli draw one 's attent to someth use , but on the other hand one should neither trust them blindli . from my experi i think it is best to either tri the product , so you know if you want to buy it again or not , or ask someon who ha alreadi tri it for advic .
