i defin agre with the statement that it is import to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact for the reason below . first , understand concept can lead one to more profound inform while onli learn fact can onli be just know fact . becaus just like tree , under the big concept branch grow . thi idea appli everi subject peopl studi . for exampl , when learn histori , peopl can possibl say `` hitler caus the world war ii. '' which is true , but in thi situat we do not know whi hitler did . howev if one say hitler caus the world war ii becaus german were so overwhelm with the treati of versail and germani want to show that they are power , it will make more sens , and it will be more easier to understand it as well . second , understand concept can save larg amount of time . for student , use their the time properli is veri import . break their time wise can make their life easier and sometim they even determin their success as well . in my opinion understand concept instead of learn fact is more product way of studi . as i mention abov , understand concept not onli lead to more inform but also lead to know the fact faster . onc , i had friend who did not spend much time on stude but get better grade , and who wa so struggl with their studi and spent great chunk of time , but did not get a good grade on it . and i realiz that their approach to the topic wa differ . the smart one wa tri to get the big pictur of it while one wa tri to see the small part of it . when draw a pictur , peopl measur and sketch it first instead of draw detail . becaus if not , the whole structur collaps . for those reason , it is veri import to see and understand the big concept rather than learn fact .
