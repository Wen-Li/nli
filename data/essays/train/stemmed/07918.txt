whether to be a person who is equip with plenti of knowledg from all kind of academ subject or just to be a professor in one field is not a straighforward issu . everyon keep a unic opinion on it . while it come to me , i would say that to be a professor is more benefici . first of all , peopl should save their energi from obtain knowledg from all categori of field , which doe good to our advanc educ . energi , just like time for human , is limit . with these limit energi , one can do what he or she like to do . but , onc distribut to too mani subject , peopl ca n't be a professor in a certain field . for exampl , we know that teacher in the element school can teach almost all the cours that are provid . howev , if the child grow up and enter a colleg , no one can be respons for all the class . what he or she need is a professor who know a lot in a particular subject , not a teacher with mani knowledg from differ subject . in addit , peopl with a great number of knowledg in some special field help solv the social problem . take the develop of scienc reseach for an exampl . without the technolog brought by scienc research , we ca n't live such comfort live today , we will still suffer from the deseas , hungri and disast . without scienc research , we ca n't explain natur phenomenon and the secret of the univers . nevertheless , who are mostli respons for these research ? they 're our scientist , most of whom are expert from differ field . admittedli , to acquir as much knowledg as possibl from differ subject is advis , becaus it can help peopl to know the world outsid us as a whole pictur . nevertheless , to have as much knowledg as possibl in a certain field can benefit ourselv much more . to sum up , i think it is better to obtain much knowledg in one particular subject .
