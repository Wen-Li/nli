the world we are live in is a global and competit one , as economi have come closer to each other , produc and consum are growingli becom part of one singl global market . good and servic can now be offer through out the world with veri littl barrier and similar technolog avail to almost everi produc . therefor , product are becom increasingli difficult to be differenti . in order to differenti , produc look for the objet and subject qualiti that can make the product uniqu or distinct , and then they must commun these qualiti to it potenti consum , mainli through advertis . so everi day we face endless promis of how good and special a product can be , some time appeal to the object qualiti or the subject qualiti , or perhap a combin of both . i consid thi is to be fair right that produc have in order to succeed in thi competit market . the statement that fals promis are made by produc is rather unfair , sinc mostli it refer to the subject qualiti of the product . in the end , it will alway be the custom choic to purchas the product base on hi or her person prefer . let consid the exampl of a car advertis where they first explain the specif of the engin and technic featur . thi is are mostli objet qualiti , and the produc ha the respons of be truth , actual , fals claim are not onli illeg but also harm to the manufacur long term success . on the other hand , when they explain the subject element that will make you buy the car , they are appeal to your person tast , which will be the judg of how good or not the car is , leav no room for seem to be what it is not . in conclus , i must disagre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are , sinc it is found on the premis that the advertis could be liabl for differ in judgement on subjet matter .
