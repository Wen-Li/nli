i do agre with the statement that the number of car would reduc in year to come and they will be fewer than the present in twenti year from now , but restrict to the develop countri . the number would be on the rise in develop and poor countri . in the develop countri that are alreadi at a stage where there is a car for everi individu ( adult ) and the pollut and traffic is at their peak there would be awar about the vehicular pollut and trafic discomfort that lead to citizen opt to other cost effect and environment freiendli mode of transort like the public transport system , metro , buss etc. that will sure reduc the use of the person car . the inform technolog , boom in comput technolog all these lead to reduct in the movement of men , where the work can be finish direct from one place . all these event might result in the usag of fewer number of car and effect transport system in twenti year from now . but thi is not the case with other part of the world , the poorer countri the develop countri where the possess of car is synonym with high social statu and the person vehicl is still a luxari . for exampl if in the develop countri ther is a car in everi home then in other countri with far more greater popul there would be a car in everi 10 home . thi is veri much true atleast in countri like india . in such countri there will be a big boost in the number of car own by the individu and it will then peak in the tweni year from now . it would take a minimum of 20 year for countri like india to reach the posit where the us present is . not onli will the number of car will be on the rise but also the transport system will improv further incres the effici of travel and indirectli the number of car in use . henc twenti year from now the situat of the number of car and transport system would depend on the place consid . but univers the number of vehicl will be lot greater than the present number .
