learn fact and understand idea and concept are the differ way of learn and they also need differ kind of attent . i am a univers student and i prefer learn fact rather than understand the idea and concept . i said they have differ kind of attent and first i want to explain thi . when you tri to understand idea and concept you gener spend more time . you should cover whole issu to understand it . most professor tri to use thi method and while come the import point of issu they are talk a lot . in my opinion , they are give unneceseri knowledg . howev , if professor just give the import part of the subject than student may understand better and it would't take much time than talk about unnecessari thing . the second import thing that we should talk about is that the human brain can also concentr 25-30 minut at all . that 's whi on the 35th minut of lectur the student start to daydream while the professor just come the most import part of subject . if teacher want to teach better , they should stop talk and tri to cover the whole idea . i insist on just give the import part of issu and then start to cover the subject while solv problem or debat for exampl . thi is more succesful way to teach and more conveni for student , too . to sum up , i total disagre the way of undertand idea and concept . that is a less of time and time is more import that student . teacher should use time conveni and just give the student the import part not the whole of the subject .
