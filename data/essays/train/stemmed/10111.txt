when i talk to older peopl , for exampl to my grandpar , they give me the advis to alway enjoy everi hour of my life as thi time will never be given back to me . also , they say that i should enjoy life while i 'm still young as i have more possibl - mayb not financi , but regard my health and the time i have . i 'm still veri young , at the begin of my twenti to be exactli , and , ye , so far i realli enjoy life . howev , lack the person eperi of how life chang and how one actual enjoy life when be older , make thi question hard to answer . to answer thi question , i 'd like to look at the thing which chang when a person is older . one of these thing is respons . as a child , i did n't have the feel of be respons for anyth . without be worri about other person ( as my parent were with me , for exampl ) , i could enjoy life more effortlessli . also , becom older mean to be face with other problem . as a child or teenag , i wa not realli worri about the question of how to earn my money , how to put food on the tabl , when to fill out my tax form , or how to solv problem in my relationship . howev , as a teenag , i experienc an increas respons for my educ . i had to go to school everi weekday , i had to finish my homework and hand in my assign in time . these task defin were n't veri help in enjoy my life . due to the time older peopl have to spend on their job and get other task done , they have less time to do thing they actual enjoy - unless you enjoy your work more than anyth els . i know mani peopl who enjoy the work they are do but would rather do someth els even more enjoy , like studi a topic they are realli interest in , go hike , see some friend , or travel . howev , even though younger peopl have more time to do all these thing - student , for exampl , have long summer break - most young peopl lack the money to afford all these thing . also , due to law and regul , younger peopl may not be abl to do certain thing that older peopl can do . drive a car wa someth i would defin have enjoy when i wa six year old ( i still do now , though ) , howev , i wa not allow to do it . there are also thing which are not appreci by younger peopl as thing that make live more enjoy . visit a classic concert or just watch a sunset might be such an exampl . for mani adult or older peopl , have an own famili is the most import thing to have an enjoy life . given the exampl and explan abov , i gener agre with the statement , mainli becaus of the less respons young peopl have , the less problem they are confront with , and becaus of the time they have avail . look at it in a philosoph way , one must not forget the other side to thi discuss , which is that older peopl have the experi and matur to appreci certain thing more which make their live enjoy . howev , for me it defin seem that younger peopl have more fun , are more activ and get to know more new peopl . also , there is still thi curios about new and unexperienc thing , which make life veri enjoy . howev ,
