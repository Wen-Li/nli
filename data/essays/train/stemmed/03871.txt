academ educ ha alway been a debat issu becaus it deal with lot of purpos . one main point that is be more and more discuss is if it is better to acquir knowledg in mani academ subject or to special in a specif subject . we will see that even if a special academ curriculum can be reward , have knowledg of mani subject can help to be open-mind and can be use in daili life and societi . first , avoid special at school or at univers permit to develop curios and to have an open mind . inde , could you imagin what would be the consequ of onli teach biolog to a ten-year-old child ? he would onli focus all hi life on that subject . i believ that is the same for academ subject . we must learn a lot from other subject that the one we are go to work on all life . have class of histori or econom can help you to remain interest in differ subject . moreov , the more the knowledg is divers the more it is easi to face real situat . onli learn at univers doe not alway help to know how to behav in specif situat . by attend to a divers rang of cours , thi lead to a faster adapt and understand of the environ . for instanc , a manag should have learnt differ aspect of the econom busi . if he onli focus on accont , he will not be abl to understand the market team with which he will have to work . howev , it is necessari at a time to be special in one subject . to take the exampl of a plummer , he need to be sure of he is do to to work . if we did n't have to special , everybodi should know how to produc a pen or how to repair a car . though i fulli agre that sometim it is relev to special in a specif subject , i still believ that it is necessari to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it permit to be curiou and open-mind , to know how to behav in new environ and in daili life .
