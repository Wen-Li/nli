can somebodi know everth in the world ? of cours no . so whi do we tri know everth . if you think i have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . it mean you do not know anyth . becaus one person can not know everht , you just know someth about everth and it doe not work in the academ world . but if you special in one specif subject , it mean you can know a lot of thing on thi subject . therefor it is better to have special just one subject . i will give an exampl from the real world . whi compani have a lot of section and their own manag ? becaus they are specialist in their section . the owner of the compani ha a opinion for everth but he can not know everth so he ha to ask somebodi , who is specialist on thi situat , what he should do . we can use thi inform for academ world . if you work on a lot of subject , you can not spent enough time for everi subject . you can not know everth for everi subject so nobodi will ask you some help for their work becaus you do not have enough knowledg for them . they need specif answer . for exampl you are studi materi scienc and engin . you can not know everth about everi materi . you can just know all materila behaviour and some other basic thing . so nobodi ask you someth about it becaus they can find thi knowledg everywher . but if you are specialist on the cast iron , it mean you know everth about cast iron . therefor if somebodi need some help about cast iron they will ask you . as you can see , you can not know everth for mani academ subject . it is better to know everth about oneth . we should spent our time for specif subject .
