nowaday young peopl have n't time to hep their commun . i think that thi statement is true . nowaday the interest of young peopl are differ to do help for their commun . there are a lot of reason becaus it happen : 1 ) young peopl do n't recev an aduguatli educ by own parent : i think that the parent should do an adeguatli educ about help the commun , becaus so they do n't onli play with their friend , and becaus it is anoth way to stay with other young peopl . 2 ) they think onli for theirself , to buy new dress , to play footbal , and other activ that give more import to own person . 3 ) they think that other person can help their commun , and so they ca n't do noth for their commun . they do their help onli if someon tell they what they do . when i wa young i help my commun when i had some time : so i went to a social place where live some small children who have n't their parent and i play with they ; or with other friend and parent we clean my citi to some rifiut that other bad peopl put on the street or in the park . thi are onli some exampl that all young peolp can do to help the commun : it doe n't take a lot of time . onli person can do a littl action to help the commun , becaus the commun is form also by we and becaus the help that we do now , tomorrow someon will do it for we .
