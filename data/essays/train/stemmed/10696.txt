i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk , becaus , i think , that 's what make them success . peolp who remain do thing they alreadi do for a long time get use to it . develop routin give secur , but keep your abil on a certain level . after a certain amount of time you do n't get better in what you 're do . i think , that 's when successful peopl decid to make a chang . they realiz there 's no improv and tri someth new . my husband , for exampl , wa work as an oper after hi apprenticeship . he keep tell that he earn good money those day . but he wa n't satisfi with what he wa do . therefor he went back to school to becom an engin . now he work as an engin for 15 day and he 's still veri happi that he made that decis , becaus he find the engin work so much more interest . anoth point , state in the statement , is that risk take make peopl successful , too . in my opinion that is true , becaus start someth new impli to take risk . the risk can be to borough money , live somewher els or even give up a job , like friend of us did . they both had good job in a big town in germani . he wa a manag and she work as a doctor in a hospit . although a lot of peolp were admir them lead such a life , the coupl decid to quitt their job and move to the countrysid . everybodi kept ask them , if they got mad . their answer wa , that they decid for their relationship . obvious there must have been some problem , we did n't see . for some peopl thi coupl did n't look like be successful , but i think , to be successful doe n't have to have the mean of earn a lot of money . be successful mean to do what 's best for you . in conclus , successful peolp have learn to take care of their self-interest .
