it is often ask , wheter student should get a wide rang of knowledg dure univers or just special on one topic . in my eye , the specialist is much more appropri than a generalist . in opposit to a generalist , who can do nearli anyth , but can not do someth realli good , a specialist is abl to , as the name tell , specialiy on one concret thing . therefor , he ha a good , deep and great knowledg about thi topic . like in school , you learn a lot of stuff , you never need again in our life , becaus you are not interest in thi thing . also , you are onli good in lectur you are interest in , student are less motiv in thi class . thi is whi they wont get good mark or point in thi topic , and therefor are more unmotiv . but if you need some knowledg from other academ field . like busi knowledg for a physican who start hi own compani , you have the opportun to get thi knowledg `` learning-by-do '' or in an autodidact way . also , if you onli provid gener knowledg , some student were not abl to start at univers , becaus they are not interest in such a wide rang . they mayb visit privat univers which support thi special thing . the most import thing is , that you will need a veri specialis knowledg , to invent and progress thing . so , onli a gener knowledg is not enough for research and develop . thi could lead societi into a world without or with onli few progress . for exampl , if you know , how the engin in your car work exactli , doesnt mean that you are abl to build one up by yourself . or make some thing better on it . so , without specialist , a progress of societi is nearli imposs . becaus of thi , special knowledg is veri import . gener knowledg can receiv from book , but special knowledg is hard to get to know on your own .
