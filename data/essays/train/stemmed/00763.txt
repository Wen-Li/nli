in my point of view the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact is right to a certain extend . the purpos of educ in my eye is not onli to teach scientif fact to student , but also to convey the concept of the polit system and set of valu of your societi . in order to do so it is import that the student develop the abil to understand differ idea and concept and get to know how to critic deal with idea . thi will help the student to understand whi it is import fot them to studi hard and gain more knowleg in certain area . by understand the purpos of their educ , student feel that school it is not someth which is impos on them , but will help them to deal with educ challeng in their futur life . howev , the base for differ idea and concept are usual fact . in order to understand idea and concept it is necessari to have a basic knowledg of fact . without these fact , student can not understand where these idea come from or how they have been develop in the first place . howev , teach onli fact can not be the aim of an educ . if you teach student onli fact there is a high probabl that they will feel bore . it might be difficult for them to understand the reason whi know these fact can be import for them and how these fact might help them in their futur life . to summar thi i think there should be a balanc between teach fact and teach idea and concept to student . they are both necessari to complet a good educ , but i think convey idea and concept should have the prioriti in a teach concept .
