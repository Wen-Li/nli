i disagre that statment that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for sever reason . first , when we buy someth in the store , we almost read the advertis about that we are go to buy . then we decid if we should buy or not . if the advertis about that we are go to buy is good for us , we may buy that . wether we buy someth or not is depend on advertis , so they should not tell a lie . second , if advertis use the inform that seem much better than they realli are , and consum buy and use that stuff , it can be harm for consum . for exampl , if advertis say that thi meal doe n't includ fat at all although it realli includ much fat , those who buy that and have regur can get fat . it is not good for health . final , if most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , consum ca n't believ them and buy anyth . it is seriou problem . for human can live safeti and confort , advertis should be honest , i think . for these reason , i think most advertis should not make produst seem much better than they realli are .
