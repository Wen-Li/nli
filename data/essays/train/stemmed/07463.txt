the mobil of societi is a topic which is often discuss : in newspap , in polit , but also among friend . should there be less car to decreas pollut ? ye , there should , but in my opinion thi will not happen in the next twenti year . on the contrari , i think that the number of car in the world will stay the same or probabl even increas . differ reason such as the need for mobil , improv road condit , a better econom situat in develop countri and the growth rate of the popul will lead to a constant or even higher amount of car . first of all , mobil is one of the most import point for modern societi . also in twenti year , thi wish for mobil will still go on . peopl still want to be mobil , to reach everyth within a shortest time period . as it is , car are the fastest medium of transport , at least for short distanc . thu , the major will not be will to give up hi or her car onli to decreas pollut . in switzerland , there is a live discuss about improv and extend road to absorb all the traffic . also in other countri , these measur are of high interest . if there are more and better plan road and therefor less traffic jam , even more peopl will think about buy a car and use it to reach for exampl their work place . consid develop countri , they hope will have improv their situat in twenti year at least a littl bit . less poepl will live in poverti , and more will be part of the middl class . thi posit develop also lead to a higher demand of car , becaus a car is a symbol for have enough money . in develop countri it is even more import for peopl to show how much they earn and therefor to climb the social ladder . final , the simpl fact that the world popul in the whole is grow indic that there will be more car owner in the futur than now . the grow demand for mobil in western countri as well as the longer the more in develop countri lead to a higher number of car in the world . thi develop is support by the fact that a lot of countri are think of expand their road system . thu , it can not be thought about a decreas amount of car in the futur .
