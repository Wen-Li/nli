it is often assum that work thing the right way , the way we are taught , is a major key to success . i believ that thi statement is right . howev i believ real success happen to those who bring in new idea and take risk . it is true that when peopl are taught to work on someth and do it the right way they will be effici and success . for exampl , someon who ha been taught how to make cooki and how to run a shop could open a cooki shop and be success at sell cooki . i can see no reason at all whi thi person would not earn hi life by sell cooki . howev , take someon pretti creativ and who enjoy take risk . thi person would open a cooki shop and sell cinnamon flavour cooki as well as cherri flavour cooki , and thi way differenti itself from other cooki shop . there are two end to thi stori , thi new busi is a complet failur or a real success . thi person ha taken risk and invest in it new idea without know if these would meet the costum ' tast or not . and if thi creativ person succe , i am convinc that it busi will outlin the common cooki shop busi . anoth success that is engend by take risk is the self satisfact that is bring . be success for it own idea is far more gratifi than do thing right . great success that qre famou worldwid are alway born from an innov concept , and thi in all area . famou film director would not be so famou if they did not introduc a new vision of film direct . in financ , broker that earn the most are those who take the most signific and relev risk . bill gate would not be worldli known ( and immens wealthi ) if he had not invest in a revolutionari idea .
