i do agre that young peopl can enjoy their live more than the older peopl . one can do thing while he is young but can not do the same thing when he 's get older . not onli that , but a young person doe have much time to live and enjoy hi life more than the older person . mani book can be written when talk about thing that are onli can be made when a person is young . that 's becaus when a person is young , he is usual more power . for exampl , if there is a trip , the younger person can go and enjoy everi minut in it , while the older man can still go but he wo n't get to enjoy the trip as the young man had . mani thing can be done when a person is younger such as , travel , have adventur , attend mani event in mani countier away from hi . howev , the older peopl can do the same thing but they will not experi the same feel as the young peopl did . the reason for that is that they can not do mani activ as the young peopl can do , sinc these activ requir a certain skill or power that the older peopl lack . from the other hand , age is a veri import issu when talk about enjoy a thing . young peopl do have much time to enjoy a thing such as , visit new place and stay there for a while . also , they do have enjoy the job experi by work in differ job and gain skill from such oppurtun . those thing can not be done by older peopl sinc they do not have time for tri new thing or live a new experi . in addit , young peopl can have kid and play with them by all mean like , go to the garden , have a picnic , or even drive them to their school . all that can be done with a clear mind . while older peopl is get affraid from the death in ani moment , young peopl do n't have the same threat upon their sholder . in the last but not the least , young peopl do have the advantag of have so much joy in theor live more than the older peopl becaus two criteria , the abil for do mani hard and tough action , and the age restrict .
