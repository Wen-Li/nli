thi question is not easi to answer and i think that there is no gener answer possibl . everbodi ha to judg for himself . from my point of view , i belief that young peopl do enjoy life more than older peopl . right from the begin of our life young peopl begin to learn . it start with fundament thing like breath , watch , tast , feel , etc . later on we have to learn how to walk or run . all these step go on dure our whole life . thi learn process keep peopl busi and therefor satisfight . even if the learn process doe not alway succeed immedi or is pain , young peopl are fill with pride when they have accomplish someth . thi feel is so good that young peopl cri it out loud `` life is so beauti ! '' do you have alreadi heard an older person cri thi sentenc ? i have not . in the last 50 year of our evolut , life ha chang dramaticali . thing becam much easier and faster for exampl do laundri or use the internet today like the toefl test . younger peopl do not have big problem chang themselv while their envoir chang . although young peopl alway claim that they do not have time left becaus time run alway out and the world never stop turn , i think they like that way . in comparis older peopl have lot of free time becaus they do not need to work ani more . or they can tell us from the past and their memori and judg in some case better becasu they know the result but all these point i have mention are not strong enough for me to convinc me that older peopl enjoy life more . i guess the chang world is the biggest problem for old peopl that they do have some problem today . my grandmoth rememb quit good when the first man on earth stept on the moon . she wa sit in front of her radio and could not realli belief what wa happen there . today nearli everybodi tell you for further inform go on my homepag under www . my grandmoth doe not know what the internet is and seh doe not want it ani more . so belief that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl .
