it is of my opinion that help commun is quit import for me . with the concern of the young peopl may not have enough time to devot themselv to help their communit , i have sever reason and solut as the follow first , young peopl are energet than the elder , they spend a lot of time in studi as well as play . they learn all the time and have the will to learn . if they are ask to manag thing with their neighbor , they will not refus and hesit to do . in thi prime time , young peopl like to help with each other to solv the problem . next to go would be , the definit of the commun may not simpli mean the surround they live . it can also be infer the place they studi and work . young peopl like to join club and learn someth new in order to satisfi the thirst toward knowledg . they concentr with a specif field and lauch their effort to achiev their ideal goal . all these accomplish need time and thier endeavor . moreov , they learn in help . such as decor a club center , recruit new blood to the club , and even take care of the sick classmat or neighbor preoccupi with busi . howev , though they are so activ in their commun affair , there definit are blind spot that they probabl fail to focu on . for exampl , young peopl who live outsid may encount the gap between them and their famili . for exampl , when i wa an undergradu who live far away from famili , be not abl to go home per week make some commun problem with my famili member . as a whole , young peopl do have enough time to help thier commun . t
