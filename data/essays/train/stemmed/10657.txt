sinc student start learn thing in the school , they have the responsb to learn everyth they should know ; therefor , student are suppos to understand idea and concept more than just know the faci . there are some reason whi i think student should know idea and concept but not just the fact . first of all , student that understand idea and concept can learn better and easili get interest in that subject . for exampl , onc studnet understand the idea of how math work , they can do the math easier and faster than other who do n't understand the idea . also , if student know what the concept is in a histori event , they can easili get interest in it and even want to know more about it . they can actual learn much better than student who do not know what the concept is . secondli , i do n't believ student would learn well if they just learn the fact . for instanc , mani subject like histori , geoeraphey and even scienc need student to understand their idea and concept . if student do not learn the idea and concept they will not be abl to good mark on the subject . further more , if student do not learn the subjext well , they can easili fail the cours and lost their interest to them either in the histori , math , scienc , and even english calss . base on the two reason that i mention abov , i suggest that understand idea and concept doe lot more import than onli know the fact and it doe not matter in ani of the subject .
