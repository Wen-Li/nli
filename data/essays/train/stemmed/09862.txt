sucess peopl are those person who suce in his/her field with good result . if somon is success becaus of his/her hard labour in that field or it may be due to someth new work in that field which make a sucess person . i agre with success peopl should tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know . i appreaci those person who are go to do new thing which make him/her as a well known person in all over world . let take exampl if you will do someth new , like as new softwar in comput which will use for some data analysi , as we know that in all over the world most of the peopl are use comput with differ softwar for data analysi , if your new softwar will be good then everyon will be use your softwar onli which will make you as a well known in all over world . i donot like the tradtion work becaus it doesnot make ani sens to anyon , let take exampl someon is work on research relat to util of carbohydr in fish , that scientist is work onli on dose of carbohydr in fish feed but fish have a limit abil to util carbohydart . scientist incorpor onli differ dose of carbohydr in feed which doesnot make much more attarct becaus thi work is alreday go on from last 30 year . if scientist will do someth differ like if he/sh can modifi the form of carbohydart like gelatin and nongelatin carbohydr then incorpor in fish feed then fish may be util more than previou then if fish util more then chanc of growth will be more then it may be appreci by everyon . i am also agre on the abov statement becaus some of new compani are com up day by day becaus of good manag . they are manag in differ way with innov idea so they can lure the custom . nowday mani of advertis are so uniqu that can lure the person veri easili with new idea . most of adverstis are uniqu in differ way . let take exampl wash powder ( nirma ) wa advertis it product veri tradit manner so it market were go down but nowday they are adverst in new way so it market again regain . at last i would like to conclud that i agre with the abov mention statement . i think sucess peopl should tri to do new thing and take risk rather than tradit or alreadi known .
