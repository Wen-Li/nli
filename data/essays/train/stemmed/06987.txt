today , we usual heard that young peopl are not interest in help their commun . i think that young peopl have a differ vision of that . they help their commun , but in a differ way than ten year ago . first , the structur of a famili ha chang . there are more divorc , parent and children can live kilomet far away from each other etc . i think thi could explain whi young peopl feel less concern about old peopl for exampl . but we can see some experi in franc to reduc the gap between old person and children . some school have organis meet , everi week , where each child ha a grandfath or a grandmoth for the meet . they play and make activ togeth . it is an interest experi for children becaus lot of them have lost their grand parent or live far away from them . moreov , they learn to care for old peopl . in addit , youg peopl have differ behaviour becaus they have differ educ . if the parent teach their children to help other peopl , i think they would follow thi lesson later . if they see parent help a neighbour or someom of the famili for exampl . anoth point is that the current societi and parent ask a lot from young peopl . there is a lot of competit between parent becaus they want to show that their children are `` better '' than other in school , sport , music , etc . thi mean that children have lot of activit dure the week and the week end so they have less time to spend for their commun . final , i think that young peopl help their commun but they could give more time for it . parent have to teach children that famili and commun are import and that they have to take care of each other .
