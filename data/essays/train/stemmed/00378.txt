i dont agre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than old '' . in the fast move era everyth in the univers is at constant chang . everyon want to learn more and more inord to compet with the comput gener . if person ha good job skill he or she is consid as intelleg . other wise they are bee consid as mere pippet . so i feel older gener is enjoy more than young peopl . while i wa in colleg i almost spent most of my week end do some assign or prepar for present . my grand-fath use to ask me to go with him for live consert . which take place in the other end of our street . but i never use to go . becaus i have to work hard inord to get good grade . he use to talk about those show for mani day . he trueli enjoy those time . if one want to enjoy he need money . he ha to think about mani thing , if he is the onli one who is earn in the hous . he ha to devid hi salari to hous hold expens , children educ and also to pay tax . but when he get old most of the expenc will be elimin . like children educ and tax . so thi is the time they will see some money in their hand . so they tri to enjoy it for their own life . not onli that late mani young peopl are suffer from lot of stress becaus of work load . even if they get vacat they are not abl enjoy that time becaus of stress . which inturn lead to mani more health problem like high blood pressur or diabeti in their earli age . but elderli are far away from all thi work relat stress as they are nolong work . whoever have no tension in life they enjoy the most . in my guess thet are old peopl . accord to me elderli peopl in our commin are enjoy the most than young gener . they get suffici to go to club or entertain center to pass their time which is not possibl for youngster .
