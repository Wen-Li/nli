youth is the power of a nation . a nation 's progress reli majorli on the perform and contribut of it youth . a youth , today , ha multipl task to handl . i believ , most of the young peopl are under the pressur of perfom the best . thi pressur drive them away from their responsibilti . they are more focuss on self advanc . thi focu take them veri far from their sourc . therefor , young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i am a student and current pursu my engin degre in biotechnolog . thi cours demand greater devot and dedic toward the studi . i have to attend colleg , do project after colleg and also particip in variou event take place in my colleg . all these responsibilti doe not give me enough time as free . thu , i fail to give a help hand to my commun . youth is the time of life where one is brim with energi and enthusiasm of move ahead in life . if thi energi will not be manifest to work toward one 's goal then , one 's dream would never be fulfil . help and serv the commun could happen at ani time of life . but thi golden period of youth will never come back again . a nation 's progress will uplift if it ha youth who are contribut their best in everi field . take the exampl of sania mirza who enter the field of lawn tenni in her teen-ag . her devot and dedic toward her game made her popular in the entir world of lawn tenni . thi also lead to the popular of our countri . in other word , she wa like an ambassador of india . sachin tendulkar enter cricket when he wa nearli 18 year old . he made himself and hi countri proud by hi hard work and dedic . so , we see that in order to go ahead in life one ha to har energi in one 's field of interest . thi would eventu requir one to give the maximum time to one 's work . but thi doe not mean that one should not give time to help commun . thi can be done when one is settl in life . then the contribut would be much more and it would be more meaningful.i.e. one can help hi commun financi , in person or in ani other way which is possibl .
