nowaday , peopl are taught mani thing includ their own special subject . i think becaus peopl have strong desir of know everyth and the social want let them studi variou thing . howev i stongli disagre with thi statement . becaus it is not onli wast time and but also it make peopl get tire to studi more about the subjest in which they special . let me give an exampl of my case . i special in classic music for bachelor cours . dure my colleg time , i had to take the lectur about not onli music but also about social scienc lectur . the practic time wa lack dure thi period . becaus my lectur schedul finish everi 6 o'clock everi weekday . i think that the musician can creat the art when they well practic and took enough rest . howev i had to spend a time to studi about thing what i do not realli need for my music subject while i had to sit front of piano or go bed . in addit , i could wast not onli time , but the energi in which i need to focu on my studi wich i special . if i took too much time on stude other subjet that i think needless for pass the grade , i should easili get tire . moreov it make to not be emphazis on my special work . in conculus , if peopl keep concetr on what they special , the world get peaceful and they will thank to each other for help them about they do not know .
