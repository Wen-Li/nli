it is sometim difficult to discuss if young peopl do not spend too much to help their commun . some peopl may agre that young peolp do n't help other , while oyher tend to state that young peopl help each other the their commun all the time . howev , i have also come to my own opinion that young peopl do not spend much time on help their commun . first , as techonolgi improv , too mani recreat could deflect the concentr of young kid . for instanc , the video game and internet , creat in late 1980 's , provid much more visual pleasur that befor . so more and moer young peopl would like to spend all their to play game or chat on the net rather than give some time to help their commun . unlik young kid befor , who did have more time to interact with other member in their commun , young peopl nowaday have less topic of commun , except game , to discuss . so they do n't share their live with their commun , no mention to help their commun . second , in my opinion , fewer and fewer young peopl nowaday do realiz the mean of help other . it is a pitti that even in the school , teacher rare instruct the real virtu of human . all the teacher ask young kid to do is that they should forcu on themslv , not other . they just acquir knowleg form textbook , but they do n't learn how to deal with other peopl , respect other peoplem , and even help other peopl . as a result , they do not give ani support to their commun , becaus they do n't how to do and what to do . thay is not to say , of cours , that other point of view are without merit . i am sure that there are do some young kid serv other . howev , on the basi of the abov mention , i think the reason i have provid in favor of my posit are build on a solid foundat .
