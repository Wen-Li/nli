i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi can be said from my own experi and from what i see from other peopl 's experi . one of the reason i think thi is becaus , younger peopl have more power or stamina to do thing . for exampl , if a 50-year old person were to play basebal , he/sh would have a hard time in hit the ball and run to the base , and catch a ball and throw it . as for the younger peopl , they still have a lot of strength and energi left to move around and use as much power as they want . younger peopl have an advantag that they are abl to move quicker and stronger compar to older peopl , so i think younger peopl would enjoy sport more than older peopl . in my own experi , my dad and i were play catch . i could throw realli fast at my dad , but my dad could n't throw that fast . i think thi wa becaus he got tire faster than i did , or he did n't have much strength so he could n't throw a ball like he use to when he wa young . we can see that if we get older , our choic of what we can do will decreas . anoth exampl that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is that young peopl can fool around more compar to older peopl . thi can be said becaus if an adult were to jump around nake in his/her yard , he would get caught by the polic . on the other hand , if a 5-year old boy were to jump around nake in hi yard , he obvious would n't get caught . as you can see , older peopl have more restrict compar to young peopl . in conclus , i think that young peopl will enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi can be said becaus younger peopl have more opportun to do certain thing than older peopl like play a sport , or go nake in your yard . i have never been old befor , but in fact , i am have the greatest time in my life now , young !!
