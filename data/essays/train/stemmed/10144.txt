i would agre that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun nowaday . thi is a result of the ongo process of enstrang . peopl do not want to know their fellow peopl anymor . today no one know who hi neighbour is . thi is mainli a result of the increas independ peopl enjoy dure the last decad . so whi should younger peopl be differ when the societi ha taught them to be thi way . young peopl are also not that polit engag like previou gener . one reason might be the huge amount of addit leisur offer you can choos from . you are mobil , so you can get to a disco or cafe at the even . young peopl play at their pc or playstat . and that is more fun than get involv in a parti . but younger peopl are also tire of polit nowaday . they do not see politician as role model that encourag them to take the same career . politician are bore , they are said to lie all the time and they serv not the interest of teenag but of adult . what is natur as most young peopl are not allow to vote and so they are not interest for politician . furthermor young peopl are veri reluct to work volunteer for chariti organ . i do not think that it is becaus young peopl do not care about these issu anymor but they are to busi to earn money with holiday job or similar activ to afford the thing they alway want to buy . that is whi we live in a societi that is dedic to consum all the time . even littl kid are seduc via commerci in tv or radio to buy the product they actual do not need . for young peopl it is more import to have all the new stuff their friend have and that is whi they do not have time to get involv in a chariti organ .
