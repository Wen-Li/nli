of cours i complet suuport the idea that most advertis make product seem much much better than they realli are . let me talk about an experi of myself , i have follow the adever mani time in make decis and after that i found that i wa mistak . for exampl , i watch on the televis about a new kitchen tool which wa veri nice and veri cheap . in that time particulari i wa prepar my apart and i wa look for such thing . in the first i thought it wa veri nice but after buy it i found it wa a big mistak to buy it becaus it spent onl one week and after that it complet destruct . anoth thing which happen to me while i wa look for a insur compani for my new car , i red an announc about a new insur compani , that advertis wa like a dream , it said that if ani small thing happen to your car it will be fix total free , and if the car is complet destruct , you will have a new car , when i red it i decid that i will join thi compani to insur on my car , after one year of join that compani and pay all my money , i made an accied with my car , and when i went to the insur compani , i wa astonish to hear that i would not get ani money becaus i wa mistaken . anoth one more thing , when i wa look for a nice place to spend my honey mool there with my new wife i hear about a new tourism compani . i went to it and i ask them for a nice place to go and they advis me to go for a certain place . but when i went there i found that everi thing is veri bad . so that i think that one should not follow the advertis when shearch for ani thing becaus mani compani tri to sell it bad product by make a veri incorret advertis and they pay atremend amount of money in it and spend alot of money to make it look like what we see .
