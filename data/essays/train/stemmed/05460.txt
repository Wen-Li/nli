our societi is a societi of valu . i mean peopl often like us for what we did rather than what we are . thi statement allow peopl to tri new thing . that is whi some peopl think success peopl are thi kind of peopl qnd that the other one are those who never take risk . cqn we challeng thi statement ? we will see in which way thi affirm is true or fals . when peopl tri new thing , it is clear that they are show their abil to creat , to manag and to anticip . if they took the right innov decis , that-is-to say what they decid make them earn money for instanc , they are go to be seen as succes peopl . on the contrari , if they made up their mind in the wrong way , they are go to be blame for , especi becaus they did not take the usual way . acut , take risk is danger and that is what we award when everi thing goe right . moreov , when a ` right innov decis ' is taken , becaus of it creativ , it ; ake earn more money for instanc becaus nobodi think use it befor . it is in that way that peopl are consid as success . it is also becaus media , which play a big part in our societi onli talk about particular peopl who , accord to them , onli succed becaus of a revolutionari method , invent or way-of-manag . on the oher side , we find peopl who not take risk . thi peopl take usual desicion do not challeng what they have learn . acut , they know how to do well , and think they do not have to tri new thing to do better . thi peopl can also earn money , mayb without be on tv , but the result is the same . thi behaviour correspond to more quiet peopl qnd mayb who are afraid of tomorrow . to conclud , i think that media are the reason whi peopl think success peopl are those who take risk becaus they talk a lot of them . i think peopl have to bear in mind that even if tv onli deal with peopl who succeed becqus of thir creativ , mani who took risk are still in the dark .
