there is an old say , `` do not judg a book by it cover '' . it is true and appli to everyth and everywher in the world . it is imposs to see what the content of the box is onli by look at a box unless a person ha an uncanni abil to do so . a woman with luxuri cloth eat in an expens restaur might not be rich becaus she might have borrow the cloth from her friend for a day and somebodi els wa pay for her food . same as the advertis . sinc the purpos of the advertis is to sell product , it is inevit to describl product better than they realli are . everi product is cover with some descript and pictur on it . in most case , the pictur are not exactli same as the real content . for exampl , one day , i went to the store to buy someth to eat . everi food look great to me sinc i wa hungri , and the pictur on the cover look realli delici . i bought a bunch of instant food and tri one of them at home . i put frozen pasta in a microwav , and when i took it out from the microwav to eat , i wa greatli disappoint and frustrat . although the pictur on it cover had big chunk of meat and creami sauc on softli boil noodl , the actual food look total differ from the picutur . from thi exampl , it can be conclud that it is necessari for food compani or advertis compani to make advertis with exaggr express or pictur to sell them . i bought the frozen pasta sinc it advertis look great . if there were two kind of frozen pasta with two differ cover with the frozen pasta and the other one with delici cook pasta , what would peopl prefer to buy ?
