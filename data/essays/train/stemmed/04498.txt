the statement given is rather black and white . i would although agre with the tendenc , that success peopl are abl and have the courag to dare new thing . and obvious not dare anyth new or unus doesnt promis ani success . an abil which might lead to sucess is the wisdom to know in which situat it is need to do what is familiar and when a new step can be dare . i would say thi is a possibl of use resourc and energi effect . some time it might be wise to do thing which are familiar to do and doesnt consum money or time for research . but than it is nessesari to dare someth new . for instanc for a compani which produc product or servis , it can be advis to lanc a small rang of product first , till they got a posit in the market and a name among their costum . after that they have gain ressours to do step in new direct , gener spoken . take risk need a person that dare to fail . an experi can go wrong and in that case a desicionmak need to carri the respons for it . i think the abil of take risk is definitivli a posit and creativ one and need to reach goal and success . it is a skill for lead posit . but as i mention the more import skill is to be abl to distinguish situat where it advis to chose either the known or the new action . sucess altough could be understood differ . goal could be set differ . in the case the goal is not an econom one , and for instanc to gain experi , than is tri new thing and experi defenitli an advanteg .
