i agre with thi statement . peopl tri thing that they do n't know veri well . the risk is a part of live and mani peopl believ that thi is the onli thing to carri on live . i thing it 's veri sad . the quotidian is also veri import and to appreci small thing of each day is an other way to live . thi statement can carri neg effect to peopl 's life . the teenag tri often thing veri danger to be appreci by other member of a group . they take risk onli to be part of someth . they do n't hear what their parent tell and they do what kind of stupid thing . they drive a car at high speed , for exampl . recent , i wa watch televis when i saw a girl that she had an accid with a car . she kill three guy and she onli sayd : `` luckli , i wa n't in our place '' . incred ! . she kill three innoc peopl . i think that peopl can tri risk , but onli a risk without consequ for other person . an other risk is , for exampl , start a busi . i think that it 's veri difficult to creat a new compani , expeci today . i studi busi manag and i understood in my univers 's cours that onli few peopl can realiz thi thing : peopl that are clever , ambiti , they must understand what they are do and thi last carachteristiqu is the most import . mayb , a man with a famili spend a lot of money to open a restaur , but he doe n't have qualiti to organis , to calcul problem and to solv them . he lose all for a dream too bigger for him . it 's veri import know what you 're do onli in the small and less import thing . know the effect of own action and imagin the action of the other . an other risk is the bank invest . i do n't think it 's a good idea and my money will stay in a secur place .
