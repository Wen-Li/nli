knowledg of the student determin hi abil . sharp ide can interrupt in the student mind if he or she is strong in concept . student thinkin abil ha to be fast , sharp , innovative.a good student is one who can resolv the issu in quick n better way . the way a student approch the task is also import , it can b done in two way , analyt way n the other is fact way . it is veri import for the student to tri to think in differ possibl way he can . if the student ha gone throuh the concept in the tradionanl way then hi approch will be narrow so i prefer the analyt understand rather than fact way . innov idea lead to success in a short period of time . concept of the subjet can help the student in mani way to resolv the problem . but fact also play an imprtant role , if the student is not awar of the fact of the topic he is deal in then he might not be abl to solv the issu . so a student shuld first go through the fact and then tri to think over them in an analyt way . consid a the fact that i hav seen my senior design a 4 stroke engin in the colleg scienc carniv . he wa not a brilliant person in the class but when it came to the practic section he wa awsom . wen he wa reward for hi work he ststed that hi area of interest wa design , which alway wa foccus and innov . ho wa veri clear in hi concept , which ultim lead him to success . so i prefer firstli to know the fact and then to analy those fact in an analyt way for success. a combin of both will lead to success in a veri short time .
