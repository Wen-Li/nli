definit , i see mani reason that allow me to think , not onli that in the near futur car will be fewer , but also that that scenario is desir to improv the qualif of peopl' life and the wealth of our environ . on the one hand it is plausibl to think that the use of the automobil , particularli those that function with ga , will decreas dure the near futur , due to the evid of a direct lingk of it usag and a perman damg in our eviron . in fact the pollut of the latter is draw the attent of may ecologist and polit activist , clearli awar of the terribl consequ if a sustain develop is not undertaken . in adddit , the usag of more car in citi seem to be veri inconveni if we acknowledg that urban place are becom increasingli overcrowd , mainli becous of the flow of migrat , either within countri , from popul abbondon their countrysid town and head to the big citi , either from peopl leav their own countri , seek for new opportun . car could hinder the possibl of a rapid movement throughout the citi , creat traffic jam , thu , extend the time peopl need to commut from one place to other . moreoev , sinc citi , particularli in europ , character from their high popul densiti and their lack of space and , the cost of park lot is unafford for the major of the popul . therefor even car owner decid to restrict the usag of their vehicl , to weekend or to go out at night , avoid commut by automobil on a daili basi . anoth factor that should be taken for consider , regard the inconveni of car massiv use is the cost of ga . in other word , it is a lot cheaper to use the public transport system than to use a car . final , the reason to rtestrict the use of the car outnumb the reason to use it . therefor i strongluy believ that their number will decreas /
