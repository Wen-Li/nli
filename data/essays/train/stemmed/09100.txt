i complet disagre with the statement that , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the first reason for my belief is , if ani compani or industri make ani fals statement about their product , they will be in loss not onli with that particular product even for their entir life time . next time if they come up with realli good product and they start adveris in the tv and in newspap , but no bodi is go to buy it , as they alreadi have veri bad impress about their earlier product . so gain confid of the custom is veri import for profit . so when they advertis about the product they should not lie about the product consequ the product or particular compani will build a good rapport with the custom . the second reason for my belief is , not all the compani will cheat the custom . to have good reput the compani should not expect the profit initi , first they should be humbl with the custom and tri to improv the market of their product . for exampl take johnson and johnson compani product , initi they tri not to exagger about their product or not to lie about the product , they creat some sort of trust in their custom . so as they come up with new product some time they do n't even have to advertis their product , just by look at their compani name cutom will buy the product . thirdli , there are few product which will be given over impress as they realli are . but it should be healthi it should not be someth which play with custom life . some product will sell fast just the way they advertis the product . for exampl some cloth advertis , they can give ani type of advertis becaus it is not go to have ani kind of life threaten , the same thing if they do in some medic which ha realli bad side effect and still if they do fals advertis that is not healthi . advertisem play veri import role in compet with the other product , the competit should be healthi way , it should not be unhealthi , by fals advertis the compani not onli get loss but also never can be good reputit compani or product , even they come up with real good product . abov mention reason will support my disagr with the statement given `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' .
