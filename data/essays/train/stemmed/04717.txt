i agre with the idea that success peopl tri to new thing and take risk ratehr than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are some reaosn to support my opinion . in the begin , most peopl may consid star player , like basebal player , as success peopl . i guess that most famou player tri new thing and take risk to improv themselv . for instanc , japanes basebal player wish to play in the unit state becaus they think the us is the number one basebal countri . such as ichiro suzuki on seattl marin , he left japan and went to the unit state to tri to reach the summit of himself as a basebal player . he said `` i want to improv my basebal '' . if he continu to play basebal in japan , he would not take risk rather than play basebal in the unit state . it is so difficult to be a star basebal player in the us rather than in japan becaus there are so mani popular foreign player in the us . in other hand , there are mostli japanes player in japanes profession basebal leagu . i think peopl are educ or improv by take risk . in my case , i came to the unit state from japan three year ago becaus of my father 's job . my father said to me that `` you did not have to come with me '' . my father worri about that i would be troubl with foreign languag . howev , i came here becaus i want to improv my english skill . in the first year of my stay in the us , it wa horribl . i could not understand almost all word what teacher said . i wa so depress ; howev , i realli want to becom a good english speaker although i have to take much risk or i need ton of effort for that . right now , i hope my english skill is improv by live in the us . thu , i believ that i will becom a success person in the futur by take an activ part of my experi in the unit state becaus i take much risk while i stay in the unit state . therefor , i agre with the opinion that success peopl tri to new thing and take risk .
