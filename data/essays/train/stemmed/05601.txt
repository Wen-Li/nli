the topic `` whether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or have specialis knowledg '' is subject . in my opinion have specialis knowledg is more import than have littl knowledg of everi field . i support my opinion by an adag `` jack off all and master of none '' as per the adag a person who know bit and piec of all the subject but doe not have complet knowledg of one field end up knowher . a specialis is must becaus if person tend to select a career path the he must be focus on follow it , he must be abl concentr on hi or her desir field without bieng distract by other influenc , for exampl mani peopl tend to switch career becaus the pay is good or work is less tax , they tend to obtaind knowledg of other area which may be benefici , but as trend chang the motiv also chang . i.e if the particular field get to crowd then peopl tend again to switch their area of expertis . in do so peopl may intial get better pay for their skill in differ depart , but when it come to progress they may find themselv at lower postion then if they had specialis in a particular area and wait for better opportun secondli have broad rang of knowledg in itself is not detriment if a person is abl to keep with develop and progress that are be made , in thi fast chang world thing get outmod quickli for eg in the it world peopl tend learn a lot new comput languag but as technolog develop some of them get outdat so a person must be abl to keep up with progress . have said thi , it is not humanli possibl for each human be to keep himself updat with myriad of chang take place in limit time he ha each day thirdli it is not onli the knowledg in the differ academ field that matter it is the applic of the knowledg practic that matter if a person is not abl to appli himself or use a skill practic than the skill is worthless for eg if a person ha knowledg in the follow area comput , medicin , law : all dispar field with littl or no relat to each other and he can not repair a comput when the situat demand or save a person when he is ill then the knowledg in differ area is of no use unless he abl to do complet justic to all the field have said thi have basic knowledg in some field which is requir for day to day function is good for eg basic comput knowledg is requir in almost all offic in addit to basic knowledg it is necessari that person must specialis in particular area so that he can continu to prove hi worth to employ and continu to progress in hi care in conclus it is better to specialis in particular academ subject than to tri to gain knowledg of all area and as result end without proper direct to one career specialis bring a sens of accomplish which diversifi can not
