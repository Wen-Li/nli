i disagre with the statement even thoug i think it is more importan to understand idea and concept . most of the estud are more concern about fact becaus fact can be prove , fact can show you the right and the wrong way to do thing . when you understand the concept and idea is up to you to prove them , to see if they are realli what you have been told , i think thi is the main reason whi student prefer fact rather than just understand idea and concept . in my opinion tradicion countri like mine prefer to teach idea and concept so tha you can develop as you want , in the other hand more develop contri prefer to teach fact that you can put easal in practic and you dont have to spend time triyng to prove if thing work right or wrong . one of the major reason develop contri teach fact is the valu of the time , time ha becom a treasur that you have to improv , time goe fast and cost money . understand idea and concept will leav you the main idea , the estructur the format , is up to you to thake advantag of thi an tri to develop an take in to fact of your own experi . fact are realli imoportan and if you now how to use them you will have more argument to deal wiht live
