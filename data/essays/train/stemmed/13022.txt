i believ espeaci collag student should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . for exampl in my univers call sabanc univers , we have two year to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . no matter which faculti the student will continu with , all student should learn a bit from everyth such as chemistri , biolog , mathemat , polit , histori \ design ect . for exampl i made a good useag of thi system , by learn what i realli want to studi . as for me , i would never choos visual commun and design depart if there wa no such a system . i have choosen thi depart by know what it includ , what the requir are and for sure what pleas me more . by look from thi perspect , i think that to have broad knowledg help to open peopl mind and creat more well cultur background peopl . the more well cultur background peopl mean the more civil peopl . perhap thi would lead to a better , piec enviro for live . by the help of thi system , peopl take more confidenti step to their futur job . as we see today , most peopl do not work at the same field that they were graduad from , moreov they do not enjoy their job . as a conclus , thi system can be the solut of thi problem . howev i believ that after have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , peopl should special in one subject , becaus it is also import to have special peopl on specif subject . if knowledg of everyon is on the same level , the scientif approach or artist innov would not be possibl . as a result of all , my oppinion is , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
