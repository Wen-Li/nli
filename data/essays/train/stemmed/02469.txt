i disagre with the statement . i travel around canada by myself . it wa a bu travel for a month . it wa a great experi for me . i had a lot of chanc to talk local peopl . i could go whereev i want to go . at the begin of the trip , i wa nervous about traver alon . becaus i had never travel alon even in japan and i did not have much inform about citi where i would go . of cours , i did not have ani friend there . howev , after a few day i becam not feel lonli at all . i met and talk a lot of peopl . i wa not alon at all . i had to ask peopl where i wa on a map or how to get a hotel which i would stay the night . and also mani peopl talk me where i would go or where i am from . eveyon who i talk were veri kind to me . some of them drove me around their home town for me . they were real tour guid . they knew veri well about their home town and i could tast their real life style . i rememb nice peopl more than beauti build . a town look more beauti when peopl who live there are nice . at a famous spot , usual there are some tour which provi by local govern or an organis . they are good enough to get the inform about the spot . when we travel with a group , we tend to talk the member of the group all the trip and we do not have time to talk with local peopl , which miss wonder part of a trip . when we travel alon , we have to take a responsivir for everyth by ourselv , so we becom more care . of cous , we have to make sure not to go around at night , to have our passport all the time and so on . from my experi , i think that we can feel a town more close , when we travel alon . so i disagre with the statement .
