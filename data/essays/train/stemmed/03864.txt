i agre with the statement , although i believ there are argument for and against thi statement . first , if a student learn onli fact , then it can be especi difficult for them to appli their knowledg to a practic situat . for exampl , a pharmacist who know everyth about chemic formula might find difficulti tri to suggest to a custom what medicin to take , becaus they lack the understand of idea and concept necessari . a student who understand the idea and concept can learn the fact necessari for their job through experi and trial and error . wherea , a student who know onli fact will find it much more difficult to learn idea and concept through practic situat . howev , student must obvious know fact , otherwis their understand of idea and concept ca n't be use . use the earlier exampl , a pharmacist who ha no knowledg of fact but a complet understand of idea and concept will not be abl prescrib a correct medicin to a custom , becaus without know chemic and medic fact , they would not be abl to even guess what medicin to advis . anoth exampl of whi understand idea is more import than fact can be seen in the way languag were taught year ago . mani teacher forc their student to learn onli verb tabl ; for exampl , my grandmoth can repeat verb in french , but ha no idea what they mean or how to use them . if she understood the idea and concept , such as grammar and sentenc structur , she might be abl to creat sentenc in french . howev , without thi understand , her factual knowledg is useless . therefor , we can see that understand concept is more import than learn just fact . in summari , learn just fact is pointless if the student doe not also learn the idea and concept behind these fact . howev , obvious , thi doe not mean that a student can learn onli concept and idea ; they requir a balanc of fact and understand in order to appli and use what they learn .
