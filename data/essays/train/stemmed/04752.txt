young peopl do enjoy life more than older peopl do . in my opinion , young peopl take more chanc and risk , as well as they tri to experi numer thing when they get a chanc . thi becaus they have been present more option in life , they are not as care with their health as older peopl are , and they like to tri new thing in everi occas they can find . life ha evolution and chang in mani aspect in thi last centuri . young peopl like to take chanc and go for what them want . they tend to look beyond what is present to them , and go beyond what is tradit expect . sometim the choic of someth new and differ may not be there , but young peopl will look for it , they will expand their horizon and go further out their boundari . old peopl have more tradit to follow . famili valu are strongli present in their daili live , so they have to follow certain life style that young peopl are not veri interest in . when take a risk , their is alway a fifti percent chanc it might work or it might not . that is what take a risk involv . older peopl are most conserv and might be more afraid to take a risk . a young person is start hi or her life , and might see thing differ . they could see their futur as an uncertainti for the present time , and might be less skeptic to go for it and take the risk of lose someth . differ than older peopl , they might not have a famili to provid to or worri about . they might onli need to worri about themselv . the valu of thing is less import , becaus it might onli have a monetari valu , and not a sentiment valu . thi becaus they are young and have not been around for a long time . older peopl might appreci thing more , sinc they have been here for longer . they appli more valu to thing like a bracelet or ring , than just a financi price . a young person might think that if they lose it , they can replac it from ani jewelri store . some experi come from practic . it can be practic that take a long time to achiev or simpli practic that can be learn quickli by do it a lot in a short period of time . older peopl are suppos to have more experi than young peopl . but it might be in fewer area . young peopl like to experi new thing and tri differr thing . they are more open and know that the world ha mani differ thing to offer , so they tri most of them or as mani as possibl . they are young and healthi , which allow them to travel easier , and eat more ethnic food . in the other hand , older peopl have to take better care of their bodi , sinc their health is more at risk . they ca n't travel long distanc and might need medic that are not alway avail everywher . so they are not abl to enjoy life as much as young peopl can .
