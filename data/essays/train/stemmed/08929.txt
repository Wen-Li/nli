can you imagin your citi with fewer car ? i think that i can imagin madrid , where i live , in that way but i think that it is go to be a hard and a long task . the enviroment problem , the price of the ga and the park space , the traffic jump and the cheap and fast altern instead of the car will push toward the direct of fewer car . one of the mani reason whi i think that will be fewer car in twenti year is that the pollut in the big citi it is a big problem and mani peopl have , and will have , diseas due to thi . the altern are car friendli with the enviro such as the new car design by the japanes brand . other reason whi i think that will be fewer car is that the price of the ga is veri expens due to the war and due to that the peopl are not use their car . the other big problem in the big citi is that there are not enough park space in the street and the price of the exist one are veri high , and can cost as much as one luxuri car . the main reason whi i think that the number of car will be reduc in the futur is that in the main citi there are cheap and fast altern to the car such as the tube or the bu , that can take you to everi part of the citi in no time without be stop in one traffic jump for hour . definet , i think that in the futur will be fewer car but still a lot of car . we can tri to reduc the number of car , but i believ that we can not live without it . we should take the bu or the subway if we can and use the car as the last altern .
