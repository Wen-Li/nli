we all hope that we want to enjoy our live . then thi question come to my mind , which enjoy life more , young peopl or older peopl ? i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . there are three reason . first , young peopl have healthier bodi than older peopl do . second , they have longer time in rest of their live than the older peopl do . third , older peopl tend to say that the younger the better . first of all , young peopl have healthier and stronger bodi than older peopl do . they can continu to work longer , run faster , need shorter time to sleep , and so on than the old peopl do . that mean young peopel can enjoy what the old peopl can not do . for exampl , they can swim in the mornig , go out for lunch , go shop , and have parti with their friend . second , they have longer time remain in their live than the old peopl do . if you want to be a veri good and famou doctor , it will take about ten year to attend medic school and get enough experi as a doctor . young peopl can plan and achiev thi aim becaus they have time . howev , old peopl may not beacus they onli have limit time in rest of their live . final , i often hear old peopl say that the younger the better . i am still young and can onli imagin how the live of old peopl . the old peopl , howev , experienc life of young peopl alreadi and say the younger the better compar their live to the one when they were young . to conclud . i believ young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . they have strong bodi to do anyth they want while old peopl have limit becaus of their health problem . also , young peopl have longer time to do anyth . in addit , old peopl admit that the younger the better . i strongli believ that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . actual , i think , that mean young peopl have to challeng anyth they want and have to enjoy their live to the max .
