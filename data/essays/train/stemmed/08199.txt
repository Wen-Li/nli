i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it is in the interest of advertis to show their product in a better way . i believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus they are tri to sell us a product that we do not realli need . therefor , advertis use beauti peopl in their commerci to convinc us that by buy their product we can look just like them . for exampl , it is common to see on tv an anti-wrinkl cream commerci with a beauti model that did not have wrinkl to start of . most advertis tri to make us feel better for buy their product . therefor , advertis present the produc they are tri to sell in a better present than the one their product origin have . for exampl , we ussuali see food comerci were the product look much better and tastier than it realli is . we actual get disapoint onc we tri that product . advertis agenc are privat busi that have to gener profit for their sharehold . as a result , advertis will use everi possibl scheme to trick us into buy their product . i believ that commerci and other advertis should be view with a critic eye . it is in the best interest of advertis to make us beleiv that their product are much better than they realli are . as a result , advertis use model and paid actor to convinc us into bu their product . advertis make their product seem much better than they realli are in order for us to buy them . advertis agenc are busi that look out for their own interest , and that will use almost everi mean to achiev these interest .
