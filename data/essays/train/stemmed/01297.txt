as you all know mani student choos to learn what it is written in their book rather to see the main idea behind it . thi lead to develop gener , who wait for other to think and accept their idea as a truth without question it . so it is veri import for young peopl to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . firstli , when you are take a math class or ani other subject relat to scienc you have to learn the main principl of the subject in order to succeed . for exampl you can not just say someth fall down when it is drop . you have to know that there is an extern forc call graviti , which keep all subject on the ground or make them fall when they are in the air . without understand the main reason or think about the caus you can not make ani progress for yourself and the other . secondli , it is not onli true that someon should learn the main idea for the scienc relat subject . also in other area like histori or polit ( especi in polit ) you should know the reason whi someth happen or go to happen . unfortunetlli mani student believ that histori is onli about learn war or import charect in order , but histori is more than that . without the background inform on the fact , for exampl the wwii , you will never understand whi the american have to go into europ in order to support england . in thi exampl it is import to understand that england wa the onli countri against the nazi-germani and need help in order to prevent the groth of nazi-era , but without thi inform it will be just anoth war in the human histori . final mani student say that they have mani think to learn and to understand the idea behind everyth requir much time , but that is onli a misunderstand . especi in engin subject , such as program , you can not learn everi singl command , becaus there are to mani of them ! the main point of program is to know how to build an algorithm and how to translat it into the program languag need . the rest can be done by everyon with a littl experi in comput . to sum up , fact are noth compar to the idea behind them . in order to take an import part in the societi peopl should produc their own idea , otherwis they will be noth more than a slave . in order to do that you need to understand the main idea .
