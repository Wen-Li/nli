i entir agre with thi statement due to the follow factor : first of all , i think that fuel will becom more expens and for mani peopl it will be hard to afford go by car . anoth reason whi i think that there will be fewer car in the futur is becaus of the high pollut and the smog in the world , which is mostli produc by the car driver . nowaday there are also far too mani car on the street . there is a lot of traffic ervey day and park spot are quit limit in sever area . sometim it would be much faster to go by public transport than to go by car and tri to find a park spot . becaus of these mass of car on the street the pollut will just increas . all these factor mention abov should encourag the peopl to stop drive and start go by public transport . but evid they do n't ! fuel can get more expens and more expens , but the peopl are still drive more than ever . i still think that the number of car in use will be reduc . not by the peopl itself , but by restrict of the govern . in my opinion it is the duti of the govern to prevent the countri from more pollut and smog . i am sure that in the next ten year there will be quit a few suggest from the govern tri to limit the number of car . it will not be a veri easi task for them , becaus they will have to convinc the peopl who are use to drive a car to go by public transport or mayb just to walk . i think for most of the peopl not be abl to go by car anymor will be a loss of their freedom and flexibilti . it will be import to show them the altern and also to build up a strong publich transport , where you are as flexibl and free as in a car . i know that it wo n't be easi to reduc the number of car , but i think it is a task to be done in order to keep the world a clean place and i am sure that it will be done !
