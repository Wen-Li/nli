i think the best way to travel is in an group of peopl led by a tour guid becous travel will be more confort to all of us and we all will get the inform of the place we visit . in the other hand travel alon will be more expens that travevel in an group , cost will be split for all travel . i rememb one time i travel alon to mexico citi and my money wa realli short but took the risk and i travel . then when i wa in the citi i realiz that the best will be travel with someon . i spent the ninght with some friend becous i had not enougt money to retourn to my citi , then next time that i consid to tavel by my self would not be a option . travel in an group not onli have the econom benefit , you can meet peopl and have an nice long trip chate with new friend . i met someon in a tour to acapulco , and we all have fun i still have touch with them but they are n't in mexico anymor . the best way to have my next vacat will be by have a tour guid , they may know more the citi that i do , in fact that 's is their job , to show up the citi and indic the best way and place to spent time . i will recoment to have a tour guid , famili will have much fun that get lost look for some place in special . that is realli usual when get parent think that they alreadi know about the place they will visit . i agre with thi point and will not get ani tour by my self , not if i do n't the exactli inform .
