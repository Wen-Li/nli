some peopl say that young peopl enjoy life more than older poepl do . howev , person , i disagre thi opinion . i think that older peopl can enjoy life more than yonger peopl . i will give you some reason to support my choic . my primari reason is that older peopl have more time and money for enjoy their life than youger . youger peopl , like studesnt have a lot of thing that they have to do . so i don ' t think that they have much time for spend life realli . in fact , now i 'm stude art at the bunsai colleg . in bunsai collef student learn art and english everi day . teacher both art and english at bunsai alway give us a lot of assin . so student alway are busi . they also can not have a littl part time job . as a resolt , we have no time and no money . thi everi day life give student strong stress . other reason is that older peopl have more experi than yonger peopl , so i think that they know real good thing for enjoy life . for exsampl , i have a lot of kind of interest thing . for exampl , draw pictur , danc , sing a song , i want to tri to everth . but time is limit . i think that older pepl will be abl to chooc a best way rapidri . as a reult , they can spend time use . therefor , i disagre with that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
