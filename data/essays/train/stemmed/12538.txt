i person believ that the number of car will increas in the follow twenti year . the onli thing that may inhibit thi trend is a strong committ , support by all the import countri , to the safeti of the environ . i will tri to support my opinion consid the follow argument : - urbanist pattern ; - `` car habit '' evolut ; - the distribut of wealth ; - other mean of transport 's trend ; - purpos for which peopl move ; - last , but not less import , individu econom condit . urbanist pattern citi are chang shape and numer studi and research state that in twenti year nearli 90 % of the popul will leav in citi area . thi might increas the need of car . a limit would be given by local law intend to manag the trafic , for exampl inhibit the access to downtown . `` car habit '' evolut technolog is help to make car into in more and more effici mean of transport , with lower cost than in the past . thi might incres the number of peopl who can afford to buy a car . thi point is strictli connect with that of the `` distribut of wealth '' . the evolut of the other mean of transport is strictli link with polit and the big issu tackl by governa . if governa choos to enlarg public spend support the construct of train , subway , and all the other `` public '' mean of transport , peopl will be offer an altern to the car , but if governa miss thi point , car will still be use as a preferenti way to move from one place to anoth . anoth point is the reason whi peopl move , that might be busi , leisur , etc . . in the last few year the number of peopl move for leisur purpos is increas and thi , combin with the fear to move away from home due to recent terrorist attack , may increas the use of car . all of thi is true onli if individu econom condit remain those of today ( or even better ) . but if thi doe n't happen , there will be no money for car . perhap no money for anyth !
