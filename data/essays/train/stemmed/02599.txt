accord to my view in thi twenti year there will be higher usuag of car than there are today becaus noweverday peopl are think to have much luxuri and comfart travel . so the best way of all those comfart is car . where as in thi present gener car show the royal look of ur famili and how are they rang . nowev day mani peopl are perfer to go by car becaus go on other vechil like bike and local train , there caus there caus lot of disturb and polluat . where as when u go with ur own car you can go out on your owm time no disturb no poluat and can have have a safe drive by your selv . in thi presnt day poluat ha becam a major problem in the world wide so by go on car ur can prevent sound poluat and you can go anywher as u like ani time ani where . by go on car we can move to the excepet place soonli and safe with out ani poluat and disturb . otherwis we need to wait for train for bu or we shuld move befor the place befor except time to go earlier . there are mani more way and advantag of a car where as a larg famaili can travel easili and comfartli and these day mani thi car are use like mobil bussi justlik small store and can sell anyth . i conclud that in the twenti year have been use much and by mani peopl becaus it ha got mani advantag and save over time to move from one place to anoth .
