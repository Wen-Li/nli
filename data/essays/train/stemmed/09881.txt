i certainli think that have a broad rang of knowloedg is better than know a onli one subject deepli . howev what i mean is littl bit differ than what it sound like . for exmapl , if you are a leader of the orchestra , it is realli import for you to know all the techniqu that are use in lead a orchestra . howev it can be better if that person know how to play piano or other instrument , so he can at least know that feel and share the pressur of peopl who are follow hi sign . therefor i conclud that know mani academ subject in one broad speicif subject would be the best . these are the exampl . misto takil , one of the most respect orchestra leader in japan . legend creater of yokimusa orchestra . question is whi wa he so great ? he wa a great leader , hi techniqu were concis and simpl to follow , therefor it reduc the confus of player who are follow , but that did not made him legend . he had someth more than that ; hi abil of play piano and violin wa good as a profession , he could teach a concert master how to play a piano or violion middl of the practic . he wa also an expert in music histori , he wa abl to , and actual give lectur about music histori in tokyo univers . by know how to play instrument , he ha share the feel with player , and give them better , simpler lead . by know the music histroy , he understood better about the song . he knew broadli about hi profess . that is what made him great . kim mari , world famou zoologist who design nanj zoo . she ha been famou becaus of her excel and effect design of zoo . howev for her to reach thi level , she had to finish 5 major . first she ha major in medicin , second anim medic care , third three-dimens design , fourth build construct and last but not least , zoolog . she ha gone through all that to becom the best in her area . she know so broad about what she is do , she could becom the best in her subject . therefor i conclud that know broad rang about one subject is the best answer to the question . if you take littl bit of everyth , it doe not give you depth understad and it doe not help you a lot , howev if you decreas the rang and studi deepli about all the subject around your profess , it will give you lot of credit , it also might relat to other big subject as well . you can possibl argu that einstein wa a math maniac who did not know anyth els except math and physic . but he wa geniu in a centuri , veri except case ! if you are not , and to be great in your area , i think it would be more benefici for you to know broad rang over your subject .
