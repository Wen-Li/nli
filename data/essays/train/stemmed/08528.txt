today we can see on televis mani kind of advertis . these kind can attract our attent or not . mani time televis 's advertis attract my attent about some product that realli are not interest for me . but the scatch and the music are made so care that i ca n't refus to watch them . these advertis attract so much my attent that i want immedi to buy that product also if it doe n't is useful for me realli . onli after i understand that the product is not how i imagin it watch it on televis , but it 's realli differ . for exampl when i saw a realli beauti advertis of a watch on tv , i immedi went to buy it . but when i took it in my hand , it look realli differ from the watch i saw on televis and i wa not so happi to have bought it as i thought . so i understood that what i like wa not the object watch on tv , but hi advertis . some other advertis are not so good and often , when they pass on televis , i do n't watch them veri well . but often these advertis present an object that is much better than the one well present on tv . for exampl i never paid attent to a particular pair of jean that often i watch on tv ; the advertis wa not realli good and so it never took my attent . but when i went to buy a pair of jean , after i tri mani pair of them , i bought the pair of jean i saw on televis that never paid my attent . it wa realli confort and i like it . so i agre with thi statement becaus mani time what seem to be good on televis is not realli so , while what on tv seem not so interest perhap it can be good and can like me when i see it in my hand .
