advertis is a veri import part of busi nowaday and the aim is to sell . if you turn on the televis you 're most like to fall on commerci and thi is veri specif of the unit state . i do think that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . just by the lighten , the way it is shot , food look systemat better on tv or in pictur than in your plate . there aim be to sell , they are not go to tell you that , in a month , your new vacuum cleaner will be broken or that it will leav dirt on your carpet . they want to show the best featur of the product and highlight it to the extrem . the problem is that sometim commerci lie and that thing should be defin and rule becaus when you invest money on a product and expect a lot out of it , not becaus you are demand but becaus you have been promis someth , you are in your costum 's right to demand repar . it seem like there is no rule in advertis and that lie ha becom a common talent but i do think that thi type of practic ha it dark side . in fact , anyon can tell when a commerci is over-sel a product to the point where it get obvious and ridicul outrag . few poepl are actual fool by these . we are awar of it and have come to find it rather funni . but doe thi give a bad imag to the compani and the product ? i do think so . i have a tendenc to think that they are not seriou with their costum and therefor i am not interest in buy such a product . if the first answer to `` do advertis make product seem much better than they are ? '' wa `` ye '' i would give it a second thought and say that the ridicul of most of them total diminish the work and the money spent on what is suppos to make the product look good . for me advertis fail at that by fail at take poepl serioulsli .
