young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i am against thi statement and have strong point to support myself . we read the newspap and magazin and see that it onli the young peopl domin the front page and parti scene . thi creat a gener misconcept in peopl 's mind that the youth age is the age when life is meant to enjoy rather than when we 're forti or fifti plu . we might think that thi is true , but if we put ourselv in , say , our father 's shoe . we conclud that life is all about go to work in the morn and come back home tire . thi is n't fun right ? well , now that a misconcept . older peopl attain enjoy in place where we do n't see anyth but a bore event . let me compar myself and my dad . i enjoy myself by go out to the movi with my friend etc. , which i do n't usual see my dad do . doe that mean that my dad doe n't enjoy life ? wrong . my dad love hi work and take pleasur in go to work everyday , and even on sunday . he ca n't stand sit home just lie in front of the televis have pizza and sunda . that wa suppos to be fun for me but for my dad , no ! my dad realli enjoy hi earli morn yoga session and tenni game , and realli look forward to them . to me these are noth but time wast which could be spent in sleep , go out to parti etc . whenev i take a close look at my dad i notic that he is realli happi and enjoy life to the fullest while i 'm not . conclud , it all depend on the way we analyz the given statement . we may think we 're the one get most out of our live but no , older peopl also have a life and look forward to it more than we do .
