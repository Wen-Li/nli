accord to carl marx : '' a person older than you in one minut is a hundr time wiser '' . nowaday learn is a prioriti in everi civilis man 's life . no one could live in th 21st centuri without have a minimum of khowleg . to be a succesful and wise person your khowleg should be widespread in severla field and deep in one of these domain . in thi modern way of live , work in ani field oblig you to be knowled in mani domain . for exampl a person that is manag a juic industri should khow about plant manag , mechan engen ( to fix the machin ) , financ , market . .. that show hoe knowleg ha no limit and everi one of us should seek for learn as much as he can . a broad khowleg increas the number of field we can work in . that 's the onli way we could developp our potenti and increas our chanc to suc in thi challeg and compet woke field . on the other hand if a person is not specialis in a specif subject she ca n't be a leader in ani work domain . everi one of us should have not onli a broad khnoleg , but also a deep studi in a certain field . for exmpl thi same plant manag should show to the employe that he is superior than them in a certain field like market . that knowleg will help him to find new advertis trick that will increas the sale . in the market part of thi industri he will be a leader and will be respect by everi won . in summari , both broad khowleg and specialis are import . the first provid a bigger choic of work field and the second give us the oppurtin to be a leader in a certain domain .
