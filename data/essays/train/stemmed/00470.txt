in gener , a person with normal mental abil ca n't know a lot of subject with a deep knowledg of each one . it impli that a person must choic between a broad or a specif knowledg of the academ subject . in my point of view it 's better to have a huge knowledg of academ subject . infact the advantag follow by it 's are much more numer than the disadvantag . in particoular : first of all a wide knowledg of the scholast matter can help a person in all the aspect of the life that can includ social relationship , polit choich , religi belief . if a knowledg is complet in hi wide it becom an use istrument for do right choich in these critic event that occur to everyon along all the lifespan . the second reason is more pratic then the first and is about the opportun that a huge knowledg can bring to a person in the research of an employe . infact an peopl who are in poss of vast notion have much more altern for find a job then peopl who have a specif knoledg . on the other side there are some disadvantag in have a broad knowledg . in particoular they are : it 's a common opinion that peopl who learn a vast number of gener notion `` know everyth and know noth at the same time '' . in other word the lack of specif notion can be seen as a total unknowledg . the second is that the futur of a person with a broad knowledg is uncertain for sever year .
