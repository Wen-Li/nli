certainli , these day it is said young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . in fact , it might be dicreas time that young peopl help their commun littl by littl . but they still give enough time to help thier commun . i disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . the primari reason is that a lot of young peopl work for commun . parhap the best exampl to illustr thi point is that where i live , in japan , there are farmer . some elder peopl do not have the person who succeed in them . so it must be difficult for them to keep on work . but young peopl like student of univers or commun colleg help farmer a lot . second , young peopl help the elder peopl in their hous . there are a lot of elder peopl who can not do thing by him or herself in japan . the exampl of thi is that mani young peopl help elder peopl in their hous and also in the rouzin home , which is the home take care for elder peopl . young peopl help them to go to the rest room or to clearn them up with hot water or to make them eat easili . consid the abov factor , i disagre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun .
