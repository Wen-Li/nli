from my person experi the best way to travel is not by be led by a tour guid , it 's better to plan your own journey . it is true that it not an easi process , but you have much more benefit . for exampl , the money is a perfect factor to talk about . some agenc often charg you to much money to organ your trip , and it could not be a god idea to loos all that money when you could save the 50 percent of what you spent . you have differ stategi to find solut . for exampl , involv place to stay , such as hostel that you find in the internet that are cheper . the experi is one of the most import element of plan your own trip . the process of make your own desicion and go whear ever you want can becom realli fun . last summer i went to europ and went to spain , franc and germani . i organ the hole trip , day by day and it becam a real success . it is true that problem occur dure the trip , but i think that those are part of the thing that creat the adventur of the experi . anoth factor is that most agenc alreadi have the citi in wich they are go to travel , so you do n't have mani choic to explor . on the other hand , the liberti of my schedul gave me the oportun of even go to england for just a coupl of day and in a short notic . the schedul is led by you and not by anyon els , give you the liberti in a place whear you had never gone to . there is no better feel than be in a huge place were time is not a factor and liberti is taken . in a sens you feel so small and alon in a enorm contin but ironicli you becom stronger and bigger as all the experi satisfi your expect . so in gener i think that backpag is an experi that everi human be must have in hi life . there is adventur , clueless bahaviour and surpris that a tour guid could not offer you .
