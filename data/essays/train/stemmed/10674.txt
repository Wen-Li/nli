thi ha alway been a controversi and complex question . as we do not hve a clear boarderlin for the word '' young '' and `` old '' , it is complic to judg thi matter . in my oppinion , i think it depend . differ peopl have differ point of view of life . that is the most curcial reason whi i think it depend . we can not simplili decid which enjoy better . to illustr , when i wa littl , i use to live near the coast , my grandmoth often take me to the beach and tell me about her life and thing she felt happi about . i can feel the love and pure joy . we had a great time . i can tell from my feel and her smile that we are all enjoy our life at that moment . we can feel the joy and happi from the bottom of our heart . i do not think i can tell the differ between our joyful giggl . thu , i can not tell who enjoy life more . we face variou situat everyday . how we feel about these eveyday problem effect our feel toward life . as some of the old peopl have come across mani hardtim their whole life , they seem to look blue everyday . some complain about the commun frequent , the other often sit togeth and gossip about other peopl 's busi . they never look satisfi and alway feel dull . to me , i do not think they enjoy their life . they do not seem to understand the mean of life -- to be confid and alway believ that tomorrow is anoth day . when ever i see a littl joy kid pass by a old ladi with unsatisfict in her eye , i constantli believ that in some case , youth enjoy life more than eld . on the contray . nowday thousand and thousand of youth are addict to the internet , durg , and all kind of harm thing like that . they think they are estact when they are do the wrong thing . are they enjoy life as they think they are ? i believ the answer is i strong oppos . compar with the laugh we heard when an old coupl celebr their 60 anniversari , i think some young peopl should someth from them . thu , i think it depend .
