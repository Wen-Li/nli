our popul is evolv toward induvidu more and more each day . what wa consid proper and in the line of duti is now consid boar and out of date . children tend to think that spend time to help other , is wast possibl time to take care of themself . by becom more selfish we forget to help our commun . young peopl do not see what is import in spend time with differ peopl , they reli on themself for everyth and think other should do the same . but our societi ha not chang as fast as they think . the world still need help . for exampl i use to live in a small villag were everi decit were made with our whole commun , we would attend meet and decid on how to resolv each problem with the young and the old . i went back to thi town a few year ago and realis that children were not even attend the reunion . thi show how much they care . but on the other hand young peopl have less time on their sheschul to help other . with the work load we have at school and the activ we attend , it doe not even leav much space for leisur . so how could we spend time help out other when we first need to finish everyth els . i spend my time between class dure the day , in the afternoon i have teni lesson and at night i prepar my self for the test i have the next day , when could i possibl help other ? i believ that us , the adult of tomoro are more preoccupi by are own problem then our commun , and it is a shame to see thi happen . but at the same time our live are fill with work and expect for our futur , that need to be accomplish in the first place for us to go on .
