i person believ that it is true that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . thi is quit clear to me as we see how local event , such as festiv and `` hinoyoujin '' going-around ( the japanes tradit local patrol , perform at the end of each year , to warn a local commun to be care with the fire ) are excut by old and bare see young peopl to be involv . it is not `` enough '' becaus it show the lack of the sens of commun among the young peopl and , i believ , the sens of commun is essenti to a healthi societi . my primari reason to say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun is that we no longer see young peopl to attend local event like we use to did . for exampl , in the past , to my parent time , it had been a due for young peopl to attend local event , such a festiv , and there everybodi in the commun got to know everybodi . as the result , they had stronger sens of commun so that they are more apt to get help from each other and peopl could help more secur to live in the erea so to rais their kid . but , as time goe by , later gener start attend local event less and less . nowaday young peopl stop attend local event . in the case of my home town , a small citi , popul of about 100,000 in okayama prepectur , japan , we rare see peopl in my age or younger are involv in the local event . that show that the sens of commun is get weaker at least in one part of japan and i do not think thi is uniqu to thi local commun . of cours , it is also true that they are mani young peopl who is help their commun . when
