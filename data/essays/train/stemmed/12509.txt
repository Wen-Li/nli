nowaday most of the peopl could n't do without their car . there is no doubt that the grade of depend upon the car vari consider depend on the cultur and the countri we are focus on . for exampl , in the american way of life a car is simpli essenti , while the citicen of amsterdam , for instanc , make a greater use of bicicl than car . howev , we desperatli depend on someth that must have and end and whose end is unlik veri close : oil . therefor , everybodi would agre in the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . perhap twenti year is n't a long time but i 'm sure that we are at a turn point . in my opinion there have alreadi ben made incred improv that would have help us to move toward ecolog car . howev , i 'm certain that at thi point it ha n't been interest econom speak pute them in the market . more than onc have we heard in the news that an engin ha final discov how to build a car that work with hidrogen or other organ materi . howev , just as happen with the power industri of medica , sometim an improv is iron not benefiti . i probabl sound tremend skeptic but i must say that i 'm hope that someday not in a long time somebodi will make a car that doe n't pollut and depend on a renov good . that would defin caus an increas in that car 's demand , what would mean a dicreas in the use of the tradit car . anyway , even if my best wish do n't come true , i would still believ that in twenti year time a decres in the use of the tradit car will occur in the develop countri . to ilustr my point i will take china as an exampl . the popul in china is huge and , while most of europ and north america ha alreadi experi a crazi develop period that ha lead them to industrialis and our actual welfar , china and mani other asiat countri are now at that point . and , unlik , we can not demand en ecolog conscious from them , when we ourselv have had non of it . and if all the chines buy a car . ..
