the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' ha been often said . most peopl say that they need a car to be flexibl and have the control over their person timetabel where they can decid where they want to be at ani time . peopl need their car as their statu symbol , to show how rich they are becaus their earn enough money to pay tax and these high ga prize . on the other hand you see how natur show the power human bee that mother natur 's sourc are nearli empti and that there is no chanc of produc ga in such a short time , like peopl like to have it . anoth reason , to have fewer drive car on the planet in twenti year , will be the , alreadi excist , high polut . when we get these high degre like we had it thi summer , the peopl will start die much earlier becaus of the unhealthi air they inhal . in my opinion , i hope that these lead peopl out their will open their eye to the import , to support natur . i sometim have the feel that they do n't see the natur catastrophi out there , which are our fault , too . we throw our gase into the air with our car . and natur show us the revench with heavi rain or other extrem weather condit . nevertheless i think , we need car . but , mayb , we will develop a sourc which everyon can use without loos their power of the car . or find anoth way of traffic , which we do n't know yet .
