in my opinion enjoy in life ha lot to do with age . it not onli requir a sourc and time to enjoy but als the spirit and energi requir to spend in enjoy . young peopl enjoy alot than the older peopl doe becaus of variou reason . reason like eneri , experi , spirit and time . young peopl are complet satiat with energi . as their muscl are in a grow stage or in an alreadi develop stage , young peopl find it veri easi to enjoy . whether it is a matter of sport , parti or disco or the matter of learn . some sport like the basebal , footbal , basket ball and mani other requir an energet bodi and grown muscl like in box or wresl . older peopl lack thi sourc requir for enjoy . due to lack of experi mani young peopl takin mani difficulti as challeng and strive hard to overcom it . thi in turn excit them , thrill them and provid a mean for enjoy . for exampl when a boy for the first time approach a pet anim like a dog , he ha no knowledg about how the dog may react . but when he find the anim veri kind he enjoy in spend time with it . anoth reason is the confid and the spirit which the young peopl have than the older one . when we feel more confid we tri to undertak even the most difficult task . get some tuff time in complet that task sure enjoy us . spirit is an essenti requir to begin and even give an end to someth . old peopl have face mani difficulti in through out there life , lack spirit to do the similar job . they find it bore to do the sameth which thay have been do sinc mani year . on the other hand young peopl find it realli excit to start a task to which they had never been befor . older peopl especi those who ha a famili and a job to take care of , work lot of hour in their offic . these peopl can hardli find few hour from their busi schedul to even watch a cricket match . they spend almost ten hour in their factori , offic or other work place for their earn . and the young one they readili find time for enjoy . as soon as their homework got finish and prepar were made , young kid they just go outsid their home to spend a pleasant time play with their friend or danc in a parti . in summari , i will onli say that young peopl with no responsibilti of anyon enjoy alot than the elder peopl . wherea the elder didnt get a chanc to enjoy as they have mani responsibilait . howevw they enjoy when they wenwer young .
