i do not agre with thi statement . oppos , there will be even more car than there are today . peopl are more and more interest in statu symbol ; therefor , they want bigger and better car . thi is not onli repres by the huge varieti of possibl we have to buy a car nowaday : we can hand in our old car and pay less for the new car bought at the same firm ; we can buy car onli use for exhibit a lot cheaper than they would have been normal ; we are abl to leas car and even if someon is not a doctor , he might well be abl to drive a new merced . due to thi import of luxuri good , peopl demand for better thing . the car industri is alreadi make use of thi becaus i have never seen as much advertis for car as i do at the moment . they advertis on poster on the street , in magazin , in the cinema , and the car industri seem to becom bigger and bigger rather than smaller . as we all know , car pollut the environ . i live in frankfurt and i rememb those electron board put up on big street in the citi center where peopl are ask to refer more to puplic transfer . on the other hand , and i can onli speak for myself , it is just more conveni to drive my own car , listen to my own music and drive at my own speed ; so i will definit not be use more public transfer in the nearer futur . consid my point of view , i am veri sure that there will not be fewer car in twenti year than there are today .
