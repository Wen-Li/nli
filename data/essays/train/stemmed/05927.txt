though some peopl might think travel in a group arrang by the travel agent is the most suitabl way of travel , i strongli disagre with it and i consid the best way to travel is by individu . in my first place , the cost of travel by individu is significantli lower than by a group . you need to pay more servic charg to the tour guid , to the hotel , or ani addit charg when travel in a group , you may have a question in mind , `` what is the cost differ between them ? '' from my experi to boston in unit state , travel in a group would cost about hk $ 10,000 , while travel by individu would cost about $ hk 6,000 . it is onli two-third of the cost by travel in a group . my second reason is that travel in a group is not flexibl for the schedul of your trip . you need to follow a standard schedul to eat , to play or to wake up at specif time while it just like work . the main purpos of have a trip is to relax while the tight schedul would not make thi origin goal effect . for instanc , if i want to stay a place for a longer time and enjoy more there , it is up to my decis by travel alon . i can manag my time in my own interest instead of follow a standard time schedul . final , i consid that travel alon would explor more than you expect . you can decid to go to ani place to learn the differ custom where it would realli broaden your horizon and make you becom independ . you can obtain ani kind of inform by find them out yourself and get a deeper insight on them . for exampl , you can live in a host famili for a coupl of day to experi their cultur . thi would be realli benefici to you . to conclud , i love the experi that onli travel alon would give me .
