although i can imagin reason whi peopl would consid learn of fact as the most import task of student , becaus in some situat a specif knowledg is a great advantag and all that count , i totali agre with the statement name abov . i do share the opinion that the understand of gener idea and concept is more import for sever reason . first , thi abil is transfer to mani situat and subject . for exampl even if a person chang her major subject of studi , it is still possibl to use the accomplish knowleg of method and concept in the new subject . on the contrari , the simpl fact of the previou studi are most of the time no longer useful . second , human brain are onli abl to provid a limit number of fact at the same time , so peopl will not rememb detail of fact after a few month or year and need to relearn them anyway . accord to my opinion , anoth reason to judg the learn of fact less import is the current way of live . becaus of the fast technolog develop in our centuri , a reason amount of fact which you learn today might be toal useless veri quickli . for exampl some program languag which were commonli use onli a few year ago are now not up to date ani longer . thi technolog environ also enabl peopl to get to know specif fact veri fast by start research in the internet , which make the knowldeg of fact even less import . but it is necessari to be abl to distinguish the qualiti of web page , which lead again to the argument that a gener knowledg is import . becaus of those reason state abov , i came to the conclus , that the knowledg of fact is time limit and be capabl of use gener concept and idea will last longer and are therefor more effici than fact .
