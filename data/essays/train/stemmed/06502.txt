nowaday when you are in the street , the first thing you can notic is the amount of car that each day collaps the road of the citi sinc the first minut earli in the morn . the fact of see hundr of car in the street depend on the countri you are , and the citi in that certain countri too , as not all the citi have the same traffic level . here in spain , you can easili notic the differ when you travel to madrid and when you come to my citi , burgo . in madrid it is nearli imposs to go out by car wherea in burgo you do not usual have problem with the traffic . from my humbl point of view , i think that peopl is becom in geren veri lazi when have to choos whether to use the car or not . in madrid , i would not use the car becaus it is obviou that you arriv everywher befor if you go by bu or underground . in the other hand , in a small citi like burgo it is healthier to go by bu or even walk as distanc are veri short . it might sound extrang after have said thi but , i do have drive licenc although i don ' t have a car but i hope not to becom an obses girl with my car in the futur and not to use it unless it is neccessari . due to thi lazi societi that we are creat and the fact that we are all the time improv the car , which make peopl more interest in them , i think that in the futur we wo n't be abl to solv thi problem . if nowaday we disagre with the number of car that we are see each day , i think that thi is noth compar with the amount of them that each day are go to appear for exampl in twenti year time . in the end , i would like to add that by the contrari , i think that we will have to assum it as it is part of the evolut and developp of our industri and tecnolog .
