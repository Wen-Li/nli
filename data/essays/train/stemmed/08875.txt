i do not agre `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the reason is follow . first , the day schedul is alreadi decid . that is , we do not have enough time to see freeli , when we go to veri larg sightse place . thi is just my experi . when i wa 8year old , i went to kyoto . there veri famou classicla japanes cityand there are so mani templ . that time , i took a tour guid . the schedul wa so dens . so tour guid allow us just 30 minut for one place . while the turip , time wa too fast . i could not recal where i went and see . it wa just like take pictur about object without the emot . i want to say that to see what i need feeli is best memori thing in my heart , becaus thi is in my intent in my travel . second , group tour is difficult to have direct commun with peopl who live in the place . to enjoy the travel , we need strong impress about citi and peopl . if we talk with the peopl who live there , we awar about the place what we do not awar of see surfac of the place-build or construct . for exampl , when i went to hawaii , i had a chanc to talk with peopl who live in hawaii in park . that day is the special festiv for tem . they told me whi they were celebr . moreov where is the best place to see the sunset . thi inform is just know about peopl who live in there . thi is a good chanc to see real life in there . i am alway enjoy commun with the peopl llike abov . moreov good accid becam good memori after travel . treavel is freeli is best for me becaus of abov reason .
