will we have more car in the futur or not ? thi is a question that mani peopl would like to find out whether they are car produc , environmentalist , or just regular peopl who either take public transport or own a car . howev , i think it is import to address that differ part of the world might have differ result . it is becaus peopl in differ place give differ cultur meanign of the car and they might have differ prioriti in relat to what is imporatnt to them as a group . i will start by point out how differ place preceiv car in some way and how these differ might increas or decreas car in the futur . first , in some develop countri , such as china , car is a symbol of modern and wealth . when thi connect is form and built , it is quit difficult to expect that poepl will decreas car in use within twenti 20 year sinc what peopl desir is develop . and , thi imag of develop happend to also mean `` have car . '' in thi sens , i think it is quit unrealisit to agre that peopl will diminish the amount fo car . after all , the major goal of these place is econom develop and decreas the ownership of car contracdict to their major goal . on the other hand , for some place in the world , especi countri in the west , the mean of car and the proriti of what is impor to them are differ . to them , car is more or less mere a tool . although i do realiz that some peopl in the west aslo use car as a symbol of prestig , there is a degre differ in relat to how stronger that a car is tie with the concept of modern . meanwhil , peopel in teh west might think the envirn protect is at least as import as develop , if it is not more import . in thi sens , when car do not carri such strong desir of be modern , meanwhil the idea of environmenti is appreci , it is more like that there will be less car in the nearli futur . therefor , i think teh amount of car will decras in some area in the world meanwhil decreas in other area depend on differ context and the symbol mean of car in differ cultur . i think it is problemat to make a univers statment on thi issu .
