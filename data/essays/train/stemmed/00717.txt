young peopl nowaday tend to be less help to the commun . i think there is quit a varieti of reason for that phenomen . firstli , time nowaday is quit rare . there is a wide rang of person and institut that requir our time . from child to adult peopl have to do a lot of educ and gain some practic experi . at the begin of a lifetim parent and teacher want us to learn . some year later job is requir addit educ . it seem as if educ is alway a main topic in a life . nowaday thing are get faster and more is be expect . thi prevent young peopl from invest time in project that limit their own educ and spare time . secondli , especi in citi live a lot of peopl . for inhabit of citi it is not possibl to know all or just a larg part of them . but befor peopl desid to help someon , they often want to know at least some detail about who is go to have an advantag . as long as you do not know who is go to have an advantag , you need a lot more of encourag . i made that experi as well when i wa learn for my exam . i choos a quit room in zurich to studi . but i had to find out that a lot of peopl just do not care about other . their first aim wa to get their problem solv , which requir a talk to other peopl . furthermor , societi nowaday doe not realli expect us to help commun and therefor doe not honor it if we do so . final , it can be said that a lot of peopl - as long as they do not get an immedi return on their help - are not readi for provid assist in ani form .
