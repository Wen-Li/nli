everyday the peopl are expos to a varieti of inform set and detail . in my opinion the thing that matter is not the amount of the inform and he fact about thi inform set but the idea and the concept that are embed within these inform test . as a result i can say yhat i agre with the statement that '' it is import for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . there are support reason whi i think like that . first reason whi i agree with the statement is the fact that there are huge number of fact and detail in so mani lectur . for exampl , as an econom student in everi macroeconom cours we see a lot of detail about the polici that the countri follow to decreas inflat . in these polici sever countri are contrast accord to which type of polici it pursu . in my point of view , here the crucial point must be the idea and concept that are relat to the polici of variou countri . it doe not make sens if the student are forc to learn the inflat rate in each countri for a specif period of time . second reason is that when student are oblig to learn the fact and other unneccessari detail there would exist some seriou problem that are relat to concentr of the student in learn the topic . for instanc in my histori class , our lectur had forc us to learn all the date for the war that our nation had . as thi wa the situat , i simpli concentr on the specif date and did not even focu on the idea and concept of the war . that is to say , i just learn the date but could not get ani idea about the caus and consequ of the war , which are more crucial aspect than the date . as a result i pass the cours without know the basic idea and concept . in conclus , the student should be encourag to understand the idea and the concept rather than the fact . by do so , student can learn more effici and they can be awar of more concept . moreov , when the student are exempt from learn the fact and unneccessari detail , they will sure focu and concentr on the topic that they are handl . thu a well develop gener may be creat by pursu such kind of a polici .
