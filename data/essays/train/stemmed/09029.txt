nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun becaus they are more thing to do . i think that young peopl like would help their commun but they have not the time for do it . an exampl i go at univers everyday when to back go at home i studi , eat , sleep and i have not the time to talk with my friend . i have not time to talk with my friend and i do n't help the peopl more near to me for thi reason i can not help my commun . i think that mani peopl like me have same problem becaus nowaday in the life there are more stress than in the past . i do n't think that one person do n't help her-hi commun if he/sh can do it . today we think onli at to work becaus in thi societi is the best opportun for to have much money and to have in thi way a good life . in the past , pherap , there is not the stress that there is nowaday . i know that thi a incorrect behavior but i want to think about me befor of to think to help my commun . howev when i can give enough to help my commun i do n't have problem do it . infact in my life i help mani peopl also becaus i work without to earn money in the hospit howev when i had more free time while now with the univers i have not time . in my opinion thi problem is onli problem about the time , the fast to live and other problem of thi type but no for chois .
