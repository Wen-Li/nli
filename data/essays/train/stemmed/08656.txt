after ponder thi question thoroughli and prudent , i final reach the point that it depend . if a student want to go directli into the workforc after graduat , it 's may better for him to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . on the other hand , if anoth student want to becom a specialist in a given domain , i think he 'd better special in that one specif subject . nowaday the number of colleg student who hunt for a job just after graduat keep increas . mainli becaus they are awar of that differ job requir differ knowledg or skill . some job requir a student can use a comput fluentli and skill , some may hope a student to be capabl to speak differ kind of lauguag , and some other may just use those whose have the intens abil of coorpor and sccializ . to mee to variou requir of job , student should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . take my sister for exampl . befor graduat , she did n't know what job exactli she want to pursu . but sinc she had broad knowledg gain from mani subject in colleg . she sent innumer applic to veri divers compani . guess what ? all of those compani said ok to her . and then she could choos the best one from them . but if a student , like me , dream of becom a specialist or even a scientist in a certain realm , he should and must special in that one specif subject . the foremost reason whi i said that is , onli thi way , can a student make great consentr on that one subject and learn more about it . like me , i alway think i will becom a specialist in ee , so , now i put all of my focu and energi on that subject . by do more research and read more reffer book of that subject , i obtain a profound understand about it . although i ca n't assert that i am a master today in ee , i have took the most signific step to be a master i think . take into account of all that mention abov , i draw the conclut that thi question depend .
