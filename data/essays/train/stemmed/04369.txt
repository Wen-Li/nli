mani peopl can not decid whether have broad knowledg about academ subject or special in one specif subject is more benefici for individu 's career . in my opinion , peopl should focus on one topic and special in it . by have deep inform and signific experi on an issu , peopl will gain some import advantag such as find a good job , salari opportun and becom an expert in an area . first advantag of special in a topic is that peopl can find a job more easili compar to other peopl . becaus , compani today gener look for peopl in a specif topic . the reason for thi is that today 's compani are work on a detail subject . it is clearli seen that there are not so much compani that work on differ area . therefor , thi situat push the compani to find peopl that have import experi and knowledg about their job . secondli , in today 's world , if a person is an expert in an issu , then thi person take high salari compar to other employe . becaus it is hard to find an expert for compani for a job posit . therefor , big compani can give high salari to these peopl . final , technolog forc peopl to becom an expert . the main reason for thi case is that technolog is develop day by day and it is not possibl to have `` enough '' inform about a topic . i state that becaus if you want to produc someth or creat a product , you should have detail inform about it . by onli thi way , peopl can be creativ and valuabl in their compani . to sum up , have detail knowledg about a topic will becom peopl more lucki than other peopl . they can get high salari and they can be `` want '' peopl among compani . if peopl choos the second choic , than they may not be special in the market .
