learn is base on too main tecniqu , understand the idea and concept and learn fact . understand the idea and concept is a veri import step in the learn process , it help student absorb the essenc of the topic . for exampl : jenni ha to studi scienc , the first thing she should do is read all the inform , digest it and make her oun conclus base on her knowledg . ti step is more gener , it includ more aspect than the next one . after get the main point of a lesson , student learn the fact . thi provid them with a solid base when the use of the previo knowledg is requi . in contrast with understandind the idea , learn fact is a specif activ , where you memor select aspect of your interest . in my opinion understand the idea and concept is as import as learn the fact . i have been in contact with both of the way of studiyng and i have got better grade when i learn the fact than when i focus on understand the lesson . even though when i learn the fact i usual dont get the esenc of the lesson , i get better grade . it is a littl absurd but almost all of my classmat had the same problem . that is whi i state in my person opinion that the understand is as import as memor . it is a way of itegr two proces that complet each other and form a whole , join both step . as a result the flaw of one would be cover by the good thing of the other and viceversa . for me , the perfect learn process would be the one which includ both of the step mention abov , link them by relat the overview of a lesson with the specif fact that support it .
