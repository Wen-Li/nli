i agre with the statment that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . if i think about my past when i wa younger . i can rememb the idea that my friend and i had about help our commun . we use to spent at least few hour a week to provid servic and help peopl that were in some kind of troubl . natur our help wa relat with our age , but it wa a good way to teach us the sens of commun . nowaday i can see in mani differ occas that young peopl are more selfish , they think just about themself and what is the best thing to do just for themself . dure last year i have never met a young person that wa give some of hi time to do someth helpful for the commun . in our modern societi there are mani thing that everybodi should do for the benefit of our commun , and some of them should be done expeci by young peopl . for exampl they should spent part of their time stay with old peolpl and help them . i think thi is a good way to learn the histori and get a sens of respons . i rememb that i use to do that expeci with all my grandpar , and i learnd mani thing from them . nowaday young peolp prefer to stay with their friend mayb waist time or do someth realli useless . probabl there are differ reason whi young peolp have thi kind of attitud , but i think that the most import reason is relat with their parent . i think they forgot wich are the most import valu in a sociati . they also did not teach what a kid should do for hi grow and how relat with the commun . i am sure that if i will have a children i will teach him how to give hi help to hi commun and how to relat with it .
