the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun is although a littl extrem , yet correct . i agre with thi statement to a larg extent . firstli , young peopl live in thi world of capit , are veri materialist . success today is judg by the amount of money , or luxuri of life that a person ha , and the young peopl are greatli influenc by thi fact . young peopl work toward get glamour and high profil job . they concentr mostli on person gain and do not give enough time for commun activ . secondli , some young peopl are influenc by the violenc and crime depict in film and on televis . a lot of crime nowaday are commit by young peopl . these young peopl are unemploy and have a tendenc to commit illeg act for money . some young peopl are influenc by radic ideolog and join anti-soci , and terrorist outfit . some might argu that young peopl do help their commun by help and work for non-government organis such as the p.e.t.a , old age home and orphanag . yet other might cite that some young peopl are involv in development activ for their commun and as such , are not absolut materialist . these fact are true and factual , yet in my opinion , there are not enough young peopl involv in the nobl and social activ state abov to fulli support and generalis the claim . final , a lot of survey conduct by variou agenc clearli show that the young peopl prefer money , social statu , sex , glamour and a strong educ a lot more than they prefer help their commun . some young peopl do have a desir to help their commun , but do not take the step toward realis of thi desir due to a lack of time and commit . to sum , most young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . some help their commun , but in my opinion the major do not help and thi is the reason whi i feel that the statement , although a littl extrem , is still correct .
