in my littl commun all the volount work and help the other are mainli adult and old peopl . therefor , my experi give evid to the statement that young pepl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are mani explain for thi to happen . today young peopl are involv in variou activ : after have be to school , they have mani homework and they are also involv in sport and other leisur activ . therefor , they have no time to be more involv in their commun . often thi happen becaus of their parent , which prefer their son to be work more for their individu futur that for the futur of the commun as a whole . in my case , i have been alway ask to spend more time learn languag and play sport rather than work as a volunt for the commun . anoth motiv for thi low involv in the commun is the grow lack of interest from the societi itself for young involv in social work . in particular , the school doe not provid stimuli to involv the student in thi kind of project . in my high school , for exampl , onli the 4 % of the student spent time help their commun . a good idea could be , in my opinion , the distribut of school credit for everi hour of social work in the commun of origin . furthermor the govern doe not provid enough inform on the matter : with the introduct of volunt 's inform point in the citi and with the distribut of advertis , the number of young peopl involv in the commun can grow easili . to conclud , i believ that it is true that the young peopl is not involv enough in their commun , and my person experi provid a good exampl . the main caus of thi are , in my opinion , the lack of time avail to them and the lack of a correct inform on the mutual benefit of an higher involv . i think that mainli with the help of my school , i should find more time to help the commun where i live , to improv it and to improv myself .
