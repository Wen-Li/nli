ye i agre to thi statement . success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what alreadi know how to do well . by tri new thing and do it by own we can develop self - confind upon us and by do such thing we can rememb well what we had done and we can not forget it . it bring more self-confid , abil , attitud toward the subject . for an exampl i can say about great scientist like newton , einstein etc . firstli newton nor we doest know about gravit forc which wa happen around us then he wa the person who think about fall of the appl and what made it fall . by do vigor research on that concept he came to know that there is a forc which is pull the object downward that wa known as gravit forc . peopl from then came to know about the gravit forc and had done mani experi on that . that state that success peopl tri new thing and take risk in which they feel veri satisfi . for anoth exampl we can talk about children , they doest'nt know anyth and they doest'nt leav anyth in my view . so they doest'nt know whether it is go to harm them or make them feel happi . they do the thing they never let it go and if they feel happi they will enjoy . by do the thing what they alreadi know will have no enthusiasm , anxieti , intrest , on the subject . as we alreadi know about the subject we doest'nt take much care on it nor concentr . that 's whi i can say that there 's great satisfact by tring new thing and if we achiev them . if we can not achiv them we should not feel discourag by ourself and come to know about it and copmlet it success . in my view not onli success peopl everyon should tri for the new invent and tri for it till they achiev , if we take risk onli then we can come out of fli color in our life .
