a strike featur of the modern world is the explos growth of inform . we wit a surfeit of inform for a wide spectrum of topic . these topic are dispar and miscellan in natur . such a scenario offer ampl scope for super special in ani field . becaus of the vast amont of inform that exist in everi topic , specialist who are the master of that one topic are in great demand . let me explain that statement by draw an analaogi with a softwar compani . the massiv demand for special engin in the compani can justifi the statement that super specialist are in great demand . howev , i believ that have a broad knowledg of mani academ field would still be a more favour proposit than specialis in ani one field . let me justifi thi belief . consid an investor who must invest hi capit in a compani . have a broad overview of mani issu would enabl him to invest wise . on the other hand , a specialist would be bound by hi limit of knowledg in onli domain . also , let us consid that softwar compani which wa previous discuss . sure , it employ specialis engin but the employe may actual be a manag who ha a broad understandingof variou facet of hi compani and not a deep knowledg of ani one . and yet , hi post is superior to that of the hire engin . also , anyon who is equip with knowledg of a varieti of field ha the potenti to tri hi hand elsewher if ani one ventur doe not work out for him . that give him the versatil to explor sever field . the specialist may not have that option . today , we see sever top compani be led and manag by individu who may not be specialis in ani one field . thi is becaus these individu with their broader perspect offer a multi-dimension approach which is veri help for ani compani 's growth . the final decis depend on everi individu 's person viewpoint . he might deriv greater pleasur from complet masteri of ani one subject and may prefer be an unchalleng author on the same . i , howev , see myself as the manag who ultim deploy task to these specialis engin . to me , the manag 's job which involv be involv with sveral aspect and take an integr approach toward decision-mak seem more excit . that parallel explain whi i believ have a broad knowledg of sever domain is better than specialis in ani one domain .
