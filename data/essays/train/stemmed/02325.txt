i think it is both import , to learn idea and concept as well as fact . but as more valuabl i would consid the learn of idea and concept . learn fact is veri useful if you want to attend a quiz show or if you take a test to be admittet at a colleg or univers . these test often just ask question on fact , but peopl like me are not abl to keep these fact . if i just learn fact in school , i would be pretti stupid , becaus i am not abl to keep it , i just forget it again . i do not mean to it but i just can not help it . wheread if i leran concept and idea i would know much more . fact are less import . if you rememb fact you do not have a conect to other topic , for exampl if you learn that the world war end in 1945 what doe it tell you ? not much , onli that it enden in 1945 , but if you learn what caus the war to end and what happend after the war you learn much more . you can make connect to other countri , for exampl what happend there after the end of the war . you would be abl to relat these effect of the war to other war and draw conclus from it . if a new war start you may be abl to tell what happend when it end again , just becaus you learn these concept in school . but like i said abov it is also import to know some fact . everybodi should know when the world war begann and end , but it just should not be paid so much attent to it . especi these admit test should give more import to the abil of draw conclus from an event than recal the fact of it . to come to a conclus i would say it is more import to learn idea and concept rather than fact , they should just be support .
