accord to my opinion , it is not true that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do , rather , they enjoy it in other way that would seem unsuit for younger individu . i believ that as time elaps , physic abil worsen while intellectu abil are enhanc , and thi might be a reason whi a 15 year old boy enjoy hi spare time out in the yard play soccer while hi 70 year old grandfath might use the same time in front of the fireplac read a philosophi book . it is simpli that by live and go through new experi we adjust our expect , we realiz what we want to do and what is better for us to do . the mere fact that a young boy regard as extrem bore what older peopl do in order to spend time and have fun , doe not mean that they are actual not have fun and enjoy their live . of cours , older peopl seem to be abl to choos from a limit rang of activ with respect to what a younger person is , but still , it doe not make the point : life should be live and enjoy complet from birth to death . there is one littl , and yet , extrem import thing that everi human be need in order to do thi , and that is health . unfortun a lot of what affect our health can not be directli control , but much can be prevent , and we should bear thi in mind throughout our live . life , sometim , seem to be someth realli fragil amd that is whi we have to be more care about it . increas your lifespan can be realli enjoy , mani disagre on thi point , but if you do not live , then you can not even say you had a chanc to enjoy your life . older peopl live a differ period of life than the one younger peopl live and thi can not be the reason whi older peopl should be consid to enjoy life less than younger peopl do .
