in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today , becaus of limit natur resourc , improv transport servic and financi disadvantag of use car . first of all , most of the car today are use benzin-oil as fuel . the problem is that for produc benzin peopl need petrol which is a limit natur resourc . in twenti year the petrol on the world would be veri limit and there would n't be enough petrol for mani car as in today . of cours peopl are search for other energi resourc for car like solar energi , and there are car work with solar energi , but those technolog are far away from today and most probabl in 20 year they would still be unus in real life situat as the engin believ in so . in all over the world multi-passeng transport system is improv , even right know the subway are veri effici and cheap for transport . with the improv technolog those subway are gete faster and faster , and need less fuel . even more they have produc a train faster than ani train right know , which work with magnet energi mean that it doe n't need natur resourc to oper . so in the near futur it would be highli possibl that most peopl would use multi-passeng system , becaus of their speed and low cost . lastli , in twenti year the benzin price would be veri expens becaus there would be veri less petrol in the world . even today the benzin is veri expens , and most peopl do n't use car to avoid that kind of financi loss . peopl start to understand the advantag of the subway in financi criteria , and if we consid the fact that the decreas in petrol would increas the price of the benzin , even though most peopl prefer use car , they will stop use car and look other option for transport like subway in near futur becaus of the financi drawback of use car . it is obviou that most peopl want to use car ; but becaus of the limit resourc in natur and financi consider , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
