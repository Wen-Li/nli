in twenti year i sure think there would be a consider fall in the number of car into use . follow are the reason i would attribut to thi reduct . the ever grow popul and limitless migrat to the citi is put tremend pressur on the avail space in citi to construct road . in twenti year from now the lifestyl of peopl would becom faster and they would like to maintain punctual . with regular road servic , if they opt , the inevit traffic jam would delay them . take for exampl a citi like new york or mumbai , most of the peopl use local transport i.e. train to reach offic in the rush hour as there is less possibl of get delay . also with grow popul most of the space would be use for domest purpos , give less space for the automobil to be driven or park . anoth alarm featur support the lesser use of car would be pollut control . as we are all awar of the increas euro iii & euro iv norm , time is not far when the need to reduc the vehicl and henc the emiss becom inevit special in citi like new delhi where the pollut ha alreadi reach alarm valu . if the peopl use a common transport , number of `` smoke emitt '' will reduc and so will the pollut level of citi . with depelet reserv of petrol and not so advac and promis solar energi oper car , the futur of gasolin car would be a mere junk yard . statist show petrol reserv of onli anoth 40-50 year which will certainli discourag the usag of petrol oper vehicl . even if a newer technolog is introduc into market to run car , the equip cost would be high and will fail to attract custom . a pleas factor in discourag the usag of car would be cost effect . a fact state that , in a countri like usa , the cost to maintain a car equal it price . public transport would be much cheaper to afford on long term basi , with no worri to maintain car or buy petrol . a rough estim about the percentag a middl class famili spend on buy and maintain car in india is about 40 % . with thi money save , the famili could explor new ventur , more product one to spend it hard earn money on , eg. better educ of their children . sum up , car in futur would be replac by extens public transport network which would compris of train , tram and metro with numer advantag as envisag .
