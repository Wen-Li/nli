in nowaday , it is wide known that the car bring the conveni of traffic . we can travel some place easier and quickli . but do those car reduc in twenti year ? in my opinion , car will increas in the futur . there are sever reason i will show as follow . first of all , i think that the popul is increain in the world . in the futur there are more peopl in the world , especi in some undevelop and develop countri . in fact , in those countri there are few car . even some peopl have not saw the car sinc they were born . mayb it will have new kind of traffic tool in the futur . but i think that the most import traffic tool in those countri which are not develop will buy the car in the futur . becaus the prise of the car in the futur must be cheapter than today . and those countri could buy the car in the futur . secondli , i find that the car is more and more cheaper . futhermor , the function of the car will improv quickli and power . like tv , the car will be a basic commerci in the futur . and a famili may have more than one car in the futher . so there will be more and more car in use in the futher . actual , in taiwan , mani famaili have more than one car , even two . thirdli , the car is conveni than other transport . for exampl , the peopl go to work everi day . but the mass transport doe not pass the place where the peopl want to go . by drive car you can go ani place you want to go . obivi , it is more conveni than other transport . and in the countri , it usual doe not have the mass transport . to sum up , i believ that the car will increas in the futher . from the point abov , you could get whi the car are so popular and whi the car in use will grow up . in the end , i will emphas that the car will be more popular in ani place in the world in the futur .
