i think , that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one specif subject , becaus nowaday is veri import understand and know a littl bit of everyth . in my opinion , day after day , life is becom harder than befor , you need of a lot of differ skill and compet , not just to find a good job but for everi day life . for exampl , when you appli for a job , they ask you a lot of inform like : subject studi at school and at the univers , comput skill . in a lot of job , you need to speak more than one languag and moreov you have to be alway updat with polit , econom and market inform . in these last year , the school of differ countri in europ , are improv the knowledg of mani academ subject . they are introduc mani differ subject that are becom more import for the life , like , comput cours , technic compet , market , econom and polit . in my opinion , it is veri import to understand and to know differ subject , becaus you can talk with the peopl of differ matter and you can say your opinion . moreov , when you read newspap , you can understand better the problem of the world . on the other hand , if you want to do a specif job , for exampl you want to be a children doctor you need to special in one specif subject . i think that there are a lot of job that need of specif compet and you have to studi veri hard to special in one in one specif subject . i can not imag if a doctor doe not know well all the diseas that a person can have . .. what a mess will be
