i disagre with that . i think understand idea and concept , and learn fact are conect togath i am go to support my opinion by say seveer reason . first of all , as huna been we have to live the the fact to understand the idea and concept . in fact , it is not a conditon rule , but it is the common thing to be a human been . second , when peopl learn ani thing , they have to do it in the real life to feel it and how can it effect hi life . my third reason is , the peopl imgin be come larger and get more exper in their live . also they would be abl tomor creativ and make new thing that they felt it is import for the peopl live , and that is go to be by live the fact that had learn it and understood it . if thedo some thing on the real live , and they have seen some thing like it on televis like poor or to be hungri , they will be sorri for the peopl who have these problem , but when they do it on real they help them becaus they felt the pain that these peopl are go through . these are my reason that i thing the are veri reason and if everi school is go to do it , it would be so help for the teacher and veri effect for the studint life and imagin in thi live .
