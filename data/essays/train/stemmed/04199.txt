i , be a scienc student complet disagre with the abov statement . i have a coupl of self experienc incid to say thi . a person is gener inhibit with some level of knowledg which he can not cross over . thu take one subject specialis would be more beneficiari to the candid . i would like to quot a jug of water to support my theori . when a jug of water is place upto it brim it will be use for sever other to quench thier thirst but when it is overflown then it get wast and would be not use for anyon . in the same way knowledg gain would be use for build up good career but it becom unworthi when one is not master in ani of the subject he plan . the proverb ` slow and steadi win the race ' can be remind . therefor it is better to get special in one specif subject . let us consid the world 's greatest scientist sir isaac newton for thi . if he too would have concentr on mani subject without make ani thourough knowledg on anyth then we would have lack the world 's famou law of gravit forc . there may be exceptionalist who gain vast knowledg on variou subject but the scientif reason behind thi is they possess a greater amount of grey matter in brain and are consid as super human like einstein . here the fact is that one ha to recognis one 's own abil of studi and interest and fulli justifi thier choic . thi come onli through wise think and seek good advic from elder . i conclud the section that one ha to be self worthi and choos less , gain more should be the motto . may be one 's studi field is small but it must be uniqu and contrast . it 's not wise to say that onli by get specil in mani would make u creativ but final ` ur uniqu ' would place one in a better statu in the societi . thank you !
