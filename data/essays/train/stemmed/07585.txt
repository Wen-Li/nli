i agre about thi topic . i think it is more import for student to understand idea and consept than it is for them to learn fact . if we did n't go to primari school and we did n't understand how we make a sentenc with word we ca n't learn write and read . so i think understand idea is import . for instanc suppos that you have a comput but you did n't use it . befor you use it , you must learn it is use . so firstli you should understand it is use . anoth exampl is that if you want to tke toefl you should take a cours about thi exam , you should understand all idea about thi exam . after thi prepar you can take thi exam . in two exampl which were given abov ; if you contact with an experi you can be more success . so i think if you want to be a success person you should ask question to anoth peopl who you can trust her \ hi idea . becaus i think intellig peopl use hi \ her mind but more intellig peopl use anoth peopl 's mind not to make mistak . to becom more success in a short time you should ask other 's idea about your situat . in addit that understand all detail about fact you can imagin what it will be go on ? as a matter of fact that you can alway ask question about your situat and understand all idea and concept and you can go right . if you ca n't understand idea you may not improv easili and in a short time . so it is an import part of life to understand idea . to sum up when you want to learn fact you search everi side of it . do n't forget that everi person have differ idea and differ look side . so you alway learn other 's idea from them or from book , than think them and solv the fact .
