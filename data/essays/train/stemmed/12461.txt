thi statement present a difficult question : it is better to have a gener type of cultur or to special in a specif matter ? the statement ask that the first aspect is more import than the second one , but i am not in agre with it : i think that in modern life is import have a good prepar in all the field of cultur , but also it is indispens to have a specif knowledg on a matter ; in fact thi is the role of univers , to prepar a student for the specif job he think he will do in the futur . i have an exampl that confirm what i have said now : one of my friend , mario , ha a great passion for the studi ( he ha read all the volum of hi encyclopedia ) , but he doe n't have studi a specif matter , becaus he ha n't frequent the univers , so he ha n't a job yet . on the contrari , my friend luca ha studi mechan engen and now , onli two month after finish the studi , he work in a great societi of engeen , and he gain a lot of money ! in syntesi , i think that a gener cultur can help you to grow and to becom more adult , but the way to obtain a job that can satisfi you ( by an econom and also profession point of view ) is to studi a specif matter . i also think that the person who ha write thi statement ha a more utopist view of life than me .
