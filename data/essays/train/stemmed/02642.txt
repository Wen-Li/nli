certain person think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept then it is for them to learn fact . inde , the understand of idea and concept could seem to be more valuabl , idea and concept impli abstract think and abil to have a reflexion disconnect from the concret world . howev , i think that learn fact is essenti and more import for student than the understand of idea and concept , for the follow reason : at first , for young student it is difficult to understand idea and concept . most of their work consist in learn fact , for exampl by name object and defin them ( a child will be shown for exampl a yellow fruit and he will learn that it is a lemon ) . therefor state that idea and concept are more import would result in consid that most of the thing you learn as a child would not be worth learn . such a posit is not defend . moreov , you can not be abl to understand idea and concept if at some point you have not been abl to learn fact . most of the time idea and concept deriv from observ made with respect to fact . for exampl the theori of galileo about the rotat of the earth come from observ he ha made in the real world not onli from abstract think . as a result we may consid that learn fact is essenti to the discoveri of idea and concept . furthermor , fact may help peopl to understand idea and concept by illustr abstract thought . as a result , if you are unabl to learn fact you will not be abl to understand idea and concept . at last , in certain field , such as histori , fact are essenti to the comprehens of the subject matter . as histori is a succes of fact , consid that fact are irrelev or less import than idea and concept , would impli that histori is not an import field . such a posit could not be agre with . by way of conclus , i think that learn fact constitut an essenti step toward the understand of idea and concept .
