although it an ambiti and challeg motiv to have a broad knowledg about mani academ subject , i would rather prefer to have knowledg about one perticular subject . there are few reason for which i feel thi way . firstli , a knowledg all subject mean a lot of inform and plenti of hardwork and time for gain the inform . as a result of thi complex interact of the abov factor , most of time adequ knowledg of ani of the subject is not aquir . as a result of thi a person becom a jack of all trade but master of none . secondli , lot of suject mean lot of hardwork , and there would be too littl time for person life , which mean he will have less time for make new friend , watch movi and parti . after all educ is onli one part of the curricilum , there are mani other activ to be done to make an all round person . as a result of thi hi social life might be affect , and he will fit into the classic old say , all work and no play make jack a dull boy !! final , at the end of hi educ period if he feel that there is no look back for him , sinc he ha aquir all the knowledg , he is then dump again . onc in profession life , peopl prefer those who are specialist in a perticular subject rather than those who have onli a moder knowleg of it . for exampl a person with high blood pressur and respiratori difficulti would go to a cardiologist , than to go to a gener physician or a famili doctor . he will feel that he would get a more precis treatment under a cardiologist 's help . in conclus , eventhough just think to aquir all the knowledg in the world sound good , it is practic to have complet knowledg about one aspect .
