some peopl might say that lean fact is import for student without understand idea and concep becaus the way is more convinc to ger some knowladg . howev , i believ that understand idear and concept process is more import to learn someth to student becaus of sever reason . first of all , understand idea make student not lose the idea easili . without understand mean is student studi not deepli becaus if they studi to get more reason and inform , they wil be abl to understand and not to forget it easili . for exampl , when i wa high school student , i learn about my countri 's histori . my teacher let we know about just the histori 's fact , and it wa too difficult to understand . athough i got a high score at the class , i can not now rememb anyth becasu i could n't realli get without understad . if my teacher and i had tri to ungerstand about my countri 's histori , i would have explain about that fluent . anoth reason i believ student need to understandinf concept the idea is that know the studi ' concopt help student to studi the cours comfort . if you go some where without know direct , do you feel comfort ? i do n't thing so becaus unknow where we are go make peopl 's feel frustrat and lose confid . accod to the news i 've watch , 45 % student who know about the take cours 's conceptbi teacher 's explain show more higher acchiev from the cour in that they could know what the cour is go on . for instanc , everi class ha instruct for knew student , and almost school hold orient to show their educt ' concept becaus they believ the process will help student keep for to studi well . if the way had been help , they would have elimin the process . in conclust , i claim that understand idea and concept need to student in order not to lose their studi easili and in order to improv their achiv dure take the cour . if student need more time to understand , we have to wait them becaus it will realli make good educ .
