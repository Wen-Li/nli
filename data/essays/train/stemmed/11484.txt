i would not fulli agre on the comment that younger peopl enjoy live more than older peopl do , i think younger peopl enjoy life in a differ way than older peopl do it . for the young gener everyth ha to be harder , bigger and faster . they want to be entertain and are look for new excit activ . old peopl are happi with life as it is . they do not need to be entertain anylong . they had fun when they were young and do not need such activ anymor . but a problem which often apper , is that the two differ gener do not understand each other . the old peopl had a realli differ situat when they were young than the children today and so they can not understand a lot of thing the young gener is do today . it is the same with the young gener . they are young and do not understand the way old peopl live . they think it is bore and that those peopl never had fun . but that wrong they had fun when they were young and they had fun on their way , they did what peopl did in that time and now the time ha chang and the young peopl do what young peopl do today to have fun . so you can not say that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . the onli thing you could compar is if young peopl 50 year ago enjoy life more than young peopl today but you can not compar old and young peopl . old peopl have been young and young peopl will old one day .
