i do n't think that it 's import for student to understand idea and concept as compar to learn fact . i think idea and concept help the student in learn in their intial class onli . in my opinion , the fact are more import to learn as they are use in long run . for exampl , i wa a student of the physic class . as part of our cours structur we have numer deriv to understand the idea behind a particular fact . at that time i use to cram all the deriv in order to get good mark . but now at thi point of my age i can just abl to rememb what wa the fact not the idea or the concept behind it . like i rememb that what is the densiti of water but i do n't know how to calcul it . so , i beliv that student should more concentr on fact than understand ide and concept .
