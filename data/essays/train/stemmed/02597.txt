do most advertis make product seem much better than the realli are ? as a sourc of inform i first want to analys the purpos of advertis . anoth good way to find an answer obvious is to examin some exampl , which will follow . much money is spend on advertis . the simpl purpos is to increas the ammount of sold product . the most simpl way to do so would be to show the product in the best light . weak will not find their way in an advertis . therefor the product should seem veri good , which in averag will be much better than it realli is . let us find out if advertis take thi way of promot good . one of the most succesful product of the last year is the ipod , a portabl music player . with the succ came a lot of advertis . the print campaign simpli show the outlin of a figur in black with a white ipod . as the photo give a fair impress how the product realli look like and there is hardli writt anyth on it , we can not pretend that the product seem much better than it realli is . take an advertis of a watch . an import manufactor advertis with a sail pictur . there is onli littl inform about the watch , conclud that it fit perfectli for sail . again there is not so much written about the product that we could say it wa made better than it is . although there is some advertis show a product in the best light , most advertis seem to work differ . it is not the product , which is sold , it is the brand , the lifestyl , the imag . and therefor someth invis is ad to the product , which make it seem much differ than it realli is .
