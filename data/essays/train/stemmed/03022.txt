dure my life i made mani social work to support my commun . i think that i can disagre with the statement : `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' becaus i 'm a young person and i do it . but i kown that thi statement is truth in mani commun and in mani group of young peopl . infact mani young peopl do n't make noth to help or to support their communiti . thi situat is becaus they do n't feel part of their commun . for exampl if a young person chang hi home mani time he ca n't feel a part of a commun and i understand that is difficul to help some unknown thing . also becaus if you do n't know a thing you ca n't imagin of what thi thing need . sometim young peopl are critic by their commun and so it veri difficult that young peopl want help them . sometim young peopl have realli too mani thing to do . for exampl school , sport , work . .. and they have no time for social attiv . i think that is veri import for a young person make some thing for hi commun becaus in thi way he can feel abl to help some one .
