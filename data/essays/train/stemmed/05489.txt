i do agre with the statement that most advertis do in fact make product seem much better than they realli are . the reason i think thi is true are as follow . firstli , most advertis alway highlight posit of the product but do not mention ani associ `` con '' of the product . although it is true that without stress on posit , the product would not sell , but leav out detail do not give complet inform about the product . for exampl , a macdonald advertis would highlight the `` experi at an affor cost '' but would not mention anyth about the trans-fat content of the product which could have ill-effect on health of the consum . secondli , advertis use associ to sell a product and lead consum to believ that acquisit of the product would materi the associ . for exampl , the `` air jordan '' shoe market by nike sold the associ of have the `` abil to play like michael jordan '' use the air jordan shoe . we all know that it requir a lot more talent and abil than a pair of shoe to play like jordan . henc , the associ alway end up glorifi the true benefit of the product . anoth reason that result in misplac inform about a product given the advertis is the use of celebr model in advertis to sell product . even though the product might need a particular attribut in the custom ( for exampl a fit bodi ) to be benefici to the custom , the custom doe not sens that on see the advertis . they rare recogn that what look good on supermodel like cindi crawford might not necessarili look good on them . given the abov mention reason , i would agre that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are .
