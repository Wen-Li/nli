i agre with the statement . know fact is veri import but we alway need to think , and i believ that it is more import to have better understand of thing and concept to make good decis in real life . understand idea and concept give you a skill of slove a problem when you come across to someth . understand idea and learn fact are close connect . if you have an idea about someth , you think about it , learn about it , and everntu learn a fact . in anoth word , is a process of learn fact . for exampl , if you know what is happen in iraq , if you do n't have an understand for it , you do n't do anyth for it . fact without your opinion or concept are useless even though how import the fact is . process will lead you to the result and you learn a lot of thing through out the process . i believ thi from my experi . onc when i had a homework to search about the titan , i wa just look for a websit that say what happen to it in the begin , but soon i realiz there were lot of thing that happen other than sink nad i learn much more interest event that actual happen befor it sank . process is more import than a fact and i will lead you to the result which is a fact . sometim , i say to myself `` care about process than a fact '' becaus it is easi to forget and onli look for a fact .
