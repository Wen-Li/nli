i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . for exampl , my famili had a appl tree in our backyard . when we get the appl from the tree the appl had wors look than from a store . anoth exampl is i have heard that a compani for sell food , which are manto and dimsom , made the food just good tast and good-look , but not good for health . first , when i wa in my elementari school in korea , my famili had a appl tree in our backyard of my apart . we never gave it ani chemic pesticid or never do advertis . after i graduat from the elementari school , my famili and i could get nine appl from the tree . three of them were alreadi eaten by insect , so we could n't eat the tree of them ; howev , other were fine , but it look realli wors than the appl in a fruit store . even if the tast of my appl wa better than of the store 's appl , i felt my appl 's tast is wors becaus the appear of my appl made the appl had bad tast . second , i have seen that a compani for sell food , manto , dimsom , or etc. , made the food by the wast trash from restour in the news . when they made it had a good-look , they did advertis , also they put some chemic materi to make it ha good test . so , the food from the compani had realli good tast and good look , but extremli bad for one 's health . there are still some compani like that in korea . even though the food is not alreadi eatabl , the advertis make it eatabl . for that reason , i agre that advertis make product seem better . becaus of my exprienc , the appl tree and news about ` trash food , ' i agre that the most adveric make product seem much better thatn they realli are . but , i also think the advertis is necessari becaus i make the food tast better by give good appearac .
