in our societi , there are lot of confilct between fact and someon 's idea . but i do not think the idea and concept is more import than it fact for the sever reason . as iam a citizen of korean , sometim we have to get bad un - benefit hear for the histori thing . and also it issu on now . some countri tri to get our territori , they made thir countri 's textbook of the school own their way . it wa realli surpris to all citizen . but they were say it is true . there are reason whi did they said that becas , they also learn it like that way with that worng fact textbook . we should teach our child with the fact . therfor they can imag somethinf with the fact . without the fact , they will just keep make some non make senc stuff . secondli , the person who doe not have knowledg about the fact , they can not get ani job . in our societi we are veri think importantli abut one person 's knowledg . and also the creat idea come form our knowledg of fact . so mani compani are hire peopl who are intellegi . late , in our shcool , what are we learn about it ? all subject like histori , math , and english is all fact . and we are also go into our commun wiht that fact . that is the way we live in here now . accordingli , there are some reason for whi learn fact are more import than learn idea and concept . through the all fact we can think more creatviti , and also we should solv that conflict between the fact and idea or concept . if there are no fact , how do we lean on someon ? we should realiz what is fact and what is idea . if there are exact line between of them , the conflict are not exist ani more . so i beliv that the fact are more impot than learn about the idea and concept first .
