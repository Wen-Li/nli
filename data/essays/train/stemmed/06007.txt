the humankind alway need to educ therefor educ is the veri import aspect of human life to reach high life standard . idea and concept are most import part of educ . some assum that it is the most import for student to understand idea and concepst in controray to thi some think that the best for the student to learn fact . i total agre with the first idea . these are my follow reason . the first reason for my belief is that , the student must learn the idea first . becaus the idea are import and also the concept . student must give pay attent the idea and concept than the fact . if a student learn the idea and the concept the student can learn the fact by time . the second reason for my belief is that , the fact are not import exactli . becaus the idea make the shape to the fact . so the it concept is import so it is relat with the idea . if the student learn the idea first he or she can prepar the fact befor and he or she can look the fact in differ way . thi is the import . in the other hand the fact are the import some time to look the object trueli . some think and say thi student must learn fact first to prevent him or her to the lie . for all these reason i therefor believ that , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . thi idea is relat with both give a shape to fact and prepar to the fact befor . the long and the short of it is that the idea and the concept are more import than fact . i hope the student do n't disregard what i mention !
