i am disagre with the statement , and i do not believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than are there are today . in twenti year the world will look like veri differ than is today . in the futur there will be more tecnolog advantag and the compani will construct difer type of transport similar to the car . for exampl , will be machin that can go over the earth and watter and flight into the air , and everyon can have one , becaus the cost to manufactur will be lower . also the peopl want to go far away or faster , becasu their need will chang over the time . altough thi view of the futur , there will be peopl that think in the envior , and the peopl will be prefer use the bicycl or other transport that do n't caus a damag to the earth . if a can live in the futur i think i will below the group that protect the envior , and i will prefer to have a clean air than a car . howev , the perspect that i have of the futur is a littl neg , the industri grow realli quickli , and the technolog help in the develop of the world , but also help in the distruct . the want and need of the peopl chang , they want to have more electron thing for have an esier live . also the time will be precios in the futur , and they need to have a car to go to the job and meet in a fast way . that is way , i believ that there will be more car in the futur . final , if in the futur will be more car , i can help in the construct of thi transport , and that will be someth that do not damag the world . i am an industri design , therefor , my work is creat a posit perspect of the futur and design posit thing that help the need of the peopl in the futur .
