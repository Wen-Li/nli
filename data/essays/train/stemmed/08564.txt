i disagre the yong peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i guess everi peopl should respect and help each other . join commun is good way to learn ani littl societi of the group . the young peopl should take commun in the commun place as possibl as they can . now , we have a mani way to commun with person who you are interest in . unfortun , some younger gener doe not like to give enough time to help their commun . first , give enough time to their commun is the import for yong peopl . i understand that some yong peopl would like to be alon thermself and keep their own time . sometim , it is good chanc to think own probl just themselv , howev , the person who join the commun may give a second opinion . also , in the young peopl commun , they can meet your friend in the commun . we do not aliv without our commun . in my experic , i found my best friend in my commun when i wa 17year old . final , young peopl should give to help their commun . young peopl can learn ani educ experi from their commun . sometim young peopl communi make some troubl but you should not be shi to join commun .
