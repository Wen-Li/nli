it is hard to say that which one is better . but if i were given a chanc to choos one of them , i would rather to say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus understand idea and concept are more benefici than learn fact . let 's shed some light on the disadvantag of learn fact . it can be mislead inform onli if the fact is an except of the idea and concept . for exampl , let 's assum that some frog are dark brown but most frog are green . if a child look at the dark brown frog , he of she might consid all frog as dark brown frog . as thi exampl , wrong inform may be wors than not know . also , it ha small advantag which is that peopl learn more vividli . on the other hand , to understand idea and concept help peopl understand fact more . if someon ha no idea about specif idea and concept , he or she might not be abl to catch that which idea of concept belong to the fact . unlik , if i understood some idea and concept , i could handl the fact better . from my experi , when i wa on camp , i need a fire . i realiz that i forgot to bring a liter . then , i could make a fire easili with glass becaus i understood the concept of light reflect . it wa veri use . i wa proud myself . as all is concern , i prefer to understand idea and concept . in my opinion it advantag alway overweigh the advantag of to learn fact .
