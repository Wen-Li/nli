i disagre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use twenti year from today . the question at hand is highli controversi as mani peopl believ otherwis due to variou reason such as increas pollut and fuel cost . howev , i still believ that the number of car on road will increas . go by statist , there is no sign to show that car sale is decreas . everi year , more and more number of car are be sold across the globe . the rapid rise of sever coountri such as india and china will onli increas the car market for the manufactur , lead to higher product . thu , there is no indic whatsoev to believ that the number of car will decreas in the next twenti year . also , due to the gener risng standard of peopl , and the car manufactur desig and manufactur cheaper and more effici car give rise to the specul that as more and more peopl are abl to aford a car , they will go ahead and purchas one . one anoth major reason for thi the rapid increas in the number of roadway avali in the world . more and more number of countri have now start build broader and smoother highway . thu , improv infrastuctur is not onli an indic of the trend that more peopl are go to invest in car , it is also an incent . mani peopl might feel that due to the increas awar about the neget effect of car on air pollut and the rise oil price , the number of car may decreas in the come year . howev , most of the compani have alreadi taken a note of these factor , and work their way around these problem rapidli . hybrid car had alreadi hit the road a long time back . car are also be develop which run on altern fuel , such as edibl oil and cng ( compress natur ga ) . these new innov will make sure that the enviornment pollut is kept under check and at the same time , the car becom less depend on oil . in fact , variou research institut across the globe are tri to har the solar energi to drive modern car ! given the present trend , and the effort made by research institut and car manufactur , i believ that number of car on road will onli increas as the year pass by .
