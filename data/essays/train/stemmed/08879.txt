i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl becaus i think that the definit of `` enjoy life '' is veri subject and chang dure life . at first let me talk about the subject of enjoy life . there are so mani differ kind of peopl all over the world . enjoy life can mean to have a great job and a carrier rise up . but there are also peopl who think that nobodi can enjoy life while work . anoth exampl are children . on the one hand there are coupl who never want to have children , on the other hand a famili can consist of the parent and five children and everybodi is glad to live within such a big famili . what i want to say is , that enjoy life can not be put into a definit to test out if somebodi is enjoy hi or her life becaus it match thi definit . anoth point is , that certain feel or activ which could be defin as part of a joy life , chang dure life . young peopl who are go to school or univers like parti and danc and most of them do a lot of sport . they have hobbi and activ they are particip in and friend they meet with . these thing help them to enjoy their life . older peopl for exampl between seventi and eighti year enjoy their life in a differ way . they are glad if everybodi is healthi , they mayb like watch televis and drink a glass of wine in the even . what i want to point out is that peopl enjoy their life in mani differ way . what way it is depend on their person and their age . that is whi i disagre with the statement . i do not think that young peopl are happier than older one . they are onli enjoy life in a differ way .
