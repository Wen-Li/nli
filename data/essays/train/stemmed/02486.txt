i would say that i agre with thi statement , becaus it is true that in our societi markentig ha becom more import and signific than the product self , but i am also a sort of victim of thi kind of market busi . i am stude market becaus i am attend a master in intern manag and i can support that the buyer prefer reli on product that they know becaus they have seen them on the televis rather than trust in produt that are well made but that are not sponsor enough . i can say that i am also fashin from thi kind of product , and sometim , when i buy a new product , i recogn at home that i have bought that just becaus i have seen it on the televis or on the newspap . it is a sort of subconscion imput that i can not take under control . moreov i have to confess that i care the packag of the product more than the qualiti , and i am keen on buy product that are colorful or funni in their shape more than those that have a better qualiti . i have studi that it is test that thi kind of behaviour is quit common especi between young women becaus they are more significantli attract by advertis more than men . for exampl , my grandmoth doe not like go to do shop with me bacaus she doe not understand my way to buy unuseful thing , she is more respons , and she use to spend her money just buy what she realli need , becaus she ha live in a poor period dure the war and she doe not accept to wast money . accord to thi explan i can conclud that i can not agre with the statement even if it is true .
