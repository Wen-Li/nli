some peopl choos to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , while other prefer to be special in one specif subject . as for me , i would rather choos to be special in a specif subject onli . though there are a varieti of subject in a univers for you to follow with . but a singl man 's energi and time are so limit that you ca n't afford wast too much time on subject that ha noth to do with your futur career . imagin a freshman major physic with a select of english literatur in hand all day around , will he succeed in hi field someday ? hardli . furthermor , we call these `` academ subject '' becaus they are noth alik with subject such as math or geographi learn in high school . they are far more complex and complic . you ca n't expect to manag it within a semest or two . it need a whole 4-year systemat learn process to get to a profession level of certain field . some peopl can easili fall in love with a subject just becaus an affect on the spur of the moment , as soon as he realiz that he wo n't be abl to catch up with the cours whatsoev , he will just simpli drop halfway . final , have a determin in special a singl subject is a crucial step on your way of self-real . anybodi who want to be success and legendari in hi field must have persever and expertis . michael jordan may be a good exampl . as soon as he decid to becom a profession basketbal player , he devot all himself to the basketbal court , without think other altern . he set hi goal and went for it ! in conclus , special in a singl subject rather than pursu mani academ subject will be a wise choic . focus your energi and time into the subject , accumul knowledg from that field and set your futur goal firmli without doubt , it will lead you to the road of glori !
