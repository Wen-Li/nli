i agre partial with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i think that join a group led by a tour guid is the best way to visit a place for the first time . i also beliv that visit the same place on my own for the second time is a good way to discov more inform . i usual prefer to take part in a tour guid group when i visit a place for the first time . it give me the opportun to meet new peopl from differ cultur and learn more detail inform abuot the histori and the secret of the place . howev , i also like to visit place on my own after i wa there with a group led by a tour guid . two year ago i went to rome and i decid to join a group of peopl that had a tour guid , it wa amaz and the guid wa realli knowledg . he gave us a lot of artist and histor inform about the famou roman ruin but at the end of the tour the guid said that becaus of the short time avail , we could n't visit all the import attract . i wa realli curiou to see what we miss so i decid to go back in such a marvel citi full of impon structur of the past . last year , i return in rome and i realli enjoy my time discov all of the particular thing that were not mention in the previou tour . i also experienc the famou italian food in such nice restaur that are spread out all around the histor area . i could feel the real essenc of a citi where the ancient ruin are mix with thing of everyday life . that wa defenetli the best experi of my life and i could n't have the possibl to enjoy it , neither go there on my own for the first time , nor just go there with a group led by a tour guid .
