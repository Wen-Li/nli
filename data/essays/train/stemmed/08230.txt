i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . just learn fact might be too bore for student and they might lose their interest in the subject . one reason whi i believ that , is that understand a bigger mean or cohes of someth may enhanc the student interest in the subject . to get the context of an issu is far more interest than learn fact and not know their mean in a bigger pictur . furthermor , student might develop more independ when learn concept rather than on fact . a scond reason whi i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , is that student tend to forget dri fact quit fast , becaus they can not relat them to someth senseful . if they howev , understand a whole concept , they might know whi it is import and they might be abl to connect that concept to the real world and aplli it . in that case , the student will know what for they are learn in school . anoth reason , whi i believ that idea and conept are more import for student to learn than fact , is that in gener fact are difficicult to appli in the real world , becaus they are just part of a concept or an idea . understand just a part of someth doe often make not much sens and is useless . understad someth in a whole , make student be more interest in more concept and idea , becaus one idea may lead to anoth , and so on . to sum up , i believ that fact should be the base that is to be learnt in order to understand big context . just learn fact doe not prepar the student for the real world , sinc the real world doe not consist of fact , but of idea and concept .
