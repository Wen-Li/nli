i do agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . the reason i support my view are follow . firstli , the success peopl got success becaus they like to take challeng . to tri new thing is a challeng to everybodi , becaus peopl who did not know those thing befor would not know how to do or what to do about it , but success peopl can get pratic in the process of tri the new thing . they can pratic there abil from gete the new thing . secondli , success peopl will never stop their step , they are alway go forward , that mean they will not just do what they alreadi know how to do well . to tri new thing is the step that go forward . they can beyond their selv by thi way , they can improv theie sevl to solv the problem follow in the futur . a success peopl shall have thi qualiti , or he can not be a success peopl . thirdli , the gener is chang alway , new thing are occur alway , someon must go to tri and get the new thing , or the gener can not chang , human can not improv ourslv . whi we call those peopl success peopl ? becaus they do someth common peopl can not do and contribut to human societi . so these peopl are alway walk in the front of the gener , they start the new gener . in conclus , i do think success peopl tri new thing and take risk risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , becaus thi , our world is becom better and better , .
