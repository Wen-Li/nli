enjoy life . in order to answer the question of who enjoy life more , younger or older peopl , i think it is vital to look at how each of these group do actual enjoy life . veri young kid seem to need veri littl to have a good time . an empti paper box , and nice puppi , lot 's of mud or just a sunni day can be enough to make them total happi and enjoy life . they might not think about it , or be awar of it , but exactli thi carefre allow them to make life so wonderful for them . thi behaviour mostli continu into later stage of life , the teen , tween and probabl the thirti . dure thi time peopl might still enjoy life , but be a lot more reflectori about it . some of them tend to worri too much . it is a time when great difficutli in life might have to be overcom , such as educ , first love ( s ) and work . i think a lot of extern side effect influenc the life enjoy of a singl person dru thi time period . due to it still be in the first half of a normal life expect , i would count thi life period to the `` young '' part . the enjoy of life in the second half of our life is base on two major factor . one is again the extern situat . have you found a job or life partner that fulfil you and make you happi . have you mayb made enough of money to now be abl to live a dream life that wa not possibl otherwis . the second veri import aspect dure thi time is the gain life experi . older peopl seem to have a more relax view of life . they are not scare or worri as easili . especi veri old peopl that have surviv war and famin , great area and disast seem to be abl to enjoy life with a lot less . on the other hand there are those of cours that have suffer great hardship by that time , and might even not have a bright futur . enjoy life might not be somth they think about at all . perosn i agre with the statement . i think full and complet enjoy of life is probabl most common and easili reach when we are veri young . yet , when extern circumst are right , it is quit possibl to have a veri enjoy life to the veri end , even if there might be a few down inbetween .
