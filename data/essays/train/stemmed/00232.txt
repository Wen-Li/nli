ye , i believ that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . tour guid are often more experienc and more familiar with the place of travel and they can show us the special about that place . travel in a group alon or with friend in a foreign countri without a tour guid is like get lost in a maze . we wouldn not know how to commun with local peopl , how to buy thing and even get the food we want . also , it might be hard to travel to the landmark without understand the way transport work in that particular countri . on the other hand , if we have a tour guid with us , he would probabl have some connect with the travel agenc and it would be easier to commun with local peopl and also bring us to the local attract that we want to see without ani problem . tour guid are meant to be hire for peopl travel in foreign countri and need a person to guid or lead them . tour guid are profession train and experienc with the countri they are guid in . they are often from that particular countri and they know how to speak the local languag and they understand how thing work , so that you would feel more comfort and would trust them as be your leader . although you might not get to do certain thing that you had in mind , when travel in a group with a tour guid , you would definit have a great time and it would be the best , and the safest way to travel . with a tour guid , you get to experi or see the local life style , local food , and local attract , much more easier than travel by yourself blindli , not know where exactli you are yourself . in conclus , in my opinion , the best way to travel is inde in a group led by a tour guid as you get to experi a wider rang or varieti of sight-se place without get lost and to experi differ sort of local cultur .
