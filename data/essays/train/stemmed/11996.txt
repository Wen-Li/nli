i agre with these statement and i will support my point of view through three differ argument : the fact that our citi in the near futur will be satur , the need for live organ to have a clean atmospher , and the problem of find energi to fuel the car . to begin with , it is precis to note that these day a car own a car in develop and develop countri is becom easi . the car dealer present the costum with mani financ option . these option and the present day neces are incent for poepl to own car . the fact that mani peopl are own car present a problem of satur in citi and make it hard for peopl to effect transport . furthermor , the fact that mani car are be produc and put in circul present a mejor problem to our atmospher . the fuel use by these car produc polut that are harmful to live creatur on the planet . soon , in my opinion , govern in develop and develop countri will begin to make law in order to make it more difficult to own car . mani countri have develop effici public transport as an altern . final , it is imper to be awar that mank is rapidli use up the avail natur sourc of energi such as natur ga and crude oil , the basic element from which the fuel car fuel or gasolin is deriv . find altern sours of enrgi are costli and not alway as effici . by reduc the amount of car in circul , mankind may save these natur sourc of energi make them last longer . today mani develop and develop countri in europ , asia , and the america are make avail other mean of effici transport like rail system , metro line , buse , and tramway that may be use collect to reduc the amount of car in circul and as an altern to peopl who can not afford car .
