i do certainli believ that there ha been a mark shift from the past in the attitud of young peopl with respect to their commun . though it will be unfair to gener thi to all young peopl , but most of the young peopl today show littl concern for their commun they live and dwell in . the younger gener today is much more concern about their own futur and well be and in thi pursuit , they sometim tend to neglect their commun complet or are just not abl to afford much more time for it . they do not shi away from exploit the resourc of their commun to climb up the ladder of their own success . in my day to day experi , i have seen teen and student just litter away the wast in the premis they live in . they sometim tend to scratch and damag the properti which is there for evryon to use . i am not sure what pleasur do these peopl deriv by do such activ but the fact of the matter is that they usual do it . if they can not help the commun atleast they should not damag it further . to quot a person experi , there wa a friend of mine who wa be offer the post of district magistr of the town he ha live in from hi birth . he did all hi school from that town . he wa a bright student and that is whi he wa abl to get the post of district magistr . he alway use to carp about lack of infrastructur of the town like frequent power resourc , insuffici water suppli etc . thu , he wa never satisfi with the author . but he himself got the post and got the opportun to do someth for the commun , he just declin the job for a more lucr job offer abroad . thu , when the actual time came to perform duti toward hi commun , he didnt take up the responsibilti . thi goe onto explain that young peopl usual d not give enough attent and help to their own commun . but , as i said befor , thi pattern can not be gener to whole lot of younger gener . i believ that the success stori of peopl who do give help to their commun will inspir those who shi away .
