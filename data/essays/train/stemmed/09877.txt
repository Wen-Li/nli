after the world war ii , the develop of the influstructur especi the develop of the car have increas rapidli . howev the perspect of peopl who are use car chang gradual in recent year . in my opinion , the use of car in twenti year will be decreas as the develop of the influstructur and technolog . first of all , there are a lot of peopl who are concern about the impact of use car to the environ . in some countri such as in netherland and china , they work on the polici of use bicycl to avoid produc carbon-dioxid ga , which possibl damag the natur environ . howev , there are some countri that say co2 ga is not neseccarri for damag the environ , therefor it is not alway a major idea of decreas the number of use car . second of all , there are more public transport such as buss , train and air transport are develop by new technolog . for exampl , there are mani railway in japan to transform peopl one place to the other faster and more conveni . also in taiwan and china , they built the bullet train or maglev train which transport group of peopl at onc , and also think about the impact on natur . also in the less econom develop countri such as the countri in african region , it would be harder to get car for individu resid due to the civil war and poorvati , it is import to produc the cheap public transport for them . therefor , i think the increas number of car user will not be occur in the ledc . third of all , sinc mani countri of more develop countri such as in singapor , japan and switherland , the decreas in number of child becom a sesriou problem . in these countri , the govern are like to set the law to get more than four peopl to ride the car , therefor the number of the car might decreas gradual . sinc the time pass , peopl 's perspect of use car chang . i think thi fact would make the number of car fewer than now .
