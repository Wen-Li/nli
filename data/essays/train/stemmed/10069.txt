advertisemnet are gener use to market differ kind of product to consum . i would agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is becaus each and everi compani tri to advertis their product as superior when compar to that of the competitor . in tri to do thi the compani will make their product seem much better than they realli are to increas the sale of their product . advertis are meant to be inform but there are some compani which advertis their product with littl or no inform . i think that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus they are made attract by use differ color . also advertis use women to creat a sex appeal . in most of the case the advertis doe n't reveal all the inofrm about the product as they last for few minut . so onli with the inform the peopl obtain from the few minut they decid to tri the product and will get dissapoint when they do n't like it . in case of pharmaceut advertis fda did not regul the advertis of over the counter medic so at that time peopl check the advertis on telivis and they start use the medic by themselv without the advic from the physician . thi harm mani peopl so fda statr regul pharmaceut advertis and ask pharmaceut compani to disclos the side effect , use , contraind and advers effect of the drug . for instanc after see an advertis of a new stereo system i felt i would find all the featur requir by me in that product . but after i bought i realis that it wa not as good as i expect it to be . i realli had problem for long time and i could not find some featur list in the advertis . in conclus i would like to suggest the advertis product to make an advertis more realist , relev and inform .
