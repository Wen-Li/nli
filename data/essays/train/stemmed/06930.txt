i do agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today despit the rapid increas of car consumpt . my reason to believ so are state below . first of all , more and more peopl are will to take mass transport to go to work nowaday than a few year ago . becaus the traffic jam is more and more seriou , peopl live in the citi prefer to take buse and subway to go to work to avoid such heavi traffic jam . with the scarc of resourc thi problem might not be solv in year . what 's more , to ride in mass transport save peopl valuabl time to do other product thing . besid ride on mass transport give citi peopl more time to relax and think for their live on their way home and to work . secondli , govern all over the world are becom more awar of the pollut car bring . some govern even set up rule to ban certain car to run in the citi dure paticular time . such rule forbid the use of certain car will continu to effect in the long run . thi will help to reduc the use of car gradual . thirdli , peopl today are more concern with their own health than ever . some may even walk to work or ride a bike to work instead of drive a car . on weekend , more peopl go bike instead of go drive to rural resort to relax . take the popular bike club for exampl , they are develop quit rapidli to support the idea a lot of peopl are hold today that it 's better to travel along with physic exercis . these kind of chang help me to belief that there will be fewer car in the futur . in spite of all the abov , the rapidli develop mass tranport system and the wide accept concept that health is most import in one 's life both add up to my belief that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to sum up , with the wide spread concept of maintain good health , the util of advanc mass transport and the help of the goven , there will be fewer car in 20 year use than there are today .
