i do not agre with the statement becaus i think that , at least in the countri i live in and for the experi i had , young peopl give aid to the commun in field where the state ha not enough money to do everyth it 's suppos to . i 'm not that old , so i can not tell exactli how it wa in the past , but today i can tell that also if societi is get everi day more individualist and selfish , peopl take care of the person in need and tri to help them as much as they can . mani volunt organ have grown up in the citi i live sinc i came here eight yer ago , and most of the volunt are young : they mostli act in welfar , provid food to poor peopl and cover dure the winter time . it 's true that it 's not the major of the popul , but i know a lot of peopl ( and i am one of these ) that spend part of the week tri to do someth good for other in their own citi . mani peopl goe far in the world , like in third world countri , to help peopl there , but sometim doe n't realiz that just in the neighborhood next to their hous there is somebodi who need the same kind of help . but welfar is not the onli field : volunt organ have born also to help the state preserv the huge cultur heritag of itali , give a fundament help when an earthquak damag the central part of the countri , prevent the loss of incred art treasur . i think that most of the thing i expos are done by young peopl becaus most of them are still dreamer and feel better act like thi . they are usual more enthusiast and to them it 's not enough to just give money for chariti .
