some old men usual say that with the daili univers guy know `` everyth about noth '' . i think that thi claim come from thi particular idea : cours at univers do not prepar peopl about a field of studi but they want to direct student on a specif direct . in my opinion thi is not true : cours often give a gener knowledg ; i suppos that the first sentenc could be true some year ago , but not today . howev i agre with the statement in the abov question . from my person experi i can say that a broad knowledg , of ani subject , is more use than a specif one . a wide rang of opinion , idea or theori can allow a student to comprehend better a field of studi . if you own most opinion about a topic , also you can build your person idea and mayb you can also find a more peculiar interest afterward . in thi way , for a student it is easier to find hi own goal . in addit i think that a guy , come out the high-school , can not decid what he would like to do five o six year later . so the univers give him a possibl to make an idea . i met peopl who decid to chang faculti after few month becaus , thank to thi wide rang of subject , they understand that the particular faculti they have choosen did not fit with their interest . nevertheless , after the univers , thi broad knowledg could be a `` skill '' that factori or laboratori do not requir , i am sure that they want peopl with experi , but here we are again , exepri is someth that you can achiev not suddenli in univers , it is someth that you can build work . a job can give to a student the necessari abil about a field that , of cours , it is more specif than subject that he ha studi befor . all in all , in my opinion it is right that univers provid a broad knowledg to their student and moreov i think that the specif skill must be acquir afterward , mayb dure a job experi .
