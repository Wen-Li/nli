live in a time where technolog novel flood societi in rapidli success wave it seem a littl bold to make asumpt about the transport situat in the next twenti year . but , nethertheless , i have the courag to say that i do not believ that there will be fewer car in use by then . one might argu that the global energi suppli will diminish , that the market for new car might be satur some time ( perhap in the industri nation . .. ) that altern like buse and the train system will improv further in qualiti and quantiti , and that human will final , final conced that use public transport will help save the environ . but look at the situat with a global perspect , the world 's most popul region like india , china , southeast asia have n't even nearli cought up to western standard in individu transport . in twenti year , around the globe the demand for thi individu transport facil will have skyrocket . if one still will speak of car , no-on know . a brief look at the telecommun sector will suffic to see how rapidli technolog can evolv . furthermor , old car ca n't be despos of as easili as old telephon or comput . so , as could be examplifi with cuba where u.s. car from the 50i still crowd the street of la habana , the new car of today will probabl find their new home in the poorer region of earth . in total , i can not realli relat to the idea that the total number of car circul on our planet will have diminish in 20 year . to achiev a reduct in emiss of carbondioxid and other wast produc by combust of fossil it would certainli be help to limit the amount of car . but as far as i can see , besid of the - usual powerless - environment activist found in each societi , there 's no strong lobbi to be found which could enforc a reduct in car volum . and by the way , what happen to the newest porsch or the most sophist merced benz ? would anyon realli want to have them vanish ?
