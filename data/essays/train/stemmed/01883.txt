in my point of view `` the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . i came from iraq and in iraq as well as in mani of other countri the wrong gudianc is the main problem i think that it is the goverm job to guid the youth for the best way to serv their commun when the youg man found no attent from ani one in the commun in hi or her problem the young person seem to run away from their life toward ani place that give them that attent other that place wa the street or a bad friend or ani thing . in tha case the commun not just lose the person afford to build a good societi but also gain a crime mayb . and i donot want to plaim the sociti for that but there is also the parent role to rise there children in the correct way to introduc a good person for the commun and there is also the tv role which is a major role in the whole process and of cours there is the person hi or her self role everi bodi can work to build the commun the resposibl is common between the all i have mention . now i may suggest some way to solv the problem may be give the new coupl a cours in who to brought thrir children . and the educ system should be renew in a way to keep up with the new tecnolog and the internet should be use in correct way . in the end i would like to see more action take in thi direct becaus real the youg peopl are the most import thing we have to rebuild our commun in a desant way that the countri could be respact
