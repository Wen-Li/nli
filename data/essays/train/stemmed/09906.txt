accord to my experi from the colleg year , i can say that learn fact is necessari to be success in your undergradu educ sinc fact are use in everi part of the lectur . also learn fact are of great valu to understand the life and to make easier it for yourself . becaus the world and the environ that you live in is full of fact everywher . for exampl , you wake up everi morn , see the sun and then night come and thi goe on in thi way . so you can not understand the differ between morn and the even unless you know the fact about the rotat of earth around the sun . henc fact help us to examin the world and have a meaning life . but i think that fact are not suffici to understand everyth . learn idea and concept is more import for student . becaus learn a concept mean learn everyth and understand everi term about it . in the same way , learn an idea consist of learn everi concept , everi thought and everi fact behind it . so you can learn the fact while you are tri to get the mean of an idea or a concept . also fact are hard to be memor . when you get the idea onc , you do not forget it and you rememb the fact by thi way also . furthermor , have studi idea and concept will give us a way of think about peopl and their behavior . for exampl , when you are think on an idea or when you are analyz an idea you may think about the peopl who had thi idea befor . question such as `` whi these peopl had propos thi idea such year ago ? '' or `` what kind of differ are there between us ? `` may come to mind . thu , these kind of question help you to understand the behaviour of the peopl and may be use to find out new thing relat to yourself . as a conclus , learn idea and concept are more valuabl to student than learn fact .
