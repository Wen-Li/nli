in my point of view , i agre with that most advertis or commerci messeg make product look much better than they realli are . there are three reason of my opinion . first , all of compani advertis their product to sell as much as they can , so they tri to show their product much better than they realli are . they even spend their cost for advertis tremend , and in these day , mani of compani consid how to make the best advertis or commerci messeg and hire some specialist for that . for instanc , one of the big compani in countri , toyota usual estim it cost for advertis approxim 20 ~ 30 % of their budget annuali . i assum that other also spend the budget for that . second , the compani usual tri to make their imag better and advertis is the primari stragedi for that . in my countri , imag of compani , industri , and product depend on what sort of advertis and commerci messeg they do and how they make the consum impress about them . in my countri , about 10 year ago a small ventur compani got bankruptsi becaus of the commerci messeg and it wa brought to the court . the judg rule that the imag wa part of sexial harrass . i think thi is rare exampl , but that is the advertis . final , the advertis compani are also do their busi . in my countri , i think it is the same as in the unit state , the competit between the advertis compani are also hard and they tri to make the best commerci they can . so , their motiv is also veri high . in asia , there is a big competit of commerci messeg and they decid the best commerci in everi year . in conclus , i can not say thi is good becaus we are confus becaus of the advertis and we just buy someth , even if it is not good . all we should do is just look anyth care when we buy someth .
