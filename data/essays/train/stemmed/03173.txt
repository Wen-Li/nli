i do n't think it can be consid as a `` natur rule '' the fact that older peopl enjoy life less than young peopl do . at the same time i must say that it is what gener happen , and for sever reason . first of all , we live in a societi ( i 'm specif talk about the italian societi ) in which the age a person decid to leav hi famili , for mani reason such as lack of job opportun , lack of `` braveri '' and so on , is close to 30 . thi mean that , until that age , young peopl do n't face a lot of respons they 'll be oblig to face in the futur . less respons for young peopl mean at the same time : a ) more avail time for them , who gener use it to enjoy life ; b ) less avail time , and more and more thought in consequ to their respons , for the parent . thi is the gener scheme of a normal italian famili 's dynam . fortun it- not alway like that . my person experi support me state hat . in fact i left my hous when i wa 18 and i came to live and studi here in milan , where i found a job and have my life without ani depend from anyon . that allow also my parent to spend the time they `` earn '' in some other activ , like have hobbi , or develop their person interest . enjoy their time . enjoy their life . even if thi is the most import reason that bring me to affirm that young peopl gener enjoy their life more than older one , there 's a second that is just a physiolog reason . it is not difficult to understand that when we are young , we feel like we can climb mountain , travel around the world without stop . we are full of energi , our bodi are readi to face almost everi kind of situat . it is not the same thing for older peopl , who necessar have to maintain a sort of proport between their effort and the forc they dispos of . a lot of thing becom forbidden just for physic reason . but on the other hand , as i said befor , older peopl can enjoy their life in a differ way , proport to their possibl , like travel , or develop interest
