`` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . i think that is not true and i will explain here whi on my own experi . when i wa at the faculti , i wa the manag of a place insid the univers that wa maintain onli by volunt student . it is a place where from 7:30 am to 6 pm student can come . they can rest , have someth to eat dure all day ( sandwich , snack food , croissant , pancak ... ) , play babyfoot or chess or other game . they can also read newspap , listen to music they like or come for concert in the even . the question is whi is that help our commun . the aim of thi place is not at all to make money and profit . peopl that manag thi place where not paid , onli student work to make food were paid . these young peopl are hire on the basi that they realli need thi money and that they ca n't get help from their parent . special in my faculti ( faculti of scienc ) , it is veri difficult to get a job in addit to go to the univers becaus gener we got about 30 hour of cours a week . these student work for us onli work 6 hour a week so they can find time to do it . we organis also twice a month on thursday a concert gener organ by an anoth associ where all the profit from the night are given to thi associ . for exampl , one of the associ need the money to buy some toy to distribut it to children that have to spend christma at the hospit . all the benefit we do each year which is not much is automat invest for local ' or for new materi such as tabl , chair , light for the scene . so i think on my experi and on what i have seen is that young peopl still do their best to help other as much as they can .
