i do not aggr with the statement . it is obviou that youngster and older peopl have differ way to spend their time , but it ha to do more with gener matter than with their capac of do enjoy thing . i know it is a common belief that dure the youth one ha a wider rang of activ to enjoy , but a more care view of the fact might chang thi posit . there are two main factor that could support my point . in first place , an import factor is the experi . the experi give a person the capac of make better decis but also give one a better perspect of life . both thing help older peopl to enjoy some event or thing which young peopl do not . secondli , older peopl usual can be benefit from resourc they have save dure their youth . thu , the avali of greater resourc among older peopl can also contradict the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than those older one . commonli , young peopl have to spend a lot of time gener those resourc . howev , it ha to be said that young peopl have some other advantag over older peopl regard the capac of enjoy some activ . the main advantag is natur their energi and - usual - health . young peopl have more energi and are usual healthier . for that reason they can enjoy better thing involv physic activ . the main exampl of thi is sexual , but there are a lot of other exampl like sport . in balanc . i think both youngter and older peopl have mani thing to enjoy . and there is no reason to think one of those group is more abl to enjoy life .
