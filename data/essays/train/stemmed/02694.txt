i do agre with the satement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' , becaus iam a teenag of thi gener . but if i would be a old gener teenag i would would think about thi statement , i have a reason reason for both of them which are explain below . if iam a teenag of thi gener i would strongli agre with the staement , becaus thi gener is a well forward gener than aprevoiu one , a lot of chang had came in thi gener , the techonolog is veri much develop so as the mind of the peopl esspeci teenag . they are well matur and know about the outer world much better than the old age peopl in thi gener . they realli enjoy the thing much better than a old age person do , becaus they are well awar of all the consequ about what they are do . for exampl , think of a student who tri to dirv a car in averi small age but hi father is worri about him but he knew the consequ of it and drive a car which he enjoy a lot while drive . but if iam a previou gener tenneag i would realli think of it becaus the envoirn then wa not as today where we cant find a place to enjoy a lot . the main reason behind that is there no develop at that time in mani area . and take in view of old age peopl they dont seem to enjoy more as the teenag or young peopl do becaus , they are bound to there famili and responsibitli , which make them to look after all the famili matter and they hardli have a time to enjoy the beautiful world . the old age peopl dont notenjoy a lot but they help their children do that . the young peopl doesnot have ani soght of pressur on them such as famili matter , bussi and so on . so they can enjoy a lot where as a old age person can not . on conclus , i strongli agre with the stament becaus of the abov provid reason and exampl which impl the statement .
