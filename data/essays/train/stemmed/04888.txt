unfortunatli thi world is affect by a new hill call market : capit and it consequ had creat an imperfect economi situat where industri need to chang consum 's will use the new method of propaganda as media . so the phrase `` product that seem much better than they are '' is an hillus assert becaus we realli do n't know what we are buy , eat and alway think . so i sure agre with the statement but i think is not useful to complain about a situat if you do n't work to chang it . the real condit of mani product are hide to the consum : we can find mani exampl , from medicin to energi drink . . but i think is the same in fact even though mcdonald 's product are label on theyr nutrit valu , pepopl continu in the same way . so probabl the onli thing to say is that we are all blind ! the matter is about imperfect of market and inform : with a basic econom studi everyon can understand that there 's no need of market for the right process of product and distribut of thing . in fact the problem born becaus of the presenc of oligopolist compani need bad devic to sell theyr product on an highest price . i think that almost food have to be cheke with much attent : the true caus of all the sik of our time { like cancer and so on . . } . although the modern centuri give to human popul time of bright , from the other side we are bound in a circl in wich { thank to televis and the million of spot everi time . . } other tell us what we must desir . in my opinion an implicit { but with our avali inform explicit ! } attempt to our will .
