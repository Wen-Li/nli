i do agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . the term `` enjoy life '' can be view at from mani differ angl and each individu will have an own way to explain thi phrase . but take into account all possibl aspect i can think of right now , the abov mention statement seem agreeabl to me . compar to the past , the youth in our societi today ha the freedom to achiev almost everyth - from enjoy a financi secur famili background and a prestigi educ in school to all person favourit , such as sport , social with other , and the art . young peopl are energet and can do whatev physic challeng there is to meet . they can travel the world dure their studi , they can choos from a varieti of plan for their career , and are most of the time prefer hire by employe compar to the elderli . but most of all , they enjoy a wide-spread portfolio pf person enjoy . in a societi focus mainli on the younger citizen , the way to enjoy yourself seem unlimit : danc club , bar , sport club , travel agenc , internet chat room and platform all offer their servic to their young custom . if you are young , you are in ! all door seem open . older peopl often feel exclud from such activ due to bad health , lack of energi or accept by the young . they often fail to catch up with the fast and immensli import develop in the telecommun sector and do not find mani possibl to share time with other . an exampl for thi strike differ between the desir young peopl and the reject older one can be found at ani time of the day in an ordinari chat room . the chat user tend to ask for the age and the sex of the one they are correspond with . not seldomli they close the chat window when the answer is `` 28 '' ! of cours , there are quit a few offer for older peopl , too . but i wit a develop in our societi that mainli the young peopl are enjoy themselv . mayb the older should get more motiv to learn new skill in order to enjoy their live . but mayb the young should accept and respect the fact that one day they too will be old . if our societi achiev that , then all will enjoy their live more .
