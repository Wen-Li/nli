sinc the time of the renaiss , peopl ask the question if it is better to have a vast knowledg in as mani field as possibl or to be one of the best in a singl subject . i believ that the rennaissance-man , a person who know a lot about mani subject , like leonardo da vinci , still should be the ideal for all of us - even if thi might sound a bit outdat . there are three reason that make me think that it is still wrong to special in one specif subject . first , there is my person situt . as a lawyer , it would be a big mistak for me to concentr on onli one singl subject . if i want to win a case in court in - for exampl , a case where technic question are to be consid - it is not enough to just know about the law . you have to understand the technic issu as good as possibl . second , sinc most peopl tend to special , the allround can have a big advantag . he is not part of the big crowd of specialist . he is differ . and there will alway be compani who want to hire somebodi who is abl to look at a certain problem from anoth angl - someth the specialist simpli can not provid . third , special can lead to boredom . the one that ha to deal with onli one specif subject for all of hi profession life is like to becom frustrat for not be abl to do someth els for an instanc . and becaus peopl chang over the time , do someth is what mani peopl desper want . da vinci wa an artist , a doctor and an inventor to name just a few of the field he wa work in . he alway wa given a job as far as i know . he wa abl to merg hi artist talent and hi knowledg of the human bodi - someth a specialist , taught in onli one of these field , would be unabl to do . and there are no report that da vinci ever got fed up with what he wa do . therefor i believ that he , who had vast knowledg of mani academ subject , still would be better up in modern societi than all of the specialist .
