ye , i agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . accord to my knowledg mani famou scientist , mathematician etc had tri to invent new thing even after they discov one task . a success man doesnot sit idl after finish hi work he will tri to invad new thing which depend on hi interest and he love to take more and more risk inord to acheiv hi goal . let us take an exampl of a school boy who is in the start step of hi educ . he will tri to improv hi academ life by reach higher studi one after the other , rather he dont like to sit in home and studi hi kindergarten repeatedli to becom master in that stage . so in the same way if ani human want to becom a success in hi life he should face the differ risk and face the outsid world to becom a success person . a boy can not becom an graduat onli in one day he ha 2 face mani consiqu an pass mani mileston and had to face mani risk in order to becom an successful graduat . in the similar fashion the peopl who keepon tri or tri to invad new thing becom more successful rather than the peopl who onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . let us consid an anoth exampl of a politician , ani politician can not becom directli presid of thier respect countri unless they take new risk and face all differ peopl . the politician start hi career from the small post as an local area leader and then tri to fight with the other politician in the assembl and tri to win over him an becom an minist . so , it can be infer from the abov exampl that the politician can not becom directli the minist unless he face differ risk and stand in elect and win . similarli thi suit each and everi human on the world that if ani one want to be success in hi life then he should take as mani risk as he can and keep do them .
