i total agre with the opinion that most advertis make product seem much better that htey realli are . first of all , the object of the advertis make the sale of product increas . in order to do thi , advertis emphas onli good point about the product and not mention the bad point . for exampl , when new small car is realas , in the commerci , it is enphers that the car is afford , but they do not mentin the capac is realli small becaus the point is not attract for buyer . also , we can see that mani advertis overr the product or hide someth behind the valu of product . for exampl , in the advertis about exercis machin , they mention how much effect the machin is . but often we can see the comment like , `` thi is not typic result '' or '' you have to control the diet '' . consum can not notic these comment becaus these are written in veri small print . additionali , popular movi star or famou peopl in the advertis attract peopl . in thi case , they trust the fame of the star , but they do not check the product well . even though mani peopl that know they should not be trick or they should look into product themselv , the degre of tactic of advertis are veri high .
