i support the argument that young peopl do not give enough time help their commun . in today 's context and scenario the concept of benevol and brotherhood no longer exist . the youngster these day have becom so obsess with the materialist pleasur that they tend to overlook or appreci the environ they have been brought up in . they are part of a rat race and constantli compet with their contemporari so as to get ahead of them . they seem least bother when it come to actual do someth for the benefit of someon els . it is the `` i , me , myself '' scenario that prevail today . i can say from person experi that the essenc of belong to a commun is lost let alon help other ! in the stranglehold of societ demand , we are all subject to just work for ourselv , to achiev as much as possibl - more perhap , if achiev ! it all about goal , target and result . we seem to have forgotten that at the end of the day , we , the human race must live in cooper and share a symbiot relationship with everi other be . we must learn to ` give ' and not just ` take ' - for the sake of moral if noth els ! but moral and principl are a thing of the past , long gone and forgotten . we tend to forget that onli when we give someth do we get someth in return . but again , just for our own selfish reason we must not resort to help anybodi els . the realis must come from within , it must be like an awaken that would lead us to help other , share with other and creat an amibl and comfort environ . as citizen of a commun , it is our respons to give other member their due . it is inde the need of the day to reinstut the valu of help other for the uplift of societi and the entir human commun .
