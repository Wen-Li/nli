the best way o travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i agre thi topic beacus usullay when you go anoth countri or citi , you heard someth or you prepar to travel . if you have a tour guid you dont need to look someth about thi place . tour guid usual know thi place becaus they are do thi job . and they can know everyth about thi citi : about histori , shop center , natur park , ... ect . so i want to talk about my expres . i went to itali with tour guid . it wa fantast . i went rome and it wa a so beati place . it wa histor place and they can make best ice cream in the world . when we went there we dont know what we gone a do and when we arriv rome internatoin airport our our guid wa wait us . he came to near us and he discrib hi self . and he told us let go to our hotel and be readi to rome . so we slept and next morn we woke up 6 am. and we took a perfect breakfast . first we went to lover hole . he discrib about histori and whi all peopl throw quarter to here . and we travel everywher . also we have lot of free time . in those time you can travel your self . you can see everywher whit thi tour guid . but sometim thi can be whore thing in the world . some tour guid doesnt know anyth about citi or that place and they couldnt tell anyth about citi . it can be so bore . but usual tour guid select person . and they know three or four langu . and usual they were born in yhi citi or they were live in thi citi . they can take special histor class for those tour . i beliv the best way to travel is in a group whit tour guid . becaus if you dont want to join group , you can stay and you can travel by your self or usual they give you free time to travel in thi place . thi is the best way to travel .
