knowledg in ani form is welcom be it in depth or breadth . for the develop of a societi both type of peopl are requir , those who have in-depth understand of a particular subject and those who have a gener understand of mani subject . in my field of consult it is import for me to have a broader understand of busi rather than focu on ani one . therefor the pattern of knowledg would primarili depend on a person profess and futrur aspir . i support the statement that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject are requir , but even specialist are necessari . there is no-doubt that special in subject lead to further develop of technolog and theori which help the societi at larg . for exampl the invent of variou kind of vaccin were done by emin research and scientist . howev , research alon doe n't guarante the success of an invent , it wa a collabor effort of businessmen who fund thi research and made sure common man ha access to it . so it is not onli specialist but also generalist that we requir , who have a bigger outlook and can co-rel thing . but again it is the job of a person that should decid the apttern of hi knowleg . for exampl if the aspir of the individu is to becom a professor or research , then sure an in-depth understand of the subject is indespens . which would requir him to focu on a particular subject . on the other hand , if the person is a journalist or a politician , a broader perspect of societi is requr , to perform well in their job . on conclus , i would like to add that both form of studi are import . generalist and specialist both are requir for the develop of the societi .
