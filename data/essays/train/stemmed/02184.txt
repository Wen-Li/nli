it would be univers acknowledg that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . accord to me , thi statement can not be entir true . let us consid my person view and the comparison between a young peopl life and an older person life . for the great major of peopl , young bring all that a person want : health , beauti , love and so on . and it is wright . but someth everybodi ignor , is the notion of time . in our societi who ha time to do what they want ? current , young peopl are the most of the time student . they have a lot of work to pass their exam and have their dilpoma . by thi way , they studi a lot and spend their time work at home or on campu . ad to thi question of time , a student ha no money . studi are veri expens , abov all in the united-st . a master could cost 20 000 euro for a year . it would be difficult to have extraordinari week-end or travel to a foreign countri or to do a veri expens sport . all these thing bring us to consid difer a young peopl life . with no time and no money , how could a student realli enjoy is life ? on the other hand , older peopl do not have all the daili life problem ' . of cours , they have some healthi problem but they have time becaus they are retir . they work all their life , they accumul money . they can travel all over the world and make their dream possibl . they do n't have children at home , they do n't have a lot of preocup . they can live their life as they want , see their friend when they want . accord to me , older peopl could enjoy life a lot . thi brief present can lead us to reconsider the statement . young peopl are to busi to lead their life as they want . old peopl have thi opportun . it is import to realiz thi . it is my person opinion .
