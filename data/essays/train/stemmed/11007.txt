accord to the question `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' i agre to the fact in the question . i feel that thi issu is not in a specif countri or commun but it almost in the entir world of human . life compar to the past ha chang a lot today . the gener today have a busi life of their own and may have forgotten their respons of give a help hand to their commun . in today life the young peopl are busi with their job , own famili , kid and are tri to give better comfort , good educ and a luxir live to their children . talk about job or a busi profess there is so much competit among the co-work to updat themselv and go to better posit through promot . in certain situat the young peopl forget the sacrific their parent did for them , in bring them up to a good posit by give them good educ and provid all the nessic they requir in their childhood . there are a lot of old age home com up everi where all over the world for the older commun . the strong reason behind thi is the older commun is be neglect by the young one . there are other reason too in a develop countri like india where the popul is veri high and there is a lot of unemploy , in such situat the youngster have noth to do for themselv and are helpless in their own situat and can not do anyth for their own commun or older commun . financi burden is one factor that everyon face today and the greed for a better posit and a greed for more money make the younger gener selfish at time . so accord to me the younger gener do not concentr in help their commun either the older or younger commun .
