i agre with the follow statement . success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i have three reason that i want to support my point of view . first of all , i think that if a person is alway feel passion on meet new peopl , learn new thing , tri new stuff , that mean they are not afraid they did wrong thing at least they tri . it not a big deal for them becaus they have a stronger attem than other peopl . in addtion , learn more thing that you do n't now is good to you . for examl , i am lear a new method for solv math equat , and by do thi , i 'll understand more solut that other peopl do n't know . so , i am be a better student that the other person . secondli , i find out that to do such new thing is a littel bit hard for most of the peopl becasu they are not good at . howev , if they break that mind which seem nervu and afraid , they 'll go trough it and will get a lot of fun by know fresh thing . further more , chang your mind and learn will make you enjoy the thing what you do , i think thi is also a big idea that those success peopl have . thirdli , i believ that most of the success peopl have attempt for their goal , they use certain way , veri activ and power way as the process they 'll do . for exampl , onc when i wa have a dinner with my parent , they 've give me some good idea and i never forget about them . the idea are if you never tri , you never win . and the other one is if you learn more than other peopl , you 'll get more chanc than other peopl . those are the word i alway rememb and i realiz the life from real , thing just like those word . lastli , to conclud base on the reason that i gave abov , i agre with the follow statement . success pepl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
