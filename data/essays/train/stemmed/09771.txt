i diasge with the statement . accord to me it is equal import for student to understand idea and concept and learn fact . mostli idea and concept are base on fact and if the student would n't know the fact how would they understand the idea and concept and build on them . let take the exampl of a nuclear fission/fus reaction and the nuclear energi which is use to provid electr to a larg part of the world . if the person who came up with the idea of build a nuclear reactor would not have known the fact that nuclear fission/fus reaction emit a larg amount of energi he/sh would not have come up with the idea of tap thi energi and concept the idea of a nuclear reactor . fact are like the foundat stone without which all idea and concept would be baseless . equal import is for the student to understand the idea and concept . if the student do n't understand the new idea and concept how will the world advanc . all these technolog innov today have been possibl becaus peopl have thought over the idea , extens research the fact and then use both of them to their advantag . for exampl , if alexand graham bell would not have had the idea that he could build telephon or thoma edison would not have the idea that electr bulb could be made then we still might have been live in a world full of dark and thi kind of commun would not have been possibl . also if the student would not concentr on idea then they would just becom a kind of robot with data/fact feed in and with no innov and imagin idea . student also find an outflow of their emot in the idea they express . so , the student should concent on both ; learn the fact first and then build idea over it . both are equal import .
