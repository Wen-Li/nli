i think that , the young peopl dont give enough time for help their commun . as the most peopl accept , the life ha chang consider and thi caus some chang on peopl characterist . the effect of thi chang can be seen on the issu of the help the commun . the follow consideratoin can be accept to as a caus of thi chang nowaday , young peopl dont have suffici amount of time to deal with the social occur . young peopl have to particip an educ institut and they have studi for their cours and thi take a huge amount of time . for the sake of the success on the life , young peopl have to dealt with their educ , after the school life , these peopl encount a job life and again thi period spend a too much time of peopl . as we see from thi life condit , young peopl can not find enough time to take part in social activ and they tri to particip more prefer activit in their free time , the second consider is that the young peopl encount a huge amount of competit at the recent time . as you guess , the high level of competit affect the think of the peopl and thi make peopl to less awar to issu that about their commun . in the school life and the job life , young peopl spend a big amount of effort to reach better posit and thi increas the selfish level of young peopl . these peopl onli think abount better posit , better educ and final more money and thi is the opposit of the expect result . eventu , we can say that young peopl will be less involv in the issus about the social life at the futur becus of the recent life style . the peopl who live in 1700 , less involv in educ and the ecenomi . therefor , they were more involv in social activ , the level of the competit wa less at these year and so peopl respect more to other peopl and the issu that are anbout the commun . we have to decreas the level of the competit and the work time in order to increas the involv level of the young peopl to issu about the their commun .
