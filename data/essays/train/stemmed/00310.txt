given an oppurtun i would like to answer the question base on the countri about which the question is be ask . in my percept the answer complet depend on the natur of the nation and the peopl about which we are talk about . so i would like to both agre and disagre with the given statement . in the present day world we have nation with variou econom statu . there are develop nation , develop nation and underdevelop nation . we can see a definit distribut of the number of car in relat with a countri 's econom statu . a develop countri ha more number of car per capita than develop countri which are follow by underdevelop countri . sinc much of the world popul still live in develop or under develop countri we can say that number of peopl own car in the present day is less compar to that who do n't own . as time pass nation gradual develop and the per-capita incom also increas so the purchas power of a citizen . so we can see that number of car should rise in the next twenti year . but thi alon is not the point . as the number of car increas the fuel consumpt in countri would also increas lead to a fuel scarciti and henc price rise . but thi will again not be the same global . countri which are rich in oil will have a compar much lesser price rise than other in case they do n't want to export their oil . so we can clearli see that the citizen in these countri can afford to buy more car than other lead to an increas in number of car . anoth point to make is environment concern . sinc increas in number of car would lead to an increas in green hous effect peopl concern about the same would tend not to use car . but again we lack the data regard how much of the world popul is readi to give up the comfort of use car for sake of environ . anoth import point to think about is the public transport system in a countri . if the govern improv the same peopl may tend to use car in a lesser number . thi again would vari from countri to countri . sinc i have no inform about the abov mentoin point i ca n't cast my vote to whether number of car would increas or decreas . if i were given the data regard the growth rate of variou countri their popul , their econom polici onli then can i clearli say whether there would be an increas or decreas in number or car .
