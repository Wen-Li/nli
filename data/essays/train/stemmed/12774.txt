it is quit an import question . i think it depend on the level of the studi . actual , if the student is a graduat student , it is quit differ than if he is an undergradu student . in one hand , a broad knowledg of variou subject is import to aquir a good cultur . it allow the student to have interest in a lot of thing . besid , if he doe not know what he would like to do , it is a way for him , to hit variou subject upon , and whi not , for what he will be passion , or unless what he would do later . in the other hand , to special in one more specif subject would be better for a student who know for what he is interest , and who want complet hi knowledg , i mean , who want aquir a deep knowledg . thi student could get bore by the other subject . even though , i own up , it would be a way to allow him to find interest in other thing . actual , as far i am concern , i would rather prais for a progress solut . and i think that it is what it happen in the univers . i mean , i suppos it is better to have a broad knowledg at first , in order to special in one specif subject after that . thi is whi i told about the undergradu and the graduat student . an undergradu student ha a knowledg about variou subject , unless a gener knoledg , and when he becom a graduat student , he can special . it seem logic . a graduat student need the whole time to concentr and stress hi subject as better than he can . eventu we can also ask if the better wa let the student choos . would it be possibl imagin a personn program which would match with the student plan ?
