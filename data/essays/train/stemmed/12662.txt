person , i do prefer to travel by myself . travel with a group ha limit that i think reduc your experi in a place you have never been at . everytim a person is lead by a guid , hi prefer or opinion are more like to be affect by other 's opinion and , also are predetermin by a person that alreadi ha a point of view base on hi own experi . when a person travel by hi own , the onli way to enjoy the travel is to be alway awar of the world around , due to it is a new place and your sens are open to ani movement . it is excit becaus if you do n't take care of the thing around , bad experi will happen easili . from thi perspect , there is not doubt that travel in group is much better . a group give you a safeti sensat , even if you do n't know the peopl around , a feel that whatev happen you will have somebodi to share with , neg or posit . also , a lot of friend can be made in a group trip , i believ it is anoth advantag . it is usual a long time spend togeth with new peopl that at the end , you share your new experi with them . in other hand , travel alon is a great idea to make new friend . although it is true that it 's onli you in the trip , it doe n't mean that it is onli you at the place you are visit at ! also , at the end , you will share your experi with other peopl and the most import , other 's will share experi quiet differ from your . as far as you are will to meet new peopl and know differ place , a predetermin group is not necessari to enjoy a trip . in regard of the tour guid , from my standpoint , learn and search inform by myself is the most reach way to expand your knowledg about a new place . a tour guid will onli tell you typic thing , memor inform from a book or a littl guid . then , if i just want to know gener thing , i do n't need a guid , i need a book . travel by your own , you need to get inform , map , place and peopl . howev the difficult but also the most reward part is not to have the data , is how to get thi data . due to there is nobodi that will provid you all the instruct for the next day , schedul and rule , it 's necessari to creat your . creativ is the most import ingredi in a succes trip , you need to defin what to see , when to be there and how to enjoy it . besid , travel in group is much more expens than travel by your own , and in fact , it ha sens . if you want somebodi to be your tour guid and a complet schedul of your next day activ , you have to pay for it . in conclus , a travel experi is much more appreci when it is creat by the person , it is a way of live a trip even befor you leav home .
