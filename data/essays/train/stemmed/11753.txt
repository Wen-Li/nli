i disagre with the statement and it is what i do n't like of the intruct system of my countri . i 'm stude engen and i have to studi a lot of thing , a lot of idea and concept of difficult subject . my professor onli explain concept difficult to understand and , import too , to rememb for the exam . i see that there is someth wrong becaus if i studi veri much for the exam and i bare rememb a concept , two week befor i ca n't rememb that concept becaus i do n't undertand it or becaus i have n't a fact that can conduc me to rememb the concept . i think if a professor tell a fact or a stori to support a main concept or idea i can use that fact or stori to rememb and , most import , to understand it . i can say thi becaus i had a professor of ecolog and he wa veri differ from other professor . he onli spoke about fact of littl anim to reach the main concept of their reason to leav a place . or for exampl he explain a chines problem with the women popul . he told that a chines man can be consid a man onli when hi son put him in the ground for hi death . for thi reason when a chines man had a doughter he kill her becaus chines govern do n't want famili of more than five person , so the women decreas . with these exampl i understand and i rememb ecolog thing after three or four year . i think that is the best metod to explain complic concept too , and it is a funni and not hard way to understand and rememb thing of differ subject .
