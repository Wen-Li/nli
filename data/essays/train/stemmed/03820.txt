from the topic , `` young peopl enjoy more than older peopl do '' . i disagre with the statement . accord to me both the young and the old peopl enjoy at the fullest , becaus there is no age differ in the time of enjoy which is to be done by all . and be born as a human be it is the must . but the differ is that the young peopl enjoy accord to there young knowledg wherea the old peopl enjoy accord to there age and knowledg . `` peopl here are born on the earth enjoy '' .and the sentenc present that `` life is like perform a drama on the stage `` which is done though all the part of the thing .. exampl : happi moment , sad moment , memocra and etc . . but in life not onli enjoy but also sad n all the tmoment should be take place so that we can know about the thing happen in the word and the natur of the young and the old peopl and mani more thing to be discuss . even old peopl came from the young age which may not be said or to be discard from the topic . young peopl enjoy in the way pursu or gain new thing such as love , friendship , etc .. ; which are the must for both the youngest and the old peopl . wherea , the old peopl do by listen the old stori , song etc .. ; `` life is to enjoy by make mistak '' thi is done mostli by the young peopl to know someth new they make mistak , there is no wrong in do that . but just gain someth new . there is no such rule that onli young enjoy wherea the old doesnt . we have to make all the peopl enyou in thi pendimonium . life is defin as l = live i = in f = fullest e = enthusiasm . thi is to be kept in the mind by al lthe peopl on the pendimonium . so , final accord to me i can say that both the young peopl and the old peopl enjoy their life and must do to the fullest .
