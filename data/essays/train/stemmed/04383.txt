each and everi person know how to have fun in hi or her own way . i complet disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do '' what is fun ? all the smartest mind combin on our mother earth will not be abl to answer that question . everi one ha a differ idea of fun . i am ninteen year old and when i wa younger i defin thought that my parent were bore and i never want to do anyth fun with them . i thought that my friend and i were the end of the world . while on the other hand my parent went out all the time and had fun too . fun is what a lot of peopl would connect enjoy life too . in my opinion that 's incorrect . i like to go out , parti and spend most of my time with my friend but on the other hand my aunt prefer sit at home and watch t.v or talk on the phone or surf the internet . she sit at home and i parti , to a stranger my aunt would sound realli bore but she ha fun in her own way . she 's enjoy life too . older peopl suit the phrase `` been there done that '' perfectli . they have experienc what the younger gener are go through right now at thi moment . younger peopl want more and older peopl are satur and want to do differ thing which would relax them . to enjoy life we have to do what we like , even if it just sit and stare into thin air and we have to do these thing with the peopl who we love and who love us . spend some qualiti time with the peopl who we care about , what more could anyon ask for ? enjoy life is a must but how you do it is n't . pursu your dream follow not onli your heart but also your mind . do it well and dont forget the poepl who have stood by your side along the way . to enjoy life older peopl do n't need to be parti anim , as long as you do what make you happi your automat enjoy life in your own special way . .
