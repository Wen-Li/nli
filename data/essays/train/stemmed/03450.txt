i strongli agre with the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . actual i think that tri new thing is the most import thing to do to becom success . if a person tri new experi and discov new thing , then he or she ha the possibl to learn to do those thing veri well and to develop them becom success in do those thing . as a result thi person would be consid a pioneer by other peopl in the `` area '' she 's work at . for exampl , to becom success a manag could find out a new way of run hi busi : for istanc he could tri to improv the method of work , to decreas cost or to make peopl work harder by use promot . thi manag would be recogn as a success person becaus he ha discov a new way of work that allow the factori to save money , time and to do better . moreov i believ that success peopl are use to take risk more than other peopl do becaus of their enthusiasm for new situat and becaus they have an optimist view of the situat that they have to face with . in fact be an enthusiast and optimist person help to face new situat and help work out good solut to problem . for exampl , if a manag strongli believ in what he is do , i 'm pretti sure that he will achiev hi aim ; if thi manag stongli believ in hi decis , he wo n't stop work when he will meet difficulti or problem , but he will work harder to find a solut and go on do what he ha plan to do . in conclus , i completli agre with the statement abov and i think that onli success peopl could improv and bring new aspect in the world becaus do alway the same thing , though it is well done , doe n't bring , in a long time , new idea and consequ improv at all .
