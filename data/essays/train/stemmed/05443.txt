academ subject that a student take will help him get into the school , colleg or the univers that he want . what subject should a student studi ? how mani subject should he/sh studi ? all these question confus each and everi student in the whole world . if a student specialis in one specif subject , he/sh will have mani advantag and disadvantag face him . start with the advantag , we will find that thi student will feel comfort and happi as there will be no pressur on him . moreov , the student will know what he/sh is go to specialis in as he/sh get into colleg or univers and will not the troubl of be confus later in hi life . howev , the student will face lot of troubl if the specialis doe not suit him . and if the student wish to chang the subject , thi will not benefit him/her as he/sh will have to start all over again and waist lot of time ; and as i wa onc told `` time is like gold , if u do not benefit from it you will lose it '' . on the other hand , if a student ha a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , he/sh will have less disadvantag than the advantag . firstli , he/sh will switch into ani other specialis when feel like it , if the student find that the first one did not suit him/her without waist ani time . furthermor , thi will help the student in his/her life outsid univers as he/sh will have lot of gener and specif inform and knowledg . in my opinion the onli disadvantag here , is that he/sh will have a huge pressur on him and will have lot of hard time . sum up all those idea , i agre with the statement and would prefer to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . although i will have hard time , but thi will save me the troubl of face the abov disadvantag . just as my friend onc did and told me `` i do not regret it at all '' .
