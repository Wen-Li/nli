i agre with that statement to a certain point . success peopl are wealthi in most case , so they probabl have the money to tri new thing or even take risk . for exampl , if you take a look at the busi world , you are abl to find case where big busi put a new articl on the market , even though they are not sure if that product will sell well . that 's call take a risk . the peopl behind the big busi have the money to make and solv mistak without have to suffer . they have the urg do creat someth new and pleas more costum with their product . if they kept do what they alreadi know how to do well , they would probabl get bore . it 's in the human natur to tri out stuff . human are veri interest in that . it 's a kind of feel that they have insid , almost like an instinct . on the other hand , i know for a fact , that there are also incid , where success peopl just do n't want to come out of their shell . they feel comfort with what they are do becaus they do it over and over again . they also have the knowledg and do n't realli feel the urg to put themselv in a situat of risk . risk can have bad consequ and could ruin that person 's life . it may lead that person to a break-down and ruin everyth he alreadi accomplish . some peopl are just not readi to put themselv in situat that contain risk . all in all , i think that it can be healthi to put yourself in a situat of risk , becaus there are time that thi might make you stronger or even wiser . it is proven that peopl in risk situat are under tension . tension make you work harder and give you the opportun to accomplish more . at the end , i have to admit that the statement ` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well` , can be support or not , whether it is right or wrong .
