in my opinion , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept as onli learn fact . becaus learn fact is not the elementari problem . if they understand the main problem in gener , it is easier to learn the fact , becaus they have enough scientif background . addit , if they understand the scientif concept and model , they do not need so much help , for exampl from teacher . the student can learn in self studi and answer their question themselv by analzi the problem . the student have to learn how they can solv such problem . thi is what the univers and school want to show the student . becaus in real life are too much fact . nobodi can learn all these fact , becaus there is not enough timeand it will be veri ineffici . so scientif want to formul gener concept that are base on an import idea and develop a model , on which they can show the fact of the real world . these are the basic of research . the scientif result base on research activ come form an idea of the research . if the student learn these concept and model they can use them for other situat and they will get new fact . the understand of these model and concept summar a lot of inform and fact . it is veri effici to use such concept and model and understand the main idea they are base .
