it is a veri import question , but the answer is not veri simpl . the number of car in use chang due to sever reason . 1 ) the price of oil ( gasolin ) in the world . if the price of oil in the world will be higher , then peopl will tri to use the public transport , becaus it will be cheaper than use the car . 2 ) the econom growth in diffir countri will increas the number of car in use . 3 ) the growth in popul . 4 ) the develop infrastrctur construct for public transport such as : train , subway train , electr train , etc . .. 5 ) the effort to make the envior less pollut . the abovement reason effect the number of car in use in the futur . while someon may say , that the envior issu ( pollut ) will be a veri import problem in the world , and it will be solv by reduc the use of car , the other will say that thi would be right for the countri with a strong econom basi , but not for the third world countri or for the non develop countri . these countri may face an econom growth in the next twenti year , and therefor it 's citizen will use more car , in particular if there will not be a conveni public transport system for use . in addit , these countri may invest there major effort in the futur in increas the econom growth , instead of handl enviorment issu . i believ , that the use of car in the strong economi base countri will be reduc in the next twenti year , and that is becaus of : 1 - the develpo public transport system they have . 2 - high price of the oil in the world . 3 - enviorment issu , that will be veri import to be solv by reduc the pollut of the envior . 4 - the minor increas of the popul itself in these countri . on the other hand , i am not sure that the use of car in the third world , and develpo countri will be reduc in the next twenti year , but it may happen afterward .
