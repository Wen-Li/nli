i complet disagre to the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for 3 reason . first , i often see mani product written `` no fat '' or `` no chemic '' on the paccag . when i bought some pack of yogult written `` no fat '' on their paccag and ate one of them , i felt that it wa too sweet to eat and it must contain fat . second , the advertis want to increas benefit . if they put some word that fascin consum on their product , the consum would buy them ; even though , those word are actual not real . especi for the consum who are interest in health or environ . final , mani consum alway tri to buy better product . the advertis know that , so they put fascin word on the paccag . these are becaus that i think the advertis do n't make better product than they realli are . i want to them to make the believ product .
