student should reli in fact and not concept after i graduat from high school , my physic teacher taught me all kind of concept for algorythm and formula . later , at the univers , when i wa do my internship , i look back and ask myself . whi i did not learn more didact and practic thing ? fact are the best teacher that a person could have in hi life . concept are good for the basic teach but it is not use in the real life . action demostr ten time more than a singl concept . a good idea is the one that it is made a realiti . for exampl , let 's imagin that i am an engin and i onli know the concept to oper a machin . can you imagin ? what am i go to do when i will be in front of my boss and tell him , `` i onli know the concept . '' it is ridicul , to learn someth without a logic mean . fact are the physic prove of a hypothesi or a project. a student can not learn just an idea , they need to know how to develop the concept . in particular when i wa work in a manufactur industri , we had to give our client hi product . we could not just tell him that we had the idea of what to do but not how to do it . thu , it is import to be awar of what a student is learn becuas if he doe not , it is onli an a wast of time . a student ha to consid the fact instead of the idea becuas it is the onli way for the student to understand the purpos of a lesson . in particular , i enjoy take class at secap becaus they give a few theoric class and the rest is use practic which will help me in my career . it is clear , then that the idea are just a vagu imaginari action that should be put into action . henc , student and myself have to reli on the fact of everi lesson , for those are the one that realli matter in our life and societi . between an idea and action , there is a process to work on .
