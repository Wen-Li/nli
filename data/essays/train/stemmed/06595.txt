mani peopl may think that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . on the contrari , i believ that mani young peopl give a lot of time to help their school mate , famili , and other citizen . my reason here is built on the two follow argument . first , i think that mani peopl just doe not see the young peopl 's help to their commun . i will give two veri relev exampl from my own experi to support thi idea . i spent my summer vacat in california , volunt in the '' trail mainten crew '' at redwood nation park . dure the two month i spent over there , i met dozen of young volunt , but i met onli one volunt over the age of thirti . thu , mani young peopl are volunt for free worldwid in nation park and forest , but onli veri few peopl realiz how much time these young peopl gave to help preserv the world 's natur ressourc . anoth relev exampl are beach lifeguard . mani peopl lie and rest on the beach without think about those young lifeguard . these young peopl spend their day watch for endang swimmer , and sometim risk their own life to rescu them . then , i think mani peopl still focu on the damag that young peopl can caus . i will again use an exampl from my own experi to illustr the fact that young peopl who feel respons of the well be of their commun still exist . for instanc , there an associ in my school , whose member clean the facil and repair broken item after parti . thu , i think that mani young peopl continu to give their time worldwid .
