in my opinion , the statement given is partli true and partli fals . although the sens of commun servic ha decres to some extent among the young peopl , the number of peopl who concious take up commun servic ha not decreas . i would like to support my view with the follow reason . firstli , i think that thi statement is not complet true becaus , in the past , commun servic wa mandatori in mani countri . for exampl , in germani , everi individu had to serv in the armi for a minimum of two year . thi wa not a conciou decis taken by the individu but by the govern . present , there is no such rule . so , when it come to statist compar the number of individu who on their own , take up commun servic of some kind or the other , there is no big chang in the number . also , in the past , the number of peopl who remain dedic to commun servic is veri small compar to the number of young peopl who were expos to it . secondli , the reason whi i think the statement is valid to certain extent is : due to a drastic chang in the pace of life in the present era of global , young peopl spend most of their time build up their career and catch up with the rapidli chang world . in thi process , they find veri less time to devot to commun servic . and even if they do devot some time , it is not a conciou effort . that is , becaus of the less time they get to devot to commun servic , young peopl do not understand the joy , purpos and responsibl involv in the process of commun servic . so , to certain extent the stament is infact true . to sum up , i would like to state that statement is partli fals becaus the percentag of peopl commit to commun servic these day is more or less the same as the percentag of peopl who concious commit to commun servic in the past . also , the statement is partli true to a certain extent in put forward that young peopl these day do not involv in servic becaus of the reason put forward abov .
