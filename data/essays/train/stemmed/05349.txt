in my openion young peopl do enjoy life more than older peopl . thi is a veri evid fact and can be said base on reason . firstli , younger peopl have more risk take and dander face tendanc than older peopl . young peopl are carefre and more enthuziast than older peopl and henc they tend to perform ani activ for just the sake of enjoy . while older peopl do not have that carefre and risk take attitud . older peopl are much matur and tend to focu more on the danger and possibl of damag or accid that lay ahead . so , younger peopl mani time enjoy themselv by take up riski sport like car and motor-bik race , bungi jump and para-sail . secondli , the phsical condit of older peopl doe not mani time allow them to move to differ place and perform mani fun relat activ . while the bodi of younger peopl is more flexibl and strong so they get less tire . so , they can enjoy by take up sport , long countri tour and other similar activ as a sourc of enjoy for themselv . also , young peopl are more flexibl an adapt toward the chang in the cultur and in technolog and henc more by go to a disco , pub , get tattoo , play game on comput and use variou eletron item like i-pod and mp3 player . lastli , though it is possibl for older peopl to enjoy life but they are not abl to enjoy as much as younger peopl due to other limit . older peopl have mani respons of famili , work and societi on them . so , they are not abl to enjoy themselv as much as young peopl who are free from these respons and have much more time to enjoy . therefor , it can be said that due to carefre , flexibl and risk take natur of young peopl it is possib for them to enjoy more than the adult who are less flexibl and have much more respons on themselv .
