there are variou method that could be use in order for a student to learn new inform . some student would choos to deepli understand idea and concept while other would choos to learn fact withoud a deep understand of them . personnali , i would definit choos the first method which is a deep understand of idea and concept . i truli think that it is much more benifici to understand rather than to learn . first , i would say that thi method is a veri interst one becaus when you understand someth , you get interst and fascin about it and about the way it work . let 's take the exampl of a physic cours . i think that a student would be much more interst by understand a physic concept for exampl the way cellphon work rather than learn by heart some fact or conlus . in addit , i am highli convinc that when you learn thing by heart without realli understand them , you tend to forget them veri fast , so you would have studi these fact for noth . it would have simpli been a loss of time . futher more i would add that understand idea could be veri benefici for the daili life . let 's take anoth physic exampl which is electricti . when you learn how elctric work you are then abl to deal with ani electr problem that you could face while you are at home , and would n't be use the help of an electrician . howev if a person ha just learn some fact about electr , it would then be difficult for her to soplv her problem without the help of someon els . final , i think that the more you understand a subject , the more professionn you becom in thi domain . and thi is how we 'll be abl to evolv , and make new discoveri that could be veri benefici for evryon . in conclus , i would say that it is way import for student to understand idea and concept than it for them to simpli learn fact . a deep understand of a subject could be much more benefici than a simpl learn of fact .
