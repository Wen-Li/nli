in my opinion , i think that for student it is more import to understand idea and concept , becaus the student do n't forget them . for exampl , i studi civil engin and for prepar my examin , i understand more concept , scientif teori have mani concept that elabor mani idea , instead if i learn fact , i must hope that i do n't forget them . when i have start the univers i have find a veri good professor that i teach my like understand fulli idea and concept , as to do summar fact in few idea and concept , for have compless panoram of the problem . on first time , i work hard to improv thi method , but i have satisfact while i wa stude and dure examin . my memori is not veri hard to memor each idea and cocept so i write each thing . write help me to recogn and understand idea and concept , anoth way of understand idea and concept is that record lesson , convers and other that is import for my everyday 's life . howev is more import understand what there is beyond thing , therefor idea and concept . for exampl when somebodi projectd an object , he use idea and cocept of theori that him understand . for other student that studi in umanist univers , i think that it is more import for them learn fact . infact when they go to examin , they must talk about specif fact , like for exampl stori as civil war , and so they studi specif fact and not onli understand idea and concept .
