i disagre with the statement . i believ the best way to travel is to guid or plan a trip by oneself . in thi way , a person can see what she want to see and spend as much time as she want at a place where she want to be . in addit , she can learn a cultur of a countri where he or she is visit . the problem associ with a plan tour by a travel agenc is that a travel can not stay a place where she is visit for as much as she want becaus the travel is alreadi schedul and the tour ha to move on on time . henc , she ha less time to see or stay at a place where she is visit . in my opinion , thi is neg becaus i do not like to feel be restrict by time . anoth problem with a travel compani 's plan tour is that a travel will not be abl to get to interact with peopl live in a countri where she is visit . interact with local peopl in the countri is the best way to learn it cultur . if she wa in a group led by a tour guid and have a question about the countri , she would not ask local peopl walk on a street but rather she would ask it to the tour guid who come from her countri . howev , if she wa not in the tour group and had a question about the countri , she would have to ask to local peopl . i believ interact with local peopl is a great way to learn a countri 's cultur becaus by watch how they react to a travel and she can learn some aspect of the cultur . in conclus , it is better to plan a trip by oneself rather than follow a plan trip offer by a travel agenc . some might argu that the plan trip by the travel compani would be better becaus travel do not have to worri about where to eat and how to get to a place and so on . they are correct in that travel in a countri by oneself where local peopl do not speak a travel 's languag is hard and creat a problem with food and so on . on the other hand , i believ that it is a part of travel a foreign countri . if there wa not such a part in a travel , it would be the same as stay in your countri . struggl with get food and get to a place would give a travel a good experi on how to function in a differ cultur and how to adopt it . overal , i believ that travel in a foreign countri by oneself will give h an experi that he can use for later in hi life .
