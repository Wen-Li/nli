i disagre with the statement . becaus i think idea and concept are made by peopl . if each of the peopl live in differ countri , each of idea and concept are differ even though they think about same thing . for exampl , i would like to talk about world war 2 . my grandfath joind the war as a soldier when he wa 20 . hi idea is that the war wa made by sever countri govern . the japanes govern is one of them . my brother said that did the japanes govern start the war when he saw a movi ` pearl harvar ' . he had littl doubt it at that time although he had alreadi learn the war at hisori class for more than ten year ago . some korean friend ask me if i felt guilti for the war and korean . all of these idea are not offici statement . but i am sure mani peopl have same idea as those peopl . they knew about some of the fact . i think if i understand each of idea without the fact , it is not real understand . when i want to understand some idea and concept , i should focu on what the idea and concept were caus by . thi is the most import thing for understand .
