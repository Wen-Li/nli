some peopl overestim the import of fact and not pay enough attent to idea and concept , while some other approach the issu from a revers angl and not care about fact and focus on idea and concept . i do not share ani of these margin posit and think that a middle-way includ all these factor in differ variaton should be appli in eductaion . focus onli on idea and concept is problemat for student . for instanc , if a cours on 20th centuri polit forc student to pay their attent onli to the major polit idea and concept in 20th centuri without present ani histor develop or fact about the era , it can not be fruit . moreov , it can confus the student ' mind by leav idea and concept in space . it can becom a bore philosoph discuss in the eye of student , which say noth about the era 's actual polit life . overestim the import of learn fact in educ process is similarli problemat for student . if that cours mention in the previou paragraph give onli factual inform and focus onli on concret histor develop , it can easili fail explain the polit life of the era . becaus the idea and concept that had major impact on these concret develop are inseper part of such a cours . they have a vital role in explain those event . without them , the cours may becom simpl stori session in the student ' eye . on the other hand , combin these factor in educ is useful in educ . if the professor of the cours mention abov pay balanc attand on factual inform , idea and concept , the cours can becom an effici cours that cover the topic in a comprehens way . the student can be abl to link all the inform they obtain from the cours and have a complet pictur of the polit scene of the era in their mind . in conclus , i believ that idea , concept and fact are inseper part of a whole . ani educ method that omit ani of these part is veri like to fail . in other word , student need to understand all these factor in their educ process regardless of the topic they learn .
