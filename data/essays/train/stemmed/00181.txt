in the past , the car had develop from a luxuri skill to a usual materi . now , there are a lot of car get more modern . also , there are mani car compani and factori which build more car . now , there is a statement claim that in twenti year there will be a fewer car in use than there are today . but i disagre with that . the car develop in more than a hundr year to an usual thing , from 1886 to now . and it 's still develop in thi time ! mani factori build more car to get more money , becaus everyon ha a car or more than one . for some peopl car are like friend and they them need them for a show-off . when peopl want to go to anoth place , they use their comfort car to get there . so , the factori can not stop build more car in the next twenti year , becaus they want more money . becaus of the pollut enviro more modern car are build which need liquid ga what doe n't pollut the air . so , thi is anoth reason for the factori who can not stop build new car , becaus they have to design new one , too . i think , to have fewer car in use on the street we need more than twenti year , becaus in thi time peopl still need their car either for a show-off or for comfort move . also , it took more than a hundr year to develop and when it will go back , it can not go faster , in my opinion . if the statement claim that in sixti or seventi year fewer car will be in use than today , not in twenti year , then i would agre to it .
