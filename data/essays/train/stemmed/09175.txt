peopl alway have like to travel , but there are two princip way to do that , travel in a group led by a tour guid or travel alon . both way have advantag and disadvantag . when peopl travel in a group , they have to follow all the instruct of the tour guid . they have to start and finish the experi at the same hour , and if somebodi doe not like the rule , he can not do anyth for achiev hi wish . there is no freedom . for exampl , in the rome 's tour , there is not time to visit all the place in the citi , the tour onli visit the coliseum and the vatican . howev , if you like the speech from the tour guid , you can enjoy the experi a lot , becaus you do not have to look for the interest site and it histori or it data , the tour guid provid it them to you . thi way to travel is so easi and comfort . altough mani peopl prefer the way to travel alon , becaus they do not have to follow anoth group . they decid all that they will do by themselv . they use a map , a tourist book or the advic of some friend . they visit all the place that they want and stay there one day or one year . in thi way to travel you can spent your time or your money in your deepest wish , your doubt about some place and cultur or attend your necess . in my opinion , i think that it is the best way to travel , becaus i have the freedom to chose what site i will visit , what food i will eat , what time i will spent and at what hour i will wake up and i will start my experi . for exampl , i want to visit quintana roo but the group led by a tour guid probabl visit cancun in the morn not either tulum in the midnight .
