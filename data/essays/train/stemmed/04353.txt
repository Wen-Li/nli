i disagre to the statement that state success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know hot wo do well for three reason . first , success peopl prefer to train their skill and knowledg even though they alreadi know how to do well . although they have good skill and knowledg , they may not tri to take the new thing and take risk becaus they know that chang their mind often can wors their abil . by take the new skill and risk , they can improv their knowledg and becom more confid ; howev , if they do so , they may also take the risk to dwindl their abil that wa aquir well becaus they should concentr on onli the new thing to improv . second , success peopl want to util their knowled and skill in the futur . the success peopl , who have the great knowledg and interest in the particular thing , dream to work in the futur that requir their abil . compar with the normal peopl , the success peolp have been enthusiast about the onli what they want to improv and what they intrest in while normal peopl have intrest in a varieti of thing , for exampl , tenni , pianno , karat , etc . final , compet with other are the most import reason that the success peopl prefer to continu to take the risk and train their skill that they alreadi know well . by have the rivel , success peopl tri to defeat each other . when the rivel defeat other rivel , then the other rivel tri to defeat the rivel and work harder ; howev , if one of them chang their risk to take , then he/sh will recogn it as rivel admit lose . in the conclus , success peopl tend to do not take the new skill and risk becaus they have rivel , desir to util their skill and knowledg , and want to improv them . in my opinion , take the new skill or risk is not bad , howev , if they realli want to improv their skill , they should not tri to learn ani other new thing ,
