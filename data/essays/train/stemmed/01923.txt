i agre with the claim that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are mani reason visibl in thi world of today to say so . first of all in today compitit world all youngster are run behind their dream . thi make them less avail to contribut toward their commun . they dont get enough time from their school , class and extra train session , which may be regard sport or educ . younster think that if they dont take their field of studi or sport serious and instead give more time to thier commun they may fall way behind in term of other in the compitit . in short in today world they dont have ani time other then for their carieer . with the higher sophist in today life . everybodi especi youngster spend more time in discos and pubb , movi theater and parti . they give a great deal of import to such thing then contribut to commun . as they whi to wast time in contribut their commun as they can enjoy their life for a more amount of time . also the point of view of think of today youngster is total differ . they think how will they be benifit by do someth for the commun . for instanc , what will they get , if they spread the messag of keep their surround garden , beach , etc. cleen by send flier and bill . they alway expect someth in exchang to do someth . the lack of awar about their duti and respons toward their commun have made them to avoid their oblig toward their commun . what we lear in our school and colleg is not enough for an individu especi an youngster to implement total . even the parent have to chip in some advic and thought in their grow child by introduc and make him or her know what part of the commuinti do he belong and how can he contribut in the welfar of their commuinti . thu due to lack of awar , no time for activ other then their carrier , and sophist of life style youngster are not give enough time to their commun .
