a famou man onc said , `` from experi , come skill . .. yet experi come from risk . '' thi mean that to obtain skill one need experi , and to obtain experi one need to take a risk . therefor to be success one need to learn how to take risk . when a child goe to school , they are taught the essenti that they are go to need in their life ; read , write , listen and leadership . when thi child move on to high school they are taught specif what they need to learn to fullfil their ambit . when a child graduat from school they use their previou knowledg to get a work place and a consist job . .. then what ? the person ha got thi far , yet are they truli success ? are they truli at their full potenti ? the answer is no ! one will never get rais or move up in the corpor ladder if they are onli do what they are told . thi is becaus everyon els is do exactli what they are told too . to make one self stand out they must be abl to take risk and put yourself on the line . show the employ that you are will to do anyth for the caus and you will get move . howev if you stay put and dont take risk then you will not move anywher and stay at the same level as everyon els that doe n't take a risk . a prime exampl in histori is that of galileo . he took a risk by defi the whole scientif system of hi time and say that the world wa round and that the univers wa heliocentr ( sun in the middl ) . of cours he wa laugh at and not taken serious , yet now student write about him in formal essay such as thi one . thi man prove the whole world wrong simpli by take a risk . there is no man or woman in a histori book that is there becaus they did the ordinari , they are all there becaus they took some sort of risk . to get far you will have to do thing you alreadi know , yet to be truli success you will have to take risk .
