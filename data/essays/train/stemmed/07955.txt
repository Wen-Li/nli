although travel in a group led by a tour guid could have a great posit impact on the travel experi and knowledg base , such perk are more that often diminish in comparison to the manifold problem and distract that aris from such trip . it is true that tour guid , especi local one , are more knowledg when it come to their citi and provid deeper insight and plausibl suggest on what and where to see and do . futhermor , in a group situat , be part of event and trip is usual more interest and enjoy and provid a great opportun to meet other peopl and make new friend . howev have a tour guid and be part of a group could hinder the overal experi of a citi or place due to the numer formal and regul they tend to emphas . with tour guid come cast in concret plan of everi minut and hour of everi day , week and month . sinc tour guid are manag larg group of peopl it is veri import to keep time and schedul for everi aspect of the trip ; from visit monument and tourist site to dine and sleep . unfortun , thi would take away all the spontanea from the trip render it veri systemat , dri and simpli bore . not know what you are go to do for the day , or sleep in in anoth might be all that you need to rejuven yourself dure your travel . parallel such argument and in respons to the dynam of group travel , mani other neg aspect usual aris . have too mani peopl would usual result in conflict ; it is veri hard to get consensu in the case of a decis make situat . furthermor , it is the natur of a group to includ peopl from divers background and valu system . thi would more than often surfac at some point and caus some kind of disagr that would result in a bigger complic that both parti would have to keep up with until the end of the trip . therefor , one can avoid such problem when travel by choos to travel with a coupl of friend or famili member instead of be part of larg highli organ systemat group experirnc . have a guid book or ask local for suggest would adequ substitur for a nag tour guid . now a person could be more spontanea and not govern by rule and regul on the onli true break he/sh might get per year . i believ i have strong convict toward my opinion for the reason that i wa part of a group trip that wa led by a tour guid for too long period of time dure one of my summer vacat and that certainli did not turn out to be a good experi .
