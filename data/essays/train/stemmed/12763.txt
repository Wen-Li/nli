i disagre , but not entir , with the idea that have a broad knowledg on mani academ subject is better than be special in one specif subject . i think that there should be a balanc at the time of gain knowledg . therefor , you should special in a topic but at the same time you should be open to learn other topic . gain knowledg of mani area can lead to what i call : `` dilut of knowledg '' by dilut of knowledg i mean that , although it is true that you know about a lot of topic , but becaus there is not enough time to obtain all the import inform of everi subject you would end up with a littl bit of inform from everi area . therefor , you would have dilut knowledg . have dilut knowledg can be perjudici when you encount a problem that requier you to know in depth about a specif problem . for exampl : in order to have a job , societi expect you to be special in a topic , when you see the employ section in the newspap you would not see an add that say : search for a person who know a littl bit of everyth . you would find compani look for peopl with special of differ area . by other hand be a veri special person can take you away from societi . for exampl , i am purs a bachelor degre in mathemat , and i know for sure that if i onli concentr in learn math i wo n't have anyth interest to talk about with other peopl who are not in the same area as me . as an anoth exampl , i have work with peopl and problem from other area . thi summer i work with biologist in a problem consern dna , in thi case it wa veri import for me to know the biolog involv in the whole process , but i wa need , becaus there wa a mathemat problem that they could not solv by their own . you could see how be special in math , but also have knowledg in biolog wa veri import . in conclus , peopl should special in an area in order to be use in the labor aspect of societi but they should not concentr onli in their special as they would disconnect from other aspect of societi as for exampl , social . also , special could be use in topic that are differ from your special , becaus , specialist of a certain area are need in problem outsid special topic .
