i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . it is veri import for young peopl to help their commun , becaus the societi is not made of individu rather a group of peopl . today , the most of the young peopl have neglect attitud toward their commun . they dont care what is happen in their commun and what is be done is correct or not . there are sever reason for such an attitud among young peopl toward their commun . first of all , they are not motiv enough to help their commun . their parent and other famili member do not tell them about their duti toward their commun . they dont encourag them to help their commun . thi may be becaus of the sever reason like the famili dont have enough time to spend time with their children and talk about all these . secondli , now a day young peopl dont get enough time to help their commun . now young peopl have more responsibilit , more competit to face . the studi have becom more tougher . student have to take lot of examin to get admiss into school and colleg . so they spend most of time think and prepar about their studi . thi stop them from think about their commun . for exampl , a student who is prepar for an entranc to get admiss into a graduat school will have limit time to think about hi respons toward hi commun . also young peopl think that it not their duti alon to help their commun . they have a wrong notion in their mind that whi onli they should help their commun , and not the other belong to the same commun should come forward and help . so they keep wait for the other onli to take the initi and final nobodi make a posit move . but the young peopl should realiz that even they are part of the commun . they should think that if they help now , they will get the help when they requir it . so they should understand their responsib and tri to find some time to help their commun .
