in thi period of time advertis have a veri strong impul and influenc in peopl 's live . first of all i have to say that i wa born in thi gener where the industri more or less can not surviv without advertis . from share experi with my mother and read magazin from the '' sixti '' , even back then advertis play a big role in sell product . i agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus that 's the best way to win custom . human be of cours , onli want to see , touch , feel , smell .. etc. the best a product can offer with the sens god gave them . regardless of the fact that a lot of product have disadvantag , peopl are prone to be blind by the beauti and the advantag of the product itself . for instanc , a simpl product like '' soap '' , ha to fulfil it purpos . as a young ladi i want to have soap that smell good , look good , a kind of soap that smoothen or even whiten my skin . it is proven and i have read a survey oh how mani peopl read inform on the packag of the soap if thi kind of soap is dermatolog test or not . the low amount of custom that read thi inform stroke me . all what peopl want is what give them a good impress in ani art of media . newspap , magazin , poster , tv and radio advertis will tri to do their best in thi competit world market . in order for a product to seem better , advertis compani would do everyth to attract peopl . as i have mention there is great competit in the market . and i have learn dure my highschool time of strategi advertis take . for instanc , if they want to attract young peopl the advertis compani will use a model who is popular , like a famou soccer player or a politician who wil of cours tri to impress and catch the eye of the viewer by wear '' nike shoe '' . if one person buy those nike shoe , everybodi els will . that | 's how we peopl are . i am awar that advertis are exager and sometim full of lie but i can not deni that i am a victim of thi trend .
