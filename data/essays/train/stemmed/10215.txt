i complet agre with the view that take risk and tri out new thing , rather than stick to known way , make success peopl . thi fact can be simpli illustr with veri preliminari exampl . like for exampl , had jame watt not tri to innov a new way of transport option , the steam engin , and would have been satisfi with the then prevel transport option like horse-cart , where would we be today in term of comfort , cost and time benefit we draw from transport ? same is the case , if the wright brother would have stop after the steam engin revolut . contin evolut is alway possibl , becaus i think noth is perfect to be accept as it is forev . i will use more technolog or busi environ relat exampl to explain thi view further . in order to remain compet and profit , busi have to be innov . tri out new thing enhanc creativ and can lead to either new concept , process or product . it can also result into better way to do an exist job and lead to most cost and time effect solut . for exampl , when geograph distribut work wa not as famou a concept , chines and indian compani pioneer the offshor concept . thi led to benefit for both the parti , provid opportun to the develop nation and huge cost save for the custom , which effect lower price for the develop countri . tri to remain in the safe zone by stick to exist known way and not indulg into risk take is veri harm for busi . for exampl , if microsoft would have been satisfi with their window oper system product have a huge market share and would not have innov for improv their product , their market share would have been gobbl up by new product like linux . the most direct critic of take risk , is that if the exist way is well-establish and near-perfect , tri new thing would be wast of time . and it could be a costli ventur if tri new thing yield noth , after all it is associ with risk . but i do not agre to thi critic becaus i believ , that even if sometim be innov just end up be a cost-overhead , in long term it will defin not be so , becaus of the dynam natur of our busi and environ .
