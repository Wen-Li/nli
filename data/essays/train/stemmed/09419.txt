i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what alreadi know how to do well . there are two reason . first , when high school student , i attend box club . in practic , i prefer to weaker peopl to fight with , becaus it easi way to improv my technic without pain . in other word , i wa ordinari boxer and could not win at big competiton . on the other hand , one of our club member tri to fight with stronger person than he is everytim . i think he tri new thing which is riski to becom strong boxer . final , he won a big competiton and be chosen as a japan 's represent boxer . second , the presid of microsoft corpor drop off hi school and focus on a new technolog . although it is challeng , if he fail , he lose good oppotun for prestig sinc hi univers is well known for reserch and studi . he invent new program and it spread out all over the wolrd nowaday and is the world richest person of thi year . in conclus , at least these two success person challeng new style and found their style . it deriv from take risk somehow , so i regard that peopl who achiev someth have tendenc of challeng new thing and take risk .
