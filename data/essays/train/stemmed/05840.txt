it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agre that it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . becaus the student , they need idea and concept to understand the lesson or what they are watch . if u give a child a pictur or a photo with no explain , he/sh wont know what is happen in the pictur . the child need atleast someth to talk about the pictur or what is happen . for exampl , just a pictur of a guy stand do noth . the child will not know anyth , but if there is a pictur of a guy do someth he/sh will know what is happen . the guy might be eat for play or anyth like that . but if onli give fact to the child , he will not think , he will just do what is he told to do and never think . the best solut is , and what i think and tri , is that give idea and concept and teach them the fact are much better . they can think and give exampl of what is happen . sometim it just easier to memor someth but it wont help if thi thing happen in real life . for exampl , just memor the rule of the chess game and never play it , you wont know how to play unless if u tri it mani time . it good that the person know how to use the fact and know how to give sampl what is happen . for exampl give fact of what 's happen now between israel and palestin that israel conquer palestin and will never leav it free . thi is what i think about the import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
