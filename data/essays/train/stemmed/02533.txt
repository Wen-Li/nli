i agre the idea that it is more signific for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first of all , mani of the student would prefer the easier and quicker way of understand . understand idea and concept is easier for a student to manag the inform . if a student learn a new thing , she or he would first ask the idea and concept of the thing to realiz the condit of the new inform . thi way alway seem more practic to the student . i also would prefer thi way , sinc understand the main idea by explain both idea and concept would make me understand more easili . fact are longer and harder way for most student . sinc learn a fact contain mani detail in itself , it would be more complex for a student . learn fact also take longer period than it doe in understand idea and concept . thi is mainli becaus of it complex . if i would be introduc to a new topic , and given the specif inform by learn fact , it would take me longer and harder to learn that topic . becaus i have to analyz the fact first and then the relat thing that effect the fact . howev , to understand idea and concept would suppli me in realiz the new topic by give specif inform by idea and concept .
