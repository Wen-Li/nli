i do n't think that thi statement is gener right . of cours , young peopl have other abil than older peopl , and can thu enjoy differ thing . but i think that there are also veri enjoy aspect of be old , and thi is whi i do not agre with the statement . be young is in our societi often equal with have fun or be without worri . i think though that thi is a big myth . of cours , especi the physic abil are much bigger when peopl are young : it is easier to stay up long and parti without be total sick the other day in your twenti than in your thirti . but on the other hand , be young goe also along with a lot of specif problem older poepl do n't have like thi anymor . for exampl it is veri difficult to learn and experi what it mean to be adult , to learn to take respon , to learn what person you are , and so on . thi is one main reason , whi i do n't wish to be twenti anymor . i think thi can be extrem exhaust - the older you are , in contrast , the better you know yourself and the better you can enjoy that . anoth exampl is the decis young peopl have to make and the expect they have to fullfil . they have to decid for a career , find their own specif way and place in the societi . they have to studi and they have to go through a lot of frustrat find out what they want , on the one hand , and what option societi provid for them , on the other . afterward peopl often mystifi school and studi time as time of open , freedom and choic - forget how difficult these choic often are , and that thi open and freedom is also a lack of clariti on what life offer you and if you are abl to succeed . in contrast , i can imagin that be old can be enjoy , although i think that the physic problem most old peopl encount may offer a challeng . be old can mean that you can final realli enjoy your life after you found out who you are , found your place in the world , and made your way . i can thu imagin , that be old is actual , at least in some regard , much more enjoy than be young .
