befor to start with my opinion of the topic i must to say that in thi life what is the much import thing of a product ? so if we want to respond about thi question we can tell that the imag of a product it 's veri import but it 's onli a vision fact . so i agre with the topic . the advertis make product seem a good imag , so the peopl are involv to buy these . they show us the best qualiti of product and not the realiti . an exampl is if you want buy a car you see that thi car is the best for speed , or eleg , or hors power , or other characterist but you do n't see what is the consum , if the power of thi car is economicali good . but the advertis are in all our life , becous if you watch tv show or program there are mani break of advertis , if you read a newspap there are page and page of advertis , when you go to work or onli you go out in the street you can see more and more advertis . so they are a subliminar messag . and the power of it is that can seem product better than realli are . howev , the advertis are most import for the economi becaus a good advertis can make some profit for the industri . but the buyer have one thing from their side , that the product is much far from realiti they ca n't buy it . in conclus i 'm in accord at the topic but i tell to all the peopl of the world that not are impression for the apper of an advertis but see the realli qualiti of product , that we can chang someth in the world .
