im fulli agre with the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . it 's true becaus most of young peopl is so busi to help out their commun rather than adult peopl , special in korea , they actual live with mani complic thing for instanc school , and after school they most go to the campu , and studi , they should go to the colleg at all . i think they do n't even have their privat time to spend . but the valiu way , of cours they have to concern with it , that may belong to educ . their definitli busi , but if in their heart , if there a littl concern with commun , they 'll help commun by themselv . howev the young peopl of thi centuri is not that nice actual . it up to themselv but ; in my experi , they use to think about their friend and what they like to do . i meant , it just like an child who do n't concern the futur . for develpment of good thing is up to how do they think about it . of cours some tend to neg but some are not . and im not sure few peopl would like to dedic their good for the commun . thu , thi problem will be better as much as inhavit mind are grow . howev , most of young peopl would n't like to do someth for the commun , is the truth , but i hope it will be better .
