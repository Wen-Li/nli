i agre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have coupl of experi and reason to support my opinion . first , it is alway more fun for me to travel with a group of peopl . sinc i consid myself a social person , it give me a great opportun to make new friend . for exampl , i had such a great time in my last trip to itali . we visit the histor place dure the day time and enjoy the delici italian pasta with a glass of wine and laughter at night . it wa incred . furthermor , a tour guid is veri veri import for a travel . i believ that it help a lot to visit the new place with a person who alreadi know about their histori . it is harder for me to read it from a book . also , i have a short term memori on those kind of thing . the first time when i went to barcelona by myself , i had alreadi forgot the stori of the famou sculptur , so it did n't make ani sens to see them without the particular inform . final , i think it is much better to walk around with a group of peopl . it attract the local store owner . they tend to be more kind becaus they realiz that it is a group of tourist who know noth about thi place . also , a tour guid help us to get discount for the souveni from the store he know . in conclus , . although i prefer to travel alon at the begginnig , i realiz that it is more fun when i travel with friend or my futur friend to be . that 's whi , i believ that it is much better to travel with a group of peopl and a tour guid
