as an italian citizen work and live within an american environ , after read your question whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact , the first thing that came to my mind wa the differ in the teach and learn principl that i could identifi between the italian and the american system . until recent , the italian educ system ha been focus and built on the import of theori on practic , to the point of deliv highli educ graduat student that due to the poor or complet lack of practic , experienc a veri tough time onc out in the work market , tri to get a job . on the other hand , what i have seen of the u.s. educ system tell me that it is center more on let the student learn from fact than from theori . person experi : my husband is a comput network engin and i recal hi first comput network colleg book includ sever chapter explain the mathemat and physic principl relat to issu like band-width and associ data transmiss speed . well , known that unfortun my husband ha a veri poor math and physic background , i ask him how come he end up get an a to that class and hi answer wa realli astonish for me italian student , use to the italian educ system . basic , my husband told me that their teacher simpli told them to skip all the math/phys chapter , becaus they realli did n't need to know whi thing happen in a certain way , but just the way they work . hope , i am sure that not all u.s. colleg teacher are like the one abov that wa teach comput network to my husband and most like hi case repres just an extrem . nonetheless , i do deem that a littl more attent to theori may benefit the u.s. educ system , just like more practic would benefit the italian one . basic , in my opinion , `` understand idea and concept '' and `` learn fact '' should be consid as factor equal import to student . actual , to me the ideal educ system should contempl an equal distribut of either learn system . in conclus , to me the appropri educ person is the one that know not onli how thing happen ( learn fact ) , but also whi the world run the way it doe ( understand idea and concept ) .
