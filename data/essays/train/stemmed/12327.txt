i disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i think that to understand idea and concept is veri import , but i think also that to learn fact are not less import thant idea and concept . they are at least at the same level . i think that idea and concept are at the base of a theori and so they are at the base of our knowledg , but sometim fact can replac and modifi the origin theori , so it is import to know real fact ! in itali there is a famou afferm that is `` la miglior teoria e ' la pratica '' that can be translat in english with `` the best theori is the real pratic '' , and i think that thi afferm repres perfectli my opinion . in our world there are a lot of job that need a lot of experi , and experi can be `` reach '' onli by fact rather than with idea and concept , that they are also import of cours , but without fact nobodi can `` reach '' an high amout of experi . anoth exampl is a normal math exam : to prepar a math exam we ca n't onli studi theori on the theori book , we must do a lot of exercis if we wont to understand how the theori is use in realti , or at least how the theori is use in the exercis that will be in the exam . in the end , i dont know if my thought about the import for student to learn fact is condivid by all other peopl , becaus i know that there can be a lot of peopl that thought that is import onli to understand idea and concept , but that is my opinion and i think that is right .
