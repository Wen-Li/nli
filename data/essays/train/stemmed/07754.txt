some peopl might say sussess peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than what they alreadi know how to do well . as far as i am concern , i agre with thi opinion for the follow reason : success thing is not come from ordinari thing . in addit , peopl who are readi to take the risk and danger thing could grow up perfectli . first , in my opinion , there is no easi way to success all over the world . in thi regard , peopl have to work hard tri to find someth new in their daili live . for exampl , peopl who want to be success should find extraordinari thing in everywher . in contrast , peopl who are want to go easi way and follow other could be just a normal person . although mean of success is depend on the person , but all the success thing our life is from hard work and process . for these reason , i think success peopl alway tri to do new thing they did n't experienc and take risk . second , from my experi , peopl who are alreadi success must have confid and leadership . in thi societi , they are all kind of peopl in the real life . most of them are member , few other are the leader of their compani or factori . for exampl , mr. lee , the ceo of well known compani samsung , ha tremend think and vision . i do n't know much about him , but i know he chang hi way of made hi compani with the whole new progress be against the ordinari way . at fist , befor the time he wa not a ceo , samsung wa just a second group in the countri , but after he promot to ceo , he renov hire system , factori system , everyth new to the peopl . later then , samsung turn to success group in the countri , and even abroad . with thi reason , i stronli agre that success peopl tri to new thing although it ha follow with the risk . in conclus , i stronli agre thi opinion with success peopl tri new thing and take all the risk rather than onli do what they alreali know how to do well for the teas reason : there is no way to success easili , and peopl who are readi to face the risk can surviv and live success . thank you for read .
