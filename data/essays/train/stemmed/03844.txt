the issu at hand is whether the number of car in use will reduc , as compar to today , over the next twenti year . accord to me , thi statement is not in harmoni with my thought . i think that the number of car in use will , infact , increas over the next twenti year . firstli , use a car add upto the conveni of an individu . it reduc the travel time , that is , one can reach hi destin earlier in a car . it also give comfort to a person dure hi travel , not stress him out becaus the journey . so , peopl will think of buy car rather than wast time and get stress out becaus of the journey . thi will lead to a consider increas in the number of car in use . secondli , have a car also add up to the statu of an individu . most of the peopl predict an individu 's person by look at the car he drive , that is , the car speak for the man . as year pass by , the physic appear of the car will becom more and more attract , therebi hypnotis peopl . thi will help an individu to show of hi person by purchas an appropri car . so , peopl will prefer to buy car over year in order to creat a distinct appeal over other peopl . thirdli , consid the advanc in vehicl techolog , it ha becom easi for an individu to afford a car . the modern technolog and innov have brought down the car price consider , which now provid an opportun to the bourgei class of peopl to afford a car . as , we know the major part of the world 's popul compris of the middl class , i think , thi will consider account in increas in the number of car over the next twenti year . also , the recent technolog ha increas the effici of a car to run more mile on compar less number of gallon of fuel , that ha attract a lot custom which will again account in the increas in the number of car in the next twenti year . final , i conclud by say that , as long as technolog and human desir exist the number of car in use will keep on increas over time .
