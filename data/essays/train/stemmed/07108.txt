in my point of view , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . a gener concept or idea is made of fact , which are statement found in textbook or encyclopedia . nevertheless , it is clear to me that the import of fact ca n't be decreas , becaus in certain field of studi such as histori , fact are extrem relev . but in most field of studi , without a gener understand of the concept , fact appear worthless . on one hand , concept and idea have an import that ca n't be diminish , becaus those are the element that will help one to learn the fact . without understand the concept or the idea , a student will not be abl to learn but more importantli to rememb for a long period of time the fact relat to the concept or idea . for exampl , in an astronomi class , the concept of how the planet evolv is more import to understand than to know the exact figur or path constitut the planet 's movement . on the other hand , concept and idea are what help a student in hi futur profession life . the fact can easili be found again in a textbook , on the internet or in ani databas . but if the concept made by these fact is not understood , the student will not be abl to use the fact properli . for instanc , a law student , as myself , ha to learn a lot of fact and regul . howev , those fact or rule wo n't be use if the concept is not understood . when , in the futur , thi law student who becam a lawyer is confront to a tough case , the gener idea of how the law regul on that matter will help him solv the case , wherea the onli regul , if not understood , wo n't . in that exampl , the everyday life of a lawyer prove the import of the concept becaus fact or regul can be found easili . in conclus , gener idea or concept are the essenti part of what should be known and understood by everi student . howev , what make a student excel is to both understand the concept and learn the fact .
