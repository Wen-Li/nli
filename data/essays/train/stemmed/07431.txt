as the modern societi is develop faster and faster , more and more better facil , interest thing that did n't happen in the old year appear , our youth is absolut serv more confort than those older peopl in such world . 3 aspect of reason or exempl can be shown to support my vote for the statement : young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . for instanc , my citi ha just built an gorgeou play park where you can enjoy most exct and thrill play facil . i have been there 3 time with my parent . everi time when i immers myself into those attract play event my parent just sat there to look at me `` fli up and down '' becaus they are a littl bit of old for those play event , they may have some worri even a littl fear toward them . as we all know , young peopl nowaday often prefer to do a lot of thing on comput such as shop , read and sometim studi through the internet . on the other hand , older peopl more often have troubl deal with these machin which can bring a lot of convini to our work , studi and life . as a result , older peopl can onli solv problem all by themselv . but how can they keep up the fast pace of the modern world with their lower effici ? they will have less time to enjoy the beauti life . as far as i wa concern , young peopl are more adapt to the quickly-chang world , they easili convert their thought of thing ; they are more like to chang their attitud toward life and the way of live . whenev newer and nicer thing appear , the young will be the first to take them , follow them and enjoy them while older peopl alway have cold feet to new thing and alway over think `` so-cal '' risk of those thing . in conclus , i rais both of my hand to agre with the statement : young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
