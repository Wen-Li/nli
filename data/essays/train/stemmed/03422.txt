i disagre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , becaus that peopl have more self-confid than other . for thi statement , there are a easi reason . when you do someth success , you are glad and you know that you can do someth well . so you have more self-confid than other peopl who tri to do someth well but it doesn ' t want to be as they want . and thi must be a reason in my opinoion , whi success peopl have to search a new challeng . often a new challeng bring some risk with it . but success peopl shouldn ' t be worri about that . for them it should be nice to have a risk and to do someth new . you can compar it with the word `` no risk , no fun '' ... perhap for some success peopl it could be bore to do the same all the day . in my opinion , they have to test someth new . it is too easi to do what they alreadi know how to do well . the problem is that these peopl can ' t improv their-self anymor in thi way . thi is bad and don ' t help them in their life . and for me , the life is onli interest that when you finish someth that you have to find a new challeng in your life . than you have someth in front of you what you can reach . i think that is import and not to do onli thing , yo alreadi know how to do well . that is too bore , i think . but perhap , success peopl onli do someth they alreadi know how to do well to not becom problem , becaus they aren ' t so good at the begin like befor . perhap , these peopl are afraid of do someth new . but thi can ' t be a reason to stop of do someth new . i think , it is too import to look for new challeng that you can ' t never stop it ; never now and never in your whole life .
