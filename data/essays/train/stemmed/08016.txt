at school and univers , student are ask to studi an enorm rang of differ subject . also the way student confront class differ wide accord to what they 're be taught . some cours requir that the student memor fact ( e.g. , histori class ) , other tri to develop student ' particular skill ( e.g. comput scienc class , sculptur class ) , and in other student are ask to concentr on particular abstract concept ( e.g.philosophi class ) . i therefor think that a success method of studi depend on what is be studi and focus on . it is not possibl to state whether it 's more use to understand idea and concept or learn fact , unless we consid what time of subject is be taught . the topic of one subject may be mainli factual , while in other class the focu is on the discuss of concept . if we take a cook class for exampl , we see that both concept and fact are import . we may want to learn where and whi italian pizza wa creat , what the condit of the land that concur in it creation were , and whi it is call pizza . but at the same time , becaus we 're attend a cook class , we want to know how to cook it . the ingredi that we need and the kind of manual work requir are the basic element in our lesson . so , in thi case , both concept and fact have the same import , depend on the emphasi the teacher or student give to what they 're examin ( in thi case , the creation of a simpl but success food ) . thi exampl demonstr that there are more than just one way in which one could approach his/her subject of studi . therefor give more import to one aspect ( fact ) rather than the other ( concept ) or viceversa is not a success way to learn .
