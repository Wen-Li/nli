i strongli subscrib to the statement and support the thought that , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the reason that i agre with thi statement are detail in the follow passag . in recent year , improv in manufactur techonolog ha ushur a hoard of car manufactur compani . for exampl , econom and technolog develop countri , like the unit state of america , have wit a grow automobil industri in the late 1980 . thi growth in the automobil industri link with increas consum spend power and lower interest rate on loan result in million of car be produc and sold yearli . further , globalis ha spread thi market worldwid and the recent asian develop ha seen addit of more car to the alreadi larg number . howev , thi growth come with a debilit factor . earth ha a constant pool of resourc , which all human have to share . due the sharp growth in the number of car and other transport mode , the petroleum resourc are under great stress . there ha been great emphasi on altern fuel sourc and transport mode . mani compani and gover have initi technolog program seek solut to the current problem . as the old say goe , `` necess is the mother of all invet '' , human will be abl to surfac abov thi problem with ingenu and innov . there are effort alreadi in the direct of mass air transport system which would make car redund . new energi sourc have been discov to support air transport , and corpor such as airbu are alreadi dream of provid individalist air trasport solut . thi would greatli improv transport speed and avail . in conclus , i would like to use exampl from the great visionari of scienc fiction , arthur c. clark , who said that there shall be person air/spac travel modul avaibl by the third millenium , and we would n't wast time build road through air for our car ! and henc , there shall be no need for car in twenti year from now .
