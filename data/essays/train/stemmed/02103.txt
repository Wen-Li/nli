some may argu that success peopl do n't tri new thing mean that they do n't take ani risk in the life . howev , i disagre with thi opinion and for some reason i beleiv that one should take risk in order to be success in the life . first of all , tri new thing develop one 's imagin and creativ . in other word do the thing which we alreadi know bring ordinar and make peopl 's life monoton . i think , imagin and creativ play veri import role in be success . onli if you have some extraordinari imagin and creativ you can succeed . i wolud like to qout from albert einstein say `` imagin is more import than knowledg , knowledg is limit but imagin encirl the world . '' on the other hand , the life itself , i beleiv , is a risk . no one can know for sure what tomorrow will bring . so , if we are live in a riski life , then , it is unnecessari to hesiti to take some risk in the life . by take risk , peopl increas their chanc of find new opportuni to make their life more enjoy , confort and desir . i think , most of the success peopl take risk beacus of the invevit of risk . thirdli , no one can know what someth new will bring without tri it . i mean , of cours , while someth new will have both neg and posit effect , not to tri it restrict the probabl of get the posit side . i beleiv that make some preliminari studi , i mean think , one can easili take risk in the sake of get the posit side . for these reason i state abov , i am of the opinon that success peopl tri new thing and take risk in the life .
