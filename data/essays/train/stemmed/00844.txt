i agre to the given statement . succesful peopl tri new thing and take risk . all the peopl could do wat they have alreadi known , but the peopl who tri for acheiv and observ new thing were vrey great . normal peopl are differ from scientist , who alway tri to invent new thing . as i am interest in research , i prefer peol tri new thing were great and they would be the succes in their carrer . for exampl : there are 2 type of job offer for differ peopl . one is relat to their knowledg an the other somewhat relat to brainstorm and work hard to prove it and show better result . so mani were interest in select 1st job , but few peopl who were realli look for good carreer select second job and tri whi it is difficult . not onli job , in practic life also peopl wont risk to do thing they dont know . for exampl i n a school , quiz show , is take place . teacher ask question if the student dont know the rigth answer , no one risk to press the button and answer . they probabl think whi should we take risk ? they simpli say that we dont know , and they didnt even tri for the answer . thi is not hte right thing . some student tri to answer the question and even it wa wrong they should not feel antyh wrong . and thi is the right way . now they attempt wrong and next time they rectifi their mistak and abl to rememb the answer correct and these student score good mark . and these student will come up in their life brightli an these are succesful on their career . so , i probabl conclud my opinion by mention that risk should be taken by peopl in their live which lead to succesful person in their career . what we have known is known , that we can not do ani thing . what we dont know is consid and tri to know someth better and be a success person .
