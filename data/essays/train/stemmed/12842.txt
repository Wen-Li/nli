do i agre or disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? is it wide known that prograss of technolog is astonish immens ? as far as i am concern , i believ that in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are now . in addit , i will argu over the case with the follow reason . first of all , i think that there will be more and more high-tech car which will be invent in the futur . for exampl , when i wa a child , my father alway put a map in the car . everi time we visit certain strang place , my mother would check the map , and point the correct direct for my father . now , almost everi car have a electr map . it will automat tell us how to arriv the place which we want to arriv . i think that the more high-tech servic car have , the more car peopl will buy . secondli , i find that there will be more and more road which will be build in the futur . there are still mani place without appropri road for car . howev , i believ that thi problem will be solv in a few year . for instanc , there are still a lot of place which chines govern doe n't develop . but i believ that chines govern will develop them as soon as possibl . the reason are not onli they want to decreas the dispar of wealth , but also they want to develp their tourism . becaus there will be more and more road will be build well , there will be more and more car which peopl will want to have . to sum up , i believ that after twenti year there will be more car than nowaday . becaus there will be mani high-tech car will be produc , and there will be more road will be construct well in the futur . in the end , i will conclud my decis by emphas that there will be more high-tech car which will dirv us to arriv more strang place in the futur .
