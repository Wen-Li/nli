what is the best way to learn ? to stay on the main idea and learn the fact or understand the idea , consept and be abl to demonstar your idea ? learn the fact is not the answer all the time . it is known from all the research and technic that ha been use to teach to student that , give the fact and tri to use thi limit fact from that given inform is never enough . is that what a student need ? a student should know whi it happen like that , how did it happen ? what wa the caus to that ? what would happen in a differ case ? they need to question these . thi is how the door to their mind should be open . school is not the place just to teach student , it is a place to let the student learn , to learn how to learn , to demonstart the idea they have and to discuss about other idea . thi is the way how peopl commun , find new idea , invent new product . thi is how we becam . i 've heard about a lot of student fail on their major work area just becaus that they have onli the fact they have been thaught . whenev there wa ani outstand problem , that limit knowledg wa not enough for them . fact were not enough for them to find the solut . it is not question the educ system , it 's about us . we need to know how to let the new gener go . improv theirselv . do better , not for us but for theirselv .
