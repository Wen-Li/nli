i trueli agre with the statement that best way to trave is in group lead by tour guid . thi is becaus of follow benefit state below . first reason is that when we visit a unfamili place we waist too much of time find the place which we want to visit becaus we are new in the place . hire a tour guid is best . a tour guid know the perfect rout and the place which we want to visit and so that we waist a lot less time and we can stay at a place for longer which we would have waist for find that place by our selv . other reason is that sometim we visit such place where laungag are differ from what we speak and so we have diffcuilti in understand the laungag of that particular area . so a tour guid who can understand both the laungag properli can help in commun with the peopl there . also the tour guid who had stay in a particular area of tourism can better explain the cultur and tradit belief more clearli than it were if we had to find it our selv and it would have been a hard job . so we can save lot of money which we would have waist if we were by ourselev on a tour . the main reason i agre with the statment is that thi thing can also help the tour guid econom . as we are all that intellig to see that tour giud are not well educ and so they do such kind of job . therefor by give some money to tour guid we can make him earn livelihood . thi can benifit their children and their famili . as we can see in thi process both , the tour guid and the group are benefit . instead of waist the money by find place our selv we can give that money to the tour guid and as a result he get hi livelihood and we save our time . so we should not be thrifti in spend money on tour guid , becaus one should see that becaus of thi anoth person is benefit . so thi are the reason i give my opinion that it is better to travel in a group led by a tour guid , becaus it ha mani benefit on both the side .
