i do not agre to the point of view that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . first and foremost i believ that when you travel in a group with a tour guid you have to make a lot of compromis and are restrict to the site that are cover by the tour guid . these site that are cover by the tour guid may not necessarili be the site that i may be interest in . also you may not be abl to spend enough time at a certain site if you desir to do so . secondli the loss of privaci and freedom when you are travel in a group would kill the enjoy of the trip . when i travel for pleasur the last thing i want to do is to stick to a schedul set out by the travel group or the tour guid . when you are travel independ you can set your own agenda and can be complet flexibl about it without affect anybodi els . thirdli in thi day and age of internet , i do not feel the need to reli on a tour guid for inform about ani place . i can get all the inform about a place that i intend to travel to , on the internet and can then make a decis on what place interest me the most and than plan out my trip accordingli . lastli there is a gener percept that group travel work out cheaper financi than if you travel independ . i do not agre with thi idea . with the avail of sever internet base travel agent it almost alway possibl to get great travel deal on travel , hotel etc ani time of the year to almost ani place in the world . for the abov reason i firmli believ that travel in a group with a tour guid is not the best way to travel to ani destin .
