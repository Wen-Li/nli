i do not agre with the statement . thi can not be said . becaus i think that everi age ha it own tast . so everyon at everi age can enjoy life . but thi is relat about be pessimist or obtimist . what is enjoy life . what is the mean of thi . thi chanc peopl to peopl . for me enjoy life mean be happi . and to fell happi there are a lot of reasson . but if u tri to be unhappi u can do thi it is veri easi . if u are young that mean your bodi let 's u do a lot of thing that u want to . becaus u have more energi . u can make sport , go out with your girlfriend , go a lot of entartain etc . .. u can do whatev u want illeg . and all of these make u happi . also young peopl have not much respons . and they feel the life endless . when u get older the tast that u get from life chanc . if u have a wife that u love , if u have good son and dougter u are the most happi person in the world . u get happi with the good thing that happen to your son or dougter . your vife 's worm hand make u happi . besid all of these if u have grandchildren and if they like u that make u happier . mayb u have not the same energi as u were young but now u have more reasson to fell happi . so we can not say youn peopl enjoy life more than older peopl and we can not say older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . everi age ha it 's own beauti . everyth is in your brain , if u teach it to enjoy life it alway enjoy life in everi age . so be honest to yourshelf whatev your age is rais your head u can see a lot of thing will make u happi ,
