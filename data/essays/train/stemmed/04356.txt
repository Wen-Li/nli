in my opinion , a good educ system should alway start with the understand of idea and concept rather than with the learn of the fact . thi is true from the veri begin of your educ to the end of your academ life . when you start your studi at the primari school you are just a child , often unabl to link the fact the teacher is tri to teach you , in a more complex grid . the substructur of thi grid are idea and concept . although it might appear easier to learn fact befor understad the idea lie behind them , thi way of teach alway lead to a lack of background structur and , therefor , to a lack of understand : children will learn fact by heart , yet they will be unabl to collect them into a coher structur , henc fail their test . while a way of teach focus on the understand of idea and concept is the best choic for primari educ , it can be realli use even in secondari and tertiari educ . for exampl , if you studi philosophi at the univers , you will be thought noth but idea and concept : is , therefor , studi philosophi onli a wast of time ? i definit do not think so . if you think about how mani former student of philosophi you can find work in veri differ field , you will eventu agre with me . whi those former student , who never receiv an educ base on fact , are so success in the work life ? thi is becaus they have a fulli develop grid of idea and concept that alway help them understand quickli what kind of task they are ask for , even if it ha noth to do with socrat , plato or kant . to sum up , an educ base on the understand of idea and concept is a better choic in order to develop a grid of thought that enabl you to vari between mani differ disciplin .
