i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i think success person is one who had done mani riski think in hi life time that whi we call him as an success person , we dont achiv great thing if we ar n't take risk . for exampl if we consid madum curi she wa on of the great women scientest 's , she discov radium element , it is one of the natur element which emmit radiat , at the time of reasearch she knew that radiat from the radium could caus a veri seviour dammag to her bodi , even though she knew it she ha taken the risk , which led to the find of radium , radium is use to gener electr , and is also use to cure the some of cancer deasess , at the time of her experi is she doe want to take risk of her life now we probabuli may not know radium and there may not be cure of some of the cancer deasess . anoth exampl is wright broter who were the invent of the aeroplan , they ar n't invent aeroplan but they have invent the blue print of aeroplan and they have show proof that human can also fli like a bird , from their imagin and their inspir let into the invent of aeroplan . if they think that it is risk in do experi in fli , it is differ from the way we see the world now . with thi invent it make us easi to travel place to place and thier risk factor chang our way off see the world so with these specif reason and exampl i think that there is no other way of get success by tri new thing and take risk .
