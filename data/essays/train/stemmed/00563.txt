i total agre with thi statement . there are lot of advertis in the world . all the advertis about their good contain the great exagger about their good . in my experi , i wa young and i wa in korea , i watch the advertis about new robot toy . at that time on the tv , it show the fli robot that i can control it and make it fli . i wa realli surpris about fli thing becaus i wa young . so i bought it at my birhday and tri to make it fli . it did n't fli . it wa realli big shock for me and i could not believ ani advertis from that time . in our life , we can see mani case like mine . in addit , i saw a advertis about new restaur , it say that if we come at birthday , it is free and there are alot of benefici thing for birthday peopl . so i went to that restaur with my friend on my birthday , i expect that free food and mani thing . but i could n't get ani servic or benefici thing . they said , it wa onli one week event so i check the advertis paper , it did n't mention about one week event . i wa realli angri but i could n't leav that restaur . in my opinion , we can not stop them . becaus it is one of the good way to make peopl come to their restaur . but we can think ourselv that we know it is fake . so do not expect that much , we have to get readi for a shock . when we just do n't believ the advertis , we can have some benefit luckili , and it make us happi . so my conclus is , we know it is not realli true but we can just go and have fun there .
