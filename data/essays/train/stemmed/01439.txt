it 's a difficult question , but i disagre the idea of travel in a group led by a tour guid . there are two reason that i disagre with thi idea . first reason is about money . if i go to england by the packag tour , i would have to pay a lot of money . mayb i will need pay 200,000 yen at least in case of stay london in three day . someon think that pay a lot of money for trip is nutur , becaus we buy the safti at the same time . howev , i 'm a student now and i ca n't earn a lot of money , so i will go on a trip by myself . in feburari , i went to england with my friend . i bought bord pass by myself and l also book the hotel by internet by my self . it 's easi for me to make a contract . second reason is about the time . if i go on a trip led by a tour guid , i would be abl to go to some famou place of sightse . howev , i must keep the time . i heard that there is n't enough time to enjoy look at the famou place . it mean that i have to hurri to do someth , but i do n't need to hurri if i go on a trip by myself . i can enjoy look the tourist attract , look around the shop , eat someth until my stomach fill . for these reason , i disagre with the idea of travel with a lot of pepl led by tour guid .
