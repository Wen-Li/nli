what is more import for the student ? understand idea and concept or learn fact ? so , which of these statment do toy agre with ? in my opinion , i think it better for the student to understand idea and concept more than learn fact , becaus when the student understand idea and concept thi will help him or her to understand and learn fact clearli and better , for exampl , the earth goe around the sun and around it self , thi is a fact , but the student should know what happen when the earth goe around the sun and around it self , so he should understand that when son goe around the som that will make the 4 seson , and when the earth goe around it self thi will make the day and the night . and i think if the student should just learn the fact , the student will stop studi and learn when he or she know all the fact , becaus we all know that the fact are countabl . understand idea and concept is the way to find a fact , ( or new fact ) for exampl , there is a physic rule sad , to the car fast for exampl you should divid the distanc that the car finish on the time that it took it to finish thi distanc , fast = distanc / time , so thi rule is a fact , and we could not find thi fact unless we would have understod the idea the concept of thi rule , so i think it veri import to learn fact , but it is more import to understand idea and concept to make everyth clearli for the student .
