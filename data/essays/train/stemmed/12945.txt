in my openin , it is better for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . when student learn how to use the idea and the concept to anylis and make their own dicus that will enabl them to be more reactiv . learn some fact and momriz some inform are not the ideal way to learn student how to use thier won ablitiy . student howm use their own idea that they conclud by their own accadim or even in elementri school are more like to learn more and faster than student howm just repeat some fact . they more like to learn in differ area and feild and to be in connect with the latest devlop . mayb they will invent a new sebject or improv the field of studi they lean about . als they could use they fact that areadi have found to increas modifi them . on the other hand , student how depend complet in the fact without even understand what they mean will not think about ani hting which doe n't follow the rule that they learn . sometim the rule are not correct , but they onli do what they learn . they use to follow the fact , and they will not be abl to think logicali . therefor , we can see that understand the idea and the concept is more use than repeat just the fact .
