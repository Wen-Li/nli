it 's veri hard to gener who enjoy life more , either young peopl or older peopl . thi usuali vari accord to each individu 's person and life stori . howev , there are a few idea and observ that make me assum that older peopl tend to enjoy life more . young peopl have more energi to live and constantli experi more thing . howev , they may get caught up on the veloc of our modern world and not fulli enjoy the everyday of their live . they have a thirst for someth differ all the time . thi insati crave can distract them from savor each moment as somethig valuabl and enjoy . mani time , young peopl confront difficult situat in which it appear that life is face it limit . the bad situat seem graver and can affect the younger mind , not be abl to see the long term perspect that an older mind can more like visual . on the other hand , older peopl live a life with a slower rithm , a life in which they can look back to what they have accomplish and enjoy where they stand today . individu of greater age have more memori , and have experienc more situat , that can put them at eas with their expect and make them enjoy the littl thing more than younger peopl . unlik young peopl , the elder usual have creat famili , that constantli bring joy to their live . the satisfact of share the everyday moment with the poepl one love , is someth that come with age , when one ha had the time to valu hi belov one . even though one tend to think that young peopl are alway more enthustiast toward life and generali more satisfi , in my experi , it is those who have live longer that possess the key and secret behind true happi .
