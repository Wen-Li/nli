it will be better to have a knowledg of mani academ subject becaus after you have all those academ subject in your brain cell you wo n't be have to worri ani problem with class work . for my first point of view will be that if we have all those knoledg in the brain we can be much more clever and we wo n't have to ask the classmat about the problem that we have . we can solv it ourself . it will be better to do it yourself than ask the other becaus it will be quit embarras . you will have to look at other face just to wait for their answer and i 'll prefer not to do that . nextli will be to get a better grade becaus we have mani academ subject in our head normatt how mani subject in a day we will be abl to know must of the need in the topic . and than at the end of the year or tearm when the grade come out you will be proud of your ownself . some more student will come to you and ask you the question that their do n't understand so you can be their teacher to teach them what ever thing their need and they will look up on you my last point will be the teacher , sometim you can find the teacher struggl on some question and you can prom them by tell them some clue so they will know what to do after all . you might be abl to be their top student as will . so whenev they need help with their work you can teach them . they might give you a better effect and grade . my conclus is that we sure better to have a board knowledg and mani academ subject in the brain than have blank in the head when you are do some kind of test .
