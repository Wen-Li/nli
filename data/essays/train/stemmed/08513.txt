thi statement is true and fals . first of all , when there is a lot of peopl travel togueth it may be better to travel with a tour guid , becaus is difficult for mani peppl travel togueth to maintain an order , and they can get lost , or they may disagre of certain place to go . travel with a group can result in mani problem and a lot of difficulti dure the travel , so the best way to manag that is by have a tour guid . i think in my person opinion that the best way is to travel alon . the person travel alon can collect inform from internet , magazin or book , and go to that strang countri by her | himself , and do the best he | she can to visit the best and most wonderful place in that countri and experi for her | himself . it true that the tour guid is more experienc in visit the place you dont know , but peopl learn better when they have to figur out thing by themself . for exampl , when you go to a museum , befor you go , if you are alon , you need to investig about it , and learn about it and thing of that natur , so you can confirm that thi museum is a good place for you to visit . in the contrari , when someon is in a group led by a tour guid , there are a lot of distract , becaus of the quantiti of peopl in the group , and is more difficult to pay attent or to look at pictur for exampl in a museum , when there is a lot of peopl follow a tour guid . anoth import thing is that when you are in a group led by a tour guid , you have to follow that group where they go , instead of go where you wish to go , and where your feel take you . for me be in a vacat is do whatev you want and whenev you want to do it , so be with a tour guid is like be in a school trip , and you cant do what you wish to do . tour guid are perfect for school trip or thing of that natur , becaus kid need to follow someon .
