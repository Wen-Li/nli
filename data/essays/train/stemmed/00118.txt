in my opinion peopl alway should tri new thing and take risk to improv themselv . if peopl stop themselv in front of the difficulti , they never improv . to becom success peopl , we do n't must do onli what we can do but , first of all in difficult situat , we must take risk even if they should be wrong at the end . if we do n't catch risk we never obtein import result in everi camp , for exampl for exampl if i want becom a veri import manag , in the world of work , i will have to take a lot of risk that regard my decis . thi mean that peopl that have import ambit ca n't limit themselv in which they alreadi know but they must search to improv themselv . at the end i want say that don ` t exist ani person that becam import limit himself , but to becom success peopl need courag and to take difficult chois to improv more and more .
