thi is a hard question , becaus succ mean not the same thing for all the peopl , and also becaus both way can take you to succ . in my case , i am a tenni player . for me succ would be to becom a profession player . for thi to achiev there are no secret formula , there are no new thing to tri , noth like that , but do what must be done , and what ha been done sinc the earli year of thi sport , work for it . also when play tenni there is someth you alway have to have in mind `` if it is work and give you result do not chang or tri someth new '' , so succes tenni player do not take great risk , nor tri new thing , they just do what they know they do best , and stick to it if it is work . so thi make me think thing should work like thi in everi other subject , if someth is give you succ , whi chang it ? mayb if you are just in search of that `` success '' in other subject rather than sport you should tri new thing , for exampl in pizza , we have domino , pizza hut , peter piper pizza , etc . .. so mayb think in subject like thi it is hard get success follow the same step other did long ago , beacus of all the competit , mayb it would be easier think of a not so compit subject , so mayb here it is when you will have to tri new thing , explor new market etc . . but if you find success with someth do n't tri to chang it , as long as it is give you what you look for keep do the same , or if you someth well , no matter there is a lot of competit , keep do it , becaus if you realli do your thing well , peopl will notic about it and result will arriv sooner or later .
