the statement is that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i agre with thi abov statement that is `` more import the idea and the concept to a student '' . becaus if we have some imagin then we will imagin and we will tri to reach that imagin . if we doe n't have ani imagin then there is no way to reach some purticular state . so the imagin is the import thing for the student becaus use with the alredi develop thing they will tri to do new thing . like that they can know each and everi point where they face the problem and some achiev in there experi . so the concept also take main role in the student life . if they have good knowledg in the concept then onli he will learn someth new otherwis he will not get good knowledg . if the student want gain more knowledg then it better to learn understand the idea of that field and understand the concept of that perticul field . if the student have good basic then they can easili analys the new thing veri easili . and the student can capabl to invent new thing . if everi student start with some basic and concept then it is easi to learn and with thi student experi they tri to di cover some more new thing in the futur . the the next gener also tri to learn the basic and the idea from the elder or teacher . and they will implement furtherli . if the student learn fact then they will not sharpen their mind as well as they dont tri to analys that whi that fact is made . so thi is the main disadvatag to a student to learn someth new .
