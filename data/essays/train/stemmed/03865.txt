all of us go to a market to make our daili shop , choos what we will buy among thousand of product . how do we decid what to buy ? first of all , everyday a new product appear in market , wait for custom . the first problem in thi process is how a custom would know that a new item is produc . if the custom doe not see ani advertis , either on magazin , billboard or tv , the hi chanc of buy thi product is veri low . advert's are the basic and most crucial way for a produc to reach a potenti custom . but is just a good advertis enough to sell a product ? especi in recent year , advertis is the most import tool use to make a product sell more . nearli all peopl who like the advertis of an item or servic decid to tri it at onc . thi is the border an advertis can reach . nobodi continu to brush hi teeth with an bitter toothpast becaus he like the advertis of that one . for further sale , the product must be not just be good enough but also fit to need of the person who bought . everyday we complain about the item we use , think about how better they would be . it is imposs to design an item that would fit need of everybodi in a societi . none of the textil produc can make an cloth which fit bodi in all size . like a textil product , it is not possibl to make an advertis which everybodi like . it will most like caus some new buyer to appear as well as make some alreadi buyer to stop buy . to sum up , an advertis onli help in the introduct part . we can not disregard the increas import of advertis , but a good advertis can not guarante the continu sale of a disaster product .
