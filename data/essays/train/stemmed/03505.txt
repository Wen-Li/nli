i am a busi guy . so i take risk . in my opinion , everybodi ha to take risk in their life . but risk is risk . so you can not make sure if you take it , it is go to be good for you or not . no bodi can know that . i can give an exampl about my uncl who wa one of famuou import in my countri , which is turkey . as i said , he wa a big import and he wa bring fruit from other countri such as , usa , peru , chili etc . he had been in that job for about 10 year befor he decid to chang hi good what he wa bring . actual he did n't chang basicli . but he start to bring more tropyc fruit such as ; pineappl , kiwi etc. rather then the other . . but he had not thought that if you want to chang someth in compani you have to think all chang . for exampl of hi compani is that compani had to buy new vehicl for carriy fruit . becaus those new fruit more senset then he use to bring . it is a big problem for compani caus of these vehicl are expens . besid that , they did not have ani experi about new fruit . they did not know how do they have to do keep them or how long they can keep . some more problem and then everyth wa go bad . i am not tell do not take risk . if i wa he , i would do that as he did . but if we want to do thing , we should think about everyth . i love thi phare '' the onli thing not chang is chang '' . so we need to chang someth and while we chang , we have to take risk , whatev i am in futur i will alway take risk . becaus i believ in that take risk is the most import thing in life .
