definit to travel with a group led by a tour guid is not one of the best option that can be taken . thi is base on a bad experi that i have had with thi type of travel . the disadvantag that the peopl ha if they choos the group travel are : - schedul need to be follow , what thi mean that if you are in a great citi like chicago and in the first day of the visit you found that what you most enjoy is the michigan lake , and on the second day on chicago you will want to repeat the visit to the lake you definitetli can not do it , due the fact that the tour bu ha a schedul and a rout that need to be follow and the second day vist on chicago are the museum . - other disadvantag is that sometim when you travel with a guid it is kind of tire due that the whole day you are walk . - next point is sometim you do not like the way the guid doe the speach or the explan of the visit locat . - it is veri import most of the time to know the group that you are travel with . thi is beacaus sometim there are picki person that are too loud and it is someth that you can not be deal with , special if the tour durat is like about a month . after all the disadvantag menion abov , it is veri import for peopl to do some research befor book a group tour led by a tour guid , where you can find peopl that will be take the tour , the guid that will be given explan , the schedul due that most of the time are veri thight and bore that do not even worth it . summar the best way to travel is either alon or with a group of peopl that you alreadi know . thi give you a lot of advantag to realli spend the time dure your visit on activ that you will enjoy .
