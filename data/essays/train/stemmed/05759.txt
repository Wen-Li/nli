i person do n't agre that we have fewer car in use than tuday in twenti year . my reason are as follow . first , i can stete about popul in futur , especi in develop countri . the popul have grow up greatli and their standard of live have been becom higher littl by littl . furthermor , most of them strongli want to get their own car . actual when last month i visit east africa , kenya and uganda thi summer , i wa so surpris that more and more peopl becom to have car and even if they ca n't buy now they strongli want their car . how can they resist their hope of car to do their busi and enjoy drive and travel otherwis their car proveid ? second , price of car will decreas more and more becaus mani compani have been provid a larg number of car and we have mani use car and export them from develop countri to develop countri . so peopl will abl to buy a new and use car more easili . therefor , as i mention abov , i difinitedli think that we will have more car in twenti year as near futur .
