i disagre whit the concept that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . i think that young peopl have a differ way to live , to consid their own life than older peopl , but thi way not necessarli is better . thi depend particularli by the respons of a person , the mind , and so by the style of life . gener young peopl , boy or girl , live in a particular way , do differ action , have differ interest , so live in movement without long moment of paus . for exampl , i wake up the morn and i go to univers where i studi , in the afternoon i use my free time read , listen music , visit new place , and visit art galleri . while in the even i go with my friend to theater , cinema , pub , or concert . the old peopl , instead , live in a differ way , becaus they pass their free time at home , in fact they don-t work , watch for exampl televis , so they use their time in a slow way . for exampl i have a grand mother who stay at home dure the day , she meet her friend at home and watch televis in the even . in conclus young peopl don-t enjoy life more than older peopl , but boy and girl have other way to live .
