although some peopl prefer to travel in a group becaus of the easi and safeti , i would like to travel by myself or with a onli few friend . traver individu is flexibl and econom . in the begin , i did travel with a group led by a tour guid , becaus i did not know how to make a plan for a trip , and also i did not speak english enough to travel abroad . in that case , it had better travel in a group and have a tour guid . how ever , i found myself frustrat about wait the other peopl to get readi to leav the place we visit and not have ani extra time to spend more time at my favorit place . on the other hand , if i am travel by myself , there is no such a problem . i can stay in bed late , or wake up earli morn and enjoy the sunris . therefor , i can more enjoy the trip without . traver with a group is usual more costli than travel individu . the tour group usual rent a larger van or bu and reserv the higher grade hotel and restaur to fullfil the satisfact of all the guest . thi may not be need for some peopl . if i am travel by myself , i have time to select hotel and restaur accord my budget . instead i can spend more money to visit other place or from what i have state abov , travel individu allow peopl to easili chang and adjust the travel plan instantli as they desir . moreov , the cost of travel is less than that of travel in a group . the person travel is the best way and more enjoy .
