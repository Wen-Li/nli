`` seiz the day '' use to say the epicurist , who els but young peopl would appli thi moral point of view ? inde i think that young peopl do better know how to enjoy life than older peopl . there are sever reason for thi belief . first of all i must acknowledeg than the older peopl do , in one way , enjoy life for the simpl reaon that their life is come to it end . but , given that , i think that the young peopl live their life more intens than their father or grand father do . whi do i say that ? becaus teenag , and the young adult are eager to live their life , not onli to live it in a normal way but to feel they are aliv . they want to feel the life flowd in their vein . thu they do crazi thing think that they may be unabl to do it afterward . for instanc young peopl are veri fast driver , veri heavi drinker , and veri good at parti all night long . moereov , they do n't onli live more intensev `` normal life '' but they are also look for crazi thing to do like jump from an aircraft or jump with an elast from veri high spot . i do n't think that an eighty-years-old-grand mother would do that . thu for two reason . one is that she will be physic too old , an other one is that she will be mental too old . at her age pleasur of life doe not remain in riski thing to do . she is just look for some quiet stuff to make . but is she still enjoy life ? she is certainli enjoy the end of it when young peopl are enjoy the dawn of it . that is the other main reason whi young peopl are not onli enjoy life but live it . it 's becaus all opportun are wide open to them . a young mind is full of project wherea an old one is full of memori . one is live thing for real , an other is live them in fiction . all in all it appear that the young seiz the day when the older look at it . but we ca n't deni them ani pleasur for that . they are just say `` carp diem '' in a more peac way .
