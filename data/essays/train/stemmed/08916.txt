i agre with the follow statement that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more better than have special in one specif subject . i am a japanes high school student . i am stude variou subject in my school . it is too hard for me to understand all of these , but stude a lot of subject is veri interest and i can feel happi when i understand the someth new . so , i stronglli feel we should studi and get broad knowledg from mani academ subject . then i would like to explain more detail . these day , there are mani enviroment problem around the world . for exampl , grobal warm , water pollut , air pollut , mani rain forest are destolo , and rubbish problem . i think these problem are not solv with a singl subject knowledg , so scientist in the world should share their opinion and result of studi with other field of masser 's scientist to solv these problem more better . if we have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , we could think about mani thing , and we could get abil someth new .
