i agre with the statement , that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . industri onli want to sell their product . especi in tv advertis the market director of a compani onli want to show , how posit the product is and that everybodi need it at home . first of all , compani want to sell . they want to earn money . that is whi they exist . what peopl realli need is not nescessari for them . they onli want custum to buy their own product . the second point is , that tv ad onli show how posit a product is . neg thing , like high rate prize are often not in the advertis . compani onlzx show how positiv a product is . thez also sell dream . for exampl : ten nake girl run on a beach on a boy , who look ugli and ha the product in hi hand . today that is a normal tv spot . with the product of thi specif compani the ugli guy will get one of the girl for a date . the advertis will tell me that , but that is just not the truth . compani want to sell dream , which have noth to do with the truth . market director of compani also want the custom to tell , that there is a product what they realli need at home and for themselv . everth in advertis is posit . face by thi fact , it show that the product in tv spot should be better than they are in realiti . the realiti do not exist in advertis . that is a fact . all that reason are import for me , whi i agre with the statement , that advertis make prduct seem much better than they realli are . somebodi who disagre ha no idea about compani and their trick to sell the highest number of product , which are possibl .
