i do n't support the idea that is better to have broad knowledg than to special in a specif subject . therefor i think that bee profession mean that a person ha to acquir mani theoric concept at the begin of hi carrier , but he ha to grow hi specif skill in hi major dure the job- life . dure my life i found mani reason that bring me on thi idea . first of all , a person who choos hi specif subject can be focus on hi person goal . infact , when someon doe n't care about noth in particular , he is usual to find a job just to earn money and take more time to think about hi interset . the time is veri preciou for person knowledg and for the life in gener . second , be focus in a specif knowledg 's area doe n't enhanc more problem , otherwis more altern . i realli believ that there are mani aspect in everi subject and everyday we have to make your best choic . for instanc , when a student is improv hi skill on mani matter it is more possibl that he will fail in one of those , than oneth guy who is learn about onli one subject . flexibl is n't a synonim of the dispers of person idea . person , when i graduat two year ago i chose where i would like to work , in which sector and what will be my goal . i realli appreci the advic of my parent whose suggest me to find a gener job to be abl to chang it in the futur . anyway , i prefer to be focus on my major . now i am gratifyi by my decis and i will suggest the same to my friend that are still studi . for those reason i discourag everyon to have broad knowledg .
