i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my point of view , i think all compani doe . i think a lot of peopl could agre with thi statement if they have their own experi of it . actual , the main goal of advertis are make huge profit by sell the product . to do thi , they should make good imag on the product , and the product should appear to a lot of peopl . if it look not good in the advertis , peopl will not buy it . so , thi skill is veri import to sell the product to the consum . sometim , peopl buy someth without ani inform . i think thi is becaus the advertis alreadi bulit their nice imag on peopl 's mind . i have my own experien to support thi . when i wa in my countri korea , i saw an advertis of mini radio from famou compani . it look realli cool and use to me , so i want to buy that mini radio . it wa brand new and it wa much smaller than mine . i alway want to have small radio that i can bring everywher . i order that mini radio after i watch the advertis on televison , and when i reciev that i wa surpris . it wa not that small . it wa just ` littl ' smaller than regular radio , howev in the advertis that i saw , it look so small such as my littl mp3 player . i disappoint a lot and i gave that to my older brother . after that mistak , i never order the peoduct just by advertis . actual , it wa not ` mini ' radio . howev , thi could be requir for the compani becaus they need to make money . i can understand their view , howev sometim it make peopl disappoint about the product . in conclus , most advertis make their peoduct look better than they realli are . so , when we buy someth , we should consid about it befor make decis .
