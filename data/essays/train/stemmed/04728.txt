i agre with thi statement which say `` must advertis make product seem better than realli are . '' for exampl when i are go to a sopermarct store i usulli look at a known brid . it seem better but when i start to use it i realliz that the old one is much better . here in the usa everi day you can see a new advertis . like `` gigou '' the enshor compani . i have an experinc with thi compani in my last accid . i told them i want to get cash instad of fix me my car but they rifus . than after tow month the took about same stution in thier ad . i did n't keep my mouth shout . when i have return they told me no we ca n't give the money to you . frome that time i hate to see ad in tv . second reason i thik it 's the ad job to make product seem better so the consum chang hi idea and use thi product . after that they made more and more money . that explan whi i gree with that statment .
