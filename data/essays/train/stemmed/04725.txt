i disagre with statement : `` in twenti yer there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , becaus i do not think that our societi could live with less car , even if i would be total pleas if it happen . i disagre with thi statment , first of all becaus i can see , in everi day life , that the number of the car is increas . for exampl , when my mother wa young her famili wa compos from four person and they had just one car , but they were complet normal , now , in my famili we are just three and we have two car , and we would like to buy anoth car . anoth import fact is that industri are alway tri to make new car with new thecnology insid , to emit less pollut . in thi way , it would not be a problem if ther will be more car . in addict , car have becom foundament in our cultur both in big and littl city , and in particoular for whose who live far from the citi . everyon nowaday who ha an emerg need to have the car , to go to the supermarket , but also to the hospit etc . there could be differ solut , instead of use car , even if it is not easi to make peopl understand it . in particoular in big citi peopl should use public transport wich do not creat ani pollut , and they are quick and confort . in smaller citi , where there is not the possibl of use publ transport , peopl should use the bike or walk , when it is possibl , wich are better both for the pollut of the enviro and the health of the peopl . in conclus , unfortun i do not think that in futur there will be fewer car in use than today . howev there are sever solut to the problem given by the car than can be adopt .
