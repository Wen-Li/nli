in my opinion , travel in group with a tour guid is not a good way of travel . duo to you have to schedul your time at the time that tour guid told you . and if you want to do other activ you just cant , becaus you have to go to the specif part that were assign for you sinc you choos to travel with a tour guid . in one hand , you cant go to visit place that you are more interest to go , in first place becaus you are travel with a group of peopl and have to be toghet all the time . therefor you can not live them and go to someher els . sometim , it happen that you are look someth good for you in a store while you are walk round there , and you realli want to buy it , but the problem is that you will not make ani stop there with your travel group , so you have to leav , becaus the tour guid have rush on time , and he is hur you , so you dont have the chanc even to go through the store and see if the stuff isnt good for you . as far as i am concern , if you go on a travel with a group and led you by a tour guid , you alway go up on the travel bu , and all that you can see is through the window , and sometim you even cant see anyth , becaus the bu go fast . on the other hand , you cant realli know the real place you are visit for , becaus in my opinion the best way of visit a citi is go by your own or with a group of friend that they likli to go with you and agre to the think you wanna do dure the trip . in conclus , it is possibl that you can travel with a tour guid , but onli if you are not interest in the citi your are visit , or if you are in a hurri and you just want to see the most relev place you are interest .
