a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is sure use and to a certain point also necessari . howev , i do not think it is better than a special to a certain field . i think a mixtur of both point is the best way . in other word , a trade-off between broad and special knowledg is necessari nowaday . the basi of a broad knowledg is alreadi made in school . all the children becom the same educt and have to pass the same test . by do so , the student are prepar for differ futur scenario in life and they also becom an overal pictur about the world . for exampl , the student at school do not onli learn math and languag , but also biolog , chemistri , histroy etc . . thu they get a good understand about the relat in their environ . consequ , a broad knowledg is veri import and also necessari . on the other hand , the inform input increas with the age . henc , after a certain stage in life a human be is not abl to gain all avail inform . addit , each job requir special knowledg . consequ , a person ha to choos which inform is more import and use for hi futur life . for exampl , after school a student ha to decid what he want to do with hi life and he ha to answer sever question . what kind of job i want to do ? what are my main interest ? to sum up , i think that it is import to have both , broad and special knowledg . the broad one to get a overal pictur of the world and to understand it import relat . the special knowledg is necessari and not less import .
