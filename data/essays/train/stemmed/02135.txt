life is a wonder gift of god . thi should be enjoy till one ha it last breath . i feel that it is in the younger age you can enjoy life the most . there are three main reason for thi . first factor for enjoy is health . onli healthi person can enjoy hi life by indulg in variou kind of activ like go to diffrent place for vacat , thrile activ like bung jump , sky glide and so on . i am sure such activ though enjoy are not possibl for the older peopl . it is a fruit onli to be tast at younger age . second thing is that when a person is young he dosent have to mani respons like earn bread and butter for the famili or to support some one in the famili all he is suppos to do is attend colleg get good grade and have fun . dure thi period of one life one can enjoy the life to the most . person in old age ha respons and hi prioriti to enjoy had chang he rather enjoy in support famili . last but not the least to have fun one requir money . everyon agre that dure younger age when you are in colleg or have just complet the colleg to start a new job earn to expenditur ratio is quit high . one can easili spent on one self to go on vacat and thrill support without have much difficulti . in conclus i can say that god ha given thi presiou gift to enjoy . futur is veri uncertain and unpridict what ever is there is present . one who can not live hi present happili can not expect that happi will come to him at dawn of hi life .
