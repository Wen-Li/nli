i agre that it is more import for student to understnad idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are some reason that student should learn and understand idea and concept befor the learn fact and that they need to have solid mental background as base . first , learn fact without understand idea and concept is same as make a sand castl . for exampl , if they use a machin or instument for ani reason without know the mechan or concept , they can copi some work but they ca n't make creativ work . or when they encount some problem , they ca n't solv anyth and have to depend on other peopl who know the mechan . second , they wo n't be creativ . they do n't need to start from scratch for everyth . howev , onc they know some concept , they can manupl and appli mani thing as they want and develop the current stage of work or improv to make it product . the third reason is a make a good habit when they learn idea and concept . peopl who like to learn fact usual are lazi or superfici . onc peopl learn fact first , they do n't want to learn idea or concept becaus learn basic need a lot of time and effort until they get the final product . they do n't want to spend their time and energi for learn invis thing . they want just product without effort . student mean who are learn new thing and develop their abil for their futur or for societi they are belong to . therefor , i think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , especi when they are young .
