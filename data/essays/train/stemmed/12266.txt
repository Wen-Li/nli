the way that the young and the old live their live are total differ nowaday in china . and what i agre is young peopl do enjoy life mor than older peopl do . mayb the most import reason is that young peopl spend more money . almost everi young student have some technolog instrument , such as cd player , digit camera , mobil phone , mp3 player , or even mp4 player . but that 's not so popular in adult . they may onli have a veri old type mobil phone . the comput in everyhom have almost becom toy for the children , the onli function is to play game . compar to my classmat , i 'm a save boy , but compar to my parent , i 'm wast . onc , when i wa have lunch at a out-door restraunt near my schol , mani adult pass me by . what they do is just leav , becaus they think it wa too expens . anoth unforgett reason may be the differ style of educ we get . our parent were told to save when they were at school . save , save , save . all they knew wa to save , and they realli met some problem , which `` save '' realli help them . but what i learn is `` enjoy your life ! '' , so i do . i enjoy my life so much that what i have enjoy mayb more than my parent . also , love is a factor , mayb someon will ignor . adult have mani peopl for them to love . their husband or wive , children , parent . but for we , we onli love ourselv . we have n't got so mani peopl to love , and we are still do n't know how to love , and who to love . so the older want the peopl they love to enjoy their live , not themselv , which is complet differ from us . last , there are some kind of joy that the elder ca n't enjoy , such as some physic sport , such as footbal , basketbal and some danger stuff . so , in my point of view , the youth enjoy live more than their elder do .
