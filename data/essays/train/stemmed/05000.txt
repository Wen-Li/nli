success repres a kind of obsess for mani peopl , someth that everybodi aim in his/her life . and i am one of them too . if we look in a dictionari , we wo n't find an exhaust explan of what thi word realli mean , for instanc success is a veri person concept that can gener be relat to the achiev of someth , no matter what it is . but onc that you success in do or obtain someth , there is for sure someth more you want or you tend to . that 's whi success peopl alway look for new challeng . i guess that success can be defin as a kind of adrenalin , a drug , in fact the more success you are , the more you want to becom . for exampl as i wa an outstand athlet in the practic of judo , i becam part of the italian nation team , and even if i should have been satisfi by thi sport achiev , i want more . therefor i began to practis mani other sport in order to be fit and to demonstr myself that i wa polival . but what i have to admitt is that i wa terribl attract by riski activ such as climb and free-styl ski , and that 's what i eventu did . i think that thi attitud of success peopl could be compar to mountain trek , for instanc when you reach a peak in the alp , you are veri satisfi , but then you start think about the rocki mountain , and then to the and and then your onli desir becom to watch the earth from the everest . in the end i support the idea that success peopl are consid by societi success becaus they never give up in their ambit and in their strong will to discov or to achiev in someth . that 's mayb whi christoph columbu discov america , whi we drive car , whi we use mobil and whi it said to be that armstrong wa the first man who did the famou first step on the moon .
