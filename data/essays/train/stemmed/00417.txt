i will agre to the statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . if we learn idea and understand concept then we can question those idea which would lead to new way of think and lead to discov new thing . if we learn fact then there is noth much to chang either you know the answer or you do not , but if you new the concept that lead to the fact then the student would use that concept to arriv at the answer . for exampl if the student want to know the circumfer of a pentagon then if the student onli learn fact the he may have forgotten the equat , but if a student knew that circumfer of ani object wa the total length of the side then he can add the length of each side and get the answer . the import of educ is not in know the capit of all countri nor in learn the entir scienc book by heart but to use , what the student ha learn in the school , in hi everi day life , to better hi life , to use it when face with a challeng and come out win . learn fact may help you sometim in your life but complet understand the subject will alway help you . there are six basic question to everyth - when ? where ? whi ? how ? what ? which ? if you knew the answer to onli one question then the educ would be incomplet , onli by understand the entir concept will the student know all the answer and the exact mean of a subject . lastli on a broader note , for a societi to evolv and progress in cultur and educ we need new idea , new concept becaus if we do not develop new idea we would still believ that earth wa flat and wa the center of the univers , thi way of think would have had a detriment effect on human as a whole and we would still be live like anim .
