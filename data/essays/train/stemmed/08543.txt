i would rather think than travel in group and led by a tour guid is the best way to miss what can be thrill in discov new countri or place around the world . the reason for which peopl choos to travel thi way hide what they usual feel as a great delus at the end of their trip . experi of travel ha to go through such kind of delus to discov it true ident . first , one of the favorit reason for peopl to prefer a guid is that they are afraid to `` miss '' anyth . thing ( museum , build , an so on ) `` have to '' be seen . such a way of think assum that thing which are vital need to be known from the largest part of peopl . but what one ca n't miss is what chanc help him to discov . sreet or build we love in peculiar citi reflect our personn relationship to these citi and that is more import than to rememb vagu build as if we onli saw them in guid book . what i do n't want to miss when i travel is the progress link that i build with part of a citi wether they are in guid book or not . that ca n't be planifi . also , peopl feel more secur when they travel in group or when they follow an experi guid . although thi can be a strong reason in some part of the world , i personnallli appreci when a trip contain a bit of danger becaus danger is a signific part of the pleasur to travel . when one want to reduc danger to a minimum , excit disappear at the same time . not to be the master of a situat is one the major reason to travel and thi goe from the foreign languag to real danger . last , to travel in group is often consid as more interest becaus of the possibl to share an experi with other peopl and becaus of the divers of point of view . but is n't it anoth way to miss the onli truli signific differ point of view , that is the point of view of peopl from anoth countri ? i prefer to travel alon becaus it oblig me to meet peopl instead of stay insid of a familiar cultur environ . onc one 's in a group , one ca n't escap the group .
