be abl to speak about everyth , even just a littl , is a veri attract idea . howev , i disagre with the statement besid . in my opinion , if on one hand peopl know the main issu of mani major topic can be use , on the other hand we still need veri qualifi peopl in veri specif field . particularli in polit , it is use to have elect peopl who are abl to take into account and to pay attent to a larg panel of issu . their role will be to look at the pro and the con and to decid . someon who is work hard on a topic might becom unabl to keep a clear sight of the whole situat . he or she might be like to support hi or her point . i think that it is the same at a smaller level . in a firm or in an associ for instanc , a person with a larg knowledg is import to drive the whole structur toward the right way tri to defin consist decis . howev , we still need special employe and manag . consequ , student who want to get a veri specif train are veri use as well . these peopl are the base of mani domain of our societi becaus they are abl to give veri precis specif . when a manag or a director ha to take a decis , he or she will ask advic to expert . if nobodi wa abl to bring detail answer , we zould live in a veri syuperfici world . in conclus , i think that both are veri use
