young peopl now day have better thing in mind than to think of their commun . some teenag tri to respect their commun by follow their rule and help out while some other dont even care what go on . but we ca n't realli say that all young peopl are the same and that they think exacti the same . that 's like say that everi singl adult is the same and that is certainli not true . sometim it realli depend by in what commun young peopl are surround in . their interest 's would most like chang by the commun . for exampl if it is help out in the school commun , young peopl would most like be more interset to get involv into it becaus it is someth that they have to learn for futur . becaus it involv them and their futur life , they show more interest . rather than if it is about the commun that they live in , they woulnd't realli care , unless the peopl in the commun are veri close and the teenag are massivli pull into it . now day so mani other thing are happen in the world that involv young peopl all around they either have no time to even help out in the commun or they are not will to and think it 's a wast of time . there is so much to do for them now school whise and social that they do n't even realiz what 's go on in the commun around them . but that again depend by how big or how involv they are in a commun . technolog ha chang so much in the live 's of young peopl that they either hardli have the time or interest to chang or help the commun that they are surround in . at the end it realli depend by the interest of the young peopl to help in the commun . they can chang a lot in a commun and some of them know that . not everi young person think the same . some teenag have the will to help out in a commun becaus they know that onli young peopl can chang it and some teenag dont even care and think that they have better thing to do . no one can reallli chang that . the will ha to come from their own mind and that can onli come if they want it .
