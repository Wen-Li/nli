do n't young peopl care anymor ? have they lost all sens of respons for their commun ? in recent year it ha been often discuss whether or not young peopl still give enough time to help their commun . as i can not clearli agre or disagre with the given statement , i will , in the follow essay , present argument for both side befor i draw a conclus that is partli base on my person experi . unfortun , it is a given fact that young peopl are less and less involv in their commun : when it come to local elect it is usual the young peopl who can not be bother to vote ; when it come to help out at social institut , young peopl are hardli seen ; and on sunday morn usual onli elderli peopl sit down at the local church bench . at first glanc it seem like young peopl are more interest in shop , play video game and parti instead of give some time to their commun . partli , thi might be true , but it is definit not true for all young peopl . in my person opinion the young peopl often are not properli given the chanc to play an activ and effect role in the societi they live in . dure my internship at local school , for exampl , i would often hear the young student make remark like the follow : `` nobodi care about what i do , everybodi think that i am a failure. '' , `` nobodi is interest in my opinion , i am not capabl of chang anyth anyways. '' , `` whi should i care about other , i need to care for myself first . '' . the reason for these and similar statement probabl are veri divers , for exampl one reason might be the lack support and understand of the parent . if parent fail in teach their children what it mean to be social , it is more like to meet a young one that doe n't care for anybodi els but himself . it therefor seem to me that the commun and especi the educ system ha to make major effort to prevent such a shortcom in social skill . commun , for exampl , should make it easier for young peopl to get involv instead of complain that young peopl are n't interest anymor . for exampl , the local anim shelter could go to the school and let the student know that they are in need for peopl to come walk the dog , clean the cage , and so on . they should also point out that they need veri respons and honor student to do the job and encourag the student to give it a tri . likewis , other institutuion should ask for help , also . for exampl , i could imagin that place for retir and sick peopl would have a great need of young peopl to spend time with the elderli one and , in my opinion , the institut should point out how benefici such a relationship could be for both parti . also , the commun should offer activ for teenag and young adult , for exampl regular meet where they can get togeth and perform multipl sort of activ that train intercultur and social compet . i truli believ that , if young peopl are encourag , they will gladli devot time to their commun and , thu , one should n't complain about the young one , but support them a littl better .
