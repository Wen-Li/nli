i think that a success person is more focus on tri new thing rather than do what he or she alreadi know well . infact a success person is a person who want to make the differ . let me explain . a success person is a person who want to be differ from other peopl ; he / she want to have some characterist that can make him/her special in front of all other normal peopl . to do that , a succes person ha to tri new thing and not onli to do what other peopl do everi day . the histori show us mani exampl of men a women that have chang the world by tri new thing . i 'm talk about inventor that , by do new thing , ha introduc some import innov . these men and women had taken a lot of risk by do that . the inventor that i admir most is mari curi , who develop the x ray technolog . x ray technolog is veri import today . howev , mari curi die becaus of intox caus by the big amount of x ray that she absorb . without her sacrifac , today we would't have one of the most import instrument to diagnos deseas and ill . howev , i have to say that a success person is a person that is abl to take some risk onli when risk are proportion to the benefit carri by do new thing . onli a stupid person can take some big risk without the possibl to get some big benefit . for exampl , manag and brocker , who are the main actor of the financi world , tri new thing ; for exampl they tri to invest money and time in new area of the world or in new technolog . they do thatt onli when the risk connecetd to the financi oper is as big as the return of money wait .
