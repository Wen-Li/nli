i certainli agre to the statement and there are conspicu exampl which make me believ thi way . firstli it is anchor in the `` natur '' of advertis that they make product seem much better as they are . you must onli ask yourself some quit simpl question . what are the intent of the advertis make peopl ? whi are there advertis in nearlli everi place all over the world ? and so on . the explan can be introduc by onli one singl word : `` money ! '' . do n't beliv advertis have been evolv to inform peopl about the best product , they have been evolv to make you buy a product without regard it qualiti . there are sever exampl . for instanc if you want to buy a fat-burn you will find a lot of differ product all promis achiev in a veri short period of time , but if you tri them out there will be nearli no achiev at all . moreov the advertis ha fulfil it purpos , becaus you have bought the product . an other exampl is advertis for cigarett . think about the notori marlboro-countri and ask yourself if you realli feel like a cowboy enjoy the lonely and endless of the prari when smoke a marlboro . thi exampl lead to the next paragraph . advertis want to present their product in the most typic way with refernc to the consum . let me explain thi a littl bit more . would a compani which sell tune part for car let play the main role of there spot by a gay guy . defin not ! there would by promiscu women as well as `` real-men '' repres the product becaus it would be more convinc to the peopl buy these product than a gay guy . so the advertis exist in a reciproc relationship with the consum . thi is necessari if the advertis make peopl want to reach their goal . to make you buy their product . as a conclus i would like to assert that the advertis which repres it product object doe not exist .
