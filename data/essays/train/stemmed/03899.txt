in my opinion , it is better to have special in one specif subject rather than have a broader knowledg of mani academ subject . i believ that a person should be a specialist rather than generalist . there 's an old say , `` jack of all trade master of none . '' firstli , a person should not wast hi time and money in acquir knowledg which he wo n't requir or use it in futur . a person should not devot hi time in learn unnecessari subject which he wo n't even impli in hi special like literatur and mathemat are two differ field . none of the thing are common between them . also , a mathemat student would wast hi time and energi in learn literatur wherea he could use thi time to do reserach in hi prefer subject . thi impli vice versa too . there is no practic implement of mathemat in literatur . we should avoid our time and energi spent on learn unnecessari subject . secondli , all the renown peopl whether it is from literatur or histori or scienc are the peopl who have special in one subject . they are not the peopl who have studi everyth . infact , they are the peopl who have devot all their life in special a subject . they work day and night on their subject to come to certain conclus which becom the basi of our live . moreov there are lot of prize and recognit for the peopl who have special in one subject . there is no such recognit for the peopl who know lot of subject and are master of none . there is wealth , fame and recognit for the peopl who have dedic their live to special and reserach in their particular field . these are the peopl who are highli appreci and respect in our societi . thirdli , most of the profess in today 's world requir a specialist . we have softwar programm , scientist , engin and etc . they all are the peopl who have master their field which is base on one subject . thi show that a specialist can surviv in ani condit . he will alway have job for earn hi livelihood . he will alway have a prefer over other . lastli , i will like to conclud that the greatest problem solver in ani field are the one who are specialist in their subject , not the one who know everyth .
