i think there is not a moment in your life more pleasant than other , the whole life is a cicl of grow person and intelectu , and one should enjoy everi step in thi cicl , so i disagre with the statement . peopl should enjoy everi moment in their live , becaus everi moment bring you differ satisfact and all of them are equal pleasant . as a child one enjoy a lot be in the kindergarden , and play with the other children there isnt anyth els more exit than that . the same occur as a student in highschool or at the univers , meet new peopl , share with them and all the thing around it are veri exit . by thi point there arent a lot of respons , and that is what make peopl think that be younger you enjoy life more . but respons do n't take away the exit in life . after the univers you star work , most peopl get marri , have children and with thi come the responsabilit , but who said thi wa n't pleasant . i still have no kid to take care of , but i realli want to get marri and have a lot of children , and i think i would continu enjoy life as i am right now as a young person . even work give great satisfact , and i realli enjoy work in thing i like . it is all just moment in your life , and each moment give a difer kind of satisfact . in an older age , satisfact must come from peopl around you , and the achiv you have done in your life . i think it must be veri pleasant to see what you have done in your life and share it with the peopl you love . in conclus one must enjoy everi moment of life , becaus everi moment come with great satisfactiond
