everybodi ha it own point of view on a certain issu and it not neccessari that the my point of view may corrobar with other or say in accord with other . come to thi particular topic of weather it better to have a broad academ knowledg on mani subject rather han special on one , i person feel that keep in mind the present global scenario and grow competit it better to have a broad knowledg in mani ascpect rather than to limit yourself to one particular field . whi i think so is that , it give you the cut edg over the other to surviv in thi otherwis predatori competit . by have broader knowledg you are not limit to one field onli . let understand thi by an exampl , suppos iam a laboratori technician and in addit to that i have a basic knowledg to handl the account and also to manag a offic , thi not onli add to my profil but also give me an extra confid to work in differ work condit if iam impos to them . ( here i have an standout advantag over a onli laboratori technician . ) not onli thi it can be a sourc of some extra incom which is veri neccessari keep in point of view the rise price of commod around the world . thi can be understood by again look into the exampl explain abov , suppos i get from the laboratori earli dure the work day i might take some tution of account as iam well vers with it also , thi could add extra incom to my pocket , doe n't it feel great . i am sure it feel so . and lastli but most importantli it give you a sens of secur futur in a way that you are not limit to a particular field , if you are not satisfi with your current job environ you can easliy switch on to the other as you are not limit to a particular profici . you can also chang job when you feel ennui becaus of the same stereotyp work . so i would rather advoc to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . my idea look to present secnario is `` it 's better to be jack of all trade rather than master of none .
