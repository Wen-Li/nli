` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' . the first question which i have to ask myself is : how to defin young , respect old ? a girl born in europ in the year 2006 will becom approxim 90 year old . a coupl of decad ago thi figur seem to be unbeliev . ( note : also for the major of the world 's popul such an age is quit unlik . ) still scientist in europ agre on describ life of consist of differ ` sphere of age ' . first period : 0-20 , second period 20-45 and third period up from 45 . even within thi categori there are mani , mani split like the ` third age ' from 80 onward . from my point of view young peopl are between the age of 0 and 45 , old peopl from the age of 45 up to x . so far we see that life expect ha increas but the question is if young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . as we live nowaday in a fast chang world ( e.g. globalis ) thi ha also influenc the ` joy of life ' . for instanc in europ in the late 1950 up to the late 1980 it wa easi to predict somebodi curriculum , the likelihood of job-hop wa quit low , also the worrri about environ like global warm did not play such an import role as it doe nowaday . as a result of the chang of ` outer-circumst ' ( globalis , growth of life-expect , environment question , etc . ) also the way how peopl ( can ) enjoy their life ha chang . from my point of view in the year of 2007 young peopl can not enjoy life as much as old peopl do . young peopl can not be sure about there futur . thing like job opportun , environment damag , war on resourc like oil , a fast and sudden chang world et cetera make life much more unpredict as it use to be . still young peopl can enjoy life but onli in short term : young peopl can enjoy their weekend , their holiday and their free-tim in gener . but can they enjoy their long-term futur ? can they enjoy their studi at univers by be alway awar of the job-opportun ? in contrast i think older peopl can be more sure about there futur . some of them might still need to work some year until they reach a sudden age ( e.g. 65 ) and from then on they can enjoy their pension . in contrast to their younger relev they do not have to care so much about person impact of long-term futur and it 's problem like war on resourc ( e.g. there will be still oil for app . 30 year ) nor do they have to be alway ` fit for the market ' . nowaday some research also say that old peopl are more financiali potenti than young peopl which often make life easier and more enjoy . finali i would like to say that thi gap between old and young peopl scare me a littl bit - on the one side young peopl with an unknown futur on the other side the old gener with plenti of time and money to enjoy futur . ..
