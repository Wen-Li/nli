i do n't think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today by three reason . car are expand too much to cut off from our live . as mani peopl know , car are veri convini and useful machin . in japan you can get a driver lisenc for no reason except if your are older than 18 . mani peopl ha a dream to drive a car especi if you are a male . so it is imposs to say that you can not use a car for daili life . in a sever year , i think car wo n't use a gasolin than now . it is true that car are not good for environ . but mani car compani are tri to make a new type of a car . for exampl , hybrid car . in the futur , there may be a car that move onli by a electr and not by gasolin . thi can prevent a green-hous effect . so there will be ani reason for not use a car . if you do n't use a car for transport , there should be a altern transport . not use a car mean you have to use a differ transport to go somewher . in japan train are veri common , but it is not so common to use a train in other countri as in japan . for instant , america . these are my opnion for the statement .
