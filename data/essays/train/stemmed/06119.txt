it is difficult to answer thi question . young peopl have all their life ahead , everyth is new . they have their dream that they hold on to , and they are , usual , full of hope . older peopl on the other hand , have learn a lot alreadi , and acquier some wisdom . they see life and certain thing like love less complic . they had their experi and are much cooler than when they were young . but young peopl have the advantag to be healthier and full of power and strength to live their youth and to make experi themself . older peopl are more like to get sick and to feel tire and weak . so mayb their bodi are not what they use to be . but the expier they made and what they have learn about life and about themself help them to take it easi . their mind is stronger . a old man laugh about thi childish young guy who is so desperatli in love that he is not abl to eat or to think , becaus he can onli think of hi girl . but he also envi him for be so strong and activ and to have such intens feel . thi is someth he lost on hi way becom a matur man . be young is an adventur , and you may enjoy it or you may regret it . it is full of action and impress , but for me , mayb becaus i m young and have not experienc be old , i still believ that the futur , in wich i will be old , offer me plenti of happy . it will be differ , though . i am quit sure it depend on everi singl person whether they are happier when they are young or old . but i have to admit , that even if i think that it onli get better , most of the old peopl miss their youth veri much . but it can be joyful to rememb to ! i think you should enjoy everi age . but as the youth is more intens , i think that for most peopl the youth is the part of their life that they enjoy the most .
