i think it is more import for student to lern fact . becaus if peopl just understand the idear and they can not use that in our world , that mean they do not learn anyth . everyon if you learn all thing the aim is to use that . so i thing it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the student go to the school to learn someth such as english , math , bolog and so on . they get the perti high gread but when they go out of the school they do not know how to solv the problem thay mean they never get the knolowdg so they can not use it . for exampl i have a friend name 's ning he veri like studi he think studi is the first thing in hi life , so everi night he go to bed after he know everyth veri cleanli . he is the favourt student for my teacher , but onc we went to the outsid to play suddenli one friend have some problem to ask ning , but he can not talk us about the fact , that problem is although a problem . we are live in the world in the fact we need to know how can we live . so there is go to be some problem so we go to school to studi how to solv the problem . if you just know the knolowdg and can not solv the true problem in our life the all knolowdg and not be use . so you just get the skin not the whole thing . so i think it is more improt for student to lern fact . becaus we need live in thi world !
