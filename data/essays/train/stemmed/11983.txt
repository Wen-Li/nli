i do not agre the statement . travel in a group led by a guid may seem to make your trip more comfort , as the whole intineri ha been plan for you . you onli need to follow the lead and ` woo and wow ' over the spectacular sight . but thi may lose the whole point of travel to a foreign countri in the first place : you want to enjoy yourself in a place that you have never been befor , therefor you travel . the first thing that you will miss out when travel in a group tour is the plan of your own trip . you may be forc to go to place that you are not interest in , or even threaten to shop in a particular place . as happen recent in hong kong , a mainland china tour group wa abandon by their tour guid becaus they were not will to buy anyth from a design shop . thi may onli be an extrem case , but you can not deni that you will onli be abl to see the famou tourist sight and noth more if you go on a tour . yet , if you go on your own , you can go to all sort of bizarr place that you may want to go , and not have to crowd with all the other tourist in the so-cal ' tourist spot ' , which may not be appeal to you at all . some peopl may be afraid to get lost if they go to a total strang place on their own . but i say that is part of the thrill and fun of travel to a foreign place . you could find your own way out , and mayb find an excit place that you did n't even know about befor . or you could alway ask the local for direct , possibl develop a friendship with them . travel on your own allow you to have more interact with the place and the peopl . when i travel to thailand on my own , while tourist were eat bland food in a ` high-end restaur ' , i wa eat delici local food andchat away happili with the local at one of the market stall . languag is not a problem ; you will learn how to commun fluentli in a mix of oral and bodi languag in no time . see ? anoth benefit of travel on your own . on the whole , the main point of travel is to seek pleasur in a place beyond your own home . if you can not fulli experi the place , then whi wast money and time to go on a trip ?
