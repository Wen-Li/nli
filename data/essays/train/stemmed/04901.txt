for thi question there are two main way of develop it . the first is that today there are an incred number of car in the world , in europ and in the north america the market is full , but in asia , for exampl , the rapidli grow up of popul could have increas a number of car . the second is that in europ and u.s.a. the public kind of transport are forev in amount and the car began an older kind of transport . i think that the second way is the best solut for thi big problem of car number in the world , and so i agre with thi question : in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
