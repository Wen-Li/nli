in my view , in twenti year from now will be more car in use than today . so i disagre the fewer car in futur . first , it will be chang that peopl buy a car more cusual . although , peopl start concid environment friendli sociti , like recomend a pubul transport , bu or subway . more atract have a own car nowaday . mani car compani are veri competit , produc a nice , new modl stayl everi year to attract consum thouth a media , televison , internet . and a cost of per car ha been acept for even young singl person . fortermor , a life of each famili member might be more imdipend . havind a car for as person bele will be possibl in nearlli futur . second , new nutur enegi or electron engin have been found instad of oil ga . new type of car onli use a littl oil and conbin electron enegi and it is alreadi useig some region . they are low cost and environment harmless for earth . final . i assum that even a lot of car in futur dose not pollut as much as use to be . but more number of car will appear . and i disagre that it will be fewer car in use than there are today .
