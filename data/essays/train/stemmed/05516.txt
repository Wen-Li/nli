in my opinion i believ the theori about that in twenti year there will be less car than there are today is wrong . i think that becaus of the way of human life , in the futur will be more car there are now . the first point of thi theori is that when i look at documentari about car in the past there wa just a few car and veri expens so nobodi could buy one . today everi famili can buy a car or more than one . the amount of car in use have execed the expect and now there as car or more that peopl in the earth . furthermor , the human are get more and more lazi . we plan owr life tri to do as less exercis as we can . so even we go near home we just take the car becaus it is easier to get and faster . if we think in the oves progress in societi we can asum that peopl is get fatter and and lazyier , and one reason for that is the use of the car . anoth point for thi grownig sittuat is the econom aspect of thi industri . goven from all over the world ha a big intrest in use and sell car , becaus of their own econom benefit . as you can see the best car in world are produc y the econom potenc like germani , or the unit state , or itali or japan . moreov they have a big interest in the ga they sell becaus it is a big econom resourc in all over the world . final by my piont of view the indutri is grow more and more , so there is no reason i can give to think that in twenti year will be less car than today . so becaus of the human way of life , in the futur will be lot of more car that it is right now .
