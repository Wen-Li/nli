ye , i agre with the statement that onli peopl who take risk will be success . it is import to know what i can and can not do . the most import thing is to be good at what i do and to concentr on one speciv opject or part . in the modern time there are so mani peopl that for exampl work as design that it is not possibl to work just as such . everybodi need no have a certain special like interior design or as a design for car . success onli come with individu . there are so mani design there is no way of bee success when you just do what everyon doe . like becaus everyon thi season think red and length sripe are trendi that should not make you onli design red and length sripe chair , skirt or what ever the provet is . it should make the person make green skirt with pink point on it . that is shourli riski becaus mayb no one will buy them but mayb becaus of everybodi have red , some individu like have green . as soon as a person loos the thrill of bee better he ha stop to be good . success come and goe and onli thou how keep on work on their own knowleg can keep on bee success . bring new idea and find spot on the market that have not yet been discov is the most surten way to make someth big . therefor onli bee good at what you do , doe not make someon autmaticli success . but take the risk of go one step further then everyon els can will make the differnec .
