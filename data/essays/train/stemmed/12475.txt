as the need for a better life is grow in develop countri , there is more and more commerci busi offer differ product . some of them will make the same product . those compani , not to lose money will , therefor be at `` war '' adainst each other . they will need to advertis for their product . to do so they will show us that , first we need thi type of product , and second that the one they are offer is better than the one from anoth compani . how do we know if the product of a compani `` a '' is better than the one from compani `` b '' , or if the product is as good as it seem to be ? everyon had onc ask the question . we have to understand that the compani have to sell their product whatev might happen , and they have to produc it with the less cost possibl . so we may ask ourselv if the product we are buy are as good as the advertis want us to believ it is . it 's quit a tough question if we are look at it close , there is some compani who will show us the product as it realli is and some other who wo n't . how can we make the differ ? i guess it 's up to us . we have to rememb that they are here to sell whatev product it is and therefor ha to make it look good . you wo n't buy a product if we are tell you the whole truth , the whole thruth be that there is side effect on thi new diet pill or that thi cheap tv will onli work 45 minut a day . for me compani have to sell whatev product they are make , and in order to do that they have to present those product on their brightsid and tell us onli the good part of the stori . some will emphas the good part and let the custom wonder if thi wonderful product realli exist and some other will show us the product as it realli is . we can ask ourselv how we will be act if it wa us to sell someth to anoth person , either we will be eager to sell it without mention coupl of problem we had with it , the car we are sell will breakdown at the next corner , or we will be tell the truth say that the car we are sell will break down but thi car is worth the repair to be done . either way , we are not tell the same thing , but we are sell the same thing . i will then say that advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are , but it 's for one purpos to sell and you wo n't sell someth that it 's not good enough for your custom . adverstis is to me like a painter paint a portrait , it will make the product seem better than it realli is , the same way a painter will paint the face of someon seem prettier than it realli is . we just have to know how much we want to beleiv the magnif of the truth .
