my opinion on thi subject is that young peopl can easili enjoy life , more than older peopl becaus they have less respons . besid when you are young you do n't think about the consequ and about the futur so you do thing older peopl do n't . in a way my part is that the societi where we are live nowaday give us thi imag that young peopl are enjoy life be conscious . moreov when you are young you can do mistak and peopl tell you it 's becaus you have not a lot of experi . it 's a common thought that older act better becaus they have experi , sinc ancient greek time . i think onc you are older you prefer to have a simpl and calm life , whithout do some big parti with a lot of alcohol and without see friend everi time . mayb older you want to stop all thi . but it can be differ if your life ha been bor and if you had respons earlier like a child or a hous to take care , mayb you will prefer a life with more action . for my part i 'd like to say that i am enjoy life studi , go to parti , have a lot of friend and so on , but i know that my dad had a famili veri earlier so he had to work and at night could n't go with hi friend becaus he had to studi late for univers or to take care of me as a babi . sometim i think that he would have prefer a differ life but he ' s enjoy now the way he live . so to respond to thi question i will say that it depend on the way you want to live when you are young and especi when you are old . as far as i am concern i think thi topic is a realiti for us now but onli the see part of the realiti becaus media for instanc like to show young peopl in thi way , it 's a discuss of societi
