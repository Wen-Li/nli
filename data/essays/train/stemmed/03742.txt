i think that will depend mainli on the stage of the student . for primari school student , i think it is much better for them to learn fact simpli becaus student at thi stage will not be abl to understand idea or concept . secondari school student are abl to understand idea and concept simpli becaus they have alreadi background about fact from the primari school . the situat for the student in the colleg stage is differ as well . i think it is much better for undergradu student to learn fact by take mani cours of differ subject area . that will give them the opportun to broad their knowledg about variou topic . so after graduat , dure their graduat studi , they may take cours in onli their subject area . by thi way , they will abl to work in detail on their major area of studi and of cours learn idea and concept in depth . thi definit what is happen in the us univers and faculti where student in the undergradu stage are offer to take some requir cours and mani elect cours . so dure their graduat studi , they may take mani cours that relat to their major for one year or so . unfortun , in my countri we onli learn fact all the time . i think that the main caus of jobless in my countri . i hope one day , i can chang the way of learn in my countri . as a conclus , both polici of learn are requir depend on the stage of the student .
