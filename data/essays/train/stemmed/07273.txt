i do agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older do . young are young , they have time to do what they like . they may go to a danc hall everi night share a wonder time with their friend , or sleep for an entir day just becaus it 's comfort . young are unexperienc , so they can tri everyth that they fell excit . they may climb tree and hill , travel across river and ocean to experi the glori of the naturl . they may easili take bill that take all the money , for they got a idea to tri a new thing , and then they think it 's worthi . young are confid , they will do everi thing that they want to do . they may just have a littl compani with a littl money , and then tri their best to made it gloomi . they may also get crazi in they dream , to be a painter , dancer , engin or mani other career . young are never to young , if they want , they can do anyth . no matter how other are consid their behavior and how astonish thier behavior are , onc deic to do that , they will never stop . young are free , they have not too much to think of . they do not have to worri about how much money they still have , or how they get rid of the next poor day , or climb in the rain may caus ill instead of apprici the great natual . so i think young peopl enjoy life better than the older peopl . youn are belong to theirselv , they can do anyth they like , they can choos ani life style they want to
