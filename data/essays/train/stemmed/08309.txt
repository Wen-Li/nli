some peopl claim young peopl live a more valuabl and interest life than the older peopl do . the other peopl , howev take the opposit point of view . in my opinion , i believ older peopl can enjoy life more than young peopl do . i shall set forth two major reason in support of thi . firstli , older peopl normal know the mean of life better than the youth . they have richer life experi and from which they have learnt what kind of thing are worth do . in thi way they are more like to spend their time on the pursuit more valuabl . by pursu these preciou goal , their life are full of mean and have more fun than some young `` couch potato '' who do not know where they should go . for an instanc , i use to live with an old ladi for a while . she wa eighti year old , but she kept make babi cloth everyday for the children in orphanag . she consid it as consider valuabl , and thu she greatli enjoy the way she live her life . so older peopl gain more life experi through year and gener know deeper about the mean of life , which brighten their life . secondli , young peopl are more like to enjoy their life in more superfici way . it is easi to see that a lot of teenag indulg in video game and tv program which keep them from sophisc think . they are easili attract by superfici pleasur and the life they enjoy is less valuabl than the life with deliber consider and long-term plan which older peopl normal make . in brief , older peopl can live a more meaning life and thu enjoy life with higher qualiti than some young peopl do . therefor , from my point of view , older peopl can live a more joy life than young peopl do .
