i would agre with the statement , even though i must admit that the question if young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do , is certainli veri difficult to answer , becaus you have to compar peopl out of differ time and social structur , with veri differ problem , option , possibl and wish . let me first shortli explain the background , out of which most - if not all - older peopl that i know come : most of them experienc war or the time after war ; a time full of scarciti and poverti . everyon had to work veri hard for hi life . when there wa money left , it wa seldomli simpli spent for someth like holiday or have a fine dinner or theater . it wa rather save for bad time that could probabl come again . they prefer - or perhap were forc by societi and expect put on them - to go on work rather than enjoy life or do someth for themselv , just to be secur . over the decad , life got easier of cours and also those peopl learn to enjoy life . but i think that in most older peopl there is still alway thi feel of first work , then enjoy their own life . on the other hand , life for young peopl today is also certainli hard and not easi , sinc they have a lot of pressur to bear , impli on them from school , studi or job . but i think they grew up in a societi in which enjoy life is someth other peopl make money with . it a busi - enjoy life is someth like a symbol for wealth which is highli promot in advertis and market . furthermor , it is social accept to enjoy life , to go on holiday , to visit bar , restaur , cinema or to subscrib for a wellness-week . for these reason i think it easier and more common among young peopl to enjoy life than for old peopl .
