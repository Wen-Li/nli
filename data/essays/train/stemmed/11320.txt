it is debat whether young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun or not . some peopl say that they can not find the reason whi they have to care about their commun . howev , i firmli believ that help their commun is quit import thing in their life . first of all , we can not live by ourselv . we have to help each other . of cours that is an option and we can choos whatev we want , but nowaday , it wouldl be harder and harder if peopl tri to live themselv . if we tring to spend our time in the commun , it can be a good way to know mani peopl who can help us when we get into a hard time . for exampl , i wa tri to have a my own piano recitl in my communit . and i heard that is not so easi . but fortun i wa a volunt in my commun last summer and throught that experi , i had a chanc to know lot of peopl who can help me. so i could have a recitl veri easili becaus of their recommand . second of all , we can improv our social skill . nowaday , peopl tend to be isol . but i dont think that is the best way to live . for exampl , i have a friend and she alway tri to be alon in her room . i thought she enjoy her time herself but onday , she get a diseas and it wa dipress . if she tri to live out of her room , she woulnt get sick . from that time , i learn that social skill can be the most import thing in our happi life . to sum up , even if we are young and their is lot of thing what we want besid help our commun , we would better tri to spend more time in the commun . i can say that would give you a great experi you ever had befor .
