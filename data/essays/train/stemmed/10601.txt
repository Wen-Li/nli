i can see both advantag and disadvantag to tri new thing and take risk for be success . you can whether choos stabil and use tradit way and avoid risk or tri new way and take risk for be success . i definet believ that peopl should tri new thing and take risk for be succes . if you do everyth with a routin that mean you know the result . for exampl if a farmer use tradit way for agricultur , he can guess how much crop he will get . he can avoid risk by do that . but it is not a creativ way and it is obviou that he wo n't be success . he will get as same amount crop as next year . the point i am tri to make is , that is not a vakid way for be a suscuss person . on the other hand he could tri differ way in order to get much crop which mean take risk for success . in my opinion , success peopl tri new thing and take risk . for instanc , if the farmer tri a new agriculturel way which is not experienc befor he can get a differ amount of crop . he could get whether '' less or much '' but the point is he can be success by take that risk . i alreadi know that lot of success peopl in busi area tri new thing and figur out new way . that is the main reason of their success . for instanc a veri well known newspap owner wa just a writer in a newspap . he decid take risk , he resinsg and establish a local newspap and then he made it success . and we all know that newspap owner today . to sum up , i alway experienc that success peopl take risk . they tri new way instead of onli do what they alreadi know . they take risk for be success .
