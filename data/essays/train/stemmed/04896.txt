it is state that to agre or disagre with the statement ,, ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ' ,, definetli i would agre that younger peopl will enjoy more than older peopl do . . , firstli ,, in order to support , i would give you the few fact that older peopl are caus with mani pain and health problem , so most of the old peopl must be stick to the hous or farm ,, and for maximum time , they are said to be alon with no compani to share their view or feel , for exampl ,, in mani hous older peopl live alon while his/her partner is been dead and mani older peopl today are suffer from health problem . . come to younger peopl , they have time to spend lot of time with famili friend and collegu at work station , younger peopl can have most of their time spend outsid with the latest outcom of trend and they seem to be more avtiv ,, for exampl ,, younger peopl face student life which creat more enjoy moment , and mani other sweat moment ,, other fact is that younger peopl are not affect with health problem or silli pain like older peopl have , youger peopl have chanc to share more feel from mani peopl whom they come accross and have good time spend outsid . . it is more advantag to the younger peopl that they can take advis from the older peopl , who are more experienc with the situat , and get rid of most of the problem which they are face ,, with these younger peopl solv their problem veri easili and get rid of the tension and problem and enjoy much . .. but rather than these view , few argu that older peopl enjoy much as they are not respons for ani work or carri such burden which wold basic creat more tension , they are tend to enjoy apart from physiac but mental ,,,, and younger peopl rather have more burden and respons of those situat they face ,, so with these view few peopl argu that younger peopl spend their life with all burden and respons ,, final ,, i conclud that youger peopl enjoy much time even though they have burden and respons , reason is that onli face activ interact life , and will be have mani great moment relat to their achiv along with the enjoymnet they do with lot of friend . ..
