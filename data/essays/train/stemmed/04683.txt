i agre thi statement . in moderm time , advertis for product is a veri import market stateg . the industri want have a good sale on their product , then they need to make attrac advertis to consum . therefor , most of them were made over to show it product qualiti that they realli have . i make some exampl to support my opinion . first , they are over imagin on advertis . like some liquard product advertis , we can see offen on the tv . in a pretti hot day , you get a cool drink and drink it , and then you will feel the weather becom cold and forget the deadi hot weather . i think thi will not realli happen when anyon drink the prioduct . they will never say what is not good for human , like soda , if you drink it everyday instead of water , you will gain weight a lot and also will caus some diseas for bodi . second , it is not ture for the product on advertis , i rememb i have seen a comerci is about batteri . they put their product into a robert and compar anoth unknowen compani 's product which put into a same robert too , and then they test which batteri can keep more time to let the robert move . after thi , i have bought the compani 's product and use , but i did n't recoginz what is realli big differ with other brand . not all the advertis tell the real turth that their product is . next , they make everyon seem want to purchas their product . like some advertis show peopl want to take the last staff make a long line or even fight to each other for thi staff . it make consum confus that thi product is everi import for them , so we have hurri to buy it earli or you ca n't buy it anymor . there is overshow whi thi product we realli need it . we need more inform to support thi product is we real want or not .
