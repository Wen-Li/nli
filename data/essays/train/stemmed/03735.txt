trowgh the histori of knowledg , there have been mani idea and trend about the best way to get and approach it . may be the most common one that are still present in our academ live , and command most of the present teach model we can find at school and univers . the fir of them and may be the older one , induct the knowledg , that men some one have that knowledg and give it to other , that person is the master , the autor and almost superior , and their alumn follow him . in to the other hand , we can find a more modern concept that promot the construct of knowledg , that mean each person can approach the knowledg in their own way , can get the idea and concept and construct whith them . in that case there are facilit who give that concept and the tool that student need . that we can usual find thi day in school and even at univers is a combin of both so depend on what is strongli enphasis we will get differ result . person , i studi in a waldorf school that emphasi the construct approach to knowledg and later i had to go into a tradit school , that emphasi in induct of knowledg . now i am sure i had an advantag over the other student in the tradit school becaus i primarli lern how to get and understand idea and concept and construct knowledg . if you just learn fact , with time you shure forget them . if you clearli understand concepst you will be abl to construct again knowledg .
