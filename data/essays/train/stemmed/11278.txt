mani peopl say that a student 's main job is to learn facts-sometim by heart . it is true that if a student doe not learn hi lesson he wo n't be abl to understand hi next class or get a good grade on hi test . but is learn everyth ? is it enough to fulli succeed as a student . can a math-stud pass hi exam onli by learn hi theorem , definit and demonstr ? learn is the basi for a student . one time , i had so much work to do and paper to hand out that i did not learn my lesson for the next class . and i wa lost the next period ! thi experi enabl me to realiz how concentr you are and how well you understand the next class when you learn fact . when you learn someth you make an effort and then ask yourself question about a fact if you ca n't fulli understand it . but some peopl learn their lesson in a mechan way and i disagre with thi type of organ . when student learn by heart onli their short-term memori is work which mean they onli rememb thing for a short time-period . when i learn my maths-definit i repeat them to myself but tri to understand them . thi theori work becaus i have observ that when i do n't fulli understand a definit i do not rememb it in the long term . when you understand or tri to understand a lesson you ask yourself question about the topic which make you want to know more and help you develop extra-skil . student who want to understand idea and concept ca n't be inaccur in their work and develop organ and clariti skill . in conclus we are face with the fact that both learn and understand are use method for a student . to be total effici a student ha to learn and understand .
