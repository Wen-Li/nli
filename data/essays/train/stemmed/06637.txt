i disagre with the statement , that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , but actual i can understand the the peopl , who suppurt it , either . if you consid young peopl nowaday , they alway tend to be hang around and avoid do thing , which might be use at all , not consid , whether it is use for them or for anyon els . i must admit , that there are youngster , who live accord to that . but on the other hand , you have to look for the reason , whi young peopl are act like thi . one reason might be , that there is not the appropri offer in the commun the peopl live in , which depend on the commun itself . anoth reason could be the identif with the peopl 's hometown , which , in my opinion is strictli relat to the size of the commun . becaus in smaller commun everi person know everi other person so the social reward , is much greater , when peopl recogn your work . furthermor peopl work togeth in the commun , who know each other for the whole time of their life , which bring along a complet differ kind of motiv . on the other hand , it is veri import to consid the expect other institut have on the student as well . and there are quit a lot of institut apart from commun , like school , sport club , famili and of cours friend , respect the partner . young peopl want to be succes in school to have the oppurtun to appli for a good job later , they want to have a hobbi they can spend time on and the famili and of cours friend also want to be part of your life . if it is quit difficult to handl all these thing success on their own , then it is hardli applic to fulfil a further task . nevertheless it is possibl to give time to help your commun by declar it as your hobbi , if you find someth , which you realli enjoy to do . in my case , i had also the opportun to help my commun , even full-tim : one year ago i work 10 hour a day , five day a week for one year in the civil servic as a driver for retard and elderli peopl . by the way , thi wa a veri interest experi , i will never forget .
