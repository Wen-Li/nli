the best way to travel is in a grup led by a tour guid i agre becaus if you have a person that know about the place that you are go to or you are visit , he can give you an explain about the histori , about the lifestil , the cultur , the food , etc. in the other way if you go somewher and you do not know noth about it , for exampl where is a museum , a typic place , a chuch , etc. then you have to search for yourself all the place that you should visit and it problabl will take you some time , that you can spend in other place . for exampl if you go alon to the mexico citi i am sure that you will lost on the center town , although mexico is a veri small citi . in addit if you have a tour guid , you can ask himfor everyth that you want. a tour guid is a person that know the mean of the place . is wa for they are work and they enjoy explay peopl about the place they have known and learn . if you are think on do a travel without a tour guid you have to studi perfectli the place where you want to go just for you can find all the thin that are repres in that conutri . other reason is bacaus all the peopl do not act in the same way . i mean taht if you nedd some help or ask about a street mayb you do not have someon to ask and ypo will be alon . if you have a tour guid he take you everywher you want . the condit of have a tour guid is onli tha t you have to pay for their servic , but i think that is more import have a nice vacat without troubl or accid than have a vacat where you were all the time stress .
