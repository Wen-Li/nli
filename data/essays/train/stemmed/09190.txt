young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . be a young person and compar my self to my grandpar , i have some reason to support that idea . first of all , younger peopl do n't face that mani difficulti from the begin of their life . as the time pass by , we learn the life and we face difficulti , sad , heartbreak and so on . and thi can steal a lot from someon 's energi for live . secondli just becaus young peopl have more time to live ( in normal condit ) , they have more time to make their dream come true . so they do n't stop expect and thi make them better enjoy the life . but for exampl my grand father who 's alreadi 83 year old , do n't have ani expact . he think that he will die soon , he lost hi power and will for life . also , if not marri , young peopl do n't have as mani respons as they would have when they get marri . they do n't need to think of their children . when they want to do somet , for exampl travel , they do n't need to think if they need to take care of someon who 's stay home . but for exampl for my parent it is never easi to do immedi what they want to do . they think of me and my brother , they think if we need them they can not be on our side and thi make feel them bad . also my father ha big respons of hi work , he ca n't quit whenev he want to . final , it is also veri common that older peopl have more health problem . as they get older , they are come closer to the end of life and thi give them bad feeel and keep them away from enjoy the life . in conclus , i would say that even if i will get older , i never want to stop enjoy life . if i 'm retir and in good financi situat , i can travel to see the world , i can keep expact for my children or even grand children and if i have the power , i would spend my energi for the chariti foundat . i believ make other peopl happi and provid them a better life would alway make me enjoy the time i 'm live .
