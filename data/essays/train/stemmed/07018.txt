i strongli believ that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for sever reason . first of all , the market ha been alway work behind the object of : `` sell . .. as much as you can the product '' , ... and how do they know how to sell us someth ? how do they know how to make us buy what they want us to buy ? well , first of all , they studi the consum . in my opinion , it 's more than obviou that everybodi want the best price base on qualiti everytim they are go to buy a product . thi is not someth easi , becaus if a busi creat someth with high qualiti and sell that product cheap , they would never get a good profit of it . so , is you creat a product , at a price , and you want to sell as much as possibl , how are you go to do it ? well , there is where the market , and therefor , the advertis , enter in our discuss . it 's seem someth easi , but it 's not . the first thing they have to do is studi the consum , what they need , at what price , when and how much . if the product that they are tri to sell , ha everyth the consum want , perfect , they did it ! but that is veri veri difficult , becaus no all the consum are the same , it affect the age , the sex , where are they from , what they like . .. so , the solut is make the product and make it look like the consum want it to be . it can sound strang , but i think that the object of the advertis is tri to sell you someth they want you to buy , sometim a product that you realli need for your life , but sometim they creat you wehat i call , artifici need . let just tri to think about us , i 'm sure there ha been at least one time in the life of everybodi that had bought someth that it seem great on televis and then it is n't as good as we thought . my experi wa buy a car , it look amaz on televis and it ha a great price too , but someth cheap cost you expens . .. everybodi wa buy thi car , so i decid to buy it and , at least , it wa n't as amaz as i thought at first . in conclus , i strongli agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , becaus the object of the advertis is to sell you someth and make you buy it , even if it as good as it seem , or not .
