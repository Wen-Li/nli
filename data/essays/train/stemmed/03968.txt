the statement that the , `` young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do '' , appear veri vagu to me . it is a veri gener statement . in my opinion age is just a number and it is the attidud toward life is that matter the most . i believ , if we have a posit attitud then no matter what our age is we will be optimist and have a zest for life and for other social - cultur activ . in fact as we grow old , we matur and start make wise decis instead of be impuls . young peopl in my person opinion are hyperact and prudent . when young we just want to do thing which will give us short term happi or pleasur . dure the grow up year , the tendenc is to enjoy and to experi everyth without consid the ramif of their action . but when we compar , the enjoy that compris of physic activ , like sport or other adventur outdoor activ ( like bike , hike , surf etc . ) then there is no denial that the young peopl enjoy and make the most of it ! also when we are young , we face the hardship of life , educ , job which at time can leav a littl time for adventur or enjoy . but as we grow old , by that time , we have taken care of our respons , achiev and accomplish our goal . then we adopt a more relax attitud to enjoy the benefit of our hardwork . so in a way it can be a debat question who enjoy the life more , the young or the old ! as far as i am concern , i do not agre that onli young peopl enjoy life more . enjoy and happi are also associ with the way we human perciev thing . so enjoy of life by younger gener can also be dub as an ambigu entiti .
