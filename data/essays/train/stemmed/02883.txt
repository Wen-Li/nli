the provid topic state that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i disagre with the statement as it is my opinion that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . nowaday , we live in a world that is econom driven and requir good plan and wise decis make . due to their wide experi in life , older peopl are abl to plan wise in order to enjoy their live . for exampl , older peopl will plan their outing , vacat , activ , and event more effect than young peopl . for a vaction , they plan where they want to go and what they want to see and how much the cost would be . thi way they will enjoy all aspect of their vacat and not miss import event or sight . whilst , if they went on a vaction , younger peopl would not plan as well and eventu miss out a lot of import activ and sight . consequ , with their good plan , older peopl would onli spend moni on what they want to see and enjoy . whilst younger peopl would run out of money and usual regret some of the thing they did not see in their vacat . in addit , older peopl would have more money to enjoy life with than younger peopl . older peopl are more establish in their career and therfor more financi sound and actual save have save their money to enjoy their live at thi stage . whilst younger peopl may not have as much money to enjoy life with as some of them may be in school or not employ . some of them may have not even thought of a career at thi point in their live . on the other hand , there are alway except as there are younger peopl who do plan well , are establish in their career , and are financi well off . but gener speak , due to their life experi , older peopl plan well , establish in their field , and are financi more sound than younger peopl .
