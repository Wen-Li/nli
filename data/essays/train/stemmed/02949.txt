i disagre with the statment that in twenti year will be a fewer car in use than today . car are import now for human and they will be import till we find someth more effect to bring us or our good from a to b , but that will not happen in the next twenti year . car are also import to peopl becaus they mean freedom . with my car i am abl to get to everi point in the world it make me mobil and more avail to the world . in the next twenti year the popul an earth will increas . more peopl also mean there will be a bigger need for car . peopl will ask for them becaus they are avail and compani are go to satisfi thi need in matter to make profit . they statment could be form by the fact that our fossil resourc are get less but i am sure mankind will find a solut for thi problem . compani alreadi start to test option resourc instead of the tradion one . if our fossil resourc are empti we will just switch to anoth one so that is not a point whi there should be less car in twenti year . anoth fact whi i think we will not see less car in the twenti year is the reason we need car . we need them to bring good to the destin we need them . our hunger for resourc like water and food will increas in twenti year becaus we gonna be more peopl on thi planet . sinc we live in citi and not on farm anymor thi resourc need to come to us . we have to transport them from there origion to there destin . car are the best solut for thi problem becaus the are the cheapest solut to solv thi problem so far and i am sure that will not chang in the next twenti year . i disagre with the statment there will be fewer car in twenti year becaus we need car to satisfi our need on resourc on the fastest and profitablest way we can . also i am sure we wound see less car becaus we dont wanna give them up car give us the feel of be free and peopl do not want to lose thi feel .
