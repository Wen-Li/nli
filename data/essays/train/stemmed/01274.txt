will there be fewer car in use than there are today ? i agre so insofar as with the rapidli develop of new technolog which could reshap the way peopl live the life and peopl commun with each other . howev , in thougful consider , i think that there will increas more car than there are today concern with the increas wealth of individul and the seper between work area and live area . admittedli , with the complet develop of public transport system such as the develop of underground transport , the system will obtain larger capac , which would be a replac to the use of car . howev , accord to statist survey , there is also increas in popul . on the other hand , the develop of internet will reshap the way peopl commun with each other , which mean that peopl have not have to commuinc wiht each other through public transport , howev , it doe not mean that peopl will replac tradit way of commun . some import confer must be held face - to-fac . futhermor , i agre with the statement that there will be a increas in car due to the increas wealth of individul . it is human natur to enjoy the achiev of wealth , so , in thi case , peopl will intend to buy some staff such as car to encourag themselv . the second reason whi i think that car will be increas is involv in the seper between the work area and live area . assum the case that you live in a town nearbi the citi and there is no other transport tool like subway or buse . you have to buy an car in order to arriv the place you work on time . in conclus , i think that with develop of new technolog , it will alliev the pressur on trasport , howev , car will continu to increas becasu of the spout of popul , increas in wealth and the seper between work area and live area
