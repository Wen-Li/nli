in my opinion it is not true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl - for variou reason . one of the most import reason for me is that it is imposs to gener . everi individu is differ . a shi , introvert young person may find it hard to enjoy life and a lot of teenag today have a tendenc to spend a lot of time insid the hous watch tv or play computer-gam rather than to go out and social with peopl their age . a lot of them seem to prefer live in a virtual world rather than realiti . on the other hand i have notic that older peopl can be veri commun and chatti , they still know the import of social , make new friend , get to know their neighbour and they enjoy have a social network around them - famili friend and neighbour . a lot of young peopl do go out - but do they enjoy life ? it alway is a question of definit , is n't it ? especi in the u.k. there is the phenomenon of bing drink - mostli young peopl who tri to get complet drunk as quickli as possibl . the effect can be seen in the street of a lot of citi on a saturday night . in a lot of club teenag go to you can get a wide rang of drug . if that is your idea of enjoy life - have fun ! and then , old peopl today might not be what they use to be - i think the elder gener ha becom a lot more activ ( and more often than not ha a secur incom at it dispos ) . old peopl now like to go on holiday , they might even buy their villa in spain , there is a whole wellness-industri aim at the older gener . so , in the end wether you enjoy life or not realli is not a question of age but of attitud .
