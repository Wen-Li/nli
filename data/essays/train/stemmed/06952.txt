the statement in content is , `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i partial agre with the statement . the reason for my partial agreement be , the natur of the topic that is reason hard to predict and open for mani altern . firstli , let us consid the condit where we are now . assum the present condit prevail in the next twenti year , i think we might have a declin in the usag of car . thi may be attribut to the condit of scarciti of oil reserv and which in turn result in the increas of ga price all around the world . which make it uneconom to maintain a car . consid these condit the chanc that a common man may use hi car for gener purpos may come down significantli . secondli , consid the case , where ultra modren subway and metropolitian transit in the urban area make way for fast , effici and convin transport . the citizen may consid these mean econom as well as less strenou than drive their own vehicl to work . in thi probabl case , there is a possibl of the reduc usag of car . thirdli , if substanti progress is made in the field of altern renew energi sourc and hybrid vehicl , which solv the problem due to pollut and the problem of rise fuel price , then there is a probabl chanc that ther might be a signific increas in the usag of car . and also in the case , where differ mean of harvest the energi to drive the car are develop by some of the technic breakthrough , it is veri much possibl that the usag of car may increas significantli . to sum up , it is veri much possibl that the usag of car in the next twenti year may be reduc if the exist condit prevail . even it is also hard to predict for sure that there wo n't be ani technic breakthrough which will help manufactur car which are effici enough to make them econom enough .
