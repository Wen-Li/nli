i 'm agre whit thi statement . for exampl , think to the i-pod , a new type of mp3 music , the advertis that the productor do , is too unreal . they say that if you have thi mp3 , you have more opportun to be consid by your friend , or by other peopl , that you have someth more that give you what other have n't , give you celebr or more opportun with the girl or the boy . but thi is onli an object that beetwen a few month you will chang becaus is out of mode . is noth special , it ca n't give you everyth that they said . the produc use the pubblic to bring the peopl , to influenc their choic and for do it they must invent , they must associ to their object the figur of geat , wonderful , special even if is a common object . anoth exampl could be rappres by the use of yogurt for the regular . in itali there are more societi tha make yogurt to help the peopl to go to the bathroom , and they say that if you took one of thi everi day you can get it . but if you tri , the qualiti that them could apport to you is not real how they said . it 's dipend from peopl to peopl . so we do n't believ in everyth that they tell , becaus there is alway someon that tend to tell a lay for have we to hi part .
