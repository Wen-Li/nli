i live in a citi and i can see everyday so mani car move in the street and a lot of traffic . peopl are stress and they are fed up of queue and skip in their timet . thi incred amount of car move doe n't have posit effect of cours ! i think that pollut is the first consequ of the increas number of car . that- whi i would prefear a car reduct in the futur . at the same time i recogn the import in have your own vehicl , you can go wherev you want , with no barrier and constrict in timet , like for buss or train . anyway i think that there are sever way to avoid pollut without reduc the number of vehicl . first of all , i think that in the futur there will be dicov the exist of particular kind of fuel to prevent pollut , there are alreadi some of them in use . the second solut i would suggest , is the increment in electr vehicl busi . today there are some of them in use , but they are not so common mayb becaus they are too expens . ani way i think that if everybodi start to buy thi kind of vehicl , it price will be reduc . furthermor , pollut does't seem to be the onli consequ of increas in car , but there is also a lot of traffic , as i mension befor talk about my citi . traffic make a citi unliv ! first of all traffic ha an effect on a person well be i think , it 's stress , and then i think that it alway make you chang your program and your timet , that 's whi i think that in a futur peopl will chang vehicl anyway . for me , a solut to car increas could be the emprov of public vehicl > underground , train , buss everyday more effici and faster . in such a way the pollut will be reduc but at the same time there will be less traffic in return of your own well be .
