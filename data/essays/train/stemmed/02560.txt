i do agre , the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guid , becaus even if you know the place where you are travel , you still get veri good deal at travel fare , hotel discount and special admiss discount on event that are go in the citi where you are visit . and the tour guid will make sure the group will get the best of their trip and in my veri person opinion , is much safer to travel in group that alon , in case that ani thing happen you are not in your own . if you decid to travel alon you will probabl end up pay more for everyth and miss point of much interest , becaus one day you just may fill like stay on bed until late or go to bed earli , oh well , do you know what ? it depend where are you go and the purpos of your trip , if it is just to relax and unwind youself your best choic may be to take the trip alon or just without the tour guid , ani way , just to be abl to do wherev you fell like do at the moment and go just where you feel like go , that will be great , i do not think you will miss the tour guid . and as i mention befor , it depend the purpos of your trip and where are you go .
