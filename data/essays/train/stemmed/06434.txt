help our commun . i think it 's true that young peopl nowaday are n't will to help their rel and friend as much as they did decad ago . but i also think that thi is a phenomenon appear strongest in the ` develop western civilis ' . for us time chang rapidli , everyth grow faster , move faster , peopl travel a lot and the world itself becom ` smaller ' . i mean you have the chanc to studi in europ , work in china and buy a holiday cottag in mexico so i think our way of live tend to go into a more ` selfish ' way . famili and commun is a strong background that everyon need but i think it 's not the first thing you think about in our time if you start live on your own . you live on your own so you care about yourself first that 's our way of live i think . year or decad ago peopl settl down and found a famili , help their parent keep the busi and tradit aliv and so the connect to the peopl surround them wa more evid . but as mention , in my opinion , i think thi is more a cultur thing , peopl , especi younger peopl in a third world countri for exampl still have that close connect to their rel and communit as it 's necessari . they are more or less their parent ' life insur that you pay here from your own money , so i think that 's one more reason that peopl nowaday are more focus on themselv . all in all even me as one of those young person nowaday still feel that there 's enough time to help my commun . mayb it 's base on differ reason than year ago but i tri to help my peopl whenev it is necessari in all aspect of life and i also like to receiv support from my commun myself .
