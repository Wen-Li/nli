i do agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not devot enough time to help their commun . to be more clear , by young peopl i would mean peopl in the age group of 20-35 yr . as time are chang , peopl are get more and more involv with themselv , and the materialist pleasur of life . thi is especi true of the young gener , who valu money more than anyth . as a result , most of the attent of our youth is on earn money , and henc they are busi fulfil their aim . today 's world is veri competit and in thi struggl , young peopl often do not find the time to contribut to their commun . anoth reason for such a thing , is that commun are no longer close knit as they use to be . there is a lesser feel of belong to some particular commun , and there is the emerg of a global commun . more and more peopl travel to variou place , and henc it is difficult for them to associ with a particular commun . reason apart let state some exampl from our experi . one such exampl is the lack of particip of youth in voluntari organis , such as those for educ the poor peopl . it might be true that young peopl contribut money in such scheme , but we dont see too mani young peopl , actual go out there and teach . anoth exampl is the absenc of young leader in our govern . young peopl do not find such a career veri financi reward and henc abstain from activ particip in the function of a govern . so as time is progress , young peopl are get motiv to work more for themselv , than for their commun . i would not say that thi is true for all young peopl , but it would hold true in most case . such a drift away from commun respons is primarili motiv by the current lifestyl of the younger gener .
