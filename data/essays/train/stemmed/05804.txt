i do n't think young peopl enoy life than older peopl do . it seem to be so , becaus younger peopl are energ and spirit than elder peopl , and the rang of action they can do are wider than elder . that 's whi elder peopl say `` the yourth enjoy their lif than us . '' howev , i doubt young peopl is more enjoy their life than elder peopl ? the first reason is that the the yourth imposs to escap from com across the lot of ploblem . the ploblem are may be about friend , parent , futur , and oneself . they do n't know how to handl them . they have to think over about ploblem , and expeli difficult situt , and spend hardtim . and then , they finali find the way of solut by oneself . thi process need for grow to adult . and then , when they matur enough , they final know how to enjoy the life accutu . sometim , the yourth enjoy themselv mean ecap from uneasi . so it 's not real enjoy . just discours . and there is also money aspect . for exsampl , i love music veri much , and also desir to go the gig of the favorit artist . howev when i wa high school student , i never go the gig , just becaus id did n't have enough money . but after enter univers , i start to work as a ppirt time , and finali could go the gig . that wa wonder expelien . but still now , the time i could go the gig is limit . becaus the capit is shortag . my friend who is alreadi work as full-part time can go the gig whenev she want . so thai think elder peopl well know the solut way of difficult they encount by expeli and have well financ . so , they afford to enjoy their life than the yourth .
