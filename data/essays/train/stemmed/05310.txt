there are a lot of advertis in societi , and i often see them . i like see them , so i agre with the follw statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i have some reason . first of all , it is often possibl for most advertis to make product seem much better than they realli are becaus they often have a lot of coment and pictur . for exampl , a lot of advertis have mani user 's coment , and they also have a lot of pictur . the a lot of coment and pictur influenc on reader . if advertis ha nice coment and pictur , the good is bought by a lot of peopl . second , the advertis have a lot of pictur and coment can make reader happi . for exampl , if you see advertis which do not have advertis , you mayb think the advertis is veri bore . but , most advertis have a lot of pictur and coment , so you can enjoy see the advertis . therefor , you feel that most advertis is veri good , even if the advertis is not better than they realli are . for these reason , i think that i disagre with the follow statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
