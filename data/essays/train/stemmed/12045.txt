in market , the tool that are use to convinc the costum to by the product are variou . some of these tool , like sampl , are honest , and give a true idea about the product , while other tool , like advertis , may sometim give a fals imag about the product , and we find that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , which is logic becaus the mission of such advertis is to make the consum prefer thi product to other competitor . advertis is an art , but i cnsider it a littl far from honesti . so , in ani advertis , the conclus is that thi product is the best among it all other competitor , which ca n't be true for more than one product . thi appli especi when the product is a servic , like a compani that advertis for a one-week trip , with all it detail , the custom see the adv . and decid to believ it , so he take the trip with thi compani , then he discov that everyth which wa describ in their brochur is just so away to be fact , and they plan the trip just to be with the least cost `` for them '' . the problem that within the adv. , they includ some phrase or condit that protect them legal . i believ that most of the peopl realiz the fact of advertis now , and to be fair there are certain product that are beyond ani adv. , and peopl know these produt , in which case they do n't need to be advertis , but with other product and advertis , peopl must be care and catiou so that they do n't get deciev by advertis .
