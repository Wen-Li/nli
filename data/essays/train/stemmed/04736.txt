i agre with thi statement or at leat i hope it will becom true sinc there is a real environment need for re-organ of our commun mean . climat overh call for it . that said , thi wo n't be possibl without in-depth modif of how peopl consid their way of live . car are now veri success consum product for sever reason rang from comfort to social stand . first of all they are veri comfort for they can transport individu easili from one point to the other , avoid the inconveni of public transport ( like suffer the weather while wait , the noisi and narrow environ that is to be found in buse or train , etc. ) , bring you exactli where you have to be ( contrari to public transport that is onli present on main road ) and be immedi avail . the second reason is that they particip to one 's appear . in a period where appear are - sadli enough - worth more than money or gold for a lot of peopl , they are a veri ostens element of one 's ( self - ) identif to a social categori . lot of peopl put a great pride into their car and worship them more than what would be expect of them . i think there is a need for chang . and be a frequent car user doe n't inhibit all logic reason in me . the street becom overcrowd with car , get from one point to the other take more time than ever , pollut is becom so heavi that it endang our eco-system and our health . the solut will be found in public transport . more precis , in a densif of public transport rout , in an increas qualiti of public transport mean to offer more stabil , more silenc and to offer other servic , some of which can be of great use to profession ( think of the internet , for exampl ) and in a reduct of their cost . i think the train is a veri interest solut for long-dist transport ( think of the success of the tgv and eurostar ) while subway and tramway are better for short-dist . buse should be reserv for spot where there is no possibl to set up tramway rout . let 's not be too lazi and forget the bicycl . a quick look at amsterdam and belgian citi like ghent could be a good exampl of their util and of the fact that habit can be chang in favour of a healthier world .
