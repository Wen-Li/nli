the idea that young peopl nowaday do not devot enough time , and thu have becom less altrust toward their commun than befor , is a common mistak . thi idea come from a well known process which lead the format of sever other prejudic ( like , for exampl , the idea that home made product are alway better than industri one ) . thi phenomenon , which i would call ` the myth of old time ' , is base on the common percept that younger gener are much more egoist and greedi than older one . it is often thought , especi in age societi , like in our wealthi western nation , that younger peopl intrins lack valu , and for thi reason do not do enough for their commun . it is certainli true that there ha been an evolut toward societi more base on individu and it is also true that the time shedul of the peopl have start to be impressingli fill by mani activit . but thi doe not authomat lead to the statement that young peopl are egoist toward thier commun . first , thi increas individu and time shortag appli to all the age group in an equal manner , and second , nowaday commun have much less need which must be satisfi by the commit of young peopl . exampl of thi type are elderli healthcar , childcar , and a lot o small activ such as take water from the river , etc etc . therefor decreas need mean decreas need of time to devot . if one tri to honestli look at the evid , the data suggest that the commit toward volount organ ha grown steadili and strongli among young peopl in the last decad . nowaday , the work of young peopl for their commun , though certainli chang in it organ , look much more effect ( also due to technolog progress ) and genuin driven by the will of help other peopl than befor . there are thousand of junior volount group all across unit state wit thi fact . for these reason , i strongli disagre with the passag and i believ that nowaday young peopl devot quit a reason amount of time to help their commun .
