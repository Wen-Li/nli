it is a well-known tradit for student to dislik date . therefor , it seem that mayb they do n't like learn fact , which seem harder than `` just '' understand an idea or concept . inde , onc you have understood the idea of someth , theoric , it remain in your mind , wherea fact are easili forgotten . you can then re use the concept you have learn befor , onli becaus you understood how it work , whi it wa import , and so on . and , someth veri import for the student , if they do n't realli rememb the exact word their teacher use to explain the concept , they can made up someth of their own , which may still be accur . on the contrari , you can not do the same with fact . fact , as it is impli , are precis , occur in special situat , and were follow by special consequ . for exampl , you can explain to someon what is the concept of epicur 's philosophi , even if you do n't realli rememb all the aspect of it , eventu your explan may still be valuabl for the other person . it is more complic with fact ; inde , you can not imagin how henri 8th left the cathol church to creat the church of england , unless you know the fact , the date , the consequ , and so on . as far as i am concern , i think that fact are as import as concept or idea . fact are need to understand concept , and concept are need to forese fact ' consequ , for exampl . concept may sometim be too abstract for student , and the vocabulari gener use to explain a `` concept '' is not realli word that we use in everyday 's life , and it may be a problem for some student . here , fact can help the teacher ( or the person explain ) make the idea clearer for the other . to conclud , i would say that there is a veri close relationship between understand idea and learn fact ; none is more import than the other , and when you are sutdi , you need to do both to succeed .
