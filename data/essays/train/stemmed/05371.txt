i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becaus in my opinion if you want to pass other peopl in a specif subject you must be the best in that subject and it is not import to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . foe exempl if you are a lawer it is not import to know everyth abaut law but the most import thing is you chose a part of law ( for exempl civil law ) so that you can have a veri good knowledg of thi part of law . at the contrari you have a bad knowledg af all law . nowday the specif knowledg is requirest for job in fact after you gradu trere are ather specif lesson to imprv in particular subject .
