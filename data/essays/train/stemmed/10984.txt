i agre with the opinion that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . some peopl reccomend to know the fact , but i think tstudent should understand them first becaus of the improt of know the basic inform , the possibl to misunderstand the fact without basic knowledg , and get abil to think about caus and effect . first of all , student usual lean from teacher with textbook becaus textbook have the import inform for studnet . i understand that know fact is also somehow use for student and they can learn other thing which are not indic in textbook . howev , it is more signific for student to learn subject from basic . secondli , i do n't think student can understand the fact without basic knowledg . not all fact have regular environ or situat like indic of textbook , so student may misunderstand the fact which is irregular . howev , if student learn basic knowledg first , they could recogn what is regular fact and irregular fact . some fact requir peopl to learn advenc knowledg to understand them , so it is more critic for student to studi idea and concept first . final , if student know the idea and concept , they could think the caus and the effect of fact when they face the fact which they have not learn previous . moreov , just know fact is not use for them becaus fact are not alway normal . student can not recogn fact accur without the basic idea and concept . thu , i would like student to learn basic knowledg to understand fact . in conclus , i believ that student should understand idea and concept first befor learn fact . not onli student but also adult can not understand fact without basic knowledg . if they do not have them , they would misunderstand the fact . thi is not good for student . therefor i strongli reccomend student to studi the basic idea and concept to recogn fact .
