young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl becaus they don t have health problem as mani as old peopl do . while we are get old we loos most of our abil like ; hear , see far or close object , if we are unlucki , walk and mani like these . most of the old peopl that we know take medicin in order to regul the ordinari and normal bodi condit for exampl ; my grandmoth take pill in order to regul her heart beat and grandfath of mine take medic to avoid hi blood presur increas abnormali . i hear their complain about these problem everi singl day . most of the time , i think the onli thing that can be spoken to an old person is heath problem or medicin . after get retir , see their children weed , have decreas on the abil that they use to have , the thing they expect from their own life becom just die in peac , and i think thi is the most signific idea of mani old peopl . i witnees it from my grandpar and their friend who are over 60 year old . on the other hand , i also know a lot of young peopl who ha no health problem and who are veri happi with their live . enjoy the life despit some other problem which old peopl don t have after their retir as ; earn money , afford a good life , hard work condit , is still possibl for them becaus they don t have to worri abour their health . most of the young friend i know care about their live in order not to be like their parent , complain all the time about doctor or the que at the hospit . they go to sport center , take long holiday , travel to other countri , go to picnic , tri differ type of sport , becom a member of a club . .. so they also consid that not onli be young , but also stay healthi is necessari . in my opion , young peopl who know how to enjoy life and keep their health as long as possibl , accomplish to enjoy life more than unhealthi old peopl do .
