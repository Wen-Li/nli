if i travel in a group , i will enjoy the travel a lot becaus the tour guid know mani good place to see . howev , i disagre with thi idea . in my opinion , plann the travel is also enjoy thing in the travel . if i travel in a group , i will not search about the place where i am go and the memori will not last nor vivid . if there is no one who help me with plan , i search detail about the countri and the experi will be help even in other situat . when i travel in okinawa with my friend , we plan our schedul by our selv . we hire a taxi and went to mani place such as a glass-mak shop . to tell the truth , the plan wa not perfect . we had no time to go everywher we plan , and final we got lost and we had to ask help to the peopl in okinawa . that wa not enjoy memori , but through the experi , i felt the kind of peopl in okinawa and wa touch becaus they were so friendli . of cors there are some possibl of danger . we could get lost in the place we are travel , like me -- i wa lucki though , especi in foreign countri that is a big problem . if there is a guid , we are relief when need some help in our emerginci . howev , if we are with other travel peopl , we will not be abl to feel the real cultur in the place . we might be friend with other travel peopl if we go in a group , but we will never make friend who live in the countri . thu , i prefer to travel by myself or onli with my friend . from search the place to make plan , includ get lost , everyth is the preciou memori .
