i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than tere are today . today the employ , manag men or more gener the worker go to the offic by the car . the road , day after day , are full of the car . less person take , the bu or the train to go at offic or stabliment . besid in these year famili go on holiday in week/end , and so everi week they prefer to take the car for to reach the holiday citi that they take bu , train . .. besid the modern peopl is less activ that the past peopl . in the past the peopl go to the offic or stabliment walk for three or four mile , instaend today the boy take the car for to accross the street !! anoth reason becaus it is imposs that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today is the price that the car sell to public . in the past the price of the car is more expens than today , and so less person can to buy the car . today the boy of 19/20 year old buy the car , becaus the price of the car must share in sever part distribuit on plu year and so the young boy can buy the car .
