when i wa studi in school , i also felt that `` whi we have to learn junk subject '' . howev , i realli agre about the mani academ subject are good for knowledg , becaus it provid lot of opportun , i mean it 's good for futur . in my life , when i wa second grade in middl school , a teacher gave a homework to us which wa find your talant . after school , i tri to think what am i good at or what do i like . howev , i could n't , becaus i could n't find my talant . howev , after highschool final , i found my talant . my talant is a law . when i wa first grade in highschool , i had a friend who call che-jea-heong . he wa veri special friend . he alway tri to think strang way . first , i did n't want to talk with him , but when we talk about the talant , we becam a friend . actual , hi father is polic . and hi famili is veri poor . so , first we start to talk hi father , whi he is poor . after that we start to think law . then we found our talant . actual , thi i found thi talant from the school project . when i wa 3grade in middl school , i had a class which wa korean languag class , but at that class , we had a special studi which wa law . becaus , my teacher thought law is good for stundent . so we tri to studi the law just one period with a game . howev , my friend are realli bore about thi , but me i wa realli enjoy that law class . so after that period , i said to the teacher that studi more law , but she could n't , becaus lot of peopl did n't like that . anyway , i realli like the law , also i 'll go to the law univers . from thi reason , i can think mani way to find my talant from the school subject . i can think math , scienc , music or art . so we can includ our opportun . now day , mani student can not understand the school about the acadm subject that whi they have to learn too much subject , i wa too , but now i agre from the school . and i realli thank from the school .
