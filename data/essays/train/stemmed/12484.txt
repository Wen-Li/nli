take risk and tri new thing is an import abil in mani job nowaday . if peopl had not taken a certain risk , mani busi idea would never have come on the market for exampl . thu a risk often bear an opportun . on the other hand , new busi might also fail and leav their owner highli indebt , which mean a sudden crash into poverti that often ha effect on a person 's self-esteem . in that way risk bear both opportun and the possibl to destroy everyth that ha alreadi been achiev . the question is , howev , if peopl who do not take ani risk are in total more , less or equal success as those who do . i guess that the onli job where flee respons and not take certain risk doe not limit career option is as a state employe , for exampl as a teacher in germani . when peopl can not be fire , they actual do not have much of a risk in their job . still , i have made the experi that teacher who tri someth new are often prefer by student . so tri somth new is a good thing even in their job . i consid it to be veri import to tri new thing anyway , and as in the exampl of the teacher , not everyth new bear a risk . in ani other case , i suppos it is import to make a decis by compar the size of the risk and the benefit it might have . a high risk for a littl success is in my opinion not worth strive for . if it is the other way round , howev : whi not ? becaus conclud i think : those who do take risk and tri new thing realli are more success .
