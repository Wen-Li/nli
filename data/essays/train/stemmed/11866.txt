as in all area , there are mani disagr on educ approach . regard teach method , some believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . both teach method are highli use in all over the world , but when it come to my teach method , i am a clear defend that it is far more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn plain and simpl fact . it dose n't requir ani type of creativ for a student to understand a fact . fact are fact . fact can not be develop nor chang . on the other hand , idea and concept requir creativ and develop . by teach student to understand an idea , you are teach him the whi and how of the fact . you are foster the student to think about it , anal it and reach hi own conclus - a conclus that with time , will develop in take the exampl of a teacher who is tri to teach hi student not to swear at other peopl . if he would tell him not to swear beacaus swear is against the kinder-garden rule and it sound bad ( which are fact ) , the kid is most like to stop swear becaus those are the rule , he wa told not to , not beacaus he ha understood the concept of moral , or becaus he regret hurt peopl . if we teach him the idea , the concept about swear and all it consequens ( which are such and such ) , the kid can truli understand whi not to swear . by teach our student the idea and the concept behind the fact that control our live , we are encourag our student to becom flexibl , anal and have a mind of their own . we are forster student who do not onli know the fact , but also know the whi and the how of fact . david zuniga leyton
