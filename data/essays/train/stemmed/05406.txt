have you been ani other countri ? i have been europ and america , now i am in the america . some peopl said the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour suid , but i disagre with it . first reason we have to go with other peopl who i do not like . thi is big deal , such as when i went to the europ , the guy who veri old , bring a denjang which is smell bad , and he eat thi in the restor when the bread came out . the other nativ peopl cover their nose with their hand , and i feel bad becaus they will think the korean is bad . anoth reason that is the other peopl can feel bad about us . forexampl , if the group is big , we can make a big noisi , and the other peopl can make their feel bad . supos you are in the hunni moon , and you went to somewher veri specal . howev the big group of peopl come and make a noisi . what you go to do ? i know the answer . you will get med of them . last reason that we can make differ think with guid . forexampl , when i wa 5th grade , i went to the pari , franc in europ , at night , and we want to go to the epal tower becuas the light would be beauti . how ever the guid do not want to becaus she wa tird , so we say to bu driver . the bu driver wa veri nice , so we went to the epal tower . after we went there , she wa so med , and the adult fight for pay with guid . in conculus , the travel in a group led by a tour guid is veri bad way to travel . if i travel just with my friend and no tour guid , than i will feel happi than that way .
