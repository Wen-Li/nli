alway it help to learn and understand idea and concept than to learn fact . i agre with thi statement , becaus idea and concept form the basic build block of ani subject . learn i dea and concept lot of expertis what do we need in ani particular field , for exampl , if we consid a child tri learn how to ride byscl . in thi process if we taught him the key idea and concept of ride a byscl , which are fristli blanc ofbyscl in order not fell from byscl on to ground . secondli about how to move the byscl forward , which is done by paddl the byscl in a cyclic maner . if the child coher doe the paddl and balanc of byscl , he may ride the byscl with out anybodi help . the child may drive a motro bike with littl help from hi friend or parent he know the basic of ride a byscl . if we consid idea and concept for student carrier , they are also import in thire life . for exampl , if student dont understand the key idea and concept from hi class work it difficult for him to write the end exam as wel as to particxip ani type of quiz conduct on the basi of the concept and idea . if a student is best at understand idea and concept in a subject , he will be get good grade in hi examin . on the other hand if he undersatnd onli fact which are asscoci with that subject , consequ rout to a end which is quit danger for hi carrier . but in some case fact are more import than that of idea and concept in order to live a pleascent life . so accord to me i whish to learn idea and concept asscoci with ani sort of subject . which will lead to a better understand of the subject . so i prefer learn idea rather than know fact .
