in my opinion the statement is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . to confirm my opinion i will give sever exampl . for exampl if you think of a product fill in bag like soup and then of a commerci in televis . the soup look colorful and it seem that mani thing are in it . but if you will buy it and cook it on your own at home there are not as much noodl in it as the commerci want to make peopl believ . thi happen on an special purpos . advertis are made to sell someth to peopl . peopl who make advertis are special train to know what peopl want to have , so they will onli show us the thing we want to see . in my exampl thi are more noodl in the soup then there actual are . anoth exampl is advertis for underwear on larg poster everywher outsid . on these poster you can see beautiful men and women , and the underwear fit them perfectli . the invent of such advertis did thi perfect thing to make peopl think that they can look like these peopl too if they will buy the product . so it is all about what buyer want to see and feel when they look at advertis . the maker of advertis mostli pretend to have the best and perfect product and to convinc buyer to believ so too , they exager in demonstr good item as perfect item . no one want to spend hi or her money on thing that are not worth it , but they also have to believ in advertis .
