i believ that , it is never good to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . you alway get the best when you special in one specif subject . specializt in one particular subject that help you build your career will not onli bring interest dure the studi but will also give you the satisfact when work through it . first let me state that gener all the subject are vast , and studi these vast subject in which a person is not interest may lead to improp knowledg about the subject . as an old say say say `` half knowledg is alway danger '' , it would turn danger . furthurmor no person could cover all the thing in all the subject in a given academ time . practic , a doctor ha to go through those subject that are total differ from what a biologist go through . a doctor ha 5 year of academ time to studi and master all the thing about the human bodi and a biologist ha around 3-4 year to studi about all the anim . now if a person think to have a broad knowledg and know all the subject in thi 5 year , is it possibl for the person to master either of these ? he would neither becom a perfect doctor nor a good biologist . in gener keep academ time asid , interest of person matter a lot . he must be focus on what he is interest . most of the peopl they will not be interest in all the suject , say , i never like math and program , i alway like biolog , now will a person like me , will he be interest in learn all the other suject effect say math ? he will concentr on onli those subject that yield him benefit , it like when a person goe furthur in hi career would the other subject realli help him ? it mere wast of time , if thi time is utlil for improv hi knowledg in the field he is interest , thi would help him better for hi career , and in career job satisfact is alway much more import than ani other thing . let us consid a biotechnologist , hi work is discov new vaccin , relat patholog etc. , if he would have learn law dure hi academ would that thing realli help him in ani way ? there are other peopl who can do that job effici than thi person who is not at all interest in doin that job . so for thi reason too i say that have profici in a particular subject is alway better than wast time in learn all the unnecessari stuff and have a broad knowledg of the academ subject . final , the implic in the passag would state clearli that , it is not import for a person to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , but it realli veri good for a person to gain profieci in one particular subject that help him inbuild hi career and do better in hi job , in all requir aspect . it alway good be a master instead of call ourselv `` the jack of all trade but master of none '' .
