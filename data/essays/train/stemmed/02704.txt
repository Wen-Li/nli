in my opinion , young peopl today do not dedic enough time to help their commun . there are a few reason for thi , which have come about as a result of the chang in societi and the outlook that these young peopl have ! most reason centr around the issu of time that is avail to perform such activ , while there are some that pertain to the psycholog outlook of the person . today 's youth are too caught up in simpli achiev thing for their selfish need . a strong assert , no doubt , but parent pressur , peer pressur and henc the need to deliv result in an ever-so widenen world with larg number of competitor put a strain on the individu . he/sh is simpli left with no time to cope with mundan thing , leav alon the commun he/sh live in ! addit , live lead by some of the youth today are too fast pace for them to be worri about the commun they resid in . ani free time avail at their dispos will go to satisfi their person need . the commun , unfortun , thu rank veri low in term of prioriti ! a person exampl can help throw some light in thi matter ; be a full time student leav me veri littl time to allow myself to indulg in my music , which is a favourit hobbi . whi would i spend it unselfishli on the commun ? thi leav us with the system of educ in the scheme of public servic . a good , if not decent , educ would inculc certain valu that would result in the develpo of a complet individu , who is part of , and thu see himself/herself to be respons for the commun they live in . thi doe not seem to happen as effect as it is expect to be . mani student go through their school and ultim entir live blind to the help that their commun are cri out for ! is it not the fundament responsibilti of these school to ensur that the youth be made awar and proactiv in thi regard ? ! to conclud , i would like to say that an awar of the advantag a person who help hi commun ha over a person who doe n't engag in such activ , need to be brought , not mention certain chang in their hectic work schedul as well !!
