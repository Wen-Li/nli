i think there is no miracl solut to be success but we can do the best to achiev thi object . i am total agre with peopl who said that you must take mani risk to plan a success career . for exampl , if you want to open a restaur , you must risk a part of your own money to have suffici fund to buy all a restaur need . if you do n't want to take thi risk , you 'll never open your restaur . but onli take risk will not guarante a success career , i think you must be innov to achiev thi object . by do onli what you can do , you 'll never progress becaus you do n't tri to experi a new type of work and i think success peopl are in constant progress to be the most competit in their field of activ . and if they fail in a project , they can chang total their activ becaus they more adapt . so experi new thing is veri use to have success becaus the world is chang everi day and it will not adapt to you , you will adapt to it . imagin a groceri which onli sell appl . if appl disapear on the earth ' surfac , he ha two solut . he can stop thi activ or he can sell other product . that 's the reason you must adapt what you do
