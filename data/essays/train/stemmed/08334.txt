i believ that it is much more import for student to understand idea and conceot than just to memor fact . through my life experi i realiz that understand the idea of a fact and the reason whi thi fact is availab to us is veri import . i did n't come to realiz the import of understand fact befor learn them until i wa in high school . back then , i face a lot of troubl tri to memor the requir for the test . i especi face troubl in biolog , where i spent hour and hour memor the step of `` photosenthisi '' . and when i final gave up and ask my friend for help , he gave me the most import tip . he told me that unless i understand whi the step is take place i wouldnt be abl to memor all of the step of the process . he also said that understand the `` idea '' behind the step will help me in memor their order . take for exampl take in miner from the soil , these miner have to be present befor take in light from the sun for the burn to occur . so , offcours talk in sunlight come after talk in miner and befor burn . i rememb memor the step and in their right order in less than 10 minut , offcours after understand each and everi on of them . so , person i alwayz make sure that i understand idea and concept befor attempt to learn them as simpl fact . i believ that all student should go by thi rule of `` understand befor memor '' .
