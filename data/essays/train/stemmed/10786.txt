ye , it is correct to say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn them . if a student learn a fact or a text then it wo n't last longer in hi mind wherea if a student understand a fact through exampl and reason then the fact would last longer in hi mind becaus thing done practic ha a greater impact then thing done theorit . for exampl , if a chemistri book a procedur for make a soap is given then a student learn how to make a soap effici . he would rather come to know the procedur to make a soap if he learn the process . but on oter hand if a student make a soap practic then he would not need to learn the procedur . it just the understand power of a person which work throughout hi life , not the learn power . let take an anoth exampl : if a student is be prepar for the interview for get a scholarship and the teacher are prepar him for the interview by simpli give him the list of question , which is expect to be ask from the student , with answer and the student memoris the answer to each and everi question . incas the student select commite for the scholarship ask the student a question which is out of that list or may be from the list but with the differ text , then a student wo n't be abl to answer the question . wherea , if the student had undestood the question and the manner how to answer the question then it would n't had creat ani problem for thi student to answer . student life is the base of the whole life and if we are misguid at thi point of life then it would sure creat problem in futur . learn a concept wo n't help a student to perform better . if we take math as subject then the student with the habit of learn wo n't be abl to crack the question in math as the subject need the understand power of the student to understand the concept . therefor in my opinion , a student should alway understand the concept rather than learn them .
