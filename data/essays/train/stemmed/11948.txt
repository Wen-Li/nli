young peopl are more energet and they might therefor appear to enjoy life more than older peopl . howev , in my opinion , happi and enjoy are close relat to a human be 's state of mind , no matter what the biolog age of that person is . therefor , i do not agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . one can reason that young peopl have lesser respons and therefor more reason to enjoy life . again , thi might not alway be the case . i would like to give the exampl my friend who wa financi support hi famili when we were still in school . he had taken on responsibilit earli in life , howev , that did not keep him from enjoy it . he seem to be the happiest person in my class . i think hi happ had to do with how satisfi he wa with life . on the other hand some older peopl do not loos their sens of adventur . they keep their bodi fit through exercis and use their strength to travel and enjoy the vacat they could not afford when they were younger , due to time or money constraint . some older peopl enjoy hobbi they otherwis never had time for . i know of a gentleman who start write poetri after he retir from work . hi poem were greatli appreci and he soon publish a book . at the same time there are young peopl who get disilluson and resort to self destruct or illeagl act in the pursuit of enjoy . in conclus , it doe not matter what the age of the person is . if a person ha a healthi state of mind , he / she will alway manag to enjoy , no matter what hi / her age .
