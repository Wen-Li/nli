in respons to the statement given sideway , i express my approv for it . young peopl nowaday seem to be more interest and involv in their own life and problem than the commun as a whole . the present day world ha undergon a dramat chang than it use to be , say a gener ago . it ha becom much more competit and demand . the advent of globalis ha led to drastic repercuss . in today 's world onli the best can surviv . recent an articl wa there in newspap on globalis . it wa state there that globalis is produc rich countri with poor peopl not onli in develop countri but also in develop countri like the unit state . the fruit of globalis are mainli distribut among the rich and the highli skill person . unskil and less skill labor are no longer the recipi of these fruit . thi put an immens pressur on young peopl to achiev great skill in whatev art they are pursu . they could not devot enough time for other caus , like ani work relat to the uplift of their commun . for them their own surviv is the key issu . they want to be a part of the ongo globalis . moreov , they do not find ani potenti benefit in lend a help hand to their commun . all they can think of is their own well-b . whether they are get ani output by do so , is what the young peopl 's think is . in short , the world ha becom much more materialist . also young peopl lack the sens of respons which prevent them in help their commun . they think that just by be a part of a commun and follow it rule and regul is suffici . they have forgotten the fact that with right come duti . so , i would onc again like to support the statement that young peopl are not give enough time in help their commun .
