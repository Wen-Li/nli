student should learn fact more than understnad idea and concept . there are two reason for thi : effect and useful . it is much effect lean thing with fact becaus you can pictur the idea instead of ponder them for a long time . the physic class is the most typic exampl for thi . it is not easi to underestand the graviti and speed on earth by lean formul such as e = m3 . howev , nobodi would doubt the fact when the train stop there is a resistac of the speed . moreov , fact enabl us to pictur the idea . we know that how atomicbomb are deadli neag for human-b and it should not be util ever again . but the idea itself is not as strong as an experi which we can still see through film and visit hiroshima and ngasaki in japan where atom bomb were thrown . it is a direct effect to re-experi thing visual and sensit . fact are more useful on our daili live rather than ideal concept . the concept of econom theori doe not repres the societi but the currenc rate are more famili to us and inevit affect our live . when we travel to other countri , we care larg about the currenc rate where we go on a trip . the strength of money affect the strength of the purchas dure the trip . thu , it is useful to studi how the world monetari system is work . therefor , i support that it is better to learn fact befor understand idea and concept . the fact give us more direct knowlg . it also massiv affect our daili live .
