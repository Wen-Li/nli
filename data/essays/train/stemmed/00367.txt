travel should be fun and variabl experi in my life . in order to satisfi with travel , i disagre with the statement . first , if i have to travel with a tour guid , i have to be control by the itnerari that is made by the travel agenc . for exampl , i have to keep move on follow by a tour guid although i would rather to stay in a museum . it is better to make my own schedul to see everh i want base on my own list . second , if i cam explor by myself , it is bigger chanc to get some unexpect experi such as see famou peopl there , or get paticular food in the area . explor or challeng to do someth in oversea or even outsid of town is a part of fun . i like do some special activ if i have a chanc . basic , those activ are not provid by the tour agenc . to excut thi plan , i need to ask peopl who live there , and i need to tri it . think about these plan make me excit , i will do that activ for sure if i have a chanc , i like challeng third , travel need money . in order to spend money efficieni , it is good to travel without a tour guid . if i am with a tour guid , i might need to pay for somth which i am not will to spend . inst of use money for that a tour gide suggest , i can use money for other thing such as make anoth trip from the area . to sum up , to travel without a tour guid is good for save time and money , also , to enjoy some rare experi . in order to make the trip better , it is better to traval by my own plan without a tour guid .
