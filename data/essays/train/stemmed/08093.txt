i agre thi statement . although i admit it is import that product ha real qualiti , there are sever reason that i think advertis make product more valuabl and it is quit import . first of all advertis give peopl to know about the product easili and convienetli . everyday we can meet lot of product ad by newspap , and tv even internet . that give peopl more beliv it is good product . for exampl , one of american wine ad give peopl beliv that wine made from amercia is veri good compar with made in franc or chile . they ad by produc process and tast with some celebr and chang the common belief that american wine is low qualiti second , the advertis repres the product 's imag . so sometim peopl buy the product becaus of their imag . for my person experi , i like basketbal so much in junior high school . i alway play with my classmat but i am not tall it 's veri hard to jump up to catch the balll . i am veri deprss . howev i watch the ad unexpectdli and it chang my life . it 's air jordan shoe produc by nike . he jump up so highli just like frog . after watch the ad i buy the jirdan shoe and i am veri confid at jump and i can play well and i repres my junior school basketbal team . of cours jordan shoe is just one of the shoe but ad give consum it is more better than what it ha and believ it is best shoe , in conclus i firmli beliv that ad make product seem much better becaus it 's purpos is to sell the product . and nowaday peopl is veri busi all day they are mostli depend on ad to buy the product .
