i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the logic of advertis is basic to sell more product and to make more money as a consequ of the the advertis . advertis is a way for the compani to show their product to a larg number of consum . they are the must of a modern life . in a modern life the demand of the peopl increas as the world chang . the demand can be of new tool , machin , car , hous and ani other thing that you can imagin . as the peopl need more of these the produc and compani make new tool and machin and idea to attract peopl 's attent . in a growig world you do n't have the opportun to reach everi peopl unless you do not advertis your product or idea . to appeal more and more peopl an advertis must show all the good side of the thing and should not mention about the bad side of it . i am sure that you are familiar with the situat such that peopl come into a problem with anyth he or she can buy by just believ in the advertis . cellular phone are a good exampl , i had friend who chose their cellular phone accord to the great adverts done about that item , but most of them were not happi with the product they bought . as i mention befor , the logic of the advertis is sell more and make more money as a consequ . as long as the reason is make more money , the compani will not interest in the consum 's approv for the short term . they will tri to sell more and to do thi they will need advertis that are lack the disadvantag or bad featur of their product . and in thi advertis , again for the same reason they will exager the even the basic featur of that product .
