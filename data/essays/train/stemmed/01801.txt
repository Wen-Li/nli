today , mani student are forc to perform a lot of role . they have to both studi hard and help commun . but they have enough time to perform variou role . it can be explain to two reason . i will explain it in detail . first , although , they want to particip in commun like activ help orphanag or the poor , their parent doe n't like it . they think that their children have to studi more for surviv competit . they give a good circumst to studi for their children . and they alway said that studi is most import . for thi reason , student studi harder in their school and their academ institut . let me take my friend as an exampl . hi initi dream wa a counselor for poor person . he interest in book and class such as counsel for commun . but their parent disagre hi idea . they alway argu becaus of thi problem . after all , he had to give up hi dream . and he made up decis teacher their parent want . secondli , the societi doe n't ask for these oppourtun . student are like to think that time to help communiti doe not neccessari . instead of thi time , they ask for them more high grade in their school and some qualif such as toeic or toefl grade . for them , commun exercis is not their interes requir . dure school period , student often worri about their grade and evalu from their teacher or professor . in order to give a good grade , they have too much effort . howev , no one worri about their commun . in conclus , from these two reason , young peopl do not give enought time to help their commun . they may want to experi thi time to help other peopl . so , for solv a problem , both household and work place help young peopl .
