i have to admit that thi statement is realli true in these set of materi nowaday . advertis play realli big role market . all sell plan set accord to adverties . in adverties they can show product better in mani way . first of all they show product with it 's most beatiful look . they play the imag with comput becaus nowaday the tecnolog are realli develop to do these kind of arrang so they use it . and also they show the product veri practic even it is not . they show you use of the product as easi as a toy and when you see them you believ that and so you buy it but the fact that sometim you ca n't even combin the part of the product or if thi product is a food they eat it like they never eat anyh like it befor so you wanna tast that but again the fact not chang and you will be disappoint in the end . secondli they make some word trick and play with the word even they can mislead you about that product or that product 's apportun . also you onli see the good part of product in the advertis . the bad part never mention and limit or some bad way about product alway shown at the bottom with realli thini letter . so you never read that thini letter but by the time you are be mislead about apportun or sale etc . the last and most import mind game is the slogan of the product , the sell sentenc or word or word group which relat with the product . if they make a good jingl or song or warn in advertis it stuck on your mind becaus you listen that on and on and on . so you rememb that all the time so when you see product you rememb advertis and you wanna tri it . as a conclus advertis affect all the sell of the product and we know that not all the product are good and on to that if we still tri these product it 's all becaus of these advertis . on the other hand the product not alway bad as i mention but no matter what the advertis alway show it better than itself .
