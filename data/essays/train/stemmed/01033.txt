probabl in twenti year there will be fewer car than there are today and thi will be due to differ reason . in fact there are alreadi mani problem for the traffic end for pollut air and it ' s easi that it will be someth to resolv thi problem . there will be mani more pubblic way to go aroun than today . modern car need petrol wich is not an infinit sourc and it 's easi to think that there will be differ kind of work so that peopl will not need a car as much as today . first a modern problem are the polut air and the traffic , wich is too caotic . so it ' s easi to think that scientist are tri to resolv these problem . a possibl solut is to make someth to have car that will not have such a bad effect to the air as it is today . but to resolv both the problem of traffic and air there will be mani more buse or train . in fact today there are so mani car around iven becaus there are not enough pubblic buse or train , so it 's necessari to have a car to go to work or to everi other place . then a big problem of car is that they need petrol to go on . but petrol is not an infinit sourc so in the futur there will be less petrol than the one necessari for the great number of car . it mean that petrol will cost too much till it will be too expans for mani peopl , that will decid to use other way to go around instead of car . in addit new tecnologhy are develop new kind of work , in fact mani peopl will work from their own hous use their comput and internet . so they will not need to go to work everi day like they usual do now , and they will not need to have mani car in each famili to go to work in differ place . so the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today will be better for the condit of the air and for ourselv too . and it will be easyer to go around spend less money than today
