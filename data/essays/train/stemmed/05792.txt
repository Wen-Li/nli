in my opinion you have to consid a lot of thing for when you are travel thi all differ thing will affect where you go and how you spend your time wherev you will go . in my opinion travel in a group led by a tour guid ha a lot of good and bad thing . the good thing are that you get to see museum to learn about a lot of stuff of the place you are visit it is also easier to travel with someon that know the place you are go and who can understand the languag of the place they are go . but you are also limit to the number of thing you can do or the number of place you can go if you were with no tour guid . on the other hand travel in a group with no tour guid ha mani posit and mani neg thing . some of the posit thing have to do with the night life you can go wherev you want at whatev time you want , you can chang plan whenev you want like if you plan to go to itali and in the last minut you decid you want to go to germani instead then you would just by a plane ticket that easi !!! some of the bad thing is that you could get lost or someth could happen to you and there wa nothign you could do if you didnt have someon who knew the place and spoke the same languag . in my opinon the best way to travel is with no tour guid becaus i like take risk and go to place by myself .
