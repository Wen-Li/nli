although a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can make a person veri interest , i realli consid that nowaday the promot of special is better for mani reason . firstli , if a person is focus in a particular subject he or she is go to feel veri motiv to improv hi or her knowledg , becaus it is hi or her elect and probabl he or she realli like that field . moreov , special is veri import when you are a job seeker , particullarli when you are look for your first job . there is not ani chanc for peopl know mani thing in a superfici view ; oit is easier to find a job if you are an expert in a particular field . i can concid that a broad knowledg is use sometim , for exampl when you have to manag a small compani with a short staff . but that is not usual the common case becaus most of the peopl work in medium or larg compani . thu , the proport of peopl work under the umbrella of gener think leader is quit higher than the number of leader itself . usual a gener knowledg is enough to fit properli your specif subject in the framework where it must be insert . we can consid also thi dilemma is the histori . if the modern societi have promot the broad knowledg more than the special one , it would have been imposs such a fantast develop . in summari , although a broad knowledg is necessari sometim , societi had better promot deeper knowledg in the challeng that we are face , and for that the special must be a prioriti .
