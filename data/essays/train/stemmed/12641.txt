i disagre with the statement becaus in my opinion thi fact will not realiz . becaus of the pollut , that exist in amount of quantiti yet , the governa will take misur of secur . the situat today is yet danger becaus the car in use are million and million i the world . even if there are better situat like in holland and in other northern countri the situat is dramat . in these countri , life is more natuar than in other countri like itali , becaus abit usual use bycicl to move . they prefer thi way to the car . in itali , for exampl , don-t exist thi attitud and thi educ for all or about all . but accord to me for the nearbi futur we , human , will arriv to the point that we will have to constrict to use public servic even if we don-t want or other servic will be invent to permit us to move without car . the essenti problem is not the car like object but is how and what it use to go , gasolin . with the mani war of today , thi element is anoth enorm problem , for exampl . yet thi is a problem . for these problem i think that governa will do law or other thing with the idea that today will not be the futur . in thi way car demand will be less than now but onli if the governa will know how to fight all problem to garante better servic than today . an idea will be the sostitut of gasolin with a materi less danger to the environ . thi can caus less pollut but we need resours for thi new gasolin . the fact are difficult for us , peopl who live in differ citi , what will be the better thing to do , especilli how will be our reaction at thi changement . i don-t know , but i hope in a posit
