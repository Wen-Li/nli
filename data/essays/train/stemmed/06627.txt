mani student believ that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i am afraid i completli disagre with thi statement becaus of sever reason that i will clearli explain . the first reason is becaus have knowledg of mani academ subject is help onli if you do not plan to work . think about it . if in the real societi , in the real word i mean , each individu wa not special and did not have a specif job , it would be a disast !!! for instanc , research would not have had so mani discoveri in all thi year . moreov , doctor must be special to take care of their pacient in the correct way !!! the second reason is becaus not special in someth doe not allow you to pursu a real carreer . for instanc , the fact that geniu did so much for us is a concequ of have special the subject that fit better to them . moreov , it doe not solv our problem be all awar of gener inform . we need expert to progress in all subject . furthermor , have a gift for a subject help you to trust yourself and to be proud of yourself when you succe in thi disciplin . you feel special and it help you also in your privat life . in addit , special in one specif subject help you to focu in someth that you like make you happi !! whi should i studi math if i do not want to ? whi should i do that ? if somebodi is not capabl to studi a subject becaus he realli doe not understand that whi shoud he be oblig to do that ? to sum up , i am convinc that individu must be free to do what they like and there is no reason to dni thi right .
