throughout the centuri there have been mani talk on what kind of educ would be best for student . is it more import to help student understand idea and concept of what they 're learn , or is it more import to help student learn the fact ? differ countri have come up with differ solut to these question , and as a person who studi under both type of educ system , i will say that i person believ it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . from my person experi of studi under the korean educ system for a year and from hear my peer ' first-hand experi , i say that korean educ is more concern on teach fact rather than idea and concept to student . student memor fact and statist , line after line , without even understand the mean of what they are learn . thi ha a harm effect in a long run becaus after examin is over , student will no longer rememb what they learn . on the contrast , if student come to understand idea and concept of what they are learn , the knowledg ha becom their own and will stay in them for long term . for instanc , when i wa littl , i hate scienc becaus i had to memor numer formula and fact that i did not understand . howev , under new american scienc teacher i began to thrive in scienc as he taught me the basic idea and concept of scienc . as i understood what i learn and digest it as my own , i came to appreci scienc more . in conclus , although both type of educaton is necessari and student need to understand and learn both ideas/concept and fact , i think it is more import for student to understand fact and concept first becaus it will be much easier to learn the fact after understand the concept .
