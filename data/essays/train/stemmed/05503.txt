recent day my parent often ask me , `` so , what do you want to studi in an univers ? '' whenev thi question stand in front of me , i ca n't even say a ward to answer it , but instead just stand there delig and deepli consid what i realli want to learn for endless time . in some of the univers , they do n't ask to choos major but they give an oppotun for student to take ani subject they want to . howev i do n't want belong to it . i person think that the know and special in one specif subject is much import becaus there are a lot of disadvantag of tri to have broad knowldeg of mani academ subject . firstli , it is imposs to put all knowledg in the world in peopl 's small brain in such a short amount of life that we have given . human 's histori is surprisingli long , and everi new fact and inform were found by peopl at that time . besid inform and knowledg are alway chang and increas as time pass by . as a result , the sum of those knowledg , which were found and will be found , are a lot and anybodi ca n't input them in the brain less than a decad we got . furthermor , there are a lot of peopl who ca n't get job that they expect and becom a unemploy . one of the reason of thi is becaus they have spread their view too wide and have n't focus on what they can realli good at . even though they have broad knowledg , but it 'll be useless when it come to realiti sinc when peopl are get job , they have to special what the specif job they work for . to conclud , i believ that specializign in one specif subject is considerab essenti for peopl 's life sinc know as much as they can on mani academ subject is imposs . nobodi is good at everi subject , howev it is true that everybodi ha certain subject that they can do better than other do .
