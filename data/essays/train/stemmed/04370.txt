in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do n't agre with thi statement becaus everyon want to have a car . in thi essay i will give some reason whi i have thi opinion . first of all and that 's in my opinion the main reason whi i think that in twenti year there will be more car than there are today , is that most of the peopl get richer , so they earn more money and they want to have a good reput and to look great , that 's whi most rich peopl want to have the newest and best look car at the moment . in addit to that the car are get cheaper with the time becaus the automobil industri produc more car . anoth reason is that the youth want to have car earlier so they get car often as a present . today the peopl do n't realli want to live anymor in the citi , so they move to the suburb and sometim it is n't possibl to reach other place without problem , then it is more practic to have veri earli a car to be more independ . in my opinion in few year the car will have such a high technic standard which is better for the environ than today and thi will be anoth import reason whi there will be more car in the futur than now . in conclus i disagre with the statement and with the reason i have list abov i support my opinion . peopl will earn more money not to have onli one car , but two or three . then a new technolog will appear in a few year , and will be a second reason whi car drive wo n't be wors for the environ anymor . the last reason will be that peopl will move from the citi to the suburb .
