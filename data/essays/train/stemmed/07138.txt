i must say that i total agre with the statement . as a student , i person find more importsnt and use to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . what is more , i think that the realli import thing is not onli to understand these idea and concept but also to studi , to examin and to see how an idea or a concept lead to anoth and , thu , how fact appear as a part of the process , not as isol thing that are record in our memori . understand idea and fact help student , and peopl in gener , to develop their logic and their analyt capac . for exampl , let ' s talk about the french revolut . to me , it is easier and more use to studi it not as an amount of date , fact , name , event , etc , but as a concluss of the social and polit situat of europ in the 18th centuri : one thing lead to anoth and , at the end , studi it can even be funni , as a film in your mind , better than a long and bore list of non-sens word . furthermor , i consid memori a bad friend : you trust in it and , when you most need it , it leav you alon , with no other help . when take and exam , for exampl . if in your mind there are onli fact , you can forget one and be unabl to continu with the answer . on the contrari , if you have all the understand process in your mind , mayb you won ' t be abl to give a concret date or a name , but you can explain the context or give other inform that can help you to avoid a total disast . to sum up , i think that understand idea and concept will help us more than learn fact by heart , not onli in our academ life but also in our everyday life .
