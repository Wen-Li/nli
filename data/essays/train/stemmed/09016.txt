i strongli disagre with thi statement , as i do not see whi it would be correct . it contain no arguement to support it claim . young peopl do give enough time to help their commun nowaday , as they alway have . i do not see the reason for elder to beliv in thi statement , or to view our youth in a critic manner . ye , the youth might be somewhat differ than the gener of peopl they grew up in , but it doe not need to be differ in a neg way . their critic mere demonstr their inabl to take respons or to adapt to recent event , which would bring about a differ in mental in the next gener . most probabl peopl make such a statement are not satisfi with their own contribut to their commun and will tri to eas their mind by make such a claim . often pension who have noth better to do , i.e. make no contribut to their commun , make such a claim . thi statement is in no way a construct statement , as it give no suggest of chang the circumstanc . therefor the person put forth thi statement is not help hi commun in do so . thi statement is so broad , that it is hard for me to think of ani specif exampl out of my head , but in gener , the young peopl are the peopl which drive a commun and contribut to it cultur by their motiv . thi claim is nonsens . it ha no arguement to support it and is terribl broad . the peopl who are support the commun and who are to a larg extent the commun , by be activ , are to a veri larg extent young peopl . thi statement is often the result of an elder , not be abl to adapt to recent chang in the world , and therefor not be abl to understand the youth .
