i do n't agre with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are some reason to dislik to be led by a tour guid while i am travel in a group . it is not agreeabl to my tast . first , our time is restrict by a tour guid . that 's mean that we ca n't go somewher freeli . at my cultur trip on my school event , we ca n't behav freeli becaus there is a guid . we have ecperi mani time . we ca n't behav freeli . it is hard for us to spend , becaus ew have to write report about the place , so we have to be led by a tour guid even we do n't like it . second , a tour guid sometim tell a lie . last week , i had a cultur trip in switzerland . i had prepar against report trip , but they are not accord between the explan of the document that i had prepar and the explan of a tour guid , so sometim i am confus , so it is troubl for me to write the report . final , i think that the best way to travel in a group is that to behav ownself . thi action is veri good for experienc somr thing in that place . thi thing is happi for enjoy at that place . to be led by a tour guid is not happi and aw . sometim the explan of a tour guid is unus and not interest , so mani peopl shoud travel by own . sometim we can learn someth that a tour guid doe n't know . wherev we go , what ever we find . there are someth who doe n't know , so when peopl travel , they should not ask a tour guid , it ca n't enjoy and becom bad trip , so we need to travel without a tour guid .
