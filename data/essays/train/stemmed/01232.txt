it is realli good to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , but special is someth that is probabl more use onc a person start work . thi doe n't mean that a wide knowledg of mani academ subject is n't an advantag for those who have it . when a person end hi high school or univers studi , he find out that employ of mani compani look for peopl with specif abil . for istanc it is not veri common for a person who graduat in geographi to work for an investi bank becaus he probabl doe n't know enough about the financi market and doe n't have as mani quantit tool as a mathematician or as a person who graduat in econom . of cours no econom graduat will easili find a job as a geographi reserch . in these specif case , which are certainli not the onli , it is probabl better to be special in a singl subject . howev , it is not veri hard to understand that , between those who special in just one specif subject , not everyon will be abl to have a succes career . when a compani chose a person to advanc in hi posit , it doe n't look onli at work abil ( which are suppos to be pretti good for everyon ) , but it also look for leadership abil . i think that a person that ha broad knowledg of mani academ subject will be most like to have thi characterist : thank to the mani thing he know , he can speak with mani differ peopl from the mani differ area of the compani which he work for . thi comun abil will make it easier for him to be a leader insid the compani . in conclus , i do n't realli agrr to the topic statement becaus i would n't be abl to chose between broad knowledg of mani academ subject and special knowledg : i would spend more time studi , so that i could have both .
