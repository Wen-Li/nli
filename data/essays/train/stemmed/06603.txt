i agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than a veri good knowledg on onli one subject . i think that if you got a broad knowledg , you will know what peopl mean when they talk about a topic you have hear about , even if you dont know much about it . you are not focus on your special subject tho whole time . you can free your mind , you are open for new thing . although the knowledg of onli one subject , your special subject , offer good abil for you , i prefer know less thing about mani subject . later you also got the chanc to becom a specialist in your subject , you can still sharp your skill , but at the bigin you should be readi and be prepar for thing who can happen to you . mayb you then go on with subject , you did n't know some year befor . for exampl , if you have got no job and you are look for one you have a big space to seach for it and you might can get a job which you did n't expect . if you are just a specialist in you subject , you might find faster a job , but onli about you main knowledg . it will be veri bore for you to do just the same thing your whole life . i think so , becaus thi is what happen to my father . he first sharp hi doctori skill , becaus he want to becom a doctor , but he also studi law . now he is a laywer . thi show me that you have to be prepar for abil you might get , but to do so you have to have a broad knowledg about mani subjectc , includ academ . thi is necessari to have a good and not bore job in the futur .
