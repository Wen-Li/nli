to answer thi question , we must care look at the advantag and desadvanteg of either a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or a broad knowledg in one specif subject . let 's look at the major advantag of broad knowledg of mani academ subject . if one ha a broad knowledg of differ academ subject one ha the power to draw connect between differ academ field which often lead to veri creativ solut for complex question . in a world that get more and more complex thi is a veri import skill . howev , broad knowledg ha also a big disadvantag : it is obviou , that the knowledg of everi singl academ subject ca n't be veri profound , becaus usual there is not enough time to get a broad and profound knowledg about mani academ subject . on the other side what 's the major advantag of have a special knowlegd in one specif subject ? if one ha a veri profound knowlegd of a specif academ subject one can concentr fulli on thi subject and tri to get more knowlegd about thi subject . one ha the possibl to push the scienc on thi subject forward . one can develop new model and solut on thi specif field . that would not be possibl , if one tri to get a broad knowledg over mani academ subject . the most import disadvantag in special in one specif subject is the lack of survey . there is a big danger that one get lost in look for a solut , that could have been found much easier by take a glanc of other academ subject . one stop to look over the boundari , which can be veri help - as point out at the begin . look at these advantag and inconvieni i am draw the follow conclus . becaus the world is get more and more complex it would not be intellig to just concetr on one of the two possibl . in my opinion it is absolut necessari that in academ field there is a good combin of peopl who have a broad knowledg of mani academ subjetc but also of peopl who special in one specif subject . that is the best way to encount the multiplen and complex question and problem of the futur .
