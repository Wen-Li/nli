i agre with it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus , when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalis by himself . when a student had understand certain concept student can develop more idea by himself . by understand it the student will abl to answer ani type of the question on that topic . for exampl let us consid that a student is studi on motor . the student need to understand the main idea and what are the concept that are relat to that topic . and how the motor work and mani more thing about the motor . but , less import should be given to learn fact . let us consid anoth exampl , let us consid one of the topic from the student subject . the student must know the what is the main idea and the concept of that particular topic rather than learn fact on that particular topic . when the student is focus to understand the idea and concept on a particular topic . when we aris ani doubet on that topic they will be abl to answer that doubt . now a day the gener is develop day by day . to sustain in thi compit world we must have to be more famil about the topic which are veri much import . to know such thing we have to understand the main idea of the subject or topic so , that we can face the present world . so i prefer it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than fact .
