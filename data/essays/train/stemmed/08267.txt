i agre to the statement `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . in the recent age due to technolog advanc mani are interest to make their own futur better . in a world of competit the youth is race toward the improv of their own skill and they are not bother about the sorround and their commun . i feel that `` serv peopl is serv god '' i feel if we spend atleast an hour of our daili life in serv the commun and if everyon do that , the nation will certainli achiev it plan and becom the lead of ani other in the world . `` today student are tomorrow 's citizen '' . if we serv our commun it is indirectli serv ourselv becaus we are lay the foundat of the futur part of our life . for exampl , take a student of age 20 . he must be have mani work , enjoy with hi friend , parti everi night and lot more . he can do a lot of work at thi age . and even if he spend a 1/10 th of hi time in enjoy to the commun develop that would be great of hi part . imagin the number of the youth . they must in lakh and each of them spend 1/10 th of hi time there can be lot and lot of work to be done . even by do all thi they may improv their own skill and in the other way develop the nation . the polit parti leader and other higher offici are alreadi exhaust and can do a veri littl work and they may mani problem regard their famili and mani more tension . but in the case of a student he ha no tension , no problem and he can gener mani more idea than the older one . he can work a lot more and can mani work like help other , provid the basic requir to the needless and organis some function to creat awar of the present world and how to tackl their own life in ani situat . in thi way they can do mani other thing which help the societi to move further . i have a concern that the youth may be busi with their own work . becaus i myself practic face the experi . even though i have some time to spend on other in help them . i do agre that everyon have some difficulti or someth other . but if he had an idea of offer himself to the commun he shall sure do that anytim . everyon is not awar of what the problem societi is face . we need to creat awar among them so that atleast 10 % of the youth would be use which would help the societi to develop further . i final conclud that the present youth is not show interest in such develop activ and there should be some programm in order to creat awar which may be help the societi itself develop to a higher level .
