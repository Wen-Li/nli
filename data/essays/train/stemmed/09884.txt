market is the main factor to make thi a rule . i personali think that product have to look better in the imag becaus the market competit you can found in the real world . i have found mani time my self with a product that is not event the half of good that i wa expect and thi is the result of advertis . under control cirumst the color , the textur even the result of the product are control by advertis whom are respons for the introduct of the product to the market . and you beliv it . some time product reali are what they announc and i think these are the expens one , not all the time but frecuent the more you pay the more you receiv . some brand give us the idea of qualiti and we buy that becaus qualiti is import . i do n't mean with thi that we have to pay extra money in order to get better item , some time a particular brand have `` more name '' than other and thi the onli reason that justify thi product to be more expes but not becaus is the better . we can find in the market a lot of differ brand and qualiti equip that can let us solv our need . it is in more of the case the power of adquisit ( the amount of money ) we have the one that rule our buy behaivor . you have more money , you can buy more expens thing , but not nessesarili the best . it is a game that we play veri often consid all the time the expes versu the qualiti , some time we just buy an item that bearli give solut to our need but we are not will to expend more money on it . so it is importat to put in a balanc what we are look for and tri not to be catch by the iluss of advertis becaus most of the time they are more atract that theri reali are .
