it is not easi to say which is the better approach , but i person do not agre with the statement , becaus i think that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is not as good as special in one specif subject . i say thi for two main reason . the first reason is that it is more practic for student . i mean , if you can concentr on one subject it will be easier for you to learn lot of thing on that subject and you will be abl to becom prepar . but when i say `` more practic '' i refer also to the fact that stude one subject instead of more than one is good for the student 's path . i mean , onc a student ha enter the subject he should know what that subject requir , what the import aspect are and he would be abl to organis hi studi in the best way . maintain your mind open to a lot of subject is a big effort . it is true that keep your mind open could be a good thing , give you a wide rang of knowledg , but the question is if thi knowledg will be use in your futur . thi question bring me to expos the second reason that support my opinion . i argu that specialis will be use for work . compani , or institut , usual do not hire peopl who have a generalist approach , that know a lot of thing , but that remain on the surfac of them . compani requir peopl to be expert in someth and to becom an expert you have to get into thing , to discov all the aspect , to prevent all the problem . as for my person experi i have to say that i 'm in a class with a veri generalist approach and i think it is not good . i 'm glad that i 've got a solid basic culur background , but i am sincer worri about my futur . you could ask me whi i am in such a class and the answer would be that i do not know . when i chose my class i thougth it wa more specialist , but i wa wrong , but i think to be lucki as well becaus i had the opportun to attend lot of interst cours and to meet lot of good professor .
