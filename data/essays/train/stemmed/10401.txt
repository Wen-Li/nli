i think that for student is more import to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . when studi , and in life in gener , it is import to comprehend rather than use the memori to repeat word or fact that eventu will not have sens in the near futur . fact are still import and should not be forgotten . still , the abil to understand idea and concept make it possibl to reason and discuss about topic and matter . we human are abl to make logic connect use our ( limit ) memori and few fact . we can understand the real mean of fact . and we can reason on what it is behind a fact , we can tell whi a fact ha happend . on the other hand , comput and the internet are in a certain sens `` stupid '' , but they can come to our help and support when we look for fact . with an internet access we can consult onlin sourc such as wikipedia and googl . these are some of the best tool for look for fact and these are the tool we should know how to use . to summar , for student , in my opinion , is more import to understand and reason on concept and idea rather than memor mechan fact , date and number . student will need to be abl to think and reason , comput will help to `` connect the dot '' .
