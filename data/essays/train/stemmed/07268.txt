i agre with thi statement becaus in my opinion a success peopl have more money to spend than normal peopl . they can tri what they want , and in their opinion anyth is forbbiden . they want to tri alway new experi , know new thing and sometim take risk . last week i have read to the newspap that a famou italian singer decid to spent a month in a unknow place ( probabili an island ) . he want to stay alon . none can go with him . he ha not a person phone becaus in thi place the phone do not work in thi way he can not commun . he want to stay in contact with the natur . for find food he can onli fish or hant . in my opinion it wa a veri danger experinc but i think that the onli reason that thi singer decid to go is to increas in success . if he doe not the econom possibl i am sure that he do not go . i think that is import to increas your knowledg , tri news thing but there are some limit that we must respect . it is good to do small thing but well than more thing not well . i think that a dream that the man have is to fli , but for natur condit it can not possibl .
