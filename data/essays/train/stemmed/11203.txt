first i would like to say that life doe not stop at acertian age , so i have to disagre with thi statment . but also i must say that there are someth that old peopl cant do anymor , never the less there are even more thing they still can do , as long as the person is suround by hi love one , have a good hobbi or still know how to life in the eye of hi children he 'll alway enjoy life . a young person could enjoy the thing that the old person had alreadi enjoy . for young peopl a need for explor , for go to place , for speed from time to time , for there heart beat faster and faster as they start to feel love in thier soul is a must . for old peopl they 've seen it all - or at least that what they 're say - they want the quit night , the earli sleep , the healthi food , and a vacat to an island that he alway dream of . for exampl a night of play pingo with your friend and wife , go fish with the child of your sun or go from time to time to your old work , all these thing would mean the joy for an old person . where a young man or girl would feel bore if he / she had to do ani of these thing everyweek , he would rather be in a parti or with hi girl , or play a hard game like footbal or basketbal , she would rather be in the mall get readi for the pram . and in the other hand the life of young peopl is not suitabl for old peopl , to parti everi time you could , to play and move all the time . so everi age ha it own style , it own magic , it own enjoy .
