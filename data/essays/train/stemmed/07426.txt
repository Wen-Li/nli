i agre with the topic that `` it is more import to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact '' . understand the idea and concept ultim lead to fact that is we need not learn the fact . understand idea and concept mean have an indepth knowledg about a topic . learn fact mean mug up the topic in a subject for some student . if student wont understand idea then they will be unabl to develop the logic and creativ think . for exampl let us take mathemat , in mathemat it is veri import to know what actual problem is , way to resolv it and how to approach the problem . if student dont know about basic idea or concept of problem , he will never be abl to resolv it . in mathemat mere know the formula is not enough but one should know basic idea of appli it to solv the problem mportant . sometim we believ the fact like `` pluto is a planet '' as our teacher said in our earlier classess , but now it realli matter that whether it is a planet or a kbo . thi impli that the thing we consid as fact earlier is no more a fact . there are mani instanc like the abov in histori . let me quot anoth exampl that is dure ancient civilis our ancestor consid earth to be flat , but with the invent of galilio 's telescop peopl chang the attitud that earth is no more a flat surfac but a elipt sphere . thi is possibl onli by understand the concept of physic and mathemat . final what i mean to say is that just simpli learn the fact is not enough but we should learn to understand the idea and concept so we can explor new invent and theori . if scientist would have satisfi with lear fact then world would be at standstil , but their quest for deep understand of idea and concept pave the way for new research and invent .
