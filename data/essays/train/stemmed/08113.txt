i person disagre with the given statement . in my opinion there is onli a differ way to enjoy the life between youger and older . young peopl are in the begin of their life and they have still so much to tri that they are attract to the more exstavag thing to do . also substain by their young age and lower experi they can afford more risk and tri situat that make their adrenalin level to the top . but all of thi is onli giud by their desir to becom experienc about life , thi is not a real more enjoyng way of life . the older part of the societi doe not spend a sad life . they have tri all that emot in the past and now they can enjoy through other experi . with mani respos to take care of , they can now get their enjoy from what they have built , their famili , their social relationship last mani year , their job and so on . i do not think thi is bore or less enjoy . may be the differ that mani underlin is in the impact of the two kind of enjoy . it is clear that what a boy do is spectacularli enjoy , i do not want to say it is not , but also the style of live fo an adult can offer a real enjoy , just a differ kind and perhap more deeper in the soul . in conclus we can not do a garduatori about what give us more enjoy but , in a easier way of think , i want to say that everi age ha it own enjoy , the problem is onli how to catch it .
