for sure im total agre with that statement , in adit to that i will explain whi for two point of view , one person and anoth more object ; i rememb long time ago , when i wa stude a element school all teacher were make us to stock in our memori useless data , name and anoth crappi stuff that nowaday i still not use . now im a physic , and the most part of my person world is rule by mathemat law , equal , oper and overwhelm logic . i know thi thing caus my colleg professor taught me to smart-think by make me undertand all from the basic , i.e : noth about memmori but ye in understand . thi wa a brief and person explanaiton of whi i am total agre with the statement , now i will focu on reason and exampl to support my answer . firstli , fact are of cours useless if it have not a concept or idea within ( newton and the appl fall is a ridicul fact if newton wasnt explain all with hi newtonian mechan theori , when we see that exist a forc field call graviti ) . of cours fact are sometim funni o funniest than an explan of a concept , but talk in term of use or import , concept win . imagin an exampl of a scienc student , to be more accur a biolog one ; in the colleg a professor say to hi student that human bodi is made from water and carbon basic , it ok , but thi is onli a fact that contain onli a partial true . the idea of the human bodi is the commun of a lot of organ live togeth to mutual advantag that are call cell , of cours these cell are made of water and carbon , but that is onli the fact that a lot of live unit conform the human bodi are chemic compos by water and carbon , the idea is that carbon and water could creat differ type of microscop structur depend on hi molecular structur give place to the format of cell . well , if the student onli knew that human bodi is made of carbon and water , nowaday organ transplant would be imposs , a lot of modern medic threatment also would be impos , genet therapi also would be imposs too , onli caus we knew a partial true instead the big one .
