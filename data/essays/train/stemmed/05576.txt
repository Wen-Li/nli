understand and learn are not abl to be separ becaus withouht understand learn can not happen and without learn understand can not happen as well . howev , there are order of between understand and learn . in my opinion , understand is more import than learnign becaus for me , lear mean understad fact becaus without understand , i can not learn ani of fact that i should learn . the three reason that i think understand is more import than learn are without understand , learn can not happen , without understand , peopl are easili lost what they are learn and just learn can help peopl for a moment but as time goe by , most peopl do n't rememb what they learn . these are the my reason that understand idea and concepet are more import than learn factor . my first view point is without understand , learn can not happen . for exampl , when i came to canada fist time , i learn about canada 's histori and at that time , i could n't understand ani of them becaus i just tri to memor bunch of factor and l believd that wa the way to learn factor . it wa wrong . after i understood the flow of histori , i wa abl to understand canada 's histori . with just memor or learn some fact from somewher or someon are impossilb that peopl let know about the fact , understad is obvious need . in additiotn , wihtout understand idea and concept , peopl are usual lost what they are learn . one of my friend did n't know how to solv math problem becaus he just tri to put sever number in to the formula that he learn from hi teacher . when he understood whi and how the problem could be solv , he wa possibl to learn about math more . if he could n't understand the concept and idead of math , he would not learn about math anymor . the last reason that peopl should understand first is as time goe by , peopl often forget what they learn . most korean peopl do n't remeb what they learn at high school becaus they just learn without understand . they need to get into good univers so they learn a lot without understan the concept or idea . they usual said it wa useless . howev , they do rememb most of histori . they absoletli learn histori but befor learn histori , most korean understood what lett they are use and where they are live . not onli korean rememb their histori , but also other countri ' peopl rememb most of histori of their mother countri . they understood whi and how they are live through understand and life . learn fact can help peopl at a moment but it doe n't mean they do understand what they are learn . befor learn someth , we should understand idea and concept for effect learn .
