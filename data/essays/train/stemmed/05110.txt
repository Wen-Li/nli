nowaday we are involv in an overwhelm stream of advertis . there are advertis everywher , on tv , magazin , even on everi corner in the street and it 's impossibil not to notic them , even if you want to . we are not onli involv by advertis , but also strongli influenc , even if sometim we do n't admit it becaus we are sure that we are superior to certain thing , but advertis are more subdul that we expect . i agre with the statement , becaus we are so influenc that we arriv at the point that we buy one thing better than anoth onli becaus more public . and what 's the main problem ? we trust advertis too much !! advertis manag to make thing better becaus there are a lot of mind behind who think how to propos an articl to the public , in a way that exalt it best featur and hide the worst one . adverstis in thi way is not correct and loyal toward the public becaus it is n't honest about the featur of the product . how mani time we have bought an articl , think that it 's in a particular way or it doe particular thing while it 's actual veri differ !! and what a disappoint !! i get realli angri when it happen to me . for exampl , when i wa a littl child i saw on tv a realli fantast littl robot which did ( which would have done ) a lot of thing , such as bring glass as a waiter , go alon around the room , record my voic and play cd and so on . but as soon as i brought it to my hous i cuold notic that he wa abl to do onli half thing that i expect .. mayb becaus it wa a realli bad product ?? you can object me that thi is a gener , and mayb you 're right . i think it too : not all the product are got better in advertis and not all the compani make advertis in thi incorrect way . some peopl are honest and clear about their product and i realli appreci them , becaus i think that advertis should be a mean to get articl know to the public and to get peopl who watch tv or read the magazin awar that a particular thing exist , but as it is and not as it should be .
