even if we all have been onc seduc by an advertis although the product wa not that good , i think that thi question is more about what the real object of advertis is : to demonstr the qualiti of an object or to give to someon the desir to buy it . as an exampl , i still rememb an advertis made by san orang juic compani . it show an young teenag who wa come home after play basketbal with hi friend and ask to hi mother where is the juic . the boy and hi life look so great that for week i want to tast it . it happen that one day , i found it in a supermarket and tast it , of cours i did not like it but the advertis ha alreadi done it work , i had bought a bootl of it . neverthless did the advertis lie about the juic ? not at all , it ha onli match with what i wa want to see and what could make me desir the juic . that 's whi , i do not agre total with the sentenc as it is a bit more complic . an advertis must be due to a type of person . to that group the product will seem great but to lot of other , they will not see what that advert is made for . advertis play with a whole rang of feel that a man can feel , it can also play with confid . by make famou person onli say they use thi product and not anoth one they manag to sell a lot . inde the man who is buy the product will first think as hi star that thi product is the b so in my opinion it is true that advertis seem better than they are realli but not total
