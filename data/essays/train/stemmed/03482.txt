some peopl like to attaind a tour group led by a tour guid when travel . howev , other like to plan the iternirari and do the pre-trip inform research by themselv . in my point of view , if one want to have the awesom travel experi , travel alon would be the best choic . first , when travel in a group , you do n't have much choic . much time of the case you encount is that a bounch of tourist crow in front of the paint or relic and listen the lectur address by the tour guid . the qualiti of lectur may vari between tour guid and you do n't have much choic about what you can see or where you can visit . anoth reason whi travel alon is better than join tour group is that you will becom the tour expert when you come back home . you can enjoy everi deatil from the veri begin of trip plane to everi moment you spent dure the trip . you may do more background inform for the spot that you have interest . it is not what a tour guid can do for you . the way of tour guid 's lead may not fit your tast perfectli . one of main reason that peopl choic join tour group is that when face accid dure trip , they need someson can help them . but , sometim even a tour guid may also not the local resid . when accid occur , tour guid is also in the same situat as we are . if we do the inform collect by ourselv in advanc , we can have more confid when face accid after consid the reason abov , the best way to travel is travel alon . you can have much more control over your iternirari and you can learn more about the spot you have interset .
