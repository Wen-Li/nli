i love travel to some place where i have never been . if i go there , i will see someth which is attract or interest and i have never seen befor . it must be excit . i have been to hawaii seven time . although all trip were alon , i had great time and also i have experien that i have never done and i could to see my best friend . thu , i disagre with thi sentenc . first of all , tripe by myself is alway solitari , i mani time felt that i want to go home and too much tree time becaus of alon . howev , if you are alon , you could do whatev you want and you could go wherev you want all the time without care other 's feel . in addit , for me , it is easir to speak to other peopl who are stranger or other tourist or nativ peopl than if come there in group , becaus i need to think about what time is suppos to see other and how they feel about it . so , if i go to travel alon , it make me feel more free than other . next , i met my best friend in hawaii . then , i wa walk among beach by myself . and i wa veri free , also i do not have anyth what to do . so i spoke to a guy who is go to be my best friend . he is a great person and veri consider . all my thi trip , he took me to a lot of place and let me stay hi home for 2 week with delici food . i think if i came there as group , he could not accept me and he could not take mani place , becaus of alon . inconclus , i think that trave alon is more reflex and more calleng and adventur eventhough there are a lot of possibl to face to danger . and , you could do whatev you want again . i think it is even possibl to love somebodi . there are more oppotun to see someon who is import and to studi from everyth that i have seen and to think about my futur slowli .
