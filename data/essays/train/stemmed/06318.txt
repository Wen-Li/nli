mani peopl are convinc , that the last univers geniu die with humboldt , or even earlier with other great scientist , philosoph and thinker . that would mean , that today everi academ field is onli teach a specifi knowledg . i cant't share thi opinion . as a student of polit scienc , i consid myself as a person that is accumul knowledg in variou academ subject , not onli in one specifi . so an answer to thi question , the old question of `` gener '' against `` specif '' . is not realli difficult to me . the most import argument in thi context is larg rang of possibl of where you will work in futur . peopl that studi onli a specif subjectonli have few varieti of what to do in futur . but on the other hand they are the one with the , i think , better chanc to get a job anyway . it is so to say a risk to persu the path of gener '' in job perspect . but have a broad academ background make it much more easier to handl a problem , becaus you will be abl to make use of veri differ problem solv strategi , which onli specif knowledg , thi wo n't be that easi . but not onli in carreer issu , gener is more comprehens . experienc alreadi at univers ( by studi a broad varieti of subject ) that life is much more than what you think it is , is a great addit to life qualiti . i 'm think of a person that is sophist , with good manner and that is interest in the world and the peopl live in it and especi in those live close around him . to come to a conclus , gener could play an import part in creat a better world .
