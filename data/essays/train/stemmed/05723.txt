the question face an actual problem in the modern societi : the role of the young peopl in build the futur societi , through help their commun - by mean of a social , cultur and polit help - and the capabl of such young peopl to build themselv as individu and part of the societi they live in . in order to explain my point of view i need of cours to not take into account those societi in which young peopl grow in war zone and are not abl - becaus they probabl never got ani chanc - to realli know a peac exist . said that , and in particular now talk about the societi where i live , i agre with the statement express in the question . a lot of survey , publish in the most popular newspap , show that young individu just take care of their person growth without consid how much they are touch by what happen around them . these survey also demostr how much young men and women are not awar of the improv they could afford if they were abl to realli put themselv in an effect relat with their commun . as to the reason that can get young peopl to have such behaviour , i guess the most import is the will of person success relat to a deep indiffer . as a concept , indiffer take peopl - young or not - to not care the world 's chang and in contin evolut . tri to find out the root of thi featur would seem to be a task , or a hard challeng as well , of the modern sociolog scienc . than , in my opinion , the will of person success is the reason that explain such non-accuraci . young peopl fulli involv in studi , career , will of easili earn money , seem to forget the place they come from .
