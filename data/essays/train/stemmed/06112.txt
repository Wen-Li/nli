it is often said that young peopl would not spend enough time to help and support their commun in our societi . i disagre with that opinion . at first , i do not think that interest in polici ha decreas over the year . the most import reason for that is that our system is democrat which mean that peopl have the abil to vote and can influenc polici which is not possibl in a dictatorship , for exampl . anoth import factor is that everi citizen ha thi right from a certain age on . in the past , that often depend on the incom and women did not have suffrag at all . today , nearli everi polit parti ha a youth organ , as well . that would not be neccessari , if young peopl were not interest in polici . furthermor there are a lot of poltic independ organ which concern about the interest of the commun . in the past there were neither polit youth organ , nor independ poltic youth organzitaion in spite of the decreas number of peopl to vote , i think it would be exagger to say that young peopl do not put enough effort or time in help their commun .
