i think understand idea and concept is much more import than simpli learn so-cal `` fact '' . histori ha repeatedli prove that past `` fact '' turn out to be fals . for exampl , peopl use to think that all speci on earth were creat by god and they remain the same all the time . today , almost all biologist believ that evolut is the drive forc behind all speci , past and present . as environ chang , old speci extinct and new speci emerg . god ha no role in evolut . consequ , learn the fact may leav you with wrong inform . if rememb fact is not good , will understand idea and concept help ? definit . if we think about the abov exampl , peopl believ god as the onli creator of speci becaus they do n't question the claim and never ask for valid evid to support it . the idea behind such claim should then be `` how do we know ? '' well , in 1859 charl dalwin gave mani evid in hi histor `` on the origin of speci : the theori of evolut '' . as time goe by , mani scientist found more and more evid to support the theori . such evid lie in fossil , similar between live plant and anim and their ancient ancestor and even dna of all organ . we now know all live thing share the same univers hereditari code , i.e. , dna . some peopl may argu that learn fact help a lot when you do n't have access to inform you need . like when a nurs want to know how mani gram equal to an ounc . howev , in the modern `` inform time '' when internet is univers access and most fact are avail on you fingertip . most hospit unit in the u.s.a. are equip with comput connect to the internet . a nurs can simpli `` googl '' `` gram to ounc '' and get the convers rate right away . we no longer need to rememb all the `` fact '' . idea are more import than fact .
