whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than special in one specif subject depend on the rang and varieti of academ subject . in my opinion , to be a specialist in one subject would prove to be more advantag than to be compet in variou field . the main reason for my view is that to special in one subject would mean that the person becom a pioneer in that field . he would be qualifi to make contribut to hi chosen field . for exampl , when a person special in civil engin , he would becom a qualifi person to speak on the topic and to offer hi servic to the public . to major in one subject would mean that the person would be empow to forse chang and paradigm shift , that could be for the better or wors , in the field . if for the wors , he would be in a posit to make a positic differ . anoth reason for my view is that , a fulli qualifi profession would be abl to engag himself in high-end research therebi enabl him to make technolog advanc . some may say that to be a compet speaker on vari topic would enabl a person to have a farther reach and bigger sphere of influenc . yet , it ha to be acknowledg that a man who is a specialist in a field will be abl to make a stronger influenc on those around him . other might cite that to special in one field would be to limit a person 's perspect . howev , a specialist in a field would not onli have a good perspect but also a vision . thi vision would enabl him to achiev an envis goal . specif , it ha to be state that to set and achiev goal , a person would have to be a specialist in the field . for instanc , onli a qualifi electron engin would be abl to improv the satellit commun techniqu and not a newspap editor , who would be compet to speak on vari subject . admittedli , if the person wish to enter anoth field to enhanc hi knowledg , hi oppurtun would be limit consid hi poor prior knowledg . but the upsid is that there is rare a dearth in demand for specialist in a field . to be a pioneer in hi chosen field would enabl the person to mentor bud peopl and to guid other and henc contribut back to the peopl . in conclus , to special in one subject would be more benef , not onli to the person but also to the commun . i would agre that have vari interest is benefici but on balanc , thi should be support by a masteri in one subject .
