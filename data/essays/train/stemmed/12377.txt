i am 22 year old now , that mean i should be includ to the `` young peopl '' use in the statement . that make me think how my life is go . i ask thi question to myself . and my answer is to agre with the statement . i think young peopl , includ me , do not or can not give enough time to help their commun . i will show my point in the follow . the question ask use `` young peopl nowaday '' in the statement , therefor , i should compar the young peopl in the old time with of them in nowaday particulari in the stiation of their famili . i studi in the univers 4 time a week and i work at the restrant in nearbi 3 time a week constantli . moreov , i studi english for the graduat school everyday . that show that i can not have enough time to help my famili becaus i am too busi to do it . but tipic in japan , women did not go to univers to help their famili and to learn how to be as a housew . the enviro that both young poepl in old time and nowaday ha chang . it becam give chanc to women to do what they want , on the other hand women becam much more busi and lost enough time to help own famili . i think there should be enough time for young peopl to help their commun , though it seem difficult for me . to make it possibl , not onli young peopl but also all of the member of the commun have to help each other .
