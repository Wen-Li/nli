my knowledg and my person experi give me the reason to agre with the statement . second my knowledg becaus it 's true that the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus young peopl do not have time to do it . in fact , in the third millenium , the time is a veri big and import sourc . thi concept born princip for the busi world . the famou statement `` the time it is money '' confirm my opinion . from the busi peopl to the young peopl nowaday there is a veri small differ for manag time . as a veri busi man , the child must employ hi twenty-four hour : school , sport and ... televis ! ( social studi say that a child watch-in media - more of four hour of televis at day ) . last but not least , the friend . where is the time to give to help commun ? there is not ! second my person experi i agre with the statement that say that toung peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . when i wa i child i like give my time to help my commun , obvious second my person skill . nowaday i am twenti five year old and i have not got time for help my commun . first becaus my work do not give me more two free hour at day . second becaus i am marri and i have got a son . i must help my wife in my free time ! howev i like help my commun and i hope to achiev it . in my opinion the solut og the problem is in the manag of the time in particular of th efre time .
