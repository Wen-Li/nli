i woke up thi morn , earlier than the time i normal would . it wa an import test day for me , and the last thing i would want to do wa to be late for the test time . i had to leav my hous an hour earlier to come to test place which is normal 15 minut far away , if there 's no traffic ! i live in a big citi where 1 out of everi 6 peopl have their own vehicl . it 's not a big citi area wise , but the popul is over 1 million peopl . there are public transport oppurtun . which cost almost noth , but peopl ( for some reason ) prefer their own vehicl . the ga price have been increas rapidli over the last 5 year . it 's pretti scari when you think about the amount you would have to pay if you were a person to drive to work everi singl day . if these peopl were n't as stubborn to use public transport servic ; they would save a lot of money , and would help the traffic calm down . as human be , we do n't realli know how to use natur resourc . petroleum is one of them . up to now we have n't thought about what we would do if we ran out of it one day . peopl are final start to care about the futur , and take some action to keep what there is . car also caus lot of environment damag . they have harm the ozon layer , and thi ha increas the effect of global warm . if we want the gener after us to live in a healthi world , we must start decreas the number of car we have start from today . whi should a person be wast money on ga , when they could use public transport ? it doe n't make sens to have person vehicl when all they do is caus problem . the number of educ and well awar peopl is increas day by day . i believ that these are all indic that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . hope i wont be need to leav the hous as earli as i do today to get to a place as near !
