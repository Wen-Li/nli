the topic `` young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun '' is a veri controversi one . on one hand it seem to be true relat to the other activ of young peopl . but on the other hand it propos a negat consid mani commun where young peopl itself are the key worker . i would go by the direct that young peopl do n't have enough time help the commun . firstli , a young mind want to enjoy and spend hi teenag with pleasur so that he can cherish hi memori when he is old . infact he goe by the polici that life is short and enjoy it to the maximum . for exampl consid a young boy who is more interst in play rather than help hi commun . secondli , i feel that young mind are alreadi be stress under a process name studi . he ha homework and other activ call exam , paper for which he ha to spend enough amount of time to improv hi career and also hi nation as children are the futur build block of everi countri . further he can improv on hi field and can also put undivid attent on hi studi turn out to be a great scientist or professionalist . if he devot time for help commun , hi preciou time will be lost as time and tide wait for none . he can not achiev hi aim or goal set for himself . anoth point which support my arguement is young children do not do not have enough interest to help and support the commun . the young children nowaday are more interest in enjoy go to night club , watch film and other activ which are hinder in help their commun as interest or desir drive a person rather than duiti . from the abov point , i would conclud say that young children have mani other activ and interest rather than help their commun .
