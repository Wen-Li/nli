i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are three reason for thi . first , the goal of a compani is sell the product . second , advertis make peopl buy their product in indivisu way . a compani which own the product 's goal is make their profit and that way , the compani make peopl to think that the product is nessesari for them . the compani 's goal is sell their product as mani as they can . therefor , poepl who are make a advertis make better look than real product and use it for the advertis . for exampl , . in taco bell advertis , half-pound beef and potato burrito look bigger than the burrito from taco bell in our town . advertis make peopl think that the product is a neccesari item . few day ago , i saw a old navi commerci , they kind of made me think that if i do n't wear their jean , i just do n't belong to our younger men commun . so , i bought the product but it look as same as jean i got two month ago . advertis is for a compani which is sell the product 's profit and it make most peopl to think that the product is what they need . i wa kind of addict to televis home ship few year ago , the seller in the homeshop mention about what kind of peopl need their product . he said , younger or older ladi and gentlemen . instead of say everybodi . that product wa a pen with the light by the way . thi kind of mind contral make peopl that product is nessesari even if they are not veri import product .
