i complet agre with the statement . today 's young gener hardli give ani time to help their commun . i feel so becaus , i have observ thi . i feel if thi continu , it may result in the decreas growth of countri . i had free time last weekend . so , i wa roam around in the citi . the veri obviou thing which i could observ everywher wa , teenag danc around in pub , drink , game , play music . at the same time i could see peopl starv for food in slum area next to them . but , they were not bother at all . i felt realli bad and ask myself if thi is the gener which is go to run thi countri in come year ? our countri 's futur is in these hand wave unboth in pub ? have fun , enjoy with friend is not a bad thing to do . but , one should alway realiz that there is a big mob of peopl around you seek your help . bring a smile on their face would sure add a lot to your commun . the young gener can alway spend few hour per week to help their commun . they should realiz their need for their commun . they should realiz that the futur of their countri is in their hand . help out the commun is veri crucial for a countri becaus , the countri grow with the develop of commun . the impli mean is , the teenag give more time for help out the commun is crucial becaus , they can alway util some portion of the time which they spend hang around . there are mani organ form by group of young peopl in order to help out the commun . but , the teenag hardli know about them and they often do n't pay attent at these thing . i think , we should make today 's young gener realiz the import of commun servic by public such organ and let young peopl to particip more in their activ . final , i would say , the enthusiasm young gener should not wast their energi by hang around . they should contribut to the countri 's develop by give enough time to help their commun and make the countri grow with them .
