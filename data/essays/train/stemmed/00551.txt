i have alway believ that all advertis make product seem more effici than they realli are . accord to my own experi and to other peopl 's stori , i can tell that there are some rel huge exager and ornament descript . one of the point that i total disagre with is when they show us two differ situat or imag . in the first one , there is someth to be done and it ha to be the use of the adveris product . in the second , they show a differ pictur with a perfect result , which is not realist . in fact , it 's just a simul that doe n't garante in ani way such a result . i rememb onc , my brother saw the commerci on tv about the best sell product to treat acn . they made everyon believ the stori told by some differ peopl who , acord to them use the product and had amaz result in a limit number of day . what prove that the person who had the face cover with acn befor and who ha a perfect skin look now , had use the product ? on the other hand , it 's obviou that the seller 's purpos from thi advertis is to persuad peopl and encourag them to purchas the product . thereof they make it sound nice and match the client 's need . it is also clear that competit is among the major reason that push the seller to make the public compar their product to their competitor ' . thi lead most of the time to an over-descript of the item . for instanc , mani commerci show us the effici of deterg by wash the same dirti cloth use the advertis product and anoth deterg of a differ or unknown brand . then , they show us the result , with a distinct differ . after see the advertis , i have person bought a car that wa suppos to be gas-effici , a cream to elimin acn and pill to lose weight . howev , there is some truthi miss . i do n't exclud the effici of all the advertis product , yet most of them are to a differ extent over-r .
