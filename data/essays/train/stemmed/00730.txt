in gener it is alway difficult to decid definit for one possibl . becaus both of them contain some advantag but also some disadvantag , it would be the best to decid for a mixtur . wherea a broad knowledg of mani subject refer to the ideal of human which ha been support for a long time and partial is still be support , special is a phenomena of modern time . we are live in a time of chang . scientif and technic progress have coin the last centuri more than ani time befor . with the term `` global '' i onli want to mention one of the new challeng we have to master . as a reaction on these chang the idea of special ha develop . today , there is much more discov than in former time so you even have to learn much more to get along in a certain profess or academ direct . as a result special is definit necessari . nevertheless i regard a certain broad knowledg to be absolut necessari for everyon . our world is so complex and also complic that peopl have to know the essenti thing about almost all subject to give an reliabl feedback for exampl to politician lead a nation . if peopl are not as well educ there will be the risk of creat a societi lead by a few peopl not think about entir peopl 's problem . so i would prefer a mixtur of gener and special knowledg . all peopl should learn the most import element out of all academ subject . in school there is the possibl to do so . later they might decid to be teach in one subject and in subject relat to thi chosen one . after that , peopl may realli special in their subject . by thi way it would take a longer time until peopl start work but it sure would be an advantag for societi .
