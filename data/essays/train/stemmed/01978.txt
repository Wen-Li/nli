the question that `` youg peopl enjoy life more than oder peopl do ? '' isn t right at all . i mean some old peopl enjoy their life also . on the one hand young peopl are younger their bodi do everytihng what tehi want to do . but on the other hand young peopl don t do the right thing that help their to live longer . for exampl they smoke more than older peopl , becaus it seem cool . and usual they take druke and often they drink more . these are all thing which show that young peopl enjoy their life . but it isn t so , i mean when young peopl do that they want to go more to the death and they aren t enjoy their life they make it smaller . in opposit of the younger peopl older peopl enjoy their live , too . but not like the younger it do . they can not do much more thing , becaus they have famili and a job . they want to live for their famili . they must work to get money to buy food and some other need . they must show their children that they are good parent that do everyth for their famili . but i mean , no i think , that oder peopl do the same thing like the younger peopl in their past . we can that both are , i mean older peopl and the younger peopl , enjoy their life . the older peopl do it in the past and the younger peopl do it now . for me is enjoy the live veri import , becaus when someon enjoy hi life , he can say in futur that he miss hi past . he can ask hi children the past of hi live and he can say hi children what to do in some situat . it s like the histori , but of the personil of one human . i think that i enjoy my life but not more than my father it did , becaus we live in modern time , noth happen at ti time . but at the time wher my father wa younger there happen so mani thing . the world have chang at that time , for exampl comput were made and other thing . i hope that i enjoy my life in the futur .
