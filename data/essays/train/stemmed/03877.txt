ye i do agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , becaus of mani reason . my first reason is , a tour guid is more familiar with the place that we are go to travel that guid can show us mani place that we can not find easli by ourself . for exampl hidden histor place or same taradit place or relogionu place , church . the second reason finan , when we travel aboard or for holiday to same where , if we have a tour guid we us , the guid can provid us useful inform about the our travel and some of thi useful inform are , the hotel which we will go , the tour guid can provid us the chip and best hotel . for shope also we can take hepl from the guid who can take us to the chip or a good shope place . and my last reason , go a countri which ha a differ languag can be hard to enjoy . but if we have a tour guid who know the languag of countri that we are go to visit , the guid provid us to mani nice thing . for exampl we saw a castl in the citi and want to learn about it . the guid can help us by translat inform for thr castl . if we want to speak and learn about the thing and cultureof the countri that we are visint we need and translat becaus all these reason i agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , but who is profeccion tour guid .
