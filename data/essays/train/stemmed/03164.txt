some veri success peopl are the commonli known risk taker . for exampl , somebodi who open a new busi and tri to run it by himself with hi own idea , is more like to be success than an employe of a compani who ha the same job throughout hi entir life . but also it is more like to be unsuccess for an owner of an unexperienc compani than for the employe , becaus success can never be guarante . the one , who tri new thing can gain veri import experi for hi futur life . there are peopl who quit their job to go abroad , to studi a new languag or to make an internship in an other field . thi can be veri advantag when return into the area where they work befor . it could also be unfortun for other , when they do n't find an adequ job when return home . other might say , `` whi return back home , i could life on a high standart in the other countri '' . thi aquir a lot of time to adjust to the differ condit they encount in the new countri and is a challeng . on the other hand , there are success peopl who have never taken ani risk to accomplish their goal . sometim peopl have extraordinari skill that can help them to make a good career , like athlet or teacher . but still i think , howev , that most of the success peopl , if it is in their job or in a social aspect , have to be born with a special talent . they should be riski but they should also see where they have to get back to a more solid ground where it is not too like to fail . with the statement i do agre , becaus i think that you never lose anyth when you take a risk , even if you fail . you gain experi and you will never forget what your strength are and where you can go back . a success person is somebodi who ha done someth out of hi life without have to say , `` i have n't done all the possibl thing .
