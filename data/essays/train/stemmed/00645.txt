in my view it is not true that young peopl do n't dedic enough of their spare time to help in their commun . in the contrari , i see a lot of young peopl support local project to help the older , the poor or to help children to grow up und thrive in a more healthi and heartfelt environ . i experi that a lot of help is given through the local church organis . they run a varieti of project - from help kid to do their homework in the afternoon to support the poor by hand out daili portion of freshli cook food . most of the work done by the church organis could not be achiev without the help of young peopl . although the young nowaday seem to have so mani differ option to spend their spare time , if you take a closer look , it is not so differ as it wa in former time . sport , friend and other cultur activ may consum now as they have alway consum a part of the spare time . but just as in former day some of the spare time is dedic to help other in need . i am awar of the fact that not all the young peopl suppport their commun and that some project may need more help from the youth . but overal one can not say , the young do n't dedic enough time to support worthi caus . the dedic of young peopl to commun work may be less visibl now then it wa in former time . mass media tend to overestim other news . they usual do n't concentr on the small differ the dedic to a church group , for exampl , make . the help of the young may be larg unvis to a larger commun . nevertheless it make all the differ for the peopl that experi the help - just as it ha alway been .
