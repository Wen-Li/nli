the school educ is a veri import part of peopl live . the school educ method chang among differ cultur and it can influenc the futur life of person . it is not veri easi to answer thi question becaus either undestand idea and concept or learn fact have pro and con . when a student is veri young , it is veri difficult to him to understand idea and concept . for instanc when i wa in elementari class i rebemb that the major of lesson were explan of fact . i think it wa a correct educ method becaus i wa not abl to understand idea and concept . befor begin to understand idea and concept it is import to learn fact ! on the other hand a student in secondari class need to be stimul with lesson concentr on idea or concept . if a student of a secondari class follow onli lesson full of fact , he can be veri leasi and he can lose the interest in studi ! nevertheless there are particular topic in wich the student must learn a lot of fact to tri to understand . for instanc histori is full of fact and is full of idea and concept too . but a student can not understand histor idea and concept if he doe not know befor the crononog sequenc of fact ! in conclus , i disagre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact . i thing that both understand idea and concept and learn fact are import part of the student educ . in particular learn fact is the basic support for consequ understand idesa and concept .
