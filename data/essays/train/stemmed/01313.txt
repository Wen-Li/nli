when you are visitng a new countri for first time , it 's usual that you do n't know the princip and interest tourist point , even in citi like pari , where are place like the eiffel tower and the louvr museum , there 's different place to visit and know . in thi case , i think that the best way to travel is un a group led by a tour guid . first of all , a tour guid know the whole citi , and he/sh can tell us a lot o interest inform of the place tha we are go to visit , for exampl , in the winter of last year , i went to canada with my famili , it wa the first time , and we travel in a group with a tour guid . when we were in quebec , joan ( the guid 's name ) , took us to a place in where we can walk in the snow for a long time ( it wa a hugh forest ) , and we can travel with dog , like the skimal in the north pole . that kind of place are n't known by common or foreign peopl , and we cant share and enjoy that new experi with the whole group . in other word , there a lot of advantag travel with a tour guid , anoth exampl , last week i went to acapulco beach , in mexico , i love that place , i know `` all '' the interest place , restaur , bar , popular beach , becaus i travel to acapluco sinc i wa a kid . but , two day ago , i wa talk with my friend 's sister , who is a tour guid , and when i wa talk about my travel to acapulco , and talk about those interest place , she ask to me about `` laguna de chacagua '' , chacagua lagoon in english , and `` barra vieja beach '' , and a few more place , i wa surpris becaus i know acapulco veri well , but y did't heard about that place ever . and i said to her tha i would like to know that part of hidden acapulco . for that reason , i think that travel with a group led by a tour guid is the best option for new place and known place .
