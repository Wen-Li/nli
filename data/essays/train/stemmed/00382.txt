there are a lot of peopl travel on vacat . some peopl go to abroad while some peopl travel in the countri . they either travel individu or in a group led by a tour guid . for my opinion , i think it is better to travel with a tour guid becaus it is more conveni , econom and safe . to start with , when travel to the place we do not know individu not use the tour guid , we may wonder where to go and what to do . also , we have to check the airplan or bu we have to ride , check the weather and so on . on the other hand , if we just go to the tour guid shop tell where they want to go , the touri would kindli introduc us a perfect plan . they would probabl plan to go to sever popular place and prepar tradit food . therefor , be in a group led by a tour guid is veri conveni and easi when we are travel . moreov , the more peopl we travel with , the less we have to pay individu . the tour guid plan includ the fee of stay , trabel , food and so on . sinc they move with a group , all the thing will be chaper than travel individu . for exampl , the tokyo disney land cost more than 5000 yen in dividu . if we go as a group , howev , cost onli 3000 yen . it is more econom to be in a group . also , we may get friend if we travel in a group . it will be more excit and fun if we make friend and enjoy the trip . lastli , it is much safe to travel with a lot of peopl instead of travel alon . also , the tour guid know about the place and know what to do on emerg . we would feel more camfort if we travel with mani peopl , too . to conclud , travel in a group led b a tour guid is the best way . it is conveni becaus we do not have to plan the trip . also , it would be veri cheap but safe if we travel with a lot of peopl . it is the best idea to reli on the tour guid and have a relax travel .
