in gener , i do agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . howev i would mayb chang thi statement into : young peopl nowaday are not given enough time to help their commun . i think that today mani peopl , particularli young peopl , just do not have the time to care about their commun . they are involv into too mani other activ . the pressur from school for exampl and all the other possibl and offer provid by advertis do distract them from ani social activ or project . anoth reason whi i approv of thi statement is that i think young peopl do not realli have too mani possibl to get involv into ani social project . the commun do actual rather care about current problem with polici and administr , so that even they are not realli abl to spend too much time on think about involv youngster . the onli opportun for help the commun , which is taken by most young men , is done the civil servic or go to the militari after finish school . but even thi opportun is actual not taken voluntarili but one is actual forc by govern to do ani of these two servic . of cours if young peopl would be more interest in help their commun they could mayb gain some access to some help organz . but as long as thi interest doe not exist and as long as the commun do not offer ani urgent project to them , commun wont get ani more help from young peopl . most young peopl do care about their famili and friend veri much . and if anybodi ha a problem most young peopl are will to help . consequ you see that there is not a lack of common interest but there is just a lack of connect between young peopl and commun .
