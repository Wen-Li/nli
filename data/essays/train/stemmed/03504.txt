although be polyval is a good thing becaus you are abl to discuss about everyth , be special in one specif subject is more valuabl to me . inde , in my opinion , when you are abl to be the best in one specif subject it mean that you can focu veri hard on someth in a way to do your best . that 's the most import . peopl who have a littl knowledg of a lot of thing are common person . be special in one topic is veri import becaus it 's a way to make yourself differ . be good at eas on sever subject is common nowaday . you are not effici when you are know a littl of sever topic becaus your mind is not focu on someth that you can do , or explain better than everyth . even if you have an import knowledg of sever topic , you are not abl to be as good , in your argument , as someon who is veri good in one subject . furthermor , be veri good in one subject mean be weak in other topic . becaus you spend most of your time in studi ( or work ) the same thing , you do n't open your mind to other thing , or do n't even be interest in do someth els becaus you know that you wo n't be abl to be as good as you are in your specialis . anyway , if your are abl to focu yourself to onli one thing , it mean that you can focu on anyth . be well focu on someth is one of the most import thing nowaday : in work , studi . . anyth . to me , you are more effici when you are abl to forget everyth around you except the thing you are do . as an exampl let 's take the car . if you are focu when you are drive , if you are not chang the radio or diall a number on your cellphon , noth can happen even if a other car arriv veri fast from anywher . becaus be focu on someth mean control it .
