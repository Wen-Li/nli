i agre with the statement as success peopl tri new thing and risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . accord to my opinion everi where success peopl mean hardwork peopl are tri to find the new thing . becaus of they were knowen where the risk and prolem are gener . that the reson the success peopl done everi thing at where ever . and also hardwork peopl tri to know about new thing such as to find new type of product and make it where ever ani risk . then publis into market . now a day the inform technolog wa grow day by day . one compani releas one type of product and onther compani releas that type but with more featur . whi becaus in those compani were type of empyoement . in one compani had the normal eploye and the other had the success or hardwork empyoe . thi is the major exampl of the success peopl and oth . hardwork peopl knowen where the conflict are rise or gener . exampl of success peopl in the world are rathan tata , mittal and somani are there . they are all success in thier life and also they are thaught that to produc new type of product in to world market . the hardworkig wa come from their famili and from teacher they learn in to their instutut . success mean when ever a man or women got happi or got victori from their job . there are somani scientist are success in their experi , then they whould success on that experi . success peopl alway thing about the new topic from the sociti . success peopl got the full relax and happi from their work . and the peopl do ndt happi those are normal peopl .
