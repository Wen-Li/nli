there are three reason whi i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is becuas i believ that student will not be abl to learn the fact unless they understand it idea and concept , it is veri like for them to forget the fact if they skip the step to understand idea and concept , and if they have no knowledg on how the fact becom a fact they will not be abl to teach or explain it to other peopl . firstli , the pupil will not be abl to learn the fact complet unless they understand idea or concept sinc the fact are form from the concept . i can not imagin myself learn a fact and understand it perfectli without the knowledg of it background . secondli , the fact that are be learn will not remain in the student ' head just by memor them . unless they understand the idea and concept of it , they will soon forget it , for exampl after the unit test is over . that will definit not benefit their live in the futur and it would mean that the time they spent on learn the fact wa meaningless afteral . lastli , the student who learn the fact without understand the concept and idea will not be abl to teach or explain about the topic to other . i feel that it is a shame for them , and i will be embarras if i am in a situat where i can not make a thorough explan when i should know someth about it . in conclus , i agre to the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn facts. '' becaus student can not learn fact without understand idea and concept , the fact will not benefit them without the knowledg of the background , and they will not be abl to teach and explain to their peer when they do not have the understand of idea and concept . i believ that to understand idea and concept is an unneccessari step to be skip .
