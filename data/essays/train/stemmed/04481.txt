in my point of view , peopl should tri for new thing rather than do the old thing repetedli . becaus sucess full thing lead to do mani new thing that are use full for man kind . peol who are in research field they use to invent new thing that are use full for man kind , for exampl in the field of medic and space research . in the medic field there are so mani diseas to be known and they should be cure . for exampl cancer & aid etc , research are do contini invenct how to find the new medican that can cure 100 percent a man . so there should be some new thing to do reaserch that it can be cure in some other way . com to the electr and mechan thing without take risk , how peopl can invent the bulb and rotatori eqip . so there should be some new thing which thing lead to chang in histori . but , a part from invent new thing there should be some updat what thay have earlier invent . for exampl comput wa first invent by abuscu and the mechin wa also preti larg and heavi . but com to the present comput have design in a fashion that a man can carri from place to place without ani need of help or with out ani assist . so there should be also a contin up gariat when some thing is inventd to make it ussag simpl day by day . so , from the abov point of explant it can be said that peopl should invent to new thing as well as old thing . there shold be some manner of processur to do the thing in a sucessful manner . the thing that are invent should support the environ it shold not distrub the man kind . and there shold be and regulari updat of the thing that heve been invent and should be cheke wether it is in a proper condit or not
