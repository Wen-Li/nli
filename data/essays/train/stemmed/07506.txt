some person think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i think that it is not true . first , older peopl may feel not have taken enough pleasur in their previou life , so dure their last year they want to do thing for which they had not enough time befor . thu , they enjoy more each moment and take advantag of the present instant becaus they know it is their last chanc . on the contrari , young peopl are alway in a hurri , they want to do a lot of thing , manag to do few of them and they do n't enjoy what they experi becaus they are not think to one thing at the time . on the other hand , there is a more materi reason for which older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl : older peopl are often retir and they are a part of the societi with a higher consumpt power . it is easier for them to enjoy what the life can offer . for exampl , they can do some trip that they could n't afford befor becaus they had their children at home and becaus it wa necessari to pay for their studi . howev they did n't have time for that becaus they were work . final , older peopl have gain more matur and they are awar of the valu of thing . so they can better enjoy what is avail to them . the more someth is difficult to reach and the more we wait for get it , the more it will be valuabl . the more someth is rare , the more it is enjoy . nowaday , a lot of young peopl believ that everyth is due to them and they do n't measur the valu of what they get . when we are older , we are abl to meausr the chanc we had and that we did n't measur in the past . that is whi i think that we must wait to be older to realli enjoy the life , becaus be older give more chanc to be abl to do what we realli want .
