i 'm absolutli agre with thi statement . i think that is import for all poel not onli for student to understand the inform than it is for to learn fact , in fact in everi situat , for exampl at school or also in the job , it is better understand veri well befor to do sameth . the italian univers is base on thi concept and i think that it is import studi the concept to do n't make a mistak . i studi industri design and the cours are organ in thi way : dure the first semest i have to do cours of theori subject , for exsempl math , phisic or geometr draw , instead in the second semest i have practis matter call laboratori . in laboratori class i can use my theori inform , that i have studi in the first semest , for design a product that have not bed caractherist . i can write an exampl to exprim better my idea : i design a tabl , thi tabl have to be stabl and resist , so i can do the tabl with thi caractherist onli if i have studi `` statica '' . make a mistak is too simpl when i do n't undestand what i do , in gener , and how i do someth , in particular . i have to know all the step that i have to pass to arriv at the end of a product . in short i believ that it is better at beginnig undestand the request , keep all the inform about a concept and after that i can do everyth .
