i agre to that statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . the main area on which the reson of thi sentenc depend on the differ between the `` young peopl '' now and in the previou day . i feel there is a chang in the respons level of the young peopl from olden day to present . there is much burden on them now , either in away take care of the entir famili or be a bread winner for the famili . thi make them to spend most of the time in earn money . so the young peopl are restrict in take care and helip their own famili . the commun form a group of famili which in turn becom difficult to takecar and provid help as he ha been fulli bundl with hi own famili . in olden day young peopl are do more of chariti work and help other peopl and are less selifish . so they spent time in help the poor and the peopl who are lack in few thing with whatev they have . for exampl the person who is good at studi ha put up center for educ the illeter which is profit free organ . help other wa preval in most of the young peopl in those day which inturn help the commun . but in the present day we see no care attitid in the young peopl for the other in the commun . as cite abov there will be long barrier between each famili in order to help each other becaus of selfish , no care attitud , egoism etc . for exampl the rich are becom richer and the poor are becom poorer . i feel that invlov in commun activ is alway better . the polici should be help yourself and help other . so that onc we are done with take care of our need , famili need and if some time is present we can use it effect by help the other commun peopl . we can understand their problem and provid a feasibl solut to those . we can alway indulg ourselv in the chariti organ children rili fund and red cross and mani more with in our limit and help the world to be a better place . in do so one will emerg out as a great person in hi life and will encourag other with the same .
