i agre with the statement which say it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to specil in one specif subject . i think thi will give us alot of inform in mani thing and thi will support me in the situat that mayb i will in it for exampl , if i studi math and i want to be a teacher that doe n't mean that i dont need to studi comput , mayb i have to do present by the comput so it 's import to me to know how to learn how to use it by stude the comput subject . also i see thi will help me to deal in correct way with the thing around me for exampl if i have inform in the medic thing so i can protect my self away from diesea . have broad knoledg of mani academ make me awar abaut mani thing such as how to deal with other or with my student in the futur by stude comun with other which is not the math subject . if i have inform abaut one specif subject i ca n't do ani thing with other situat which is part of the onther subject . final i advic other to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and do not stop
