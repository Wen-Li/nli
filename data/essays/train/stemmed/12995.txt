i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis are meant to convinc potenti buyer to purchas certain item . therefor , in order to convinc the buyer , advertis almost alway make product appear better than they realli are . my read of an articl on the local newspap and my person experi of purchas a skin care product prove thi point to be true . i onc read an articl on a local newspap that inform reader about the art of advertis . the articl said that in order to convinc the potenti buyer to purchas certain item , the advertis market must make the product to appear as amaz as possibl , even if they appear better than they actual are . so that potenti buyer will be convinc of the product ' worth and effect . if the advertis make the product seem wors or the way they realli are , they will have a more difficult time to convinc buyer . in my opinion , the articl had a point . in addit to the articl , my person experi also prove that most advertis make product seem better . i have alway want clear , smooth skin . i rememb see an advertis of a skin care product on the televis . the product wa describ in the advertis to be so effect that i wa complet convinc befor even tri it . howev , after purchas the skin care product and use it for two month , i still had countless pimpl on my face and the qualiti of my skin did not improv at all . thi experi show me that advertis make product much better than they realli are . both the articl on my local newspap and my person experi prove to me that most advertis make product seem better than they actual are . in numer case , the product that buyer purchas in realiti do not live up to their descript in their advertis . so next time when i purchas an item , i will not judg it worth and effect just by look at it advertis .
