there are mani benefit relat with travel in a group led by a tour guid , such as opportun to make friend among the group member , and a fix itinerari which reduc the risk of get lost . howev , i believ that the benefit of travel alon outweigh the benefit of travel in a group in mani way : person time manag , tailor travel rout , and budget . firstli , it is import to have a detail plan with specif tour locat and time in order to effeci organ and run a tour where mani peopl are involv . thi mean that certain locat of interest may not be visit or may not receiv as much tour time as one may desir . locat and time alloc would be base more on the overal benefit of the group , rather than the specif interest of the individu . therefor , by travel alon , one could exclus tour the locat one is interest in and alloc as much time as one want in view the locat . the organ of the itinerari would be up to the individu travel , allow him to map out hi own travel rout and `` design '' hi own trip . also , travel alon would allow the travel to budget the spend specif to hi need . the travel could significantli reduc cost in unnecessari spend relat to visit area of littl interest , and increas spend in local food cultur or buy souvenir . the area of spend could be adapt to what each individu travel desir , depend on what part of the tour they want to concentr their tour spenditur . moreov , cheaper transport and accomod can be adapt into the plan of an individu travel . howev , in a group set , travel are charg with a lump-sum amount where littl room for person interest and budget decis is allow . in conclus , i disagre with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' i believ thi may be true in the case of peopl of old age , who are more comfort with a mapped-out plan and a tour guid lead the way . howev , i believ travel should involv adventur and discov place which genuin interest me . therefor , in my opinion , travel alon give me the freedom to live the trip the way i want to and to discov the place i desir , creat a much better tour experi overal .
