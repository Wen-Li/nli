i think it is difficult to have a categor respons to thi statement becaus i think it depen on the peopl . but , i have to agre or disagre with thi statement , so i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . first , young peopl are `` young '' ! it impli a kind of unknowledg of life . they do not have experi and do not know the end of the situat they live ( in gener ) . so , as they do know anyth , they enjoy more for each situat . moreov , they sometim think that thi situat could mayb never more happen , so they enjoy the present moment . although when you are older , you have a certain experi of life . as you have been young , you had a lot of experi in the past , and you know the end of each one . so , i think older peopl do not take time to enjoy life when it is possibl becaus they alreadi live it . futhermor , i think young peopl have generali a good health ( better than older peopl ) . so , they have the possibl to do more thing than older peopl . thi good health help young peopl to take risk without doubt or question . if a young peopl want to jump , he jump ! and he doe not have the worri of the other . moreov , young peopl enjoy life becaus they feel free . they do not have problem at work , or famili 's affair . .. onli one thing count : themselv . thi feel of freedom help them to be more spontan or happi . the innonc of the child stay in each person but is less present in the older peopl mental as the young one . young peopl have thi child 's spirit that the older peopl lose with the year . but final , i think that older peopl in appear can be young peopl insid . sometim , older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl becaus of the death which can be near for them . so , they enjoy day as if it wa the last . life is too short , and had to be enjoy everi day !!!
