as far as i am concern i think that the peopl in our daili societi need their car . you feel free if you can take the the car and go shop for exampl . but you also see the deep impact of the global . if everybodi take hi car everi day the natur will be pollut . so you do n't have to forget the natur . i think we will not have more car in twenti year than today becaus i think that scienc and economi will find anoth transport type . the oil price are veri high today so i ca n't imagin that the car industri will increas . i think anoth transport type will appear like the transrapid abov the build . anoth reason is that the world popul increas and so i think there is no space anymor to provid all peopl with car . do i guess that the natur resourc are limit and so if there is no oil anymor you have to find a solut . mayb you can support the car with solar cell but thi method will be veri expens . so in my opinion scientist have to find anoth way to bring the peopl from one point to the other point . the old tradit way to come from one point to the other point will discuss . if you ride with your bike to the univers or you want to go shop you will also support you health . so i can imagin that someth appear help the peopl to remain fit . our daili societi is full of peopl have more weight than healthi . whi we do n't connect two thing . the health and the movement . ok , i am a sport man and feel better when i ride with my bike to the next citi . but who ha the same thought that i have . nobodi . the world is govern by peopl who want to live fast and who do n't have ani time to relax . time is money and therefor i think the car industri doe not increas but the world will find a solut to make the life easier for those dream of it .
