the question here is to find out if success is close link or not with risk-tak and curios , when it come to tri new experi . as a student who want to set up one 's own busi in the long term , i total agre that statement and i will explain whi in main three point . to begin with , how is it possibl to learn and improv oneself in ani job if one doe not open up one 's mind nor express one 's curios ? as one doe not know everyth about a topic - how to use excel for the first time for instanc - , it is a mandatori task to tri by oneself to succeed , to learn and bear the tip in mind . it is the same when it come to ask to somebodi you do not know at all to find your way in the street . sure , you can bump into strang peopl , but what if you never ask ? you will never get to your meet , are you ? then , and as i mention abov , how is it possibl to creat someth new in the entrepreneurship field for instanc , if one never tri nor make experi ? somebodi want set up one 's busi can not be a risk-advers , all the more that lot amount of money are at stake . but if one never tri - to have special condit on the loan for instanc - , the compani will not be creat . thirdli , true , i am strongli convinc that most of success peopl express their curios . still there is a need to qualifi the notion of risk-tak and keep do what is alreadi work without tri act differ . i am truli convinc that a black and white answer can not be brought to the question : are there onli risk-tak who succeed and safer peopl never do ? thi opinion just becom stupid if we consid the exampl of peopl who die while tri for the first time in their live how to escalad the hilmalaya or how to swim with shark . to conclud , risk ha never been a guarranti for success but it may be a condit . and new is not alway good , old method have been work for year , unless a recently-develop new one is more effici , one doe not have to chang .
