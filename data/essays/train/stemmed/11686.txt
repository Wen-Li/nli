although i understand the comfort of own car drive , i support the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are sever reason whi i feel thi is right . first , we know how mani peopl are get the diseas like cancer and so mani respiratori diseas from the pollut deliv from the vehicl , car especi . in addit to caus danger diseas , the use of car also spoil the greenari of environ . furthermor thi pollut from the car may lead to green hous effect . by consid abov reason the peopl may reduc the use of car in come twenti year . second , the cost of fuel for the car is tri to kiss the sky . normal peopl are too elig to use car . in addit , the natur resourc like petrol and diesel are get diminish in the earth . thi may result in avoid of usag of car like vehicl which consum petrol and diesel . to increas the altern for petrol and diesel peopl may have to grow natur bio plant which will replac the normal petrol and diesel . by use natur resourc we may improv the avail of sourc , in contrast it may decres the effici of car . thi may result in decres the usag of car in the futur . anoth reason i can give is that with the increas technolog scientist may invent new techniqu with which peopl can fli with their own hand . they may invent fli machin with which a group of peopl can travel at a time like as comfort as in the car without ani cost . morov thi type of invent will reduc the pollut problem that we have now like sound pollut and air pollut . in addit to that it not onli prevent accid but also the life style of futur citizen . in my opinion , when technolog is increas it will defin replac a fault thing with a new thing which will be more effect than older one . in the same way the usag of number of car will decrea with the replac of new technolog .
