what 's the goal of advertis ? sell , is n't it ? everi punch-lin , everi jingl , everi smile girl or play babi is use to sell us a product as a mean for obtain satisfact and , eventu , happi . of cours advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . but is it enhanc it qualiti they onli thing they do ? or do they work our mind in a much more complex and wick way ? we should n't ask ourselv if advertis are the result of lie , becaus the answer is quit evid . we should ask ourselv how they affect us and how to deal with them . what public tri to do is not make us believ that their product is the best in the market , we can verifi their promis by go to a local store . what they realli tri to do is to sell us valu and life-styl along with the product . venezuelan beer comerci are the best exampl i can think of . their target is young peopl , so they take activ young peopl tipic do , like go to to beach or parti . then , they creat a clever and delic web of imag , phrase and situat that work our mind into believ that consum that beer will make us cooler , funnier and more outgo . drink beer make us into everyth we 've alway dream . the sexi ladi who drive boy crazi , or the stud that hook up with ten girl on a singl night . beer equal fun , like in a mathemat equat . of cours , thi process doe n't occur at a conscient level , it 's way more subtl . at the begin we may not feel particularli atract by the product , but after some parti where the situat show in the ad repeat themselv contantli - market genius make sure that they do - we are unwillingli drawn to it . we start drink , we feel confid and then we becom consum . advertis have achiv their goal . the beer stori is onli a small fragment of the world of comerci in the modern world . there are way of persuad peopl to consum that we ca n't even imagin . so , what should we do ? should we leav the citi and assum an amish way of live ? should we deni civil and return to a roussaunian state of natur ? i do n't think the answer must be that radic . it all lie in our capac of be critic , of see the thin thread intend to manipul us and decid whether to accept them or not . luckili , we are provid of freedom and capac of choic , therefor we 're not determin by the influenc of public , no matter how hard market genius tri . we must ask ourselv if we want to be comerci puppet or if we want to decid our vision of life and our social behaviour . both choic have their advantag and disadvantag , it up to us to decid who we want to be : the stud in the club or the outsid glare full of contempt .
