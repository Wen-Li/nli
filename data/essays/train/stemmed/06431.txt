i think it is a commom phenomena that older peopl tend to critizic the younger gener for just take care of themselv and not think about the futur . for exampl in austria thi problem exist alreadi mani year and the 68-gener which ha been blame for put too much attent on the fun part of life alreadi start to state their opinion about how bad the current gener is . i do n't think it is becaus the focu shift to have fun . the reason for the missunderstand ha someth to do with develop . becaus of econom develop in mani western countri everi gener start at a much better posit than the last one . mani improv establish dure the industri revolut creat free time that need to be fill by someth we like to do . when most peopl were farmer they had not enough time for fun activ like go run or play soccer becaus they were too tire after work on the field the whole day . mani develop countri have low weekli work hour and therefor provid space for peopl to enjoy their time . but of cours also the free time cultur did n't stop but continu to improv . the new hobbi great dure the time seem like more fun for the older gener who is not abl to do thi kind of activ anymor . they are jealou about thi new sport ( like skateboard or snow board ) but forget that their gener also develop new thing that seem strang for their parent . i do n't think that modern gener have more fun than older one but instead suggest to look at the cultur , econom and polit context in order to judg thi question . onli becaus our grandpar enjoy differ thing than we do it doe n't mean that we enjoy life more than them . now i am young but when i becom old i might chang my opinion , like they did .
