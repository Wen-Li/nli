i agre with that statment , and in the follow line i will support my idea . when we watch an advertis about a product , in most of the case we asum that the product is better than it probabl is . in effect , we think that the product ha a good cualiti becaus we asum that the produc make a lot of exam to probe hi product , but when we buy the product , and we follow the advetis , we sometim we can notic that the product ha not the suffici advertis that it suppos to be . for exampl , if you buy a pesticid , and in the advertis say that you can use in home , and you use in the plant of your home , in a few day your plant probabl die . the reason of thism is becaus the advertis did not tell you that you can not use the pesticid in the plant of your home . as we can see , becaus the advertis we assum that the pesticid wa a good product , much better than realli is . in conclut , i agre with the statement , becaus in mani time , the the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and when we use , we notic that the product are not good .
