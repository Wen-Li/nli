i am of the opinion that it is hard to say if in twenti year will be more car in use than today or not . today a lot of peopl - almost everyon - in germani have a car or even more than one car . a car symbol someon 's statu nowaday which is pretti said . i think that there are too mani car on the street becaus of the pollut and damag the enviorn . whi ca n't peopl walk or drive by bike ? whi ca n't they even use the train ? peopl get lazi . but i presum that the ticket for a train cost too much also . it is said that german have no money but it is possibl for them to buy a car . ? ! where is the point ? i think there is no point . but i realli like that truck are not permit to drive sunday a coulp of hour becaus the nois is gone . in twenti year peolp are probabl even lazier than they are today becaus everyth becom automat and robot are go to be a normal use . so i actual do not think that there will be fewer car in 2026 . on the other side it is possibl that there will be fewer car becaus peopl get poorer . everyth becom more expens nowaday and peopl get less money . car will be more expens in a coupl of year , too , and of cours the ga . the ga is one of the major problem . it get too expens and peopl can not effort buy it anymor . and mayb there will be a law which say that peopl are not allow to drive a car in a certain time period of the day and then peopl do not need a car . as a conculs i would like to mention that it is veri hard to say wheather there will be fewer car in 2026 or not . peopl chang and time chang , too . you never realli know what will happen in the futur . everyth happen for a reason .
