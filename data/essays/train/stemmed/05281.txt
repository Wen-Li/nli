it true that humen is total depend on the power of vehicl to move from one place to anoth . transport ha made human day to day life more easi than befor . in ancient day as peopl use to walk to cover distanc from one part to anoth , now use of car and other transpot made it much eaiser . motor car are useful to take three to four or more peopl to one place to anoth . i disagre with the point that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i feel that use of car wont be fewer in anoth twenti year . if we take an exampl technolog ha improv so much that now most of the middl class famili is afford to have a four wheelar with new model but same time those peopl who have old ambasedor or fiat car dont want to chang their old model after so mani year also . so their can be chanc that after twenti year when technolog will come up with new thing and modal for transpot , there will be lot of peopl who will like onli to use car . and also the poor peopl who are abl to afford onli motorbik can use car after twenti year . same time there also can be possibl that after tweti year when scienc will come up with new invent and helicopt and plane can be avail in cheeper rate as like today ani of the four wheelar or if their fair will reduc to normal train or bu fair then sure there will be less use of car . in conclus i want to state that my agreement or disagr with thi topic hardli matter . onli the thing matter is how much technolog ha improv and how it help to normal or below middl class peopl for their transpot .
