i believ that it is alway better to do such thing than just read or look at . i defin disagre with it is more import for student to know the idea and concept than to learn fact . i feel thi way becaus , just to learn the concept student might lose their attent or interest , and to learn fact is veri effect . first , student often prefer to do some activ than be in the class , which mean that if they learn onli the concept and idea will lead them to not concentr on . for instanc , in the comput class , most student do not realli want to know how the system oper , whi it is , and so on . it make them to lose interest . on the other hand , if they go on to the comput and look how it oper for real and use comput , it get much more attent and interest to the comput class . second , to learn the fact is much more effici to most peopl . educ is alway like to know what kind of educ can be more effect on it . the answer for thi is do `` real '' thing . let 's think about the brain . in what way do you rememb thing better ? read the passag , learn all the concept , or do someth with use all your five sens and exprienc ? i believ that experiecn help you to rememb meteri much better . here is a good exampl of that . befor i came to canada , i did kno noth about comput . sinc i had to use comput to get done my homework and to chat with friend back in korea , it made me to be so familiar with comput . now i can even fix up and tune up the comput . if i onli read book about comput and tri to unerstand concept i could never be that good at it . as the conclus , understand concept might lose peopl 's interest , and do real thing is much more effect than other stuff , it is more import for student to learn fact than understand idea and concept . we have to realiz what is alway better in what way and tri to bring them in the real world . by have mroe activ and experienc will make educ to be a lot success .
