i agre with the statement . a success person might take a risk instead of do what he or she alreadi know . a success man is a person that know nearli everyth about hi work . hi knowledg is the fundament of hi good work so he might be success . the question is if such a person would take a risk to gain mayb more money or more success . if a person know everyth about a topic he or she might be better in specul about the futur . a success owner of a store must know how to lead the store . becaus of hi knowledg he might know how much money he could invest in make the store more effect or more success . it may be a risk to invest a high ammount of money becaus the owner speculat that there will be buyer that will buy hi product . but if the owner is right , and in the next time is someth like an unseen event that make the place where hi store is more atract to the peopl he will be more success . not onli the ammount of money but even the time of invest must be right . a success person must know when the time might be rigt to invest . if thi person know the system the risk is more transpar to him or her , so he or she might take the risk . a success person might be also creativ , that one of the fault he or she is success . a creativ idea is alway someth within a risk , but the differ is that a success person might know the risk better . anoth point is that a person that never fail with their work doe not know how it is to be wrong or to be not success . thi person might feel save in everi action he or she might take , so thi person will tri someth new without fear someth bad . a person that is not so gift might not have invest idea or ani idea of improv the situat so he or she would continu their work as the alreadi know without ani risk . so from my point of view the statement given in the question is correct .
