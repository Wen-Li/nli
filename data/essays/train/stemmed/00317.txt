advertis play a veri vital role in sale of variou product . they not onli enhanc the sale but also bring awar among public about the product . but i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are some advantag as well as some disadvantag . it is sometim good to advertis the product more than they realli are . but not all product can be done like that . becaus if peopl becom awar of it then there might be chanc of declin in the sale of the product . advertis doe good to the product becaus most of the peopl reli on the advertis . if it is attract then they show interest to buy . becaus mani peopl who dont have access to these advertis dont know much about the product and therefor they dont show interest to buy them . but due to heavi competit nowaday they are promot the product much better than they are . but thi is not healthi alway . mani tri to show their product as the best product . onc i wa fool by see a mobil phone advertis onlin and onli after purchas the product and reciev it i came to know that it wa not at all attr as it wa shown in the promo . i nver got my money back as they couldnt take it back . from that time onward i start be care about thae advertis . i make sure that i see the product befor purchas it . some of the compani that give the advertis are not reliabl . therefor i conclud that some advertis make product look much better than they are . we must be veri care about the product and it is alway better to have a look befor purchasinginstead of just reli on the advertis .
