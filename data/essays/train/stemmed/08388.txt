i am not such kind of peopl who have mani chace to travel , but i do experienc some trip hitheto . sometim i made my excurs by myself alon , sometim with my friend and sometim , of cours , join a group led by a tour guid . compar all these way , i should say that to travel in a group led by a tour guid is not the best way . it is true that be led by a tour guid doe ha some merit . for exampl , that will be safer and we can get more introduct and imform from the guid in the trip . but for me , i think the signific thing in a trip is the freedom and pleasur . whi do n't we just stay in a librari to seek the intorduct more derectli and excatli ? the reason whi i choos to travel is to get rid of all the unhappi thing in my daili life , tri a new surround , enjoy the ladescap , think noth just be relax . without a guid , i can go ani place i want to go , not onli walk along the rout decid by someon . that should be more interest and excit . and also , i think the fee of a trip is anoth reason . it will be more expens to get a tour guid . i wourd rather pay my money on some other thing than on a tour guid . so , next time i plan to have a travel , i wo n't adopt the way of have a tour guid . mayb just myself , mayb with my good friend , the point is the same , just go my or our own rout , enjoy the fexibl and exit trip .
