i agre with thi statement . in my opinion , if you want to be success in your live , you have to take some risk on sever moment . for exampl , peopl who onli do thing that they know it alway go well usual do n't settl for chang their job . becaus of that , they can lose a magnif ocass for get a best job and also for earn more money . on the other hand , on numer ocass success peopl start new bussi although they are not sure they will go well . but , they do n't bother do that becaus they usual are veri posit peopl . even thing do n't go too well , thi kind of peopl can see the posit side of thing . in contrast , take too risk have also some drawback . befor take an import deciss we have to think slowli about all thing and risk it ha . we must be veri care with our money and with the peopl who love and do n't take risk with them . if we alway take deciss quickli perhap some day we will have problem .
