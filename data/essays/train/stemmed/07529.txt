no commun can exist if the young do not take an activ part in it develop . say that young peopl do not give time to help their commun would be wrong . the fact that the young gener enjoy the life and live it up ha creat a wrong impress that they are not seriou about their commun . but if we look care then we 'll realis the role the youngster are play in the develop of their commun . i rememb when i wa in school , we were made to go to the slum area and help the children over there to learn to read and write . camp were organis by student to educ the local of a villag on the import of educ . all these initi were taken by the student who form the bloodlin of ani commun . anoth exampl that i can recollect of the youngster 's role in a commun is when i went for a vacat to a small town by the sea . the author had allow break of a ship that contain asbesto which is harm to human . it wa the effort of the young peopl of the commun that that ship wa made to return and a commun wa save . therefor , the youngster do care about their commun and play an import role in defin how a commun should be rather than just be a part of it and accept it the way it wa given to them .
