nowaday , the develop of commun make the work at home possibl . that might be a reason that some peopl say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . howev , i disagre with it . the reason will be shown in the follow . modern peopl regard privat life as import . in other word , they love to enjoy life , and car is necessari to do so . in my parent 's gener , it wa common to buy home earlier than car . howev , peopl of my gener tend to buy car first when they get job . therefor , the number of car in twenti year will not decreas . in addit , there will be enough energi to spend in the futur . although there are not enough fuel in land , there are still huge oil and ga in the ocean . moreov , the automobil that can be oper by electr energi wa invent . it is just be advanc to be use by peopl . final , there are mani countri that are still develop . for exampl , china , the countri in which a major popul of the world is live , is develop dramat . it is necessari that the number of car in china will increas . in addit , there are mani countri that are develop like china : india , russia , brazil , etc . in conclus , the number of car will not decreas in twenti year . the import of privat life is increas , and there are enough fuel and mani develop countri . for these reason , i believ that there will be more car in use in the futur .
