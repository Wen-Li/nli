while there may be some advantag to lear mani disciplin of academ subject , i think that it is much better to studi specifi subject . there are two reason for thi : it practic and it effect . first of all , the reason whi it is much more benefici to studi specifi subject rather than broader area come from it practic . for exampl , it will be much easier to find a good job if you concentr on studi a limit area of academ subject . a recent survay show that about 80 % of larg firm in japan want peopl who have their own special not broader knowledg of mani academ area . in addit , it is much easil to help other peopl if you focu on studi a narrow area of academ subject . from my experi , i found it true . for exampl , i could contribut to a group work by use my expertis that is mass media studi . the studi group that research on the effect of the anim in japan after the second world war , need some peopl whose expertis is the recent histori of the anim . becaus my major is deepli relat to the subject , i could help them . it is obviou that it is veri difficult to support them without concentr on the specif area . secondli , anoth reason whi it is much more advantag to learn a specif area result from it effect . it is clear that it is difficult to rememb all of the area that you have laern befor . accord to a scientif data , your brain much more effect memor a specifi subject instead of a broader area in the long run . therefor , it must be a wast of time to studi a broad rang of accadem area . furthermor , it is also evid that focus on a specif subject lead to lear a broader area of academ subject . mani great scholar such as kant , assert that it is essenti to scrutin a specif area to understand the broader area . i found it true form my experi , too . in conclus , i agre with the idea that it is much more benefici to special a specif subject becaus of it practic and effect .
