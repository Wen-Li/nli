i firmli beliv that , nowaday , young peopl do a lot to help their commun . i am afraid that the amount of help that young peopl provid is not enough , but after all , how can you say how much help is enough ? first of all , in modern time young peopl have the oppoourtun to help their commun while they do militari servic . it is true that thi help might be obligatori , but it is help , nevertheless . militari servic ha evolv all around the world , and in sever countri , quit radic . for exampl , in my home countri ( mexico ) young peopl have the option to either enrol in the militari or do their servic for social caus . more than half the young peopl prefer to teach to the poor or build hous for the need than march and shoot fire gun . thi same trend is current spread in all latin america . second , nowaday there are a lot more oportun to help than in earlier time . there a numer benefiti institut recruit young peopl . i had the opportun to do voluntari work for unicef , and i wa surpris with the amount of young peopl work there for free . i wa even more surpris when i found out that they were overstaf , and that thi overstaff wa often sent to brand new goodwil institut . anoth exampl happen just two week ago , in germani . a bunch of shool kid engag in sever event in order to earn money . all of the money wa given to poor childer in africa . the motto of the action wa `` kid help kid '' . thi innov project wa veri popular , and it is be copi all around the countri . i am sure that it will not take long for it to spread in all europ . a third and final proof is rock concert . if you watch mtv , you would realiz that there are sever rock concert event that donat their profit for good caus . one of them took place just a few year ago , in london . i do n't rememb the exact amount that they got togheth , but i do rememebr that it wa in the million of dollar . all of the artitst perform for free , and all of the profit were donat to the poorest countri in africa . the event also made polit pressur on rich countri , in order to make them forgiv the nation debt of the poorest african nation . for these reason , i think young peopl do a lot to help , not onli their commun , but the whole world . on the other hand , i do not beliv that thi help is enough . i beliv that there is still a lot that can be done .
