basic , i agre with the statement . howev , there are some point to be made clear still , such as , for who advertisemtn make product seem much better than they realli are and to what extent . in the follow text , i will clarifi whi i agre with thi statement , clarifi these point . it is true that we sometim have a feel that some advertis are oversel their product in their commerci . for exampl , the commerci of movi usual show the best part of the movi in the advertis , and make us excit and look forward to thi movi , but sometim it happen that we get disappint with it after see the movi itself . howev , if there is actual overdo of advertis are differ accord to differ receiv . if we take an exampl of coffe , if you do not drink coffe at all , the qualiti of coffe doe not matter to you . in thi case , for you non of the advertis is overdo , becaus from the first of all , you do not expect ani qualiti from the advertis . so my point is that if a certain advertis is overdo or not is depend on the person who are interest in and evalu the product . besid , the degre of overdo is also depend on the receiv as well . if you go to some internet site where the opinion of certain product , such as camera , or mp3 player are public open , you can see variou type of opinion toward the same product . sometim they can be total opposit , such that some say , it wa worthwhil to buy , and the other say it had been better to throw money away . so for those who are satisfi with the product , the advertis of thi product is not overdo , but for those who are not satisfi with qualiti of the product , will take the advertis overdon . to sum up , although depend on who the receiv of the advertis is the statement might not be true in some case , and the degre of overdo vari across the evaluat or consum , i agre that most of the time , the statement is true .
