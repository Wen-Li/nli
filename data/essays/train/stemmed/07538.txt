have you ever seen on televis and advertis that say that you are go to loos ten pound in a week ? i heve seen thi kind of add mani time no just on t.v. but in the news , radio , etc . at the begin i did trust them and i use to buy everi singl product that eventu will make me loos my extra-weight and make me look better . but then i just realiz that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . five month ago i saw on t.v. an add about the pill of the centuri . acoord to them `` the pill will absorv the excess of oil in your bodi in just two week and you will have the shape you have ever drum with '' . i bought the pill and after two week i end up with five more pound . some copani make their product seem much better than they realli are just to sell and enhac their proffit , but how abot the consum ? do they realli care about the frustrat of a girl like me for get weight with their product instead of loos it as they said ? the unswer is easi , they have the money they do not care about the rest . for instanc , that time i rise a claim to the compani against the product . i ask them for my money back . their unswer wa : you should have exercis and not been a cauchpotato , the product that we sell is not a magic pill . in conclus , compani should advetis their product as they realli are . make them seem much better is the same that lie to the consum , and if it is not a maggic product they should advertis it too , so that next time i wo n't be a couch potato and i will enrol in a gym .
