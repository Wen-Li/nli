car are the main mean of transport these day in mani part of the world . but i do not think that thi would be a case in twenti year from now . mani reason can be state in support of thi thesi . the first reason is that the cost of fuel is grow at an alarm rate as the petroleum reserv are becom scarc . also there is no altern to petroleum which is environment friendli and econom . thi will sure reduc the depend of middl class on car . the second reason is that today 's citi are grow at a rapid pace due to the migrat of villag to the citi in search of better work and live condit and also due to industri . thi will increas the time taken to travel to work and other place . also there are traffic jam which can further increas the time . so peopl may prefer public transport like the rapid transit system which is cheap and fast . thi will also help in the govern in gener more money which it can spend for other use purpos . the third reason is that there may be a new invent which can transport peopl quickli and comfort . no type of transport wa constantli use from the time of earli man . from hors to automobil man ha come a long way in invent new type of transport . after such an invent the car might becom a museum exhibit like the hors drawn cabin of the past . all these point can consider bring down the number of car rune on the road . find out new form of energi which are both renew and environment friendli should be an import concern of today 's govern .
