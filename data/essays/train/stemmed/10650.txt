i do not agre with the opinion that the best way to travel is in a group accompani by a tour guid . the reason for my point of view are as follow . firstli , travel alon give a person greater flexibl to plan his/her trip . he is not bound by the physic or other constrait that could be forc on him by hi group member . for exampl , if he were travel in a group and mani of hi groupmat were old he would n't be abl to plan a day of trek or climb . anoth exampl is time constraint . while travel in a group , one ha to wake up when other do and be readi to do what all the other are do . if one person doe not feel like see a place , say like a fort that day , he or she would still have to do it becaus it is in the group plan . secondli , a singl travel can get a better feel of the local cultur by experienc it on hi own while interact with the local . if howev he is travel on a structur tour , he can onli learn about the place by listen to the tour guid and by visitng the well known often touristi place that the guid take him to . also , he would be left with littl time to interact with local popul if he is part of a group and is social with the group member most of the time . i do understand that travel alon can sometim be bore and some peopl are less confid do thing on their own . but , i would like to point out that travel alon is realli lot of fun if the person travel take time to talk to local and probabl do thing the local way for a chang and experi the flavor of the place . thu accord to me it is the more adventur way of travel . if one is lucki one can sometim get to experi uniqu thing by explor alon than by go with the group do the routin thing . i henc encourag everyon to tri travel alon onc in a while . it could be a veri enjoy experi inde .
