when i studi in the high-school my teacher gave a difficult project to do . it wa about comput scienc . i had to preapar a big program with use c++. she also told me if i could n't preapar thi project , i could not pass the class . i wa in depress . first i thougt to refus thi project but than i said myself that i can do that . final i did . it wa a big success dure my high-school life . although i take a lot of risk for thi project . in my opinion , success peopl should tri new thing and take risk than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , becaus it will give them chanc to be social in live and improv themselv in a differ way . nowaday it is veri import to live in a good condit . for thi , you have to need qualifi job , high educ level , car , hous . all of thi reson we have to lernr how to be in success . for exampl we ca n't live without money . it is not so easi to make money . in thi case success is veri import . we have to be social in societi to catch the success way . how it can possibl if we do n't take risk and just do what we alreadi know . i thi situat it will be difficult to catch the success . although everi celebr , politician and compani take risk to start their success . it is the same for student , if you will be social dure the lesson and after lesson in the colleg and do n't be afraid tri to do new thing it will open you success way in your educ live . in conclus as i wrote my experi too , it is import to take risk and tri new thing to be a success person . otherwis it will be veri difficult to live in thi centuri .
