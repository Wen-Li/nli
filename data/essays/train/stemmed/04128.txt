i agre that the young peopl nowaday are not give time to help their commun . the young peopl as soon as they finish their school they await for the colleg to be open . though they do not have so much interest they feel that help their commun degrad their presitg and it matter alot . in my point of view not onli the young peopl but also their parent are respons for that . if they have interest and when they go to help , their parent will restrict them . thi doe not happen in all case but some of the parent might be do . for those parent first they must realiz the need of help for their commun and encourag their young one . if we take the young peopl into consider their parent must be encourag and the student who are interest in help the commun must form a group and must also encourag the other young peopl . the problem of the commun must be discuss among the group and certain measur must be taken . not onli take the certain measur but also they must be kept into action and the parent must guid their children . thi help the young peopl not onli to help their commun but also the nation can chang . take inspir of small group of young peopl each and everi young person will come forward to help their own commun . by help these commun the problem that are suffer by the countri can prevent as well as remov . final young peopl are the main citizen of the countri they should have the respons over their famili , their commun and their countri . thi help each and everi young one to think about themselv as well as about their surround . thi also help them in build their carreer in the right path .
