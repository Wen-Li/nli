i think that the greatest part of advertis give an idea of the product that is not true . industri are onli focus on their busi , on money and for thi reason they are abl to do anyth . in addit i would like to put in evid the fact that sometim annunc are realiz in a particular way aim to provid not real characterist or tri to hide other one . clearli i beliv that statment are develop onli after a deep and long period of studi and reflect about which can be the better advertis , the proper way of underli someth . moreov i beliv that sometim thees kind of statement do n't make sens . for exampl , some year ago my famili decid to buy a new bike and we consid differ opportun . after a few , we thought to have the just product for our need . we watch that bike dure a programm on tv . it wa fantast all of my famili desir to have one of that incred bicycl with that cool color . suddenli we decid to phone and we had to wait for two week . we were wait anxious , imagin what we could do with the new bike , when it arriv . immedi we tri it . i can not explain how much aston and alo worri we began we at the first curv my father broken the wheel . it wa incred but it happen . in that moment all of us realiz whi that bike wa so cheap . from that moment i do n't beliv in ani kind of advertis sinc i ca n't see and test a product by my self . conclud i would like to suggest to everi one to follow my advertis , in thi way we can oblig industri to realiz true annunc .
