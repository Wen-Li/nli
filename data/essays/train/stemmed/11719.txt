thi is a veri good question , in fact i could speak about it for page and page , but here i have to sum all in onli a few word . in my opinion advertis are veri import in our societi . all is support by advertis ! and everywher i go i see advertis for exampl on tv , in the street , at the univers , on newspap , on the train : everywher ! and thi wa an import discov ! becaus , befor the 19 centuri , there wa n't it ! in my opinion now advertis make realli product seem much better than they realli are , becaus the men that have to advertis the product want onli sell it , and they do n't worri if the advertis doe n't correspond to the true . i think that thi is a big problem , and the peopl do n't worri about it , but they might ! the person who sell a product must be honest ! becaus the man who buy the articl must have the thing that is advertis on tv and that he ha thought to buy . for exampl there is an advertis on tv that speak about a cours of english in milano . the cours , is advertis that is in the centr of milano , but it doe n't ! and anoth problem is that is advertis that the first lesson is free , but it doe n't ! in my opinion the person that advertis wrong thing are veri impolit and stupid . the advertis in gener must tell the truth ! anoth exampl could be the advertis of a cake ! in tv the ordinari peopl like me and my famili , see that cake that is veri simpl to do , and all of the ingredi are includ , but in realiti it is not veri simpl and there are n't some of the ingredi ! thi is a veri orribl thing and i 'm veri infuri with the person that advertis these thing .
