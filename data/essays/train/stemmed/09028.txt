to say : `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is a joke . everi year in thi world the number of car circul is increas , new countri are develop , the work 's market need more flexibl and everyon of us want to have the freedom of go wherev and whenev we want . if we think about china we can see that it 's tri to follow the first world with it economi so we can imagin that in the futur they will follow our manner so probabl they will wish as us a car for ownself and a car for their child . if that happen the number of the car will be necessarili higher than now . in addit the number of peopl live on earth is go to becom bigger and so everyon will have hi owncar . anoth problem that can increas the car ' number is that veri often the public transport system is not veri use becaus there are not ride dure the night or the frequenc of the ride is not enough or the train and buse are so busi and owercrowd that can be a real challeng to cach them . in addit , as happen veri often in itali ( as today ) , the public transport is not avail becaus the worker do n't go to work to protest with the govern or with the employ on the other hand the number of avail park will be ever fewer and so that can be a deterr to reduc the car . in addit the request of fuel will be too much higher ( increas by the car ' number ) and as ever happen in the market the petrol price will be so high that someon will have to leav hi own car at home use public transport .
