nowaday , success peopl alway like to tri new thing and take risk in their live . i total agre with thi statement for some good reason . first of all , peopl like to say that `` it is never too old to learn '' . we are still too young to stop tri and learn new thing . if we never tri , we will never know what gonna happen . eventhough sometim we would not be success as a result of tri new stuff , we still can face the bad situat brave and treat it as our treasur experi in our life and we will learn from it as well . for exampl , i came to canada with my famili two year ago , sinc we are not english speaker we had to learn english from `` abc '' . eventhough that is realli hard for us but we never stop our step . and my grandma is 80 year old now and she still want me to teach her how to use internet . second , our world keep chang ever singl day . if we stop learn , we will realli fall behind so we must keep go for ourselv and our next gener . sinc everyth in the world need peopl to creat an develop , we should never stop learn and explor new thing . third , in my point of view , some peopl give up or stop learn thing becaus they are too lazi to tri and they think that will be hard for them , on the other hand , they are kind of satisfi by their own situat . mayb that is realli fine for them to stop go , but they will lose so mani chanc to be success . mayb they will not suffer a lot from some hard experi but at they same time they will lose the chanc to experi the excit process . becaus no bodi can forese the futur so we should tri our best and built a beauti life for ourselv . : )
