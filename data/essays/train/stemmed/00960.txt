young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do ? i do not agre the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , and i state my opinion as follow . whi age ? all peopl should know how to enjoy life regardless of their age . there may be differ interest in enjoy life by age group , but age doe not limit how well peopl enjoy their life , therefor it is ridicur to say that some age group is not good at enjoy life . gener speak , young peopl are consid to be , activ , healthi , outgo , curiou to new thing , with full energi , and go out to seek enjoy . but is it true ? old peopl have more knowledg and experi in life . they are veteran who have surviv mani hardship in life , and they should also have experienc mani joy and fullfil moment in life . it is natur to expect that they know how to cope with hardship in life and make much of joy and fulfil event to enrich their life . on good exampl is thi . onc i wa in a develop countri todo volunt work . in the countri , there were mani young volunt and also older volunt . to my surpris ! older peopl there were so activ and enjoy their life in the countri . they went to off shore fish on a boat and enjoy cook fish they took . they went to camp swim , snorkel , and even dive , and did everyth they could do ! on the other hand , those who got sick were alway young volunt . they had troubl with food , climat , languag , cultur , peopl , and everyth . they just did not have enough experi to cope with the differ environ from their modern , confi and conveni life . fron thi experi , i learn the lesson that at ani age , peopl can tri to enjoy life .
