i disagre with the statement that the success peopl do not tri new thing and they use their preveou knowledg of what they have learn becaus they alreadi know what to do with the task . one of the exampl i can rememb of thi is that a girl who alway sit with me in my lunch period . she alway work veri hard and i could see that she wa a success person and also will be in the futur from what i saw of her . one day when she wa do her homework in front of me , i could not even tell what she wa studi sinc it seem like a difficult thing to me , she ask me if i could understand the question ask in the homework . i told her the it is imposs for me to figur out the problem she ca n't even figur out . so she ask me what she should do so i told her to ask her classmat and ask them what they have answer . but she said no to that and said she is the smartest in the class and all the peopl are not veri inteleg as she so she can not take a risk . that respons wa beyond my expect of what she would say . my person thought wa to ask a friend or two so she get a feel of how she should answer the question but sinc she think she know what to do more than the other , she did not want to take a risk of get the answer wrong . in a way , i think sinc it 's just a homework assign , she can just ask peopl around her . to thi question , ask me if i disagre with the success peopl tri to take a risk , i total disagre becaus success peopl have a pride more than averag peopl so i assum they take the way they think are right .
