what do peopl usual use to guid them when they are travel ? i rememb two year ago , my friend and i went to new orlean , louisiana for a trip . befor we left , we went onlin to find all the attract in the area . howev , we got lost so mani time becaus we did not know the area ; nor did we have a tour guid . therefor , i agre with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus have a tour guid will decreas the chanc of get lost , and it will be less like to get involv in an accid . first of all , have a tour guid when trave will decreas the chanc of get lost . a lot of peopl , when they go to a certain area for the veri first time , inspit of have a map , have the tendenc to get lost . one reason for that is becaus sometim the map that they got onlin are not updat . henc , they get lost on the road , which can caus them to be angri . i rememb while my friend and i were on our way to a mall , despit the fact that we follow all the direct in the map , we still got lost . but , we had a tour guid , perhap , we would not have lost . besid have less chanc of get lost when travel with a tour guid , the possibl of get an accid is also low . in florida , it is said that lot of peopl die when they go visit a place due to car accid . the reason whi is by look at the map while they are drive . but if they had a tour guid who know the area veri well , they would be less likey to crash . thu , a tour guid would be veri helpul when travel . in conclus , i am strongli in favor of the idea of have a guid when travel . for , thi will minim the chanc of get lost and get an accid .
