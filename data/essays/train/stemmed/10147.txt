i am agre with thi statement . young peopl are becom more and more selfish everyday . they are begin to care about themselv onli . there are mainli three import reason for not give enough time for their commun ; they have more duti everi day , they becom to care about themselv onli , and degener of commun . the first reason whi the young peopl doe not help their commun is they have more and more duti everi day . if we look at the past time , we see that the life is more simpl . peopl are not have to do lot of work at the same time . but life is becom more and more complic everyday . for exampl , a child began to go to school at three year old , and he keep to go school at the age of twenti two . mayb he had to work when he is a student . thi give lot of respons to the young and so he doe not have time for help other peopl . the second reason is that they becom more selfish compar to the past . nowaday not onli young peopl but everyon seem to be care onli themselv . peopl are awar of the situt that everyon live alon and die alon . but especi youth are more like to be live alon . thi thought caus young peopl doe not care about commun problem . the third and final reason is degener of commun . nowaday some bad peopl are use some good peopl for their need in societi . and so good peopl start to think that whi would i help a person without ani reason . the main point is peopl becam to not abl to see the purpos of help other peopl . thu young peopl do not spend their time help to other peopl . to sum up , nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun becaus of three main reason . i do not think these are all their fault also the societi are respons of thi situt . yaoung peopl are immit the older peopl . they are just do what they have seen .
