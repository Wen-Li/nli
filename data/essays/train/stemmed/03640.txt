studen often have a choic to made arriv at a certain point of their studi . on one hand they can choos to make gener studi on mani subject , and on the oth , r to choos to special themselv in one specif subject . what argument can help student in their choic . in other word , what infer each choic ? i will discuss both advantag and disavantag of each . to begin , specialis doe not aloud numer knowledg but these are quit precis and more detail . special is closer to a profesion aspect of the work world . but get special in one subject restreint evolut later as the student doe not know mani thing about other subject . for exampl you have a small choic of career and sector when you have made medecin studi as it is a special studi . but for peopl who know what they wand , what they like and what they do not . they will choos for sure a specialis , avoid to learn subject they do not get interest in . on the contrari , have broad knowlegd of mani acaddem subject impli to have multipl abil . it aloud evolut in a futur career as you know thing about divers subject . you can chang sector of activ more easili . broad knowlegd show a capac of adaptabilti as you are more open mind . howev the sum of mani knowledg can not be enought if these are too gener . for me , as i am studi at a busi school , i have made the choic of have a broad knowlegd of mani academ subject . that choic aloud me to learn abour divers subject . it permit me to get more interest by other extra academ subject as i am use to look for divers .
