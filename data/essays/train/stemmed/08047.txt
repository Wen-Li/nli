travel is one of the thing in life that almost everybodi enjoy . everyon , howev , ha hi own opinion about whether nor peopl should be led by a tour guid dure the trip . from my point of view , i think that travel without guid will make us at eas and feel depend . travel wihout guid will help us to get more about the cultur and get us to know the real peopl . i am not say that have a guid is not good . it just will not make us know everyth about the place you are visit . tour guid alway have a map show place where tourist have got to visit . in other word tour guid tend to show peopl onli the beauti place and cultur one . for that reason peopl who visit place by themselv tend to have more knoweldg and inform than those who have been led by a guid . those that go by themself , doe n't have to visit certain place but the whole entir place so they will get to see mani thing than the one that have guid . in addtion peopl that travel by themself visit and see the whole place freeli . the beauti and the ugli one . moreoev , when you travel alon , you will have to ask peopl to show direct so you will get an idea on how peopl think and interact with foreign and even you can ask them question about the cultur and the custom that they have . wherea , travel with a guid you would n't be abl to interact with the nativ speaker and you alway be depend on the group . travel alon is cheaper than travel in group . becaus travel in group you will have to pay a fee to the compani that will take care of you wherea , travel by yourself you will just need your ticket . in conclus , i can say that travel alon tend to be more fun and will help us to know a lot about the cultur and will make us free to visit interest plave wihout rush or pression .
