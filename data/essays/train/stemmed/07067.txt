i agre with the statement that it is import for student to understand idea and concept instead learn fact . as i am a student , i interest in experi someth and learn from experi mani thing . such as for histori studi , i go to europ and look around real palac and build and learn about renaiss and feel aliv histori . it is veri excit way to learn , howev , sometim i ca n't understand some part . from fact , we can get aliv inform and interestig thing but sometim we ca n't catch what we want . as we travel europ for histori studi , we should have lot of background kowledg for know about that . if we do n't have ani idea or concept about art work , we ca n't understand art work dure renaissnac period . and sometim fact make except . lot of experi that done from mani scientist make except . of cours it could be new invent , howev , the fact can lead scientist wrong way to learn about someth . if some scientist did wrong lab and they beilev that they are on right way . howev , it is wrong result . it make confus when other peopl access to that idea . they will confus at which one is right . it is also same at solv the math problem . so i think idea and concept are alway be the basic . when we finish studi basic we can catch someth fast and right way , and even though we face with except , we can prove it easili . for those reason , i prefer that understand basic such as iea first , then later learn fact . although i like to learn fact and enjoy the fact howev , i usual tri to learn basic first . and it is realli import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact .
