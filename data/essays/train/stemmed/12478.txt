i disagre with thi statement . as a young peopl myself , i realli do not have the feel to enjoy my life as much as i could . without have ani health issu , nor special disabl that old peopl might have on a daili basi , i am just so concern about my futur that it doe not permit me to appreci the enjoy of the life . as a young peopl , your entir life is devot to the prepar of the futur and to how to cope with the respons that accompani the life as an adult : a young peopl ha to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the appart to have a famili and to afford for it . thi is whi a young person might go through hi youth without enjoy . as an exampl , most of student do , dure their studi , a job or an internship , to have money for some higher studi or to complet them with profession experi that might be taken into account by their futur employ . in such circumst , how can they enjoy their live as student ? they have no time to go to student parti , or they are too much tire . .. besid , most of them are consciou that these year were suppos to be the best , as their parent told them . young peopl do not enjoy life than older do , and they propbabl enjoy it less than older do . although the energi of the youth render the obstacl of life easier to go through , it is sometim hard to be young . the onli thing that can help a young person to enjoy hi present life is to consid that such a life will get better and better .
