ye thi is a statement what is usual express by person of the older gener ! i gener disagre with the statement that the young gener do not help there commun . ok there might be some case were young peopl have a littl bit forgotten there commun . but if you look at the bigger pictur thi is not the case . young peopl are veri much engag in ther social surround and they are tri to help where they can . mayb the view discrib in the statement ha occur becaus of differ standpoint . person of older gener may have a differ definit of what your commun is . today in a global world the commun ha broard a lot . possibl your commun can exist on mani diffent place . if you help then in your commun it might not be obviru to a person who look just on one spot . i believ that all these young peopl who leav there countri to help in a countri of the third world consid thi place far away from home also as there commun . anoth thing what make it today more difficult to measur the amount of help you offer to your commun is the factor that it is more common to help or e.g. to do some social work in your commun . in the past e.g. environment protect wa a quit new experi for the societi as a whole . therefor person who fought for environment protect in there commun might have been much more visibl for other . today such thing are normal and everybodi expect them to be there . mean that person who believ that young peopl do not help in there commun should redirect there focu to the chang world of today . ok there still is one point to consid . today competit in educ is much bigger than in the past . therefor it could happen that some young person are simpli to busi to help in there commun . but gener thi is not the case .
