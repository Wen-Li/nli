in today 's world , a success individu is someon that ha achiev a goal in hi life , who 's happi with what he ha accomplish , with what he own and ha reach a high level of well-b . everyth seam perfect , but thi also rais a question : can a success person desir more to what he alreadi ha ? will he tri to have new experi and take risk ? i believ there can be two answer to thi question . first of all i must agre with the statement that a success man is go to search for new accomplish and experi becaus otherwis hi exist becom meaningless , and hi journey through life would becom repetit and bore . a person eventu adapt to what he own and to the situat that he live in and is suddenli go to expect new thing to occur , and wish for new event . i believ it 's in the natur of man to desir new thing , a man is alway tri to satisfi hi desir and when they are inde satisfi , he 'll have new desir . it 's a cycl . howev i can also disagre with the previou statement becaus tri new thing and take risk depend also a lot on the individu 's charact . i believ a man ha to be confid with himself and hi abil if he want to tri new adventur . he ha to be courag and respons to take risk . in conclus i both agre and disagre with the idea that success peopl tri new thing and take risk .
