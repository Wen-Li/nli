mani peopl are worri about the qualiti of the educ system at school and high school . one of the debat is if it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my opinion it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . firstli , if you learn idea or concept you can appli them in more topic and you can understand other issu base in the same principl . on the other hand , if you learn onli fact , you have a littl knowledg about a few thing or question . learn idea doe not mean onli that the teacher tell you someth and you believ it by heart . howev , it mean that with thi idea , you can develop more and appli them in fact . for instanc , if someon teach you the concept of the physic mouvement of car , you may transfer it to fact . you will be abl to put a car in mouvement if you understood the basic principl . if someon learn onli fact , thi person will not be abl to think by herself becaus her knowledg and experi is not realli wide . therefor , i think that learn idea and concept may help the person to develop her mind and way of think . howev , sometim peopl can not understand the idea or concept without exampl , so they prefer to learn onli practic thing . to summar , in my opinion is alway better to learn idea or concept than onli fact becaus it will be more use for the futur career of student . the student will learn idea or concept about one topic but they can extend them to sever field . furthermor , they will develop their skill and improv their way of think by themselv .
