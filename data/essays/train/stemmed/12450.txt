i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . with time the awar of benefit that come out of help commun are found root in the societi . form commun and give few product hour of schedul ha becom routin in most of the young peopl as they realis the fact that work for the commun would develop the societi which constitut them too . there are lot of commun form base on differ aspect like - from the profess one is into , the local one live , the age group , the univers one is into , to the food one is inclin to . the commun form base on the profession similar would help them discuss what skill must to develop to have a better valu in the market . so all the young peopl would defin be penchant to join the commun . similarlli , the peopl of a local form a group would help them to have their home a better place to live in by take up program like clean and green which indirectli help the enviro to get out of deforestr and in thi process of keep the local clean the sewag system will also be improv . so it the entir public that enjoy the fruit of form a commun . thu i think that all young peopl will defin be enthusiast to be a part of all commun which lead to their welfar inturn . for exampl , when i wa do my first year of graduat there were mani articl about not use plastic in ani form as it lead to cancer . but there were veri few who bother to pay attent . and all our classmat took an initi form a commun which wa againt use plastic . we organis road show , disuss the disadvantag of it with the enviroment care board member and took their help a put an appeal to the governa bang the product . do so , we success to an extent in give plastic a stop . so i feel that it mostli the young peopl who are awar of the current day circumst and form commun to find the solut to make the societi a better place to live in .
