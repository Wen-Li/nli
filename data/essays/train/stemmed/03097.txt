the advertis is a way to promot a product with the goal to sell it for the price you gave him . in thi definit is an obviou answer to the subject : advertis have to make product seem much better than they realli are to be effici . but today the advertis is not onli focus on the product itself , also on the imag of a brand . those two are differ way to promot and sell a product , and therefor are differ answer of the topic . both of them will be studi in a paragraph . the advertis that promot directli the product is gener a demonstr of it effici , it power , etc . advertis are obvious attract to make the product seem much better than it realli is . it can work if the product is anyway the best of it categori or for a certain period of time . but if the custom discov a controversi `` truth '' about the real capac of the product , the lie of the advertis will be a veri bad promot and will result to an imag of a firm not capabl . for exampl , soni promot a lot it comput with advertis that show them veri power . unfortunatli , their batteri wa defici , so soni ha now to call them back to chang them . the imag of soni is now affect by thi problem , and moreov becaus the advertis lie . the second type of the advertis is when the brand onli tri to give herself an attract imag instead of tri to promot a specif product . for exampl , the coca-cola compani doe n't promot directli it drink , but tri to give an imag that is attract for the custom . in thi kind of advertis , there is no need to give a fals imag of the product becaus it is onli the brand that will attract more custom . to conclud , i will say that the differ way to promot a product and the problem they each carri show how the topic is too gener to be a true statement .
