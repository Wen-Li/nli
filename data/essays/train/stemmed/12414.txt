to have a look in the futur and say that in twenti year there will be fewer car than now , accord to me is a wrong judgement . over a period of time technolog will improv and so will the popul while peopl get more and more engross in thi practic world . histori ha shown us that as time increas civil also improv and with it the popul . in develop countri like india and pakistan the popul is ought to increas by a tremend amount in the near futur and thi predict can be global appli . with the increas in popul the movement in and out will increas proportionali and as a result car which are faster medium of trasnsport on road are bound to take a huge leap in their number . moreov with the advanc in the live style of peopl more will be abl to afford a car and also with consider increas in work , schedul are start to get bussier which will demand faster movement and henc more number of car . agre that technolog increas with time but one cant find ani mean by which technolog will take a leap to develop airplan for faster movement on a larg scale and replac car in such a short period of two decad and will not be afford for common man either . moreov scientist have develop altern fuel for car like cng , lpg , electr and so on . these advanc in fuel clearli reveal that in the near futur one will see more of car and that too work on a varieti of fuel . further these fuel be cheaper than their petroleum counterpart , will attract more custom and will rule the market for roadway transport . the onli other mean of roadway transport are motor bike , buse and bicycl but with the increas in popul peopl will prefer more of car than of two wheeler and sinc with the increas in work schedul there will be increas in number of buse but not as much as compar to car which is convini way of faster transport . thu given a period of time popul , advac in live , altern fuel , busi schedul of peopl all go in hand will contribut to increas in number of car in use .
