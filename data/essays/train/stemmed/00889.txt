even though a travel with a tour guid is more comfort , safe , conveni , i disagre that it is the best way to travel . there are sever reason to support my idea . first , a group travel is not memor and use . i experienc both type of trip . when i accompani with a male guid , he solv everi problem and arrang all reserv . therfor , i could spend veri peac time in japan . howev , it did n't give ani use experi to me , and i total forgot all my trip quickli . on the other hand , i went to china by myself . i reserv my airlin ticket and hotel . also , i tri to commun with chines peopl with chines to find some famou place , to buy gift and to eat tradit food . i met divers peopl and learn a lot how to prepar for a trip . sometim it wa too tire to do anyth . howev , it wa so exit and exot . eventu , i still rememb everyth in china . therefor , i do not agre with thi statement that a group trip is the best way . next , a group travel is fix . whenev i encount mani new interest place in other countri , i would like to chang my schedul . howev , it is imposs in a group travel sinc a guid have to arrang all tourist . in contrast , i can handl my plan accod to my interest if i travel alon by myself . i can go everywher i want to . in india , i met a kind woman . she wa interest in my countri and me , so she want to invit me to her hous . i could accept easili her suggest becaus i wa alon . i met her husband and her three children , and she prepar veri wonder dinner for me . moreov , i selpt in her hous . i experi indian tradit hous , and save my money . for these reason , i think a group travel with a guid is not the best way to travel . even though i may encount danger or strang situat , i prefer travel alon .
