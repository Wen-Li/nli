accord to me what i believ is special in one specif subjest . while do special on one specif subject we will be know deep subject contain in it . and it is veri easi to understand when deel with one subject rather with mani . if we want to have broad knowledg of mani academ , it will have a great complic while do that . but if we studi one specif subject there wont be such difficulti . have a knowledg and broad knowledg will make a differ . so have knowledg it mean gener awar on mani academ is possibl and compulsori . for exampl if we take children , i mean from 4 to 14 year they will be learn about mani subject but not broadli . and when we take arround 15 to 17 age group student they are restrict to studi onli on few subject and when we take 17 to 21 age group student that is undergradu studi will restrict the student to choos onli one subject . and in graduat level they are ask to choos onli one branch in that subject studi in the under graduat level . thi is all becaus our educ system is design in such a fashion . they are decor base on the experinc the educ peopl and scholer ha on the educ system . well i think scholer will not go wrong . final i would like to convay that special on one specif subject will give more command and author on that suject rather than to have broad knowledg of mani academ which will ultim lead to confus and less command , author and grip on mani subject .
