succesful peopl alway are research for new thing and take risk rather than count onli on what is domin by them . the first reason that support thi statement is the fact that `` famili busi '' are condenm to disappear . if the famili member do n't do someth to capt new market , or to introduc new techniqu that make their busi more effect ( reduc cost , and avoid the compet take the leadership ) the famili busi will end . one exampl of thi are the famili that have been involv in a tradit bakeri compani . new oven techniqu make the bread less expens to produc . new bread flavour make the busi more attract for old and new custom . the second reason are what i call `` the live experi '' . i can mention sever name on thi essay , but i will mention just onli two : bill gate will not have the compani he ha at thi moment if hi motiv to explor new market and new technoligi wa n't big enough to take some risk . he took a big risk develop `` window '' instead keep the old way to run program . the do wa lead the oper system market dure that time , but bill gate thought further and explor a new way to show infrom , window wa born . donald trump would not becam multi millionari if hi quest for new busi research , and the evid tendenc of take risk wa n't part of hi attitud . hi divers goe from casino in nevada , to golf resort in california . there is a spanish say `` do n't put all the egg in the same pot '' ; thi say match perfectli in to trump 's busi vision and the need of look for new horizon . for these reason succesful peopl is alway tri new thing and take risk instead onli do what they they alreadi know how to do well .
