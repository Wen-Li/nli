i agre with the statement that it is import for the student to understand the concept and idea well and not just learn the fact . the main reason for my view are given below . first reason for my veiw is that we need to implement the idea and concept in real life and just learn fact will not help our caus . what we learn in school or colleg is of import in real life and we need to implement it in real life scenario , so just by learn the fact we wo n't be abl to implement them . concept of physic or chemistri , which are essenti in our day to day life , will never be clear to us . we can learn that earth rotat around the sun , but we will never underst the reason for the same until we understand the concept and idea behind the factor like rotat and graviti . so just learn fact we limit our knowledg and understand of the small small thing which we have to deal in daili life and from time to time . second reason for my view is that the learn fact are easili forgotten as compar to idea and concept which we understand well . we do n't forget the concept which we understand well and are abl to rememb them a long time . the student who just learn for exam have less knowledg and forget the subject earli as compar to those who understand the concept . howev , it is also sometm neccessari to just learn the fact and not understand . like the case of histori subject . we are not requir to understand the concept just learn and know the fact . in conclus , it is import to underst the concepst and idea as we need to implement them in our daili life and also we tend to rememb the concept which are well understood as compar to just learn them . but there are situat where just learn is requir like the case of know the histori subject .
