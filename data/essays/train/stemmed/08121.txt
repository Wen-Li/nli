some peopl hold that it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . as far as i am concern , i 'd like to take a neutral stand on thi issu . my opinion go as follow . in the first place , with no doubt , the societi aspir talent who have comprehens knowledg of mani academ subject . for instanc , in some compani , a secretari is expect to perform not onli in administr , but also in relat area such as bank , account , market and hr . nowaday it 's not uncommon that more and more compani , in order to acquir more profit , often cut back cost on the number of staff . make one staff do the work of two or even three is not unusu . employe at work are expect to be equip with broad knowledg , so that they can perform in all area . as we all know that to do well at work , you have to be an all-round . mani peopl have been awar that languag command and comput skill all have becom common tool , all modern peopl need to know how to use a comput . we have to admit that a lawyer who could speak english and ha good comput knowledg can do better than hi or her counterpart who doe not speak a foreign languag . howev , in certain field , peopl need to be special in one specif subject . thi is especi true in scienc and technolog field . to do well in a certain field , peopl have to be special in it . especi those student who take doctor degre , some are specif in glass , some in optic fibr . in my opinion , even an account can do veri well if he or she get onli special in account . we need to be object in thi issu . depend on what field you are in and what job you are take , either ha no harm .
