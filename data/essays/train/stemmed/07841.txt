understand idea versu learn fact last week i attend a class in histori , and the teacher began talk about the arab histori and speak what had happen dure these age reach the twenteenth centuri . then i had a physic class and the teacher wa explain the lesson . but thi time the teacher wa tri to make us understand the concept and how thing work . the next day i rememb all what we took in physic but non in histori . and that is whi teacher nowaday tend to teach their student by make them understand the concept . teach believ due to previou experi , that the knowleg get stuck in the student 's head by tri to make him understand the idea and not just tell him some fact . it is better thi way sinc the student will be abl to understand the idea first then appli thi concept from what he understood . but if he just learn the fact without understand it he wo n't be abl to appli what he studi , and thu it wo n't get stuck in hi memori . in addit to that if the student understood the topic he might enjoy it and tri to expess hi idea and ever particip and that is what motiv him to know that concept and never forget it . where as if you just told him to studi certain fact he would n't be interest and might not focu on the subject , and thu he might not memoris it and then he will forget it . sinc with repetiton and understand the student will know the concept without even studi sinc the moment he understood the idea it got stuck in hi memori . and that is what happen to me . so it is much better for student to understand the idea and the concept rather than learn fact which might look kind of boor to the student . and these day student tend not to studi and memoris but they rather underst , which will enabl them to studi it much easier .
