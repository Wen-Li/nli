in my opinion , it would be better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in a particular subject . two main reason can be given to support my opinion . firstli , have knowledg about a broad rang of subject widen a person 's perspect . in today 's world , we are confront with mani differ situat each of which requir a uniqu way of handl . a project about the construct of a bridg can be given as an exampl to thi situat . a construct engin deal with just the calcul requir to make the bridg resist to the pressur of car and truck that will pass on it . howev , there are mani complementari aspect of thi issu that should be taken into account . the financi avail of the project , the environment consequ of build the bridg there , the possibl resist of peopl live at that neighbourhood should all be consid . if that engin took cours regard those issu , he would sure approach the issu in a more comprehens way which is necessari . second , have broad knowledg of mani subject give a person the flexibl to special in whatev field he wish to . unfortun , the best exampl show the import of thi includ me . i wa entitl to regist to the comput engin depart as a result of the univers entranc exam . in the begin , thing went well but soon afterward the nightmar began . i understood that i would not want to be a comput engin and i had to reenter the exam in order to chang my depart . i had no other choic . i wa lucki to be abl to chang my depart afterward but mani peopl in my countri can not find thi opportun and thi forc them to have a job they do n't like for all their live . obvious , if student were given the opportun to gain knowledg about a varieti of subject in their first year in the univers and then choos what they want , the problem would be elimin . as a result , acquir knowledg about variou subject seem better becaus of provid peopl with a deeper outlook on event and give them the opportun to choos the career that is best suit to them .
