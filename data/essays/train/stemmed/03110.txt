i do n't agre with thi statement becaus i think that have a deep knowledg in one specif subject is much better . i think thi becaus , even if a broad knowledg of mani academ subject could be import , in my opinion the world of our day requir particular skill to the person . if a person had a knowledg of mani subject , he would n't be abl to have a deep knowledg of everi these subject , and thi could mean that he could n't be abl to solv determin problem which requir a deep knowledg of a pattern . for exampl let us think about a manag who know all the kind of problem which could happen in an enterpris but who who ha n't a graet prepar in order to solv them becaus dure hi academ career he did n't special in one particular subject . in thi case i think that even if thi manag ha a great prepar due to hi enlarg studi , he would n't be abl to give hi contribut to the compani . i also think that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject automat impli the fact that it ca n't be the result of a deep prepar in all these kind of subject . i think that thi kind of knowledg could be import to a person own satisfact but if we assum that everi subject could have been studi in deepth , it would have impli a lot of time spent ( ten year or more ) and i think that it wouldn'b of great import becus in my opinion the world requir our skill as soonest as we can ! besid i also think that the world doe n't have the will to expect us complet our long studi in all the subject , but it expect that we will abl to provid it a quick solut it problem .
