i agre with thi statement . advertais is take an import place in the decis to buy for a custom . i think that thi fact is thank to the popular of televis . spot are becom more and more frequent and they continuosli influenc who is whatch televis . moreov , we can see advertais everywher : on the bu , on the wall of underground , in the newspeap . .. thank to all these reason , compani are develop the sector of advertis , becous in thi way they can reach the costum and so they have more chanc to sell product . also thi tendenc is effect to know how the peopl is influenc by advertis and how is necessari show a product in the best way . sometim the firm present a product describ all it properti , in particular all it qualiti . but they put particular attent in hid the neg characterist becous these are a sort of neg advertais . in order to show good desider and amaz they tri to invent some good qualiti and in thi way they make a product much better than it realli is . as far as i am concern i think that thi fals advertis is a neg aspect of the busi of our day . compani should do everyth in order to sell their product , sometim they even lie , that is orribl becous they do n't garante the costum . when i want to buy someth for me or especi for a present , i put all my attent in what i am buy , and a logic consquenc is that i buy someth that is famou , that is trendi . infact too not make ani mistak i prefer to buy a product with a good brendt , that probabili should be better than one that is unknown . furthermor the brendt should give to the costum sure characterist , as good materi for a dress , or good ingredi for a food . thu a direct consequ of thi fals advertais , accord to me , is the increas of product of a famou brendt that are more expens and the small success of normal product .
