in today 's societi , which is character by a hectic way of life , the desir of go everywher employ fewer and fewer time ha domin the transport market . the result is that in recent year the number of car use ha increas spectacularli . but , will thi trend continu in the follow year ? thi is a veri controversi issu . on one hand , the enviroment problem and futur suppli shortag are push govern to face the transport problem in differ way . on the other hand , there are a big and power industri which will make hard to abandon the system base on fossil fuel . in my opinion , the current situat is bad enough to compel societi to offer altern solut to thi problem which will result in the decreas of the number of car . to begin , the amount of fossil fuel avail is decreas veri rapidli . therefor , some time in the futur will be no oil or ga . thi is a cogent argument which should compel govern to take some measur to prevent that situat . thi open up a bunch of altern possibl to provid anoth mean of transport differ from car . the first solut should focu in reduc the use of fossil fuel . thi includ enhanc the use of public transport , foster the use of bycicl in citi and so on . further solut will take into account the substitut of fossil fuel depend car . the new technolog develop to overcom thi problem will result in new type of machin , which can be similar to car , but will be no longer the tradit car . anoth crucial point , is the enviroment issu . dure the last year more and more peopl are awar that the use of car contribut highli to the pollut . in fact , in some big citi , such as mexico d.f. and milan , strict measur had to be taken in order to reduc the air pollut . such measur includ restrict in the acc to the center , in the day of the week one can take the car , etc . in concluss , all the possibl solut indic that a reduct in the number of car circul need to take place . sum up , keep in mind all the problem mention abov , it is clear that the current trend regard the use of car can not be held . enviroment , social and technolog argument indic that new mean of transport will gradual take the place of today 's car . therefor , the number of car in twenti year will be definit less than the number of car use today .
