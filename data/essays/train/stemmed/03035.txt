first of all i think that is import for everybodi have a good knowledg that is necessari for live , for discuss and resolv problem or situat of the normal life . so after thi , i think is better to have a knowledg compos by differ subject than to special in just one specif subject . it s import to have a mix cultur for to be abl to think , to discuss , and to partecip in differ convers . you need an educ that should involv mathemat , philosophi , music and histori , .. and mani other . you can special in one specif object that you feel more abl to do , or just becaus you realli like . but it s necessari to have a background befor . for exampl i am a musician . i have studi mani year music at school with other mani differ subject . but after mani year i felt abl to choos one , to decid which i like more than other . i have invest a lot of time to studi music . but i alway need to read , to be with peopl that are studi someth differ . you don t need just to know how you read the music for to be a realli good musician . you realli need to read , to go to the teather . . everyth should improv your abil , your specif subject for what you are invest a lot of your time . it s better have both , have the possibl to be educ with a background of knowledg until that moment where you feel abl to choos one specif subject . so i think you need to do both of thi passag . . in my opinion these two differ approach must be both present . one follow the other . i think it s not right to choos one of these two approach , or say that one is better than one other .
