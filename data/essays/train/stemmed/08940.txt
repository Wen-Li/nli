i disagre with the statement , that it is better to have wide knowledg of mani subject than to special in one specif subject . i believ that jack of all will never be master of none . broad knowledg over mani subject will never make ani person perfect . in the competet world peopl are prefer with speciali rather than with out ani speciali . broader knowledg in mani subject is good but one should have speciali in hi major , so that he can find a good career in the particular subject . phd is the high academ degre , and those with phd 's are veri specialis in a particular subject . they are consid to be the expert in that particular field . they have wide oppurtun due to their expertis . most of the higher degre requir to do a specialis in a particular subject . it is becaus to make the student perfect in that particular field which will help him to build a good career . in the world most the discoveri and invent are made by the subject expert , who have a good knowledg in the particular field of invens . all these invens are possibl onli becaus of their special . usual in school we will be learn mani academ subject to get familar with them and to know in which subject we have interest . later we will be choos interest subject and will do a specialis in that particular subject . all the compani requir expert in particular field , a person have a broader knowledg in variou subject will not be consid as a compet person for a particular job . i believ get a broader knowledg in variou subject is veri difficult , and more over it will not fetch even . most of the univers are prefer to produ student with higher degre who hava a specialis . thi indic the import of have a specialis . in conclus i believ a specialis in particular subject is veri much use ful for career and ultim for the beter of life .
