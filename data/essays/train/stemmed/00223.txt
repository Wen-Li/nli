i am convic that student should understand idea rather than learn fact . nevertheless , i think that it is often worth pay attent to fact and , more precis , regard them as a strate point for a deeper studi . first , i think that learn fact without tri to deepli understand their origin is useless . for instanc , in econom , there are lot of fact concern the way unemploy agent behav when they tri to get inform about vacant job . when i wa at the univers , i have been precis told about the percentag of worker that use word of mouth commun to get a job instead of formal mean of get inform ( newspap , unemploy agenc and so on . .. ) . to know such a percentag is realli useless but make more fundament question emerg . when a student understand the idea and concept that lie behind an observ fact , he realli develop hi capac to adapt to differ problem and situat . he is then abl to analys a greater number of situat than the number he could have analys learn the fact itself . to restrict hi attent to fact prevent him from develop hi autonomi .
