that is actual a topic which is dicuss by a lot of student i know year after year . a lot of them argu that lern fact have noth to do with the intellig of a person and are rarley need in one 's futur job . to a certain degre i agre with their opinion becaus an engin should understand that he is not allow to use a weak materi for the fondat of a hous but that he rather ha to choos a strong materi one can build on . that is noth one have to learn but what is rather logic . other , on the conrari argu that some fact are necessarli to understand a certain idea . my favourit exampl is that an engin who finish hi studi will not be abl to build a hous or even a machin if he doe not know which compon exist to build or to construct them . that is whi engin have a special subject in which they learn which rang of compon can be use to construct a machin or to build a hous . to be honnnest , i believ that there ha to be someth in between . i know a lot of student who learn a lot and thu know mani specif fact in their field but they do not have a structur for their knowledg . one could say : `` they can not see the forest becaus of the tree . '' they have problem to analys a new situat becaus they are not openmind but caught by their thought . on the other hand i know quit a few student who actual do not learn at all but they still can analys a situat properli and give a good answer . nevertheless , they lose ground as soon as a dicuss becom more detail . final , i have to say that i do not agre with that answer becaus i believ that understand idea is as import as lern fact are . to be more precis , i believ that one have to learn fact in the begin to understand a concept or an idea properli . that is the way i use to learn dure my studi and that is what i would recommend to everyon .
