i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i do not think it is true becaus there are mani reason i think that older peopl enjoy their life more . the first reason whi i do not disagre that statement is that it is depend on what is personalti the peopl have . there are young peopl who doe not realli like to do someth and just be alon . i do not think they are realli enjoy theirn life . on the other hand , there are some old peopl who realli like to go out and hang out with their friend . my host mother is an exampl of old person who enjoy her life even more than me. she is in her 60 now and she love to go out with her friend and go shop . when she doen not have work to do she alway make a appoin with her friend to do someth . she never like to be home all day do noth . the second reason is that there are lot of thing that allow old peopl do but not for young peopl . gener old peopl ha more time and money than young peopl have . young peopl have to studi if they are still in school . and they get certain money from their parent so they do not realli have lot of money to go out all the time . for exampl , my mom and dad love to travel other countri with their friend and they do have money to afford it . of cours i want to travel with my friend too but i do not have money for it . in conclus , i do not think the statement is right . enjoy the life is depend on how the person 's person is like . and there are a lot of thing that allow onli old peopl do .
