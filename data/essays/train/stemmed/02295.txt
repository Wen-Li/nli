i beleiv that a person face all sort of risk to becom a success man . without take ani risk it is imposs to achiev greater height and becom a success person . therefor i strongli agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well . '' today we are enjoy a lot of invent and discoveri made by success peopl who took risk and even sacrif their live . for exampl aeroplan , space craft etc . if the right brother would have thought whi to take risk and invent an aircraft , we would not have travel from one countri to other countri . same thing with aircraft peopl would never been land on moon . all these we are enjoy today are the risk taken by success peopl to invent new thing rather than do what they alreadi know . i have my own experi regard thi , i have a stage fear and i do n't particip in ani task that involv a larg group of audienc . when iam do my graduat , there wa a scienc fare competit go on in my citi , the one who stand first will be given scolarship for graduat . i wa inspir by my father , he is veri courag , infact he work for the armi . i took risk and particip in the fare by display and explain how variou stimul like agonist and antagonist act on frog 's heart . i stood first in the competit and from then onward , i start particip in all competit . i beleiv one should take risk and enjoy the fruit of success . take risk also involv money . invest a huge amount of money in a busi , for which success is unpredict is a type of risk . my uncl invest a huge amount on hi softwar busi . he work veri hard to invent new softwar and becam a success man in notim . now he is abl to provid job for hunder 's of peopl . i final conclud that , success depend on tri new thing by take risk rather than do what we know .
