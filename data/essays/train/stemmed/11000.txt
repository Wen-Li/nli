becaus of two reason , i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason are as follow , 1 ) idea and concept are the fundament of studi and 2 ) learn fact doe not alway explain us everyth . first of all , i believ it is necessari for us to studi and understand idea and concept in order to understand the specif materi and advanc one as well . for exampl , when student want to answer math question , the first thing that they have to do is to konw the idea and specif fomula . if they do not know what is `` to add , '' they can not even answer the question by themselv , even though the student know what the answer is go to be . in addit , if they do not know the idea and concpet , they can not progress to the advanc studi becaus the advanc studi is particulari base on the main and basic idea and concep . second , i think that learn fact doe not alway tell us everyth . for exampl , when the student studi the typic exampl of the law , such as who won the specifc case in the court , and so on , the student can not explain whi they won in the specif case if they do not understand idea and concept . in addit , onli to learn fact doe not tell us the process whi fact were born . to learn the fact is also importnat when the student learn at school , howev , the fact can not explain everyth , onli idea and concept can . as mention befor , it is also import to learn fact becaus fact sometim give us more clear explan . in gener , the idea and concept are more obscur that fact and it is more difficult to understand them perfectli . howev , onli idea and concept can be the base of the studi and fact can not be . therefor , even though it is also import to learn fact , it is more import for student to understand idea and concpet for thier advanc studi .
