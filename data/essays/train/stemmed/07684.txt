i do not agre with the idea that success peopl are the one that tri new thing and take risk , instead of onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are sever reason that make me not agre with thi statement , but i would like to concentr in three of them . firstli , i do not believ that been a risk taker or an innov person is a necessari condit to achiev success in life or your profession field . in fact , everi aspect of life ( interperson relat , famili , labor relat , religion , social life ) and academ disciplin , or profession field , requir a differ approach to succesf interact and solv problem . secondli , take risk might lead to failur . even though fail is not alway neg , it repres an interrupt on a task or process , which certainli caus delay on accomplish a project 's goal or task . thu , incur in activ or behavior that involv high chanc to fail will definet not lead to success . lastli , it is import to consid that in fact , do the same thing lead you to special , which will make you an expert on do someth or in a specif field and probabl a success and well-known person in that particular area . opposit , it is realli difficult for someon to do someth new or an invent if he or she doe not know the object or field . thi mean that peopl requir certain amount of knowledg and familiar with a field or object to actual make a new thing that will deliv person success . i believ that the key to success is not hidden behind be the most origin or risk take person , but to actual get to know what you do . go deep into one activ , deal with it in a daili basi will allow someon to achiev success .
