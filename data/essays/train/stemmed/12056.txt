i have alway enjoy travel . everi year i have the chanc to come to the unit state for three month by myself to improv my english languag skill ( i have been do thi for more than five year now ! i guess i am veri lucki ! ) . sinc i have the chanc to spend sever hour a week at my friend 's travel agenc i notic that most of the peopl prefer be led by a tour guid , i wonder if that is becaus they are afraid to get lost or not be abl to enjoy their vacat at the best or becaus they are too lazi to organ their vacat by themselv . but it also true that if you want to go on a cultur vacat you do need a tour guid who show and describ you all the place , the monument , the histori of the place that you are visit and all those beauti thing that everi place in the world ha to offer to the tourist . plu if you go to a place where a foreign languag is spoken you might not be abl to enjoy the vacat becaus of that . person i think that , sinc i am a `` free spirit '' , i love organ my trip by myself . i just like to wake up in the morn when i want to without worri too much if my trip mate are alreadi downstair with the tourist guid , readi to go to explor the new place ! but i also think that if you decid to go to a place where there is a littl danger , have a tourist guid who tell you where you can or ca n't go is realli import for your safeti . i think that as long as i will have the chanc to travel by myself i will keep do that . mayb i will chang my mind onc i get older ! who know . ..
