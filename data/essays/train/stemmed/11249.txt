the most import thing to remeb is the mean of the word advertis . advertis mean to commun to a specif target the best carachterist of the product or of the servic for that focu target . the advertis have to follow a basic rule : sell out as much as possibl . if a man ask to a nice woman go out for dinner , what do you think he will show of himself to her ? it 's a veri easi question , everybodi know . he will be eleg , nice and kind . he will pay the dinner also for the girl and he will drop up her to her hous . what about if we go to an interview for a veri import job ? we will show our best . the boss will know that nobodi can be perfect but if we will not show our best in such a import interview we are not so clever . it 's up to us : we have to sell yourself ! i think is the same think with the advertis . they show us the best but we know that someth ca n't be as good as show there . the big compani spend a huge quantiti of money to do advertis and they must have a feedback after . ovvious they tri to show you the best thing in their product or in their servic becaus they want that the custum buy them . but we also must rememb that now the law is veri strickt about the fals advertis . the compani have to follow the rule and ca n't tell to the target someth untru . in everi situat we tri to show our best and they tri to do the same with the product or the servic . it 's their job . it 's import to not be superfici in everi aspect in our life : from the advertis to the peopl we could meet . rememb to be focu in what we realli need . there is a child stori with a littl girl with a red dress . everyon know thi stori and everi stori ha a moral : they want to teach us to do n't believ in everyth . so let 's tri to remeb the littl girl and her adventur !
