in my opinion , it wo n't be an exagger that young peopl do not spend time on their commun . it is true that young peopl seldom do thing for their commun . the reason is simpl . young peopl have other thing to do and ; most of all , few young peopl have the sens of commun . seldom young peopl in my countri are requir to do anyth for their commun . they are often be told that they have to studi hard . their repos is to focu on their studi and their school work is alway on the top of prioriti . to their `` conseder '' parent , thing like help their commun is taken as an bother to their children . even the task is as easi as clean the sidewalk around the commun , parent will usual choos to finish by themselv rather than get their chidren involv in . on the other hand , few of young peopl nowaday have the sens of commun . they even do n't know who their neighbor are . how can it possibl to ask those indiffer peopl to pick the garbag scatter in the hous next to their hous . they usual think that their will solv the problem in the commun becaus it is adult 's bussi . they are seldom be educ to help other . they claim that they are too young to have opinion and abil to make descion about their commun . i do n't think that it is all the young peopl 's fault that they pay littl attent to their commun . their parent should also be respons to thi situat . our younger shoud be taught to be more earnest to their live environ instead of care onli about themslv .
