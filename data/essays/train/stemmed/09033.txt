is the number of car go to decreas dure the next twenti year ? that is a question we have to studi accord to mani point of view . firstabl we have to determin if we have enough ressourc like petroleum to make our carswork . we do n't have precis figur about that subject . that let us think that produc countri prefer to hide them to make us think that it is not a problem . howev the amount of petroleum is still decreas . that 's whi we can think that it wil have a bad influenc on the number of car dure the next few year . we may escap to thi fate thank to biotechnolog . environment effort should be made to transform a car into a less pollut machin . we have to protect the ozon layer . research tri to creat oil thank to some plant ' speci . it is an ecolog solut to keep a certain amount of car on earth . but we will have to adapt car to thi new oil and that cost time , money and need government authoris to make it possibl . anoth aspect which can inflenc the number of car that will be use in twenti year is that everi owner ha some habit . he use more or less hi car . some peopl have to take their car each time he ha to make shop , to see other person . they can do anyth els than use their car . research ha to develop anoth way to move so that ani physic effort ha to be provid . inde , a man is not go to take hi bicycl to replac hi car just becaus of environment reason . he will not be enough concern about that . but if there is anoth choic to move , i think i will agre to tri it . to conclud , i think it will be veri difficult to decreas the number of car in the next twenti year mainli becaus of econom and practic reason . howev , in my opinion , the environment problem the number of car caus must make us react to creat a less pollut machin than car . everybodi must to keep in mind that the whole planet is in danger and we have to chang our behaviour .
