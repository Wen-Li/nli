student often have to learn a lot of thing in their studi . the basi for them is to learn the fact and then to understand idea and concept behind these idea . so it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus it is imposs for student to keep all fact in mind , becaus they would not be abl to connect the fact they have learn in one subject with the fact of anoth subject and becaus they would not be abl to interpret all the fact ' consequ . of cours it depend on a student 's cours how mani fact he or she ha to learn but in 4 year of studi , there are a lot of fact which are imposs to keep them all in mind . i studi histori and i am now in the 6th semest . each day we learn a lot of fact and date . i , person , know onli about a 10th of all fact and date i have heard dure my studi . and these 10 % are alreadi a lot . moreov a student would not be abl to connect the fact he or she ha learn in one subject with the fact he or she ha learn in anoth subject . the student would not see a depend or other relat between two fact . a friend of mine e.g. studi economi . there he ha to learn fact in financ and fact in market . one might think that these two subject have noth in common but it might happen that someth ha to be calcul in market in the same way it ha to be done in financ . here would be a relat which a student who onli learn fact , would not see . then the interpret of the fact ' consequ is import . the student have to know how some e.g. key number are creat . it might happen that they are not true . all in all it is to say that the basi of studi are the fact . without these fact it would be imposs to come to new idea and concept . but more import are idea and concept to see behind the fact and to discuss them . onli by learn fact thi would be imposs . the student would not be abl to connect fact of sever subject and he would not be abl to see the fact ' consequ .
