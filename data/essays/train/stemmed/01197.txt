first of all , it should be made clear what we intend with broad knowledg and specif knowledg of subject . if for broad knowledg we imagin the situat of a student that attend spare cours on random subject like in sociolgi and mathemat or in anatomi and mass communicationb whilst for specif knowledg a student that take cours focus in social studi , limit the extens of hi studi onli to cours that are strictli relat like sociolog and antropolog , i think i would prefer to have a specif knowledg . the reason is that a superfici overview on differ subject can result extrem fragment and scatter and it can bring the person to be unsur and uncomfort with all the topic . moreov , without follow ani structur , the student can be lost in the vagu and wide-spread extens of knowledg , he could wander from one field to anoth without catch a concret point . therefor , i would rather agre more to a specif approach on learn knowledg . a specif approach focus the attent of the student onli to some aspect of knowledg . thi give to the student confid with the topic and the skill to treat and work out news insight . nevertheless , if for `` broad knowledg '' we intend a structur of cours that follow a project that goe in and out from differ scienc , i think i will prefer better a broad knowledg . i would explain thi idea with an exampl of a field that is highli relat and interconnect with differ branch of knoweldg : cognit scienc . the aim of cognit scienc is to discov the function of the brain . in order to do thi the onli knowledg brought by neurosci will not be enough . it need support from mani other disciplin veri differ in respect with each other . thu , sometim broad knowledg is necessari to have a better glanc over topic that are too much complex and that can not be treat with a specif and focus background .
