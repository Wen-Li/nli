there is an old say which state - `` jack of all trade and master of none '' i person believ that be jack of all trade and master of none would never do ani good to anyon . thi lead to my disagr with the given statement which state it is better to have broad knowledg of mani field than to special in one specif subject . i do not deni the fact that it is import for one to have a broad knowledg of variou academ subject , but in no way is it better than to special in one specif subject . academ is all about gain knowledg . ever sinc our childhood , we are taught variou subject . initi a child is taught the basic and then gradual the intricaci of the subject would be taught . on one hand , where it is good to know the basic of a subject , on the other hand it also becom veri import to attain special in one particular area of one 's interest . it is said ` half knowldeg is a danger thing ' . when you know someth of everi thing and noth of one particular thing , it might result in seriou disast . for exampl , if a medic student who ha not pursu hi master in nuerolog is made to give a treatment to a patient with nervou breakdown , then , with hi limit knowledg of whatev nuerolog wa taught to the him in hi initi year of pursu medicin , the student might end up in take the patient 's life altogeth . what patient need is not a person with vari knowledg in differ stream , but a nuero surgeon who is a specialist . anoth reason whi it becom import to attain special is the fact that everi bodi is bless with one or the other skill . and so , a complet justic must be made to whatev skill one is bless with . now thi can onli be achiev if the person show persever and dedic toward hi potenti in the skill and attain expertis in it . for instanc , a work which is done by a carpentar could never be done with the same finnes by a plumber , how ever talent the plumber might be . each one of us have our own talent and skill and so we must pursu them further till the skill reach pinnacl of finnes and perfect . primarili , if onli a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is given to a student and the student decid not to go for perfect , he would not onli end up mess hi own life , but also of mani other surround him . the whole world would then be fill up with mani peopl who know mani thing , tit and bit of everi thing but the indepth knowledg would be misisng . thi would mean , there would be no doctor , no lawer , no engin and no research . where as , the special would enhanc one 's capabl , one talent and potenti and make thi whole world a lot better place to live in . conclus : it is import for a student or an individiu to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject but what is more import is to gain special in one of the field which interest or appeal the most to the student . thi would not onli place the entir educ system in an order but would also result in a highli talent pool of individu who would be of some worth to the societi and inturn would becom it price asset . an indepth knoweldg is alway better than have half acquir knowledg . where on one hand the latter could destoy the civil , the former would develop the whole civilz and would make thi whole world a much better place to live in .
