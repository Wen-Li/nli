i agre that most advertis make product seem much better that they realli are . my argument is clearli support by the follow reason and exampl . to illustr the point , we first want to know the purpos of the advertis . whi are the manufactur spend so much money on advertis . the anwer is quit simpl to everybodi . they want to make money out of the product . that determin that most advertis exagger the advantag of the product , and rare mention the downsid . and the disadvantag are usulli play down if they are mention at all . for exampl , toyota claim that the priu , the most famou brand of hybrid car , can run 42 mile per gallon of ga . howev , that 's not true , at least for most of situat . the typic mileag of priu is onli around 35 , a quit gap from the toyota 's claim . in fact , you can get mileag close to 42 when you drive on the highway onli . obvious , the advertis put out by toyota handili never mention that . there is anoth exampl . proactiv , the fame medic for treat acni , state in the adverties , that it work veri well on differ type of skin , no matter dri , sensit , veri moistur . it turn out that it is not true either . it onli work fairli well on dri skill . it doe n't work on the sensit skin at all . in turn , it could make the situat wors . the natur of an advertis is essenti determin by it mission , market the product for it produc . thu i strongli believ that all advertis are do exagger , more or less . sinc almost all risk gener by use the product are on consum , therefor , consum should do their own research when puchas product , especi for higli valu good or import product for health .
