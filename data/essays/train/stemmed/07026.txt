i agre with understand idea and concerpt are more import for student becaus the idea and concept help us to understand the fact . when we learn someth in our class or on textbook , the first thing come up is the theori or concerpt . then professor will explain the concerpt . later on , he give student some exampl to help us to understand it , whi professor or textbook alway give us a theori , then provid some fact to explain the theori ? after we learn a concept , we need to total undersatnd it . so we need an exampl , even some fact to explain the concept . it is a easi way for student to learn . second , after we understand the idea , we alway can use the concept to expalin other thing . we can use the idea that we learn in diffrent way . for exampl , when we use a camera to take some pictur . we understand the relationship between light and curv mirror . we can make a simpl camera base on our knowledg . third , the fact can not reflect everyth . everyon give a respon differ becaus peopl are differ from their famili background , educ and friend . they have vari opinion about a same fact . on the other hand , idea and concept are alway the same , they never chnage . final , fact can tell us what have happen in the world . but if we do n't have some idea or concept , what can we deal with some problem ? if we have some acknowledg , when some fact come up , we can explain how they happen . like , everyday news talk about the feder reserv rais the interest rate and a bloom of an expans in us . we know the fact but we do n't know whi it happen , how it is go to be . concept help us to understand more about our surround . in my conclus , i think understand idea and concept is more import for student to learn . they can have basic concept , then they have abil to explain about thing . moreov , they can use their knowledg to becaom their skill . then concept vari not depend on differ peopl . and idea and concept help to understand the fact .
