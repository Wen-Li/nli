the main mean that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact is gener state by the student themselv but almost rare by univers or institut . in my student time i made the experi that in exam often detail knowledg is afford and not onli the understand of the main concept and idea . if one might think about thi topic both manner of learn have got it advantag . for the more gener learn as i will call the understand of the main idea , the student get an good overview of the topic as a whole . thu he or she ha an understand of the sens of an assign and perhap the possibl practic applic . the student doe n't could give further detail , which often also doe not count in the pracis of the work world . for exampl for drive with a bu in anoth countri you do n't have to learn specif difficult vocabulari . l the detail learn with special fact and addit inform to a topic ha an advantag for the student if he or she want to special that topic . perhap in case of personal intererest or also becaus it is need as an requir to be taken for applic . for instanc a addit qualif in the histor develop of polymeras chain reaction , pcr , as special method in molecular biolog . or also for a job in futur you in conclus it depend on the person situat and academ circumst which kind of knowledg is afford . for me it more import to learn fact for a subject i am interest in and what is essenti for my work experi later on . but in total i also tri to be concern about get addit more gener inform of other gener topic , so that you ca n't loos the view for the essenti and practic thing which are equallz import as well .
