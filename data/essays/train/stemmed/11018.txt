i do think that success peopl tri new thing instead of do onli what they alreadi know , and i agre that learn someth new and take risk is key for bee a steap ahead the other . new experi allow you to tri out yourself , to understand your abil and your lack , and give you the an opportun of prove how worth a person is . the first person that come in my mind when i think to a success man is cristoforo colombo , the seaman that ha discov america . dure a histor period when nobodi wa believ in thi project , reach india with an other rout , he decid to tri . face the common opinion he went to the king for clere hi doubt about the project . after a long time dure which he had to face the strong reaction to hi idea and the opinion of the peopl , he eventu got the ship and the money for hi journey . he ha demontr how import bee confid is and how take risk can actual pay off . the fact that in the end he did not reach india doe no reduc hi success , becaus the main point is that he ha demonstr to europ how good hi idea wa . hi courag ha allow him to becom one of the most import man of is centuri and even more . on 5the other side , peopl who do not tri new thing , are not abl to find out who they are . i person consid what they do like hide besid what they have alreadi obtain . it is a good way for surviv but it no bring that mach on the long-term .
