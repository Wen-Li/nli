i absolutelli disagre with thi statement , becaus you can turn it around and thi will chang the mean of thi statement : you know a bit of everyth but you ca n't do anyth realli good . of cours if you are not special , you can talk with everyon about everyth but when a coupl of specialist have a convers , you come to a point where you do n't understand a word anylong . you never will understand the realli import fact about a subject , that 's whi you are hard-speak not realli useful . i have a medic diseas , for exampl , then i will ask a doctor and not someon who know a bit about the human bodi . it also come to my mind that it is a difficult situat at the univers . for exampl you have to write an essay then it 'll be pretti hard to make high-qualifi research , becaus you do n't understand the import and complic thing . that 's whi your grade will properli be wors than the one of a specialist . further i have to think about the job market , e. g. the one of germani . we have mani peopl who are unemploy and search for a work . if a compani need a thatcher , than they do n't need someon who can work a littl bit with wood , who know a littl bit about the law and last but not least ha alreadi made the roof a hous . they need just a special thatcher . that mean if you are not special you are n't often interesst for compani , and it 'll be hard to find a job . of cours there are except , but to speak in gener it 's just harder to achiev the goal in your life . all in all i realli would recommend anyon to special on someth , becaus then you are abl to put all your effort in thi subject , it 'll be easier to earn earn good grade and last but not least to find a job , that fit to your interest .
