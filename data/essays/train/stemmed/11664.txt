peopl should help commun becaus human be are the part of societi . today , it is hard to find young peopl who help their commun becaus they are busi do their own thing . therefor , i agre young peopl do not give a lot of time to help other commun becaus they are busi for prepar the furtur life and not be educ by adult about help other . first , today 's life is hard to live do work and studi hard . young peopl usual concern about their futur for go to good school , do well in school , have a part time job and get a good job . our societi focus on do well in school and work rather than educ them to have to help other . for instanc , when i wa in colleg , i wa ask to studi english as a second languag in order to have a good job . all day long , i stay in the librari and studi to get a good job . i even did n't have time to hang out with friend . i could not have time to think about other becaus life is tough in my side . secondli , adult like parent and teacher ask young peopl to work hard and studi hard . they alway point that life is hard and peopl should prepar in advanc befor they regret . when young peopl are attend class , they do not have enough time to think about other and teacher do not mention the point that peopl should help first rather than do own thing . for exampl , i never met teacher who said about help commun are import of our life or show volun work by themselv . my parent onli work and my teacher taught their class . in short , i strongli agre with the idea that young gener nowaday do not give time to help their commun becaus they onli focu on prepar their futur life and are not educ by adult about help commun .
