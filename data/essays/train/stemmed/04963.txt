from my point of view , young peopl enjoy their life more than peopl do . first off , confront to less respons than the grown-up , they have plenti of time to enjoy life . thu , they just see the nice side of it . inde , young peopl are usual neither marri , nor parent . moreov , they do have parent who care for them and pay for them when they need . on the contrari , older peopl are less look after and a part of their famili is dead . they have to care for their surviv . for instanc , they must be sure to have enough money everi day . all of thi consid , young peopl have less to think about and that mean , they have less problem about everyday 's life . moreov , they do n't have live much becaus of their age and everyth ha to be discov . thu , they will have plenti of project to acomplish such as travel . when concern about their futur , they would make a lot of plan . as for me , dream are veri import . the goal you want to reach when you are young heve to be kept when grow older . for instanc , i would like veri much to studi abroad and dicov a new cultur . i am veri attach in make souvenir . i think when you are in an other countri as everi thing is new you will make a lot of souveir in a short time . furthermor , you meat a lot of differ peopl , actual imn my mind , young peopl are veri interest in nez experi wherea , older peopl have alreadi made the larger part of their experi . eventu , be young is a veri confort posit . you can alway rely on the perspect that you can possibl do in the futur what you do n't have done yet . to conclud , i would say that feel veri happi to be young .
