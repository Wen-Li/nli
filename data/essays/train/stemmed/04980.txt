i think that tih is a veri import consider but i don ' t agre becaus in my opinion practis and concept are import at the same level . for exampl dure the prepararion for an exam the student ha to understand base concept but he ha to know the way to applic thi idea in practis . it is necessari a global cultur but he ha to have the way to work in practis for show thier capac . for most student thi is a great problem after the finish of the school becaus they go work and do n't know how to solv the problem in the realiti . in my opinion it is necessari to chang the actual way of teach , especiali in the scientif cours , becaus the teacher ha to show practic thing and not onli explain the idea . to made thi a school can organis extern collabor with industri and involv student to collabor in stage and other activ . i think that thi way of teach must be use not onli in univers but also in the previou institut so that a student can be readi for the work world . becaus of the high number of student it is necessari to spend a lot of money to build practis laboratori and to improv thi new way of teach . a last consider is that the student must show more interest in some field in order to understand their own charaterist and they tri to be more collabor in the activ of the school .
