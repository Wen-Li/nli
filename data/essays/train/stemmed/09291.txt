i agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . '' success peopl like for exampl singer or actor alway have to tri new thing and take risk - in other word reinvent themselv - in order to becom better and stay competit . let us take madonna as an exampl . when she start her career she look veri differ from what she look now and the kind of music she produc wa also a differ one compar to her song now . thi exampl indic that you have to adapt to the time in order to stay success or to becom even more success . you have to take risk to stay competit . in thi exampl madonna ha to take the risk that her fan do not like her new look or her new song as much as the old one . but she ha to tri it and produc new song in a differ way otherwis she would be out of fashion . becaus of her perman reinvent she is still today after be mani year in the show busi a superstar . one the other hand , one could also say that do thing in which you are alreadi good will improv your perform . but i think that you reach a point where you can not becom better without tri new thing which mean reinvent . in conclus , my point of view is that one can onli becom success by reinvent oneself and take risk .
