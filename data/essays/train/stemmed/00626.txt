if i had the chanc to visit the part of the world that i have alway want to , such as franc or itali , i would definit choos to be accompani by onli a coupl of the peopl who share the same interest with me rather than a larg group and i would not want to be accompain by a tour guid . therefor i disagre with the statement of `` the best wa to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . the main reason for that is travel with a group bring about mani problem such as time limit . you would be requir to stop at ceratin time sinc peopl in the group will have need such as food or refresh and you would not be abl to decid when you want to do the thing whenev you want to do them . secondli , everi person in the group will definit have differ tast and everi person in the group will want to visit differ part of the region and they will want to spend differ amount of time at everi differ locat . for exampl , some peopl might want to visit the bar or club of franc wherea the other might want to visit the palac and museum . thi would lead to disagr or unequ time spent at the visit locat . anoth factor that led to my decis is that when a person travel with onli a coupl of peopl whom he know or alon , he ha the chanc to choos the rout that he is go to take and he can stop at variou place for quick visit such as cafe or place on the way . howev when travel in a group led by a tour guid you would have a set and specif rout to follow without ani kind of flexibl and random quick stop at place that interest you would not be possibl . in conclus , accord to me , travel alon or with onli a coupl of friend who share the same interest with me , without a tour guid would be my prefer way of travel becaus it would give me the opportun to choos my own rout , i would not have to stick with the time regul of the group and i would visit the place i want to visit , whenev i want to visit them instead of that of the group .
