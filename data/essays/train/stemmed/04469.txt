in my opinion the broad knowledg chang about what a person will go to do becaus i think is veri import to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , the reason of thi opinion are : - if you have an a global knowledg you can have a lot possibl to chois a work and when you have a some difficult you are abl to know better thi problem and you have more possibl to resolv thi problem becaus for ani type of problem you are readi to resolv it . may , if you have a broad knowledg of a one specif subject you are readi to test your abil with ani problem of thi specif suject and i think you can know everi aspect of thi subjet without lot difficult . but in my opinion is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus you can have more altern than one specif subject and if you want to chang what are you do , you doesn ' t have mani problem and you are more free than if you are special in one specif subject . i think thi becaus i like chang and i think that : the chang of situat is veri interest and been in alway situat is so bore and when a person is bore is not happi and he doesn ' t know the best situat dure the life . i think one person hoe is special in one specif subject doesn ' t have a lot of mean liberti becaus he have to think everi day and everi moment at the same think . then if a person have a gener broad knowledg he can be free and he is more happi than a person how in
