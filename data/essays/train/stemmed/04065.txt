idea and concept are pretti link to fact . fact can builtd idea and concept , but the reproc is real too . it is still the same conflict that we find between the theori defend and the experi one . sometim , it is more import to understand idea than to learn fact . for exampl , in histori , that not a big deal if student are not abl to rememb each fact that occur dure the last centuri . but , they have to understand what kind of polici rule a countri and whi , in the same last centuri . it is the same in other field as econom and so on . in that case , student do not have to be consid as dictionnari . there is no use for them if they can not explain whi fact happen . in the other hand , student have to learn fact , becaus it is the onli way to understand idea and concept and to be abl to explain it . if idea or concept are tought in a such way that student do not have to think about them and to find a link between them , they should understand them and repres them in their own way . they have to make their own experi in order to get the mean of the theori . final , we can see that the more import is to understand idea and concept and learn fact is just a road to reach thi goal . to my mind , experi is best way to understand theori . but , experi is noth without theori or we will alway make the same mistak . studi have to be made as we build our life . so student will have to learn fact for a long time i guess .
