i would rather agre with that statement . at the begin i better defin what i mean by say `` young peopl '' and `` old peopl '' . young peopl are in the age of 15 to 30 and old peopl could be consid as older than 50 year . of cours there is a gab in between , but like in most discuss there is not onli a black and white scheme , but also a `` grey '' in between . well , first of all , in my percept young peopl are simpli more activ than older peopl . thi is truli a obviou argument , but whi is that ? young peopl are more curiou and less experienc . becaus of thi they feel more demand to go out , discov , make new experi . they are still more in a process of person develop than older peopl are . speed is a signifac refer for that . an exampl - young peopl fell in love more often and probabl have more relationship than peopl have in older day . they discov much more stream of the `` zeitgeist '' , which mean they develop new form of express like new music style , fashion , comput game and new kind of behaviour like flashmob or exchang via internet . despit the fact that young peopl have less money to spend than older peopl , they are tri out new way of travel and do parti . older peopl are in gener less open to new develop . they are often not abl to keep up with all new stream and develop in societi . they are embed in their normal day situat which often onli consist of busi and famili . their social activ and sport activi more or less follow the same pattern . of cours it is possibl to older peopl to enjoy their life too , but they often wait too long until start with that . in their older day they are often handicap and unabl to to what they alway want to to , to go out and feel young again . thi might be quit frustrat . to sum up i would clearli argu that young peopl are do much more activ than older peopl . and they are less defin by their job , a famili , a duti or handicap by their physic abil .
