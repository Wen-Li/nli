the youth of today ha forgotten it respons toward it commun . while there are young peopl who are will to help their commun , we see that the number of such peopl is rapidli declin . there are mani reason behind these action though not all of them are the fault fo today 's youth . one reason that young peopl of today are less will to give time to help their commun is the increas in competit in our live . we see that there are mani pressur on the youth of today to perform well in their live , whether it is at job or in educ institut as the competit for good job oppurtun ha greatli increas over the year . thu we see that young peopl gener prefer to spend a lot of time tri to improv their own valu in the job market through extra cours and project and , thu , have lesser amount of time to devot to help out with their commun . as we can observ there is a sharp declin in the number of peopl who are will to particip in activ such as collect of cloth for the poor and recycl paper believ that they have other demand on their time . anoth import factor is that with the growth of mass media and commun technolog we see that their are mani entertain establish that are constantli tri to gain the attent of the young peopl of today and tend to distract them from their respons . for instanc , consid a new cinema or bowl alley which ha recent open . it will offer mani entic discount in order to attract custom . one can easili imagin how tempt hi would be to the peopl . a youth , given the fact that thi is a short-term offer would gener choos to postpon ani commun servic that he or she had plan to avail thi offer . when choos between volunt at an old-ag home and watch the latest movi at one-third the cost most peopl would choos to go to the movi . howev , as the number of entertain centr grow , these entic also grow distract the youth from their oblig to their commun . furthermor , we see that in mani countri corrupt and lawless are so abound among the upper reach of the administr that the youth get frustrat in their effort to help with their commun . henc , we see that mani young peopl are demor and decid to pursu onli their own personel interest than to attempt to help the commun . for exampl , student who take up an enviroment initi to plant more tree , may find that the plot where they had plant the tree ha been sold for construct of an offic build . in order to get the youth of today interest in their commun there is an activ need for the administr of the compani to provid them with support and encourag . in conclus we see that the youth of today ha becom more frivil about it respons and doe tend to ignor it duti . howev , there are variou factor which have led to thi behaviour among the young peopl . we should not condemn their action without fulli appreci the enviro in which they live .
