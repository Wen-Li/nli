i total agre with the opinion , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are sever reason , they spend too much time on their job , they are not familiar with the peopl in their commun and unwil to tri to know them , and they prefer to use their own time for other pleasur . in the technolog gener , peopl spend more time on their job becaus they arecompetit . they have to work veri hard to keep their job . they have to spend a lot of time to make the achiev . they have to work as long as possibl to show their loyalti to their boss . that caus the averag time in offic increas and no time is left for the commun . besid , the modern societi becom more conserv than befor becaus of the increas crime . peopl do n't say hello to the stranger . they treat the stranger with a suspici manner . that make peopl unwil to get involv in the commun servic . i ever heard that someon had tri to rais a fund for the commun servic but the door wa shut heavili becaus he wa thought to be a cheater . also , in the citi , there are mani attract pleasur , such karo-oki , pub , danc club .. , peopl prefer to use their leisur time to go to those place in stead of help their commun . they think help the commun is govern 's job and they ha paid the tax , someon els should do thi job , but not themselv . eventhough there are still someon will to spend their time to help their commun , from these point of view abov , i think that is onli of small percentag . most peopl are still selfish , they would rather to spend time on their own job , pleasur , and keep themselv from the commun servic .
