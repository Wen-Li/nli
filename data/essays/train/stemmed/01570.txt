i agre with the idea that there will be fewer car in futur than today becous everyth is chang about transport and there are two reason whi the statement is true . first thing i like to say is about the price of the car and the price of the other way of transport . car price are get more and more expens day by day . it is not onli the price of the car but also price of the car insur . i know veri much peopl who intend to buy a car than chanc hi mind becous of the expens price for exampl . now , these peopl are use the other way of transport which are more cheaper like ; tram , buss , metro . .. secondli , as the technolog is improv , goven make metro and tram which will close the rode of car and make so much traffic jam than it will make the peopl use the metro and tram . if we look at the rate of the use of transport we can see that even now it ha some decreas of use car . in conlus , there will sure be decreas on the number of the car in twenti year becous of the tecnolog and expens price of the car and it need . and in my opinion it ha alreadi start to decreas mayb we wont see ani car after twnti or thirti year .
