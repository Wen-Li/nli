whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject ha been controversi among mani peoplr . howen , i basic disagre with the statement that broad knowledg is better . i have two reason for thi . thi is becaus and most of all , the age want specialist than generalist . as a matter fact , too mani peopl know a lot of thing , but they do n't have deep knowledg . furthermor , without special knowledg , one can not succeed in some field . accordingli , we should focu on the specif subject . for exampl , if student just learn about gener idea and do n't studi in-depth inform , they would can not fantasticali function in their field . from my think , i am sure that concentr on specif subject is veri veri import . in addit , by focus on some narrow field , one can build hi or her power of concentr . gener , poepl who do n't have power of focu are not like to success in their field . besid , when we focu our bodi and mental are strengthen . therefor , it is wise for us to concentr on the specif subject . it is report that 79 % peopl in the u. live healthi and soundli when they focu on the specif subject . from thi data , i realiz that it is essenti that concentr on the specif subject . to sum up , i strongli support the perspect that it is better to have one specif knowledg than have broad knowledg . thi is becaus it help to succeed and live healthi . therefor , have the specif knowledg is one of the factor have posit influenc on our educ , .
