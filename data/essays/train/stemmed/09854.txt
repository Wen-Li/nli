some young peopl do enjoy life more than older peopl do . but that is not 100 percent correct . some of older peopl they work so hard dure the young life , they spend almost more than 12 hour for work just want save more money for the futur old life . they might play after retir can around the world use thi money . my father wa crazi of work when he wa young . he work almost over 12 hour . he got back home usual after midnight for everyday . i even did not have chanc to talk to him . now he is retir he took my mom travel a lot of differ countri . mani of their friend were jelou of them . in china , old peopl said `` if you not work so hard when you were young , you will get regrat . '' my parent alway told me `` you have to mork harder when you have energ becaus you will not know what will happen in the futur . '' but thi word now is chang to ue in the young peopl . nowaday some young peopl just want to have fun in thi world . they west time and money in play and do noth . when they have no money they ask their parent to get . if you ask them whi do not you work ? they will tell you `` life is short , you will not know what will happen for tomorrow so just enjoy your life do not be so seriou and do not need to work so hard . '' my father 's co-work ha a son . he did not go to colleg after high school he just stay at home and play computrt game until now he is 27 year old . he never work . the resion is he think hi famili do not need to work to make money so he rather stay at home enjoy hi comput game life . it is not call enjoy life . i think some of them call enjoy life just get lazi , they do not want themselv so tire . i can not say young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl that is depend on the person , just do not west the time to do noth . time is money .
