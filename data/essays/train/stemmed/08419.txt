i disagre with the follow statement becaus i think it is better to special in one specif subject . in my opinion there is a lot of advantag becaus you can do some job better than other and also you can know all about a specif subject . the first point that i 'd like to make is that if you are special in one specif subject , you could work better than other , who ha broad knowledg of a lot of thing . it is import becaus you could find work easier than other . also you could solv a lot of problem for exampl in your offic or in the factori where you work . anoth fundament aspect is that you can know all about it , i think that in thi way you can achiv high result and you can answer all question about it . on the other hand you do n't have knowledg of all other academ subject , but it doe n't matter becaus i think i will do onli a specif work dure my life . i know peopl who get good grade in onli one subject and they know a lot of detail about it , so in my opinion they can do all about it without problem . thi is simpli fantast . in fact some artist , for exampl musician , have skill onli in what they do and it allow to achiev success and to improv themself better than other .
