i disagre with the statement . in my opinion , peopl understand idea and concept by learn the fact . it seem that we are unabl to get the idea or concept until we realli know the fatc . first , it is difficult for us to get the new idea or concept right away . for instanc , whenev the professor give the new lectur , they need to organis the materi and manag to set up the lectur in order to make student understand what they teach in class . in fact , most professor would introduc the idea and concept at the begin of the lectur , explain the detail by take some exampl , and summar the essenc by the end of the lectur . obvious , it could make student understand better , even though not all of the student stay on the same level . second , some idea and concept are realli abstract , especi those mathemat issu . we usual learn fast as long as we practis by ourselv . for exampl , i still rememb my mathemat teach back to primari school . obvious , she did great job to teach us how to undertand the class and how to work out the question . one day , when we talk about the squar of the object , our teacher got a few student to stand up and measur the length and width of our classroom so that we could figur out the exact number of object and cacul the squar of the room immedi . as a result , we learnt the idea and concept through the factss we did . in conclus , i person believ that peopl hardli to understand the idea and concept unless they learn the fact . fact help us to complet understand and solv
