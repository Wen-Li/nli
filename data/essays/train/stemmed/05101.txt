i agre with that statement becaus learn fact are base on understand idea . student can not learn new fact without know where they came from or what corrober them . for some peopl , memor a new fact is enough . it might not be that import to them to understand it or studi it . but i disagre with that . there ha to be a base for everyth someon learn or it wont be concid learn . my favourit subject ha alway been math becaus , unlik subject like histori and literatur , it all base on logic . everyth ha an explan and acknowledg that explan lead to acknowledg a new fact . when student understand idea , they becom more product , and more accomplish , becaus grasp and anal idea lead to creativeti which lead to creation . student have differ learn skill , some learn by memor conlus , and some cant memor without an know how they reach to the those conclus . understand idea is more difficult that learn facts. a fact can be learn by read a book or a biographi , an idea ha to be studi to be learn , which oblidg more think . as a result , one who studi new concept provid more in the commun in the futur , becaus what is hi or her mind are not just fix fact , they are way of think . if someon think about the technolog that is enhanc everyday and the growth of our economi , it will be clear that it is the caus of knowledg , knowledg that is not onli obtain by memor fact but by creativ mind . there is more to improv than learn fact . and when i say improv i mean in yourself . when you want to imoprov youself you need to understand what you learn to implic it . that how the process of teach work as well . teacher could have just given out book and told student to read them at home and get test on them the next day . wouldnt that have been easier if the point wa n't to make student understand what they 're take in school ?
