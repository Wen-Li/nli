the statement touch upon a veri contraversi topic . it is true that young peopl spend more time on parti and travel than the old peopl . howev , i complet disagre with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than the older peopl do . i have mani reason for my belief . it is true that becaus of age a older person would not be abl to enjoy the parti life and travel around the world . but it is equal true that not onli physic activ , but also other activ contribut to the definit of `` enjoy life to it fullest '' . to give an exampl , i had a mathemat professor who help me prepar for compit exam and standadis test out side the syllabu . although he wa retier , he had a true passion for math and even at age of eighti he use to solv mani challeng puzzl and do recreat mathemat work . apart from mathemat , he also had a group of friend , with whom he use to play card and alway particip in variou district and nation level compitit in chess . he also kept visit hi two son onc everi year and taught hi grandson the secretsof lead a success life . from all these and mani more activ , he deriv the immens pleasur of lead a healthi life . on the otherhand , consid the yonger gener , where mani peopl commit numer crime in the name of have fun in life . these peopl suffer sever , when they have to face the punish offer by the law for their arrog attitud . we can find numer exampl of young peopl commit inexcus crime and face the punish for life . on the contrari , in such case the young peopl have to face more sorrow in life than the old peopl do . i strongli believ , that to enjoy life , one must have the abil to give joy to other peopl and share thier sworrow , in whatev small way possibl . on can achiv the ultim joy of life onli if he is success in creat a harmoni in the commun around himself . and i strongli believ there is no age limit to do thi , and henc there is no age limit to be happi in life .
