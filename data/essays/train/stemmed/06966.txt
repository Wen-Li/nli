i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first of all , the techniqu use in advertis such as color , use of camera , background and a cheer music creat a more appeal atmospher that induc peopl to buy that product . the advertis compani are veri talent to make product look bigger or smaller with clever posit of the camera , depend on which of these two are merit . mani product are purpos portray differ to the consum by advertis trick . mani food item are dy with a special food color that make them look incred delici so much so that even the best cook in the world can not give them such a look . they even creat a fairi tale around a product to make peopl believ in the qualiti of the it . for instanc , mani product from car to perfum are present with an appeal feminin figur as if the beauti of the model doe inde convey the beauti of the product . so women may buy a perfum not becaus it smell terrif but becaus it is use by a famou celebr . the imag or the fairi tale creat around the product conceal the real qualiti of it and make it irresist . the use of famou peopl can even be veri much disappoint for the real consum becaus peopl usual ignor question the necess of buy a product when they see a famou and love figur use it . thi phenomenon which could be call the `` the celebr effect '' is veri much respons for disappoint consum in the long run . anoth factor that hide the real qualiti of product is the advertis promot . peopl start to use or consum product for their temporari benefit such as reduc fee for mobil phone for a limit campaign period but after that `` path depend '' is creat among the consum and peopl are use to use that product , all of the temporari benefit are remov . to conclud , advertis are do everyth to creat an imag that doe not quit exist , or exist onli partial . i think the consum should go and see the product in real life to make the ultim decis .
