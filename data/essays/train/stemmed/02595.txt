sinc ever there are dicuss if young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i would say that thi is not true . if i look at my parent or even at my grandpar i can recogn that they still enjoy their life . fist of all , it is clear that older peopl enjoy their life in a more differ way than younger peopl do . they do not want to go out everi night or weekend . but for them thi is not so import . they had the possibl when they were young . for them it is more import to spent as much time with their famili as possibl . thi is enjoy life for them . moreov older peolp have much more thing to do everi day . they have the respons for a hous , they have a job to do , and mani other thing . when you are young you do not have all these problem or jobe to handl with . so from the eye of young peopl our parent life might be seen as not too excit . but i would say that is is not true , too . for older peopl the thing mention abov are veri import . they are pround of all these thing and reach is a way enjoy their life . anoth point i want to mention is that older peopl have made much more experi in their life . most of the think me and my friend are do now my parent have alreadi done . so they enjoy their life as they were young nearli in the same way as my gener doe it now . so you never can not say that they do not enjoy their life . they enjoy their life as well as we do it now . but unfortunatelli thi most of the younger peopl will understand when they get older . to come to a conclus , i would never say that younger peolp enjoy their life more than older peolp do . as you can read abov i completli disagre with thi statement .
