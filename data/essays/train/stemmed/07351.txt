i think it is not easi to answer becaus you have to respect sever aspect . on the one hand i think thi statement is correct , becaus today there are some peopl who think onli on theirselv . they think that they are the most import person and if somebodi need help they say : ask somebodi els . thi is a veri hard opinion and i think ( and i hope ) that thi is onli a minor of our popul . on the other hand i think that especi some old peopl have a wrong opinion . they often speak about an unfriendli and unpolit youth , but i think thi is not a correct opinion . i think that thi is caus by those peopl i have talk about in the first paragraph . i can tell about my friend and me . we are a group of five peopl and we work in a home for old peopl . there , we do lot of thing to help these peopl to have a nice day . we stay there two time in month and the old peopl are veri happi to see us everi time . anoth exampl is my big sister . she is cook in my old school for lot of pupil with some other parent , becaus the villag ha not enough money to pay for a good food . so mani parent decid to do thi job on their own to give the pupil a good meal . i think thi is a good help in the comun . what is import to say too , is that there are mani pupil who help other pupil with their homework and learn with them for test or other thing like that . thi is also a kind of help for other . at least i can say that i think that the major of our popul is do lot of thing for their commun . of cours it can alway be more , but if everybodi help a littl bit , i think it is a good start for the futur .
