i partli disagre with the statement becaus there are sever fact everi student should know or learn . for exampl , in histori class , it is imposs to teach histori comlet without learn fact that happen in the past . how should student know import date if their teacher leav out the inform ? certainli you can combin the two method in your class but they should be both handl with the same import . moreov , fact are someth the student learn in order to understand the idea and concept behind them . to set up anoth exampl , think of the mathematician fact that one and one is two or mayb even of the theori of rel of albert einstein . what concept can you learn compar to ani of these fact , or what is the idea worth without the theori behind it . what i want to say is , that one is not abl to live without the other in mani case . on the other hand in addit to that , it is often said that within new method of teach , it would be realli more import for student to understand the idea and concept becaus if you onc understand someth you will be abl to keep it longer than if you learn it by heart . that is whi a lot of teacher tri to help understand some kind of process by figur or imag of themselv . to draw a conclus , in my opinion , you can not say that one thing is more importort than the other . learn fact by heart is of cours less import nowaday than it wa in the past becaus new strategi have been invent . i actual think that these fit togeth realli well , becaus you obvious get the best result if you first learn the fact and afterward you may tri to understand the idea and concept behind it .
