i agre with thi statement , but i would like to clarifi the term sucess first . what doe it mean ? i understand success as a moment in a person 's life when s/he achiev a veri signific goal that had befor , in that sens might be happi , joy or perhap money . after thi definit , i consid sucess peopl usual take risk and tri new thing , but base on their own experi and knowledg and take into account the advantg and the disadvantag that the new idea could bring up . in that sens it 's not just take risk , it impli a wise understand of the situat . i believ it is veri comfort to keep do the same thing that you alreadi know , but at the same time `` monotoni '' it 's someth that doe n't allow to prosper and liter destroy our dream . there are mani exampl of peopl who had taken risk in their live and fail , but at the same time you can take risk as much as you want , there is no limit about it . i definetli empat with thi point of view , becaus if you want to be happi or to be leader you have to struggl and get your dream , they wo n't come by pray or by miracl . sucess peopl are alway tri to be differ and look for new target with a veri clear idea in their mind and with mani argument to support their plan . muy last argument is , our life is a veri dynam and a opportun to creat alern . peopl who have been work onli under the same paradigm are wast an unvalu opportun to shine and to achiev their goal . henc sucess peopl area alway look forward for plan new strategi in their life and be happi for ever .
