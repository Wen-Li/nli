i can not to be in disagre with these word . modern peopl need the car . we use the car for mani region . we need it for the job and intertain , for the holiday and for all thing of our life . we can make an import consider : the life is chang , the world is chang and it 's chang , in the modern life we need to move and go around alway . also the tecnolog is chang , and all peopl can buy a car , now . is 's more chap then ten year ago . if in twenti year there will be fewer car , it will be an import problem for the world , for the global and for the peopl . for use and drive a car we need way and park . but today there is n't thi . the administr know thi problem but is difficult to risolv it . we can say that we can not live without car . it 's strang , but it 's realli . the life run , and you have to run behind it . today have a car is veri import , and you ca n't live without it . for exampl , i live in a littel town near milan , and if i have n't the car i can not come to work or to studi in milano , becaus the train is ever on late , and there is n't other way . when i wa young i do n't need the car becaus i can entertei myself in my town with my friend , but today young peapl have diffren necesseri , and they want have ever the car .
