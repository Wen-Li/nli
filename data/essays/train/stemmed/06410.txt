in my person opinion , it is true that most of the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are mainli two reason that account for thi phenomena . one is that young peopl today concern more about their self-interest than the interest of the commun . the onther reason is that yongster today are more aloof with peopl around them . some adult blame the educ , and some blame the societi for the characterist that young peopl bear nowaday . adult believ these adolesc to be selfish and care onli what they are interest in , and what will beneifit them most becaus our educ do not emphasi on care peopl and commun . youngster never show interest in help their commun becaus they do n't think they have anyth to do with their communit . they do n't believ that the commun will do them ani good or will benefit on them . mani have strong concept that if they spend time and get involv in help the commun , troubl will come . the more one involv , the more thing wait you to help . and final , your time is depriv and that your own work wo n't get done . on the other hand , there 's a weird notion which sometim spread through televis program that make young peopl feel more aloof with peopl around them . the reason is that by show much compass and enthusiasm in help the commuti may sometim result in an unecessari troubl . there are mani news broadcast report that peopl get kidnap or rob when they are help other to find way home , or help those who pretend to be injur . these thing happen so often that peopl are scare and unwil to help other . thu final , peopl becom more aloof with each other inord to protect oneself from be harm . all in all , selfish and cold of the young peopl taday make them unwil to devot themselv to public interest , like help their commun . the fact is that commun interest doe not concern them , and they are afraid of be hurt . they do n't want to devot on thing that wo n't pay them back . therefor , i agre that young peopl are not spend time to help their commun due to abov reason .
