i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus that is the reason whi the advertis realli are . in almost all advertis we can see onli the good side of the product . we can onli see the side effect or bad consequ onli when there is ani law or regul that they should indic them like tabbaco or medicin . advertis want to sell their product more and more and have to compet with the product of other compani . so they show the good-look product with great function and hide the defect . and anoth reason is that the advertis are made in the best circumst in which the product can function most effect . for exampl , in the cloth advertis we can see the ideali good shape person wear the product . and we imagin the look that we are go to have with that cloth similar to the advertis and come to buy the product . that is whi i agre with thi statement .
