the statement state that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i strongli disagre to thi . as a young person , i would like to make it clear that thi statement is incorrect . i actual have proof , that young peopl in the commun help . i believ adult get the imag of young peopl fool around all day becaus the unemploy rate is increas and mani crime are caus by young peopl everyday all around the world . but , thi is just an imag . there are young peopl who contribut to the commun . for exampl , in my commun , there are mani homeless peopl . they have no job , shelter , money , nor food . the teacher in my school and the student volunt to help them everi weekend . we donat the cloth that we no longer way . we make food to keep them healthi . without our help , the homeless are not abl to surviv . it is import to support one anoth , and young peopl know thi . anoth activ that i know that is help the commun , is clean the citi . few time a month , the student at my school go out in the citi to pick up garbag . we do not do thi becaus someon told us to , but we do it becaus we want to keep the citi clean . at the same time as sweep the citi , we are promot the citizen to keep the world clean . it is the citi that we live in , we want to feelo better live there . we have to appreci that we are part of the commun . sinc it is the place we live in , we want to keep it nice and clean . thi is an exampl of an activ that we , the young peopl do to help and be part of the commun . the young peopl might seem like they are alway play around but it is not true . they are not like that all the time . the adult may not alway be awar , but they help to be part of the commun .
