i do agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . to learn fact is a tempori solut to a problem while if you understand the idea and concept of the problem you can rember it for a life time . student who have command over the idea and concept of a particular subject perform well in the exam that student with mere inform of fact . by learn fact you can just have one method of solut to a particular problem while if you understand the idea and concept you can appli your own knowledg to the situat and may come out with an differ way of solut . not onli thi but also if you are through with the idea and concept of one situat you can even tri to appli them to a differ situat . text book also support that understand idea and concept is mor e import for student . book give exampl to variou law , theori and other statement . of these exampl most af them relat to day to day life so that it is easier for the student to make hi own experiment with what he ha understood . the import of understand and conceptu can be explain by , for exampl , learn to drive a car . you go to a drive school and you learn to drive a car . you can drive the car now but you would do it much better if you have proper understand of how a car work . if you learn the basic or veri simpl concept of car mechnic you can do your drive much better . it can also help you when you have breakdown though understand and conceptu is time take it is worth spend time on such long last method whose impact is much stronger on student learn .
