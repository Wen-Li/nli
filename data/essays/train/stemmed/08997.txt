i agre with that idea . i think success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . let me give an exampl from real life , for instanc edison he explor veri use thing for human that is lumb . befor he explor it he did 99 experi and at the end of he found lamb . he took a risk also he could stop but he didnt and final at hi 100 experi he found it . i point out at thi essay about take a risk but also tri new thing is so import to becom success . if you wanna improv yourself you should open to new thing . when we see the histori everi commun that they dont wanna chang is clean from histori and the new one come to their place . if we handl a ataturk he tri to chang the gover and he becam success at that point if he didnt encourg that and he didnt take risk mayb in turkey democrat gover wouldnt establish and we becom like other poor countri . also we can give scientist as an exampl caus they tri to make new thing to use for human and take risk for thi aim . if they wouldnt like that human live like an anim and pre-histor age . they invent most thing by thi way and we improv ourself and increa our life standard .
