i disagre with the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . becaus the idea seem to be too shallow and narrow to me . i would rather say it depend on each individu whether they can enjoy life or not , than just gener them by their age . i am go to state exampl to support the idea . firstli , there ha been increas number of young peopl , who do not have clear purpos of the life , be at a loss what to do . these kind of peopl often do not even work , which natur mean that they do not have enough opportun to show their abil . that kind of life seem to be veri bore and meaningless to me . although some peopl might enjoy their moment of the life by do someth funni and stimula , my impress for that is they are just have fun temporari . i think it doe not mean that they fulli enjoy thier life . as long as there are mani young peopl live without a obviou purpos or destin , i think it can not be said that all young peopl enjoy their life . secondli , let me introduc my own experi about my grand mother . she live alon after her husband die , but she is so energet and vigor , and seem to enjoy her life veri much . that is probabl becaus she ha a lot of friend around her , who usual drop by to chat with her . i think be need by other give peopl will of life . late , she even start sing with her friend in karaok , and is now put much enthusiasm in it . by see my grand mother , i wa well convinc that older peopl can live their life with mani enjoy . that is the reason i think given statement is too superfici . even young peopl could feel their life meaninngless and bore , while there is enough chanc for older peopl to fulli enjoy their life . it is all up to theirselv .
