i agre with the statement that it is better have broad knowledg rather than supeci in one specif area . thi is becaus everyth in thi world is relat with each other and you can not solv ani problem or do someth new without have other knowledg . for instanc , cook , chemistri and biolog seem all differ subject which doe n't have relationship with each other . howev , they are strongli connect with each other and you wo n't be abl to do ani cook without have knowledg of chemistri and biolog . you might think not all peopl cook at home have had class of beth chemistri and biolog . i take your point ; what you have thought is absolut true . what i want to say is that you do n't need to have profession and deep knowledg of them . for exampl . if you want to cook meat , what do you do first ? thi is mayb depend on what meat you are go to cook and how tough it is and how big it is . if thi meat is too big to cook or eat , you need to cut the brock into smaller piec . thi process involv in biolog and chemistri , i do n't think you have nitic about it , but when you eat meat smaller piec are much more digestal in the bodi system and it wo n't put stress onto the organ . in the chemistri side , small meat can be quickli cook and easili kill bacteria . now you can see , thousand of differ area are involv in just cook a brock of meat . the abov is just one exampl of advantag of have wide knowledg . how about in the career side ? i suppos if you have a varieti of knowledg you wo n't get bore in the whole life becaus if you get bore what you do at the moment you can move to the other area and do whatev you want . i think it is a easi thing to do new thing with have interest rather than do someth which you do n't have ani interest at all . overal , have wide knowledg help you to make enjoy life and live clevali . the abov exampl of cook is a exampl of thi .
