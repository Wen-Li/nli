i agre with the statement , and feel that onli a hand full of peopl spend enough time for help their commun . the follow are few of the reson whi i agre . first of all , the young peopl are so much inclin toward their job and shape their carrier and look for lead a luxuri life , that they hardli get ani time for help their commun . they have time to go to the pub and hang around with their friend but hardli ani of them spend time for their commun . recent , i approach a friend of mine to accompani me to an old age commun , that run for the old peopl who have been abandon by their children , onli to give some food to them that my mother had prepar . but he began to give all lame excus that he ha to go out along with hi parent 's . later i found out that he wa at home the whole day . he did not even think that by do so how happi will they feel . also help their commun impli that the person ha some human feel in him . moreov , the young peopl in their teen are so much so influenc by their friend and other activ that at a point they even do not behav properli with their own parent 's . for them , their friend are their everyth . such peopl hardli spend ani time help their commun . look at thi rate the young peopl , must realis that after some age even they will not be young and also they will be in need of young peopl for help . atleast , have thi in mind they must spend time for help . the abov reason make me feel so , in order to overcom thi , the young peopl , especi the student 's must make it a routin to spend some time , not much , but atleast half an hour per day for help the commun .
