i agre to the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . '' both idea seem great for me but if i have to chose eather one then i will chose broad knowledg of academ subject . through our life we grouw up and learn a lot of differ subject . have knowledg about one specif inform is seem great but in my pesonali opinion have a lot of differ academ knowldeg will bring lot of possibl in , my futur . someon who want to be engini they just need to studi math and scient , they are keep do one job and becom specialist . there is a lot of peopl who want to be a engini and it is hard to be a one great specialist , and onli few peopel can sucess and becom specialist . in the other hand , when we know broad inform about mani acad subject then we have a lot of job to do . for exampl , if i becom actrtess and i have knowledg of academ subject then i can etend my job a lot . at fiest , i can sing well then i can be both acrtess and singer . second , if i can speak foreign languag then there will be chanc to go other countri to work . either if i can speak english veri well and there will be a chanc to come out on the hollywood movi or sing with some famou foreign singer togath to procud cd and sell for both countri . third , if i am good at wirithg them i can publish the book or write song . if i have good appear then i can also be a model . in gener actress come out on comerci , magzin , movi , and some other thing base on own academ knowledg . in my conclus it is good to have board academ knowledg to extend our job for futuer .
