the issu at hand is whether in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it is an import problem , sinc it will affect humankind 's qualiti of life , exspeci if car will continu to use pollut fuel . in my opinion there hardli be fewer car in use than today . on the contrari , i believ that the number of car will esponenti encreas . one reason i think that car will grow in number is that i am not acquaint with ani effect polici to make car decreas . of cours there have been mani attemp not to make peopl use their car ( such as taxat to enter the downtown ) , but ani decis have not been made to stop definit the product of car . thi would probabl be harm to mani countri ' echonom system , and would mean the end of mani car compani . anoth reason i believ that there will not be fewer car in twenti year , especi pollut car , is that the number of car is relat to petrol busi . as everyon may know , petrol busi is one of the greatest in the world and it provid great financi gain to the `` petrol master '' , who have a certain polit influenc . unless `` petrol master '' will renaunc to their incom , there will never be ani effect decis to make car decreas . the last reason i think that car will not decres is that nowaday there are mani countri in the middl of an econom boom , and their popul , in order to satisfi their increas need of comfort , are buy car . for exampl just think of china . it huge popul on one hand is get richer and richer , on the other hand is ask for a larger number of car to be produc , sinc it need them . ultim i think that it is almost imposs that there will be fewer car in the next twenti year . of cours thi is not the best option for earth 's life , nevertheless there are not the right condit to get a better one .
