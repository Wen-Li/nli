in my opinion , in educ , in order to fulli understand and deepli explor an issu , it is more import to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . to begin with , learn fact , although import , is not suffic for a student to develop a complet understand of the subject . it is not possibl to evalu the fact without grasp the underli idea . the knowledg of the fact without know what caus them and whi is hard to be consid whole . secondli , without understand the idea and the concept , the student will fail to appli the knowledg he or she ha gain to chang fact . as long as the main idea is understood , the student will not struggl even if he or she face a problem with differ fact . lastli , the fact learn as a student can be easili forgotten follow the end of the educ . howev , if one understand the key idea and concept , these will guid him or her to recal the inform he/sh gain dure educ . explor idea and concept will enabl one to develop a strong notion of the subject studi , which is what make one a success profession . in conclus , as a lawyer who alway ha to be guid by main idea and concept in the face of uniqu fact of each event , i believ that , for a student , understad idea and concept is the most import part of the educ .
