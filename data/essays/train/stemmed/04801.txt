in our world in the school they give some topic to studennt and they tell them to learn these . the student do npot care about idea and concept in it and they just learn what they gave . i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . firstli , at a school there are two kind of student . the teacher give them a topic to learn . one of them look at the topic as a fact which he should quicli learn ' the other look at the topic more detail . he think about the idea and concept and thi make him to learn easier . secondli , if a student make some guess on the topic or search for it it make him to learn easier . after do thi student learn everi detail about the topic and after that it is veri hard to forget it . thirdli , the educ system is veri import . for exampl in our countri the system is veri bad . we have a oss system after the highschool we attend thi exam and if we win we should go to univers . thi system make us to think not detail . so we do not care about the idea and concept becaus we should learn everyth immedi as a fact . the reason are not import for us becaus we shoul win the race . lastli learn thin as a fact not understand it make us to think more small . becaus we do not know anyth els except the topic . we can not think bigger becaus we do not know how to think we just read and learn like a robocop . the other thing are not import for us . to sum up , i think it should be more import for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact if they realli want to be a high person .
