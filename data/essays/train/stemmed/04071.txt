i deepli agre to the statement that advertis make product seem better than they actual are . in fact , i believ that mani product would hardli be bought at all if peopl onli knew the product itself and not the advertis that goe along with it . my opinion on thi ha been influenc by experi and by academ studi , and i would like to state sever reason for my answer . first of all , the psycholog mechan behind advertis are rather obviou . it is easi to see that a galop hors and a handsom man have not much in common with the tast of a cigarett , but the posit feel creat by the descib imag do influenc a person feel toward the advertis brand . thi can be explain psycholog and physiolog , and i am sure that studi psycholog ha help me understand the underli principl better . the advertis industri is a huge and power one and the qualiti of an advert thoroughli influenc the sell number of a product . in one lectur on the psycholog of advertis i heard about certain techniqu that are employ by advertis which have onli deepen my opinion on advertis . an exampl of the fake of the present product is the fact that the thickli stream milk one can see in an advertis for cornflak is as tasteless as the flake themselv : the milk is actual glue and the flake are made of plastic . i am convinc that most advertis compani employ similar techniqu to make the product seem supernatur and gener better than they are . it is unlik that a compani could still compet with other if they simpli state that their product wa good . it seem like a good idea to have certain regul in advertis . these do alreadi exist and it seem almost necessari to protect consum from be lure into purchas a product that onli seem attract becaus of the idea sold along with it . it make sens that a produc want hi product to shine in the best light . howev , i think that the techniqu be use in advertis these day go far beyond what one could call a realist imag of a product . therefor , i can onli agre to the statement given .
