i disagre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , for i believ that the purpos of travel is not just to have fun and relax with other peopl , but it can also be an opportun for you to increas your own knowledg about a specif event that occur in the place in the past . thu , i think that the best way to travel is not alway in a group , but it can also be in an individu or in coupl , depend on whi you have chosen to travel and what you want to gain from your trip . when i travel to hiroshima last year with my sister , i wa convinc that travel in a group is not alway the best . the reason whi i want to travel to hiroshioma in the first place wa that i want to learn more about the japanes histori regard it surrend dure world war ii . the aim of the trip wa therefor not to have a fun , relax time be free from school work or anyth , but it wa for me to increas my own knowledg about my own countri . it wa meant to be seriou . i decid to take my sister with me as i realiz that she knew more about the specif event than i did . i expect that she would help me interpret the thing we would see in hiroshima , like the atomic-bomb dome . as a result of thi trip , we both had a great time . i manag to learn a lot about the histori japan ha gone through , and my sister also enjoy guid me in hiroshima . the way we did not take ani of our freind with us allow me to concentr on the aim i had for the trip . furthermor , we were given an opportun to have deeper convers than we had ever had , and we becam closer than befor . i can sure say that the trip would not have been as good as thi if we travel in a group . as it can be seen , it is total possibl to have a great trip even if you are not travel in a group . how great the trip would becom depend significantli on what you wish to gain from the trip . if be in a group is not the best way for you to fulfil your aim , then that might mean that travel alon is better for you to fulli enjoy your trip .
