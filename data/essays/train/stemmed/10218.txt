in my opinion success ha noth to do with tri new thing or take risk . what is success ? it 's when a person is do hi best rel to her or hi potenti . mayb it is not someth new it is someth what he or she alway ha done . anoth thing is the learning-effect and bee success in that case . there i agre that you are more success in the event of learn when you tri do new thing . for exampl a young guy between hi twenti 's , do alway the same thing , let 's say , work as a printer . it would n't be success when he would continu hi whole life in do thi work in bee in the same posit and the same compani forev . a success person would tri to go further . chang compani , learn from the best in the field , go to school , tri to take a job in the adminstr . mayb he will fail onc or twice . but on the end , he will be success , becaus he can look back and say : i have tri new thing and i have done my best . anoth way of bee success is by take risk . it 's usual a small way between bee riski and bee stupid . most peopl know they are stupid after bee riski . as an exampl let 's take a gambler which put hi whole safe on one number in the roulett . the number turn , the ball jump and take place in anoth number than the gambler wish to . that 's stupid we would say . but if it had been hi favourit number , than he would be immedi success . therefor , in my opinion , to be riski doe n't mean you are success . we probabl can say that the more risk we take , the bigger is the success , but also the bigger we can fail . import is not be in a steadi positon , where no success ever will occur .
