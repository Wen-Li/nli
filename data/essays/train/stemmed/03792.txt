broad knowledg of mani academ subject than one specif subject is a wonder thing to have . it is everi man 's dream but i total disagre . the abil to memor thing is a gift from god , and it differ from one person to anoth . onli a small percentag of peopl in the world are capabl of memor inform of multipl academ subject with eas , the other who are the major ca n't do that easial instead they work harder and read for longer hour tri to compens for the lack of thi abil . in the other hand the major of peopl are capabl of focus or special in one specif subject which is again not an easi task to do but still without doupt much easier than broad knowledg of mani subject . broad knowledg of multipl subject ha mani disadvantag , apart from be difficult , chanc to forget thing , make mistak or confus one thing to anoth are veri high compar to specif subject knowledg . in the other hand , specif knowledg is easi to maintain , low chanc of error and perfect is easi to achiev . i admit that specif knowledg ha some disadvantag too , like be bore sometim and if you do a mistak you will be badli blame . in the end , choos between the two kind of knowledg depend on the person 's capabl and interest . both are realli good and help to the world we are live in . but i am sure that i am not capabl of gener knowledg and i 'd rather to sepcial in one specif subject .
