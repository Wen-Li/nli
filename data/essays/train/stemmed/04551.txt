nowaday group travel is more popular . everbodi tri to travel somewher by a group such as somewhat europ tour or africa trip . although some peopl think that the best way to trip is an alon without tour guid , i do strongli support the idea of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus of two reason , first one is tour guid are know where we have to go and secondli if you have never been to there you need a leader who help to you how to visit and how to spend their time enjoy there . first of all , if somebodi want to travel somewher certainli she/h must get tour or tour guid becaus if you have no idea where are you and you need some help from someon thi person shoul be your tour guid moreov if you spend a lot money for thi travel it is so normal to want to see import place . nowaday tour guid have well educ person about how to assist the other person in addit to that they have an idea and knowledg about that area , for that reason if somebodi want to travel somewher such as franc or spain and also if you have no idea about that countir you have to travel is in a group led by a tour guid in addit to that , if you want to travel in spain firt of all you must get a lot of inform about spain if you could get when you go to there you need a leader who help to you to go somewher or import place and also how to spend your time enjoy becaus you dont know how to go there and you have knoe idea such as weher is the most popular disco 's there , if you are not use a tour guid mayb you can wast your time in one place if you pay a lot of money for thi trip you want to see a lot of place . to illustr nowaday most of businessmen are use thi way so they are use tour guid while your are go to abroad when they are finish their meet go somewher to see import place by the way , becaus thet havent got ani time to visit somewher for that reason busunessmen are travel by tour guid in conclus , everybodi travel somewher i suggest that if you want to travel somewher that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , i strongli support the thi idea rather than the travel alon without a tour guid .
