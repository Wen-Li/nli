i think the human be ' life is bound to the risk factor . it ha alway been so sinc the primit were chase anim with bare hand . at the time the differ between a success and an unsuccess person wa to live or die . our societi inherit the risk factor from our ancestor . in the actual societi , made of peopl do the same task everyday , take risk is the key to success in the evryday 's life . i think that take risk and tri new thing is veri import for everybodi , not onli for peopl who want to succeed . i can not imagin that we would have reach our actual well societi if somebodi had n't taken ani risk . for exampl if the wright brother had n't tri to make their aeroplan fli , we would still be travel land and sea but not in the sky ; by contrast mani peopl die becaus of flight . mayb if the wright did n't tri we would have save mani live , but we would n't be abl to travel around the world so quickli . one more exampl would be the longest jump made by a famou dirt bike rider . ride hi motorbik he jump 60 meter long and estabilish a new world record . if he hesit befor jump he would n't have taken ani risk but he would be just a regular rider , not the world record holder . by the same token he could have unfortun die , but it 's the price sometim peopl have to pay to succeed . i think we should manag the risk in the everyday life , but it depend on situaton and mainli on the limit . the differ between take a risk consid fool and succeed is so slight , but i think it 's exactli what make us differ from each other . we can manag the risk and reach higher level in the univers , career and societi . of cours the everyday work help us improv ourselv , but in the end it 's up to us to take a risk and tri new thing or not .
