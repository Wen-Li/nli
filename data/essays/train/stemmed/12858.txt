i disagre that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one . all of us have heard of the quot `` jack of all trade , master of none '' . i think i would like to be the master of atleast one subject . i believ that unless one ha detail or special inform regard a subject , it is difficult to speak challengingli on that subject . to quot myself as an exampl , i have a broad knowledg of seven languag . i speak english at colleg , telugu at home which an indian region languag and have learnt a smatter of french , german , hindi ( india 's nation languag ) , spanish and italian . but , i am handicap when i have to convers in atleast five of the seven languag i learnt which doe n't serv the purpos of learn . i also believ that special is requir in most field . some of those field be engin , medicin and law . when you have a toothach , you would visit a dentist rather than a gener practicion . a similar logic would drive you to a cardiologist when you have a heart attack and to an opthamologist when one ha a problem with one 's eye . henc , it can be seen that in the abov case , a person with broad knowledg of the ailment would serv no purpos as one requir specialist . anoth area where i want to illustr the use of specialist is engin . civil engin are requir for build bridg and comput engin are requir to work on comput . a non-speci engin would simpli do a bad job or a blotch job . we could also consid the field of law as an exampl . we approach crimin lawyer for fight our case in case of crime such as murder , extort or kidnap but we would approach a consum court lawyer for problem such as adulter food . thu , we infact need specialist all the time and in all walk of life ! anoth advantag of be a specialist is that peopl look up to your opinion much more than if you were un-speci . we would much rather believ a person who ha obtain hi doctor of philosophi degre in a particular subject rather than an undergradu student . henc , i believ a broad knowlegd of sever subject doe n't realli serv mani purpos . infact , it might even be danger . have n't we all heard of the say `` half-knowledg is danger '' ?? an intern might suggest a wrong cours of treatment to a patient which could have a fatal affect . such affect are not limit to medicin alon . thu , i believ in special and aim for that kind of approach in all my endeavour .
