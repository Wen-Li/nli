i total disagre with the statement given . rather would like to start the passag with a line rightli said that we have two childhood , one when we are born and the other when we are old . in my opinion childhood is the best time of our life , which again pop up when we are old . thi is the associ that i would like to make with thi statement , as thi is the first thing that came to my mind after read the statement . when a person is young , he is more activ , advetur , enthusiast about life . probabl for the reason that he is physic fit and can take a walk in the natur without think twice about it . youngster enjoy the late night parti and can manag the cocktail . but what about the stress that they have to undergo , the stress relat not onli for there posit in life but fight that they undergo for their ambit . the fight to rise up . the fight for make correct decis 's in life . it a great respons for a young person to live a good and happi life in contrast the old peopl they are all through with the feel of ancieti or the fight for thir owm right . they again are babi who are look after for . they have almost done all the thing they want in life . they can travel , go to place or even feel free to express themself , and nobodi would mind it . though it happen that major of old peopl suffer with health problem , but then no one is perfect . both have there bad and good aspect but i would alway prefer the one support the older gener becaus i have seen at my home-set - up , the way they have been treat and i kind off like it . so like to conclud by say that it is a veri person view onlik and dislik and i woud support the latter , as it is the one which is more mental stabl .
