the given statement sound to me as it implement that young peopl have better thing do than to spend time with their commun . in gener i agre with the given statement . as far as i know it wa more common to help in the commun a centuri ago . the societi structur those day wa differ then today . not onli that the number of inhabit rise with the time and we have much bigger commun today , also peopl mostli live in big citi now and not in small commun like then . at the same time the structur of the commun chang . nowaday the work which wa done in a commun mani year ago is done by other institut now . the state is much more respons in welfare-quest or question concearn social secur in recent year . when commun were smaller , peopl help themselv out in time when someon wa sick , or need help becaus he or she wa old or could not work anymor . today , i think , peopl and especi young peopl are veri concern about their own life . time is rare , at least for peopl that have a job and \ or a famili . they need their time to manag their hosehold . but if they have the slightest bit of time that they can determin by themselv , i am sure they use it for their own amus , for cultur , fun , sport or just to spend the time with their friend and famili . i do n't know anyon out of my group of friend who is somehow involv with community-work . neighther am i . the reason for thi is for sure the chang in societi and also in social valu . the interrest chang as well . one reason peopl are less interrest in polit , social life or in their own commun might be the increas anonym in societi . so mani peopl live on a veri small area and do n't know each other . no wonder that they do not even care for each other anymor .
