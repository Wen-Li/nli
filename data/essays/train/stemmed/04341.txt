car are the most use form of transport knowaday will that chang in twenti year ? it is veri hard to answer . on develop countri nearlli everyon abov a certain age ha a car , alot of peopl use it on a daili basi : to go to work , shop , travel and on the leisur time . i use the car everyday and i can not imagin life with out it and becaus of that i think that there will be more car rather than fewer in twenti year . you can argu that : petrol is run out ! . everyon know that , everyon is awar yet not mani know what is go to happen with it price . in twenti year i beleiv that price are go to increas , less peopl are go to be abl to pay that price , peopl on shorter incom will have to use other way to move around and therefor the number of car would be expect to decreas becaus peopl wont be abl to pay the price but the problem is that there are other fuel that can be use and peopl will get use to have car which are slower and less pawerful . i also beleiv that develop countri , futur super power like china , are go to demand huge number of car as the citizen get richer . they will want to have the freedom to travel around just like european and american do know . can you imagin how mani more car that would be ? i think that not onli there will not be fewer car in use but there is go to be more and more , i have no idea how we are goin to manag with the number of car but im sure that human be will find a way to cope with it becaus as long as peopl want to use car they will use them .
