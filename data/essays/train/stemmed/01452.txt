i am definit not agre with the idea that assert older peopl can not enjoy life as young peopl do . i will explain my reason of cours . first of all , i believ that older peopl know a lot about life . they have a lot of experi about life . thi give them a veri signific advantag on do the right thing . it mean that they can do the proper thing to enjoy . they do not vast time to see if someth is enjoy or not . becaus they know what is fun , they will just do the thing they like . second , although mani peopl believ that older peopl doe not enough energi as young peopl , thi is not someth total true . if an older person take care of herself or himself then there is no need to worri about . older peopl can do anyth that they want , provid that it is safe . of cours some thing may have some risk , but do not forget that the young peopl also have these risk . third , enjoy the life doe not need to have the same mean to everybodi . differ peopl like differ thing . it is not someth releat with age . while some peopl may find the literatur as enjoy , some other may not . for exampl , i am not crayz about footbal , but my littl brother is get mad at play and watch footbal even just see the player . on the contrari , despit my love of literatur , he ha no interest on thi . there is not a gener gap between us . there is onli two-year gap . in my opinion it reveal that age is not import to enjoy someth . if a person want to enjoy someth , he or she will definit find a way . to sum up , as i tri to explain abov , i do n't think that age matter in enjoy life . it is not the age that make the thing enjoy or not , but charact of peopl that make the world enjoy . if you want to enjoy the life , take my word for it , there are limitless opportun to do so . it is up to you .
