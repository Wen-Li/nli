mani peopl disagre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus they do n't like risk . howev , i agre with the statement becaus of the follow reason . frist , tri new thing give us new chanc to know new thing . we sometim find good thing after tri new thing . for exampl , when i work as a salesman in a small compani , i thought that job were not thing that make me to enjoy . and i thought that job were necessari to earn money to live . but i chang the thought after i chang my job . when i work as a engin , i could enjoy work and i could find that job gave me enjoy as well as money . chang my job gave me the chanc to know that . for the reason , i think tri new thing give us new chanc to know new thing . second , tri new thing allow us to get new professional and new friend . for exampl , i could know not onli how to sale thing but also how to make inform system becaus i had experi to work as a salesman and a engin . i did n't know anyth about inform system befor i chang my job , and i did n't have ani chanc to meet engin . chang my job from a salesman to a engin allow me to know mani thing about inform technolog and to make mani friend who know mani kind of inform technolog . and the knowledg and friend allow me to establish a compani . so , i think that tri new thing allow us to get new knowledg and new friend . of cours , there are some risk in tri new thing . for exampl , we have chanc to loos our job after chang job . also , we have chanc to loos my profession becaus of chang job . but i think there are more advantag in tri new thing . therefor , i agre with the statement .
