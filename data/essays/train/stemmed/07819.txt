i disagre to travel around with a tour guid . it will be great to travel around the place that we like is to travel by ourself becaus if we travel by ourself , we can spend our time freeli . we do not have to care that the guid is go to go somewher in a few minut or they are go to spend a lot of time at the place that you do not realli like . it will also be relax to travel by yourself , you can wake up in the hotel whenev you want , you can go to eat anyth you like in ani time . ane you can also have chang in your trip . in order to have a good trip for ourself , it will be good to just go to the place that we like and spend our time in the thing that we are interest in . if we go with a guid , we onli have limit time in all the place . and there might be some place that we do not like . we alway want to feel relax on our trip . we are not there for busi , we are there to have fun . so if we go there with a guid , we will have to follow the rule of the guid and we will have to get up in the time that they want us to get up . there will alway have some accid in our trip and it will be good for us to make some chang in order to solv those problem . but if we go there with a guid , our plan ha alreadi been decid . we would not have ani chanc to chang our plan . for these three reason , i recomand that we should go on a trip by ourself but not be lead by other peopl .
