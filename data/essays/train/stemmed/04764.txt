the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in my opinion , that 's not true . travel by a group which is led by a tour guid will might be a good trip . you do n't have to reserv a hotel or restraunt , and you do n't have to plan almost everyth . but , i think thatther is a mistak on here . choos hotel , restsaunt , countri , where you go to go . .. everyth is fun and call `` trip '' . also we have to rememb is , guid compani could mayb make mistak . so your tour could be destroy by guid compani . these are the reason whi i disagre with thi question .
