i think that everi age ha a differ joy throughout a human 's life . young seem to do more activ and anjoy a lot but thi doe not mean that older peopl do n't enjoy live . they also have fun but in their own way . young peopl have less respons so they are more careless . they onli tri to spend their time enjoy themselv . they live for the moment without think about past or futur . they have more energi so they get involv in physic and outdoor activ such as sport game , concert , parti and park more often . they are much resist and strong which let them to be abl to take more risk . dure school year there would be a lot of friend around to spend time togeth . on the other hand , as peopl get older they take more responsibilti so they chang . usual , after school they start work and later they get marri . they becom more matur and they learn to enjoy life in other way . they may not go to parti , take risk or have a plenti of friend but have success in work , maintain a happi famili , have a pleasant dinner with old , trust friend are joy of life that ca n't be replac with anyth . as peopl grow they see the world from a wider perspect so life becom more meaning and tast . human may get older and may have some disabl becaus of age by time but live with good memori and see their grandchildren is much valuabl than go into pub . in summari , in my point of view it is veri superfici to think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . peopl enjoy everi stage of life if they live a success and honor life . peopl should live their live in a way that when they look behind they should not regret anyth .
