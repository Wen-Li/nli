today , mani peopl go to mani countri easili . do you agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ? some peopl agre with that , but other do not . there are mani opinion . person , i agre with that for sever reason . first , peopl can go to mani countri and they can enjoy their cultur , view and so on . howev if we go to travel to other place , we have to studi about tha way that how to go to the famou place and everyth about the plece what you will go . when i wa a junior high school student , we had a school trip . we went to korea for the school trip . befor we go to korea , we had to plan what we want to go . we could have a guid , but we did not , becaus we thought if we get much inform for the travel , our travel will not be bad situat . we though the inform is veri good , we will not lost ani road . howev we lost road . even we could not find ant store which we want to go . serch the inform by themselv is good thing , but we can not lead the right way alway , becaus the travel place is not your home town . second , when you go to canada , but you can not speak english what will you do ? tour guid alway speak nice english and even speak languag which you live in . sometim peopl have some trabl in the foreign countri and they can not solv the problem . if you had a travel like that , you will not be abl enjoy the travel later . howev when you have a tour guid , it doe not occur . your tour guid will solv the problem clearli and you can enjoy the travel again . in conclus , tour guid alway lead us good way and they will solv our problem easili , so i think it is good for peopl to have a tour guid .
