i think how much he/sh enjoy life doe not depend on how old he/sh is . so i disagreeto the statement , becaus it show me that the differ of age caus some differ on enjoy life . the main reason of my opinion is whenev peopl can feel joy on ani situat onli by his/her own feel . and how peolpl enjoy life doe deepli depend on how peopl think of happi . it will chang even in the same person in the differ age . the case of sport , for exampl footbal , to run or move quickli , we need the good phisic abil and sensor . the younger peopl is , the quicker he/sh move . but the quick or speed are not onli consist of the joy of footbal . to think the stragegi of goal or defenc is one of the main portion of make the game . so the expari of elder peopl will contribut to feel joy on footbal game . so both young and old peopl have a chanc to enjoy footbal . anoth case , in the season of rose , a person who know mani rose ' name feel happi to get the new one onli shown in the book , anoth person who have a good sensit nose to feel the differ of the rose enjoy the smell of them . in thi case , these two person skill or talent doe not matter with age . as i mentiond in abov two exampl , the sensit or musul abil might depend on how old he/sh is . it is one of the differ between young and elder peopl , mainli cous by matuar and phsical condit . so there is a possibl for younger peopl enjoy much more . but we human ha a good matuar brain and how happi we are is jug by his/her own brain . so if the person feel hi life is happi , that is the evic of spend his/her life with happy and enjoy . anyon without him/herself can jugg how enjoy life anoth person .
