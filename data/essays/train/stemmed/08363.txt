i do complet agre with thi statement . in my opinion , necess of higher educ have chang tremend in the past 50 year . as human knowledg explod dure thi period of time , requir for higher educ chang as well . today , becaus the amount of inform avail is so enorm big , nobodi can be abl to know everyth ani more . it ha becom more import to learn how to find fact at the moment they are requir than in fact know them by heart . nearli all inform is avail at ani place and ani time on the internet , so the problem ha chang from have a certain piec of inform to find it . school and univers can not teach all fact , even just in a small field , ani more . they can , in my opinion , onli suppli an overview and basic knowledg on their field of studi . ani further inform is just to be found and immedi use when requir . as everyth becom more intrepid and complic , i find it import to develop a certain specialis on a veri particular , small field of knowledg to be success . therefor , i need to understand basic idea and concept of all the concern and issu , my subject and job requir . but the factor that make me realli valueabl for my employ , for exampl , is the individu , veri precis knowledg i have on a certain field , which i can , of cours , integr in greater circumst by my basic knowledg of the subject i 'm work on . thi is whi i think the statement is complet right . i would even go further and state that it get also more import to individualis one 's educ independ , as i describ abov . privat studi other than the one offer at univers , school and by employ will becom as import as the classic one consid as higher educ . but for studi these , the understand of idea and concept will be the main issu .
