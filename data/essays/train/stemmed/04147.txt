media and advertis have one goal : to promot and sell their product . thi directli impli that they need to make their product attract , which is sometim not the truth . to make their product or servic attract , they need to make the consum , the client , the fix public , feel like they need it or want it . ye i believ that most advertis need to make product seem better than what they truli are . special skill are need in differ area to make a product more attract . you need a publicist , who will advertis the product where it would find the most adequ public for the product . the peopl that are more probabl to buy it . you also need a promot , who is not much differ than the publicist , or an advertis , whose sole purpous is to sell it . whether he need to luy or transofrm the truth about the object , not do so would make him unworthi of hi job . you also need a technician , a design , a whole team that can creat the right materi for the publcist to be abl to promot the good . thi can be teh photograph that take sthe pictru of the object as well as the person behind the comput that edit the photo so it can appear even appeal to the eye . ye there are also mani aspect of teh object to improv for it to be abl to sell . such as make it appeal to the widest public possibl . you also need to make it attract to eye , so that when the client see it he can imagin himself use it or simpl have it . the photo or video ha to make the object look beauti . my point is that there are whole studi field , technic team , and career that special in make thing seem much better than they are . if there are class that teach how to do so thi statement must be true . and if career are offer in such field than it 's becau etehi need profession .
