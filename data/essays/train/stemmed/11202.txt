i think is true that advertis make product seem better than they realli are , in fact the research effect of advertis is that peopl will buy the product . to get thi result there could be two differ way . the fist is base on spot : if you want to sale someth it is natur that you will show it qualiti even exager ; in commerci world there is alway a fight to get more and more buyer and it doe n't have import if the product ha realli the state qualiti , the onli import thing is that someon buy . on the other hand show a product better than it realli is ha a neg consegu , a person who had bought thi product expect some caracterist will not be satisf about that product , so it is possibl that in futur he or she would not buy it anoth time . an other polici should be to spent less money in spot and more to make the product better , so a owner will found all the request qualiti in the product and will buy it anoth time . the neg aspect is that peopl will probal buy often the product they have alreadi seen even if it cost more than other . in conclus i think that for compani will be easier to spend money on spot becaus it give immid result while the other way semm to be more difficult . it is on the owner to understand if the product is actual as good as the advertis make or if it is onli a way to make peopl convinc to buy it .
