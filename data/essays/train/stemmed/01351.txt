i agre with the statement . one reason is that in commerci , peopl may be fool by sound effect or color that have noth to do with the product . for exampl , when advertis action figur or doll , the commerci may includ voic so that it seem as though the doll is talk to you , even though the doll doe not talk . anoth reason i agre with the statement is the ad may just complet lie to you . such as in tobacco ad , although the compani know that smoke make you less attract , they use beauti peopl in their advertis . if these peopl in the ad actual did smoke , they would not be so beauti . exampl number two is when peopl say that the price of someth is cheaper than a similar product , but truli , it is more expens becaus it say tini at the bottom , `` two payment '' . the third reason i believ most advertis make product seem better than they actual are is they use peopl that have not even tri the product just say that they have . a veri realist exampl is diet product commerci . extrem thin peopl that have never heard of the product sit in front of the camera lie to the public that they got thin just by use the product and noth els . last but not least , ad say that `` thi is a limit time offer '' and a year later , you find out that it is still on the market , cheaper . actual , thi is a real experi . one day i wa watch tv and i saw a commerci sell a product and say , `` thi product will onli be sold for thi week onli ! '' . so , i bought it at a price of $ 29.99 . the next year , i wa out shop with my friend , and i saw the exact same thing at wal-mart for $ 19.99 . so , i strongli agre that mani product are advertis much better than they realli are . compani need to make product that actual work well just the way they are advertis . that way all custom will be happi with their product , and possibl buy more from that compani , so both the busi and the buyer will be satisfi .
