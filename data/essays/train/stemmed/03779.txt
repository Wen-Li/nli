i disagre with the statement that `` in twenti year there will a fewer car in use than there are today '' i strongli beliv that the number of car that are use will definetli increas but not decreas in ani senc . i support my argument by use the follow idea the no of cart that are be use is incres day by day & it will continu to incres in the futur also becaus the nessiti of the car is more , nower day the temparatur is incres day by day and travel on two wheeler involv more risk when compar to thecar . mani peopl can afford to buy a car nower day with the improv of bank loan and mani other factor . the usag of car in next twenti will not decreas becaus even if the natur resours are get exhaust peopl will find out an altrn over come the problem like develop the solar car which run by use the solar energi . even if the natur resourc get exhaust it will definetlu not happen in the next twenti year . nower day the batteri run car are invent , research and develop is be made to improv the technolog and after twenti year it definetli improov a lot . it realli hard to immagin the world with out car , sinc they are realli import to peopl in mani way . it hard travel on a two wheeler when compar to the car . in the com twenti year there will a decreas in the two wheeler but in the four wheeler like the car . some car can be driven use natur ga there fore there is no problem that the petrol or the diesel will get exhaust and the car will stop work . the technolog use in the car is also develop day by day there fore more sophist , more comfort , more econom , less fuel consum car will be develop which make life more easi . i sum , the number of car use will definetli increas due the improv technolog & need of the peopl . acoord to the statist from a decad the the usag of the car ha been increas and not decreas , the proof is just take a look at the road in the citi . the growth rate in usag of car will increas but not not decreas .
