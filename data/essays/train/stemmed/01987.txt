i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl . in my opinion there are a lot of way enjoy life that are also suitabl for older peopl . so the age is not an indic or enjoy life . perhap it seem to be obviou that young peopl enjoy their life much more than older peopl by have more activ and do sport that usual are not associ with older peopl . but do that much sport like some young peopl is not an direct evid of have a good time . for exampl there are mani older peopl that travel the whole world after they have n't to work anymor . travel the world and visit sever countri is in my opinion a veri good way to enjoy life . in addit to that there are a lot of older peopl that do mani thing up to a veri high age . for exampl politician are normal abov 60 year old and probabl enjoy their work . addit , in my own famili my grandpa did a lot of work in the garden up to an age of 86 like he did as garden befor . final i constantli experi anoth exampl for older peopl enoy their life . when i go to the swim pool in the morn , the most peopl are older than 60 . while swim they are talk with each other and enjoy the morn sun . as mention abov peopl who have n't to work anymor have much more time to concentr on their hobbi than younger peopl . so if enjoy life would realli be indic by the activ of the peopl , older peopl can concur with young peopl basic by have more time . i could imagin a life for me in a few decad in which i have the time and the money to build me an own home cinema . so i would realli enjoy my life despit my high age . in conclus the given point abov show that the age is not an indic for enjoy life .
