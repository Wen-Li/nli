i complet agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two main reason for that : they give a perfect appear of an object that is not alway that beauti , and they repres some product as be abl to do thing that are quit improb . first of all , most advertis work on the physic aspect of the product in the pictur or commerci . thi is intent to show a perfect physic aspect of the product , but thi doe n't alway reflect the realiti . for exampl , when you watch a mcdonald 's commerci , they give the burger a much prettier imag than the one you will actual hold in your hand when you order it yourself . anoth exampl would be makeup commerci , in which all product seem to have a magic effect , when in fact , the light and beauti model boost their appar effici . these represent are intend to make the consum buy the product , but he or she will most probabl be disappoint when tri it . second of all , most advertis display their product as be abl to do thing that are quit improb , or at least veri difficult . one major exampl for thi is car advertis on televis , which may show the vehicl climb cliff , engag on race track , or go into wild natur without ani problem . in each case , and for ani vehicl advertis , the product is not onli shown as be adapt for these action , it is also present as the better one . thi is sure not possibl for all of those car , at least not with an everyday-lif driver . although some of the advertis may repres product accur , the market rule lead advertis to make strong endeavor to repres the product as well as they can to attract the consum , even if it is not the exact realiti .
