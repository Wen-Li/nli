i feel that in twenti yera number of car use will be much more than the one that are be use today . there are sever reason that i can think of to support thi view such as : increas in popul , more depend on altern fuel , competitv price by the car manufactur . the populatin of the world ha been increas in exponenti proport over the past few decad and i do not think thi trend would chang much in the next two decad . with the increas in popul the number of peopl use person vehichel would also increas and thu thi would increas the number of car purchs and use . even though the increas in the comerti fuel price might deter the peopl from use car , of late we have seen a conciou effort made by the govetn in vario countri to use natur fuel like bio-diesel which would mean that thefupric will be taken care of . even the electr vechicl woul serv thi purpos . with the increas globalis the car manufactur would be compet with each other to sell their car and thi might result in competit price . compet price will lower the car sale and thu encourag the peopl to buy the car . the increas number of car fiananc woul enhanc the sale . with most of the govrnment lay emphasi on infrastructu develop , the new road and flyover would help reduc the traffic congest to a larg extent . moreov thi world is becom so materialist that i guess we would have to see a major calam result due to the damag caus by the pollut berfor the govern would place mre stringent law in order to retrict the number of car sale . even if law are pass to limit the sale of car it would take a long time befor the state could provid adequ public transport serv the entir popul . henc becaus of the abov reason i feel the number of car would onli increas over come few decad .
