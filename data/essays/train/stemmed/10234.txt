i have to agre with that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . the young peopl ha good health , strong bodi and they are veri activ . young peopl ha good health and they do n't need need to spend time in the hospit and take midecin . they enjoy their thim in mani interst thing such as swim , traval , footbal and so on . on the other hand , the older peopl spend most of their time either in the hospit or take midic for their illniss . they do n't have much time for fun . young peol are strong . they have strong bodi which help them to carri hevey thing . they can carri their cheldern and play with them . they lift wight if the need to exercis . but the older peopl are weak to carri hevey wight . some of them are not be abl to move hi bodi . young peopl are veri activ . they can work hard and make moni . they can play sport . howev , the older peopl is not activ . they are veri slow if they move from place to other . in the end the live is short and if you are young enjoy your live .
