the world today demand for student to understand that an educ is a tool that is use to `` keep the world go . '' now , mani student choos to learn the bare minimum to get by in their profession career , and are exempt from their live that understand concept and idea is more import than to just learn quick fact . in my experi understad a specif subject in a class ha enrich my learn abil , and given me the satisfact of understand everi detail of that specif cours . i have seen mani of my classmat bare get by through school , becaus they reli on learn quick fact , pass cours , and then receiv a diploma so they can join the work forc . i strongli beliv that they join the real world unprepar . the student bodi that use fact as a method of learn will have incovieni disabl understand concept later in life becuas they will not know how to analyz situat correctli and solv problem . as simpl as a fact can be , it may influenc learn significantli , for exampl , fact : if student use the method `` memori dump '' as soon as they receiv the test , it will help them to do better . well , if student would reli more on understad the subject matter and the idea they are be test on prior to the exam , they would not have to reli on `` memori dump . '' i am in complet accord with student experienc life through understad concept and idea , sinc thi way they may alway be abl to spread their knowleg with other peopl . just imagin live life with onli fact , that mani time are uneccessari and vagu , wherea to live life with the full knowledg that you can explain or simpli express ani topic due to the understad you aquir dure your learn period .
