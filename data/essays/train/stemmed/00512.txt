i agre complet with thi statement . i think there are variou argument to support it . to begin , the grow number of car is becom a problem nowaday . in some citi , like london , they tri to find a solut to reduc the number of user by ask a fee to drive into the citi . have so much car in a confin area bring a lot of problem like pollut , park problem , accid without even think about the fact that so mani car consum a lot of fluel . speak of , it 's abund is drop danger , and of cours the price is equal expand . it 's becom a luxuri to drive now . mayb there will be a restrict at some point , that allow each person to drive a certain amount of time in a week . thi could encourag peopl to drive with friend or colleagu to a work place for exampl . thank to thi , fewer car will be in use everi day ! i 'm actual wonder if certain firm could give money to peopl who fill up their car to drive to work . thi could even bring peopl closer togeth . if you watch sciencefict movi , you quickli realis that in most of them , there are not even car ! the car have been replac by some kind of machin fli around . perhap some scientist are current tri to come up with new idea to replac car in a environment friendli way . a easier way to reduc the number of car would also be to expand huge the differ form of transport like train , bu and subway in a way that car will becom unnecessari . if peopl realis that it 's easier , cheaper and faster to go anywher by train , bu or subway , car will becom useless . sadli , thi is still not the case nowaday . certain area are to remot to acc them by ani other way than by car . it is still easier and safer as well to ride home with the car in the middl of the night . anyway , i 'm curiou how the mean of transport will evolv dure the next year .
