i disagre with thi statement . in my opinion young peopl do enough for there commun . there are mani job in the commun , which are not realli paid , an dwhich are done from young peopl , for exampl streetwork or some peopl who work in youthclub , they do a lot of work for kid , which do not know how to spend the time they have . i do n't know much older peopl with an age higher that twenty-f . they also help the commun with young crimin , which think they have no futur and their life is to steal or to beat some one , to get some money . thi is import work also for the commun and of cours the polic , who ha to follow commun opinion by have it a save area , the streetwork also help as a big part of the system . there are also mani other thing were young peopl help , for exsampl orchestra 's , they play music without get money , but the whole communiti ha it part of it , happi peopl and street festiv . what about emerg , there are a lot of young peopl help everi weekend and although the whole week , without get the same money like emerg employ by the commun get - thi would be much to expens . take an sportev , it not abl to make it a good one if you do n't have peopl outsid the commun , who help you , the most of help hand are younger peopl , mani are sportsmen or woman themself , so they like to help wherev they can . may be there are reason that peopl say young peopl do n't do enough , it right there are some part where young peopl not give there time to help , but often thi are area where older peopl say that younger peopl are n't abl to , so the younger peopl are a littl bit piss off and think that the older one can make thi project or someth like thi alon .
