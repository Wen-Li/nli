i think that new thing in life can be discov onli if there is a perfect observ . if it wo n't be there then it 's not possibl to discov new thing . some beliv that take risk in life you may go ahead but other think that it 's better to do what we know . but i think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . i have sever reason for hold my opinion . if a person is work in a factori and hi boss ha allot a particular work and he is confus then it will be difficult for him to do that work . but if he take risk and tri to solv that problem then it would be veri easi to help hi boss . even , scientist are invent more thing by take risk . for an exampl , while invent a comput it wa difficult for them to select what wa necessari for invent it . but , at that time if they would not have take risk then it would be difficult for them to invent a comput . i would like to give an exampl of an everyday 's life . some peopl spend there money in buy lotteri ticket by take risk . but if they will get doubl money then it would be use for them . and as such they will be beniffit by take risk . if a person is shi or is not readi to take risk then he might miss an opportun in get scholarship . if he think taht hi score is veri low then he is unabl to appli hi result in differ univers . and probali he will have to wast hi futur . as a result of risk our countri is progress econom . if we would n't have taken risk then we would be still stand at that same placewer our ancesstor were . so , i think that take risk in life success peopl tri new thing .
