i stronli disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . in my point of view that , on the contrast , older peopl could face their life in a posituv way and do some valuabl thing that they want to and they have not a demand attidut toward other . older peopl , therefor , i think would enjoy life more than young peopl . at the first place , older peopl have enough time to travel and see the world . i , myself , am a local english tour guid in beij , my hometown , as a part-tim job . most of the tourist i took were the eld peopl from australia . the most situat for them were they had travel mani place in the world after they got retir and they told me the stori about their travel . when they were tell those stori , what i saw from theri face wa the happi they got from travel . seconli , they , the older peopl , could face their life in a posit way by which they enjoy themself veri much . most of old coupl i took were thi sort of peopl . it is commen thing for them to pick trash up on the ground while the young peopl around were just past by or kick it off . i rememb that an old man who got a band back persist to climb up to the top of the great wall without ani help , such cabl car . i wa told by him that thi wa part of my life and i enjoy it veri much . on the other hand , most of the young peopl in my life includ my can not enjoy our life by travel . first , we do n't have that much of money to support the travel ; second , the most import thing for us is studi . besid , young peopl have n't not that much life experi which might lead they see thing in a neg way . take a freshmen in my colleg thi year for exampl . thi student , who majoy in spanish , jump themself from the forth foor just for a n unbeliv reason that she could not pronaus the spanish sound extactli . to sum up it , i do not agre that statem of young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i do think that it is old peopel who have much life experi to enjoy .
