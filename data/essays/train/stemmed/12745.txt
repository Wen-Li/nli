nowaday , in our countri we have a huge number of car run on the highway , and it seem that someth need to happen to avoid thi situat that sometim becom problemat . in ani case , i do not completi agre with the question . let me explain better , on one hand , we know the import that the transnat compani car have for the economi . the motor industri is one of the most import industri in the world . so , i suggest that it is imposs to stop the product of the car , without affect other field , or aspect of the economi . and mayb it could have impredec effect . i am not consid the economi as the most import thing , thi is not my aim , but unfortunatelli , we have to think on thi fact , becaus we need to have good economi to avoid conflict in the futur . on the other hand , we have new altern to support the impact that the car have in the planet . in thi point , we should speak about car that use other kind of energi and more or less have the same capac to move us . these car use ga , or veget oil . we have to assess thi point to achiev that the idea of individu freedom remain . in conclus , in my opinion it is earli to know if in the futur there will be more or few car in the planet , becaus it is not easi to answer thi question . usual the peopl seem to think just in the neg aspect of the car , forget the possit point of view . i mean , we have to consid that the car is one import aspect of our common life , and not just for enjoy , but for work or travel . i tri to explain that , apart from consid the number of car , we have to know if it will exist the possibl for avod the damag that the car do in the enviro . i think that the peopl will creat a new kind of car on thi goal , for the futur . i hope so .
