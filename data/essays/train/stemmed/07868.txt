there are mani possibl for young peopl to help their commun . they could engag in polici , give sport lesson , take part in the red cross or be activ in their church . but , in fact , there are quit few peopl who actual do some of these thing . what are the reason for thi ? one point could be that young peopl feel littl respons for their commun . they have to think so much about themselv , about how to plan their life and how to organ their career , that think about other seem not to fit in . they just live accord to the sentenc `` if everybodi think of themselv , it is thought of everybodi '' . one should not call all of them unfair , some of them are simpli overwhelm by all the thing they have to manag in their own life , so that they can not concentr on other . and for some of them there simpli is not much time to engag for other thing than for school or for univers . mani student i know have to work veri hard to be success in their field of studi , so that there is onli littl time to concentr on other thing . the time they have , they prefer use to meet friend or just to relax . on the other hand , not engag in one commun is , of cours , veri comfort . know that there are peopl who do the work make mani peopl think : `` well , whi me if they do it so well ? '' and one may not forget that for mani peopl there is not much that they regard to be worth to engag for . most young peopl in our societi live quit well , they have chanc for their futur , the societi they live in is shape by a stabl democraci . whi fight or engag for someth if everyth seem alright ? anoth point i consid to be influenc is , that mani young peopl would like to engag in their commun , but they just do not know how or who to ask . perhap approach student and propos possibl would make them think about get activ in their commun . on the other hand , one should not forget all the young peopl who realli sacrific much time and nerv to serv their commun . there are alway peopl engag in a school or in differ club who offer their talent and also their time for so mani other peopl . so one should not forget to regard the stament in an appropri way .
