it is often express either explicitli or implicitli that young peopl enjoy their life more than old peopl do . in my opinion , thi is the wrong approach to thi issu . let me first collect sever similar between those two group . both young peopl and retir peopl do usual not work or at least they do not have to work to make a live ( thi if of cours onli valid for industri nation ) . therefor , they are left with consider amount of leisur time at their dispos . whi should older peopl not be abl to enjoy thi time to the same extent as young peopl ? they onli choos to spend that time differ . old peopl might not enjoy snowboard , volleybal or go out as much as young peopl do . but old peopl might enjoy go to the theater , make a sea cruis or just meet with friend as much or even a lot more than young peopl do . both group enjoy their live - but they tend to have differ concern what they regard as enjoy and worthwil . also , such a holist approach doe not dignifi a human be 's exist as an individu . say that `` young peopl '' or `` old peopl '' as a whole enjoy their live much or less than the other group would be a crude gener . of cours , there are miser , complain old peopl who obvious do not enjoy their live . but take a closer look and you will find that it is not hard to find veri similar individu among young peopl . the other way around : of cours , mani young peopl like go out , have a good time with friend and enjoy themselv . but you will have no difficulti find a real parti anim among old peopl if you realli tri to . judg peopl by their outer appear , and age is part of that , doe not take their person , their prefer and their attitud into consider . if you do so , you are ignor an import part of a human be . becaus of the given reason , i disagre with the statement and i think older peopl can enjoy their life as much as old peopl do . perhap not in the same way , perhap not alway as visibl ( and sometim offens ) as young peopl . but they certainli do .
