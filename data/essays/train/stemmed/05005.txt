i am kind of disagre with thi statement . i agre that to understand idea and concept are import , but to learn fact are also import . by understand idea and concept student learn how fact take place . it is not just onc you understand idea , you do need to worri about how fact happen . for exampl , my professor explain the process of the earthquack . she briefli describ each and everi detail about it . now i know how do earthquack happen , but what if i do not know the fact of it . how can i prove my concept about the earth quack , if i do not have the specif exampl . if i said that there are earthquack happen in indonesia , and explain these are the reason thi happen over there more often , then i support my statement . my fact support my concept and idea . happn of the earthquack in indonesia is a fact . i need to know it to understand my concept better . fact are import in order to understand the concept . you can not say that fact doe not worth it . without fact no concept and no idea take place . fact are the life of the concept . one more exampl here is that countri in sourthern hemishpher have warmer climat and countri in northern hemispher have cooler climet . how can i proov thi statement ? i will give all my geograph reason and explan . how can i proov all my geograph reason ? now to have fact is import . if i say that unit state is in northern hemishpher and that is whi it is have cloor climat , and shri lanka is in southern hemispher and that is whi it is have warmar climat . thi is the fact . my fact support my argument . fact are import to proov your statement . you can not just state someth and agre with it without give specif reason and exampl . basic , the fact are as import as concept and idea . they both are equal . none of them is more import than the other .
