the statement is about , whether to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to have special konowledg in one particular subject . i prefer to have special knowledg in one particular subject rather than have broad knowledg on mani subject . if we concentr on one subject specif it will be veri much use for us so that we can know everi thing about that subject perfectli . if we have knowledg on one particular subject it would veri easi for us even to find job relat to that subject . it will also help us to becom a proffesion in that particular subject . generali it is not that much easi for ani one to concentr on all the other subject and acquir broad knowledg about them . if weconcentr on subject relat to comput we can decid the way to which we should go that is you will have an idea to appli for the job relat to comput rather than appli for ani other field . suppos if i we have knowledg on both elctron and comput we will be in a dilema situat whether to appli for a comput job or electron job for exampl i like mathemat a lot from my primari educ . i use to get the top mark in mathemat everi time . when i join my engin i use to concentr on electr subject . as a result i found reali difficult to pass mathemat dure my graduat , thi becaus i tri to to have knowledg on mani subject relat to electron . as i tri to gain knowledg on elctron subject i wa unabl to concentr on the subject which i use to have knowledg earlier and i even lost my knowledg on that subject . so i strongli support to concentr one particular subject rather than on tri to have a broad knowledg on mani other subject . the main disadvantag of tri to have broad knowledg on mani academ subject is we will be reali diificult to choos our profess that is if you concentart onli on mathemat you can known as an mathematician . whera if tri to gain knowledg on all academ subject no one can say what you are , i mean whether you are mathematicin or an engin or an doctor . by attempt to have knowledg on all subject you may even loos the knowledg about the subject which you have greater control . so it would be better if we have broad knowledg on one particular subject than have knowledg on mani subject . it will save your time , help you to choos the perfect path which you are interest in and will leav a satisfactori feel for you .
