that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is rel of each person . for me a 25 student tri to achiev mani thing as a good job or high steem reput the life some time could be stressful , but it is import to keep a balanc between what i want and what i need . some time the older peopl have enough benefit to enjoy the rest of their life . of cours they work for all their life , and right now have the money to spend travel or live in quiet place where they can rest in peac , but what about those with out the benefit ; in contrast there are old peopl around the word without money or benefit of ani kind . they sometim have to go to the street ask for cent so they can live . in thi case it would be imposs to get a good qualiti of life . on the other hand , the young peopl have all the chanc in front of them . they can live their life as they want , sometim rush in new thing without think the consecu . other young peopl are more concern about build a reput and have good job and that kind of life make them happi . i think that all depend of what the peopl want for themself . to conlcud , for me is easier to enjoy the life and get the thing that i want work as a young person , thu i can start to work in how i want to spend my life as and elderi person , so i could enjoy it when that time come to .
