i total agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . no matter if peopl are success in their carreer or in sport , they probabl have made the experi that without tri someth new and put someth at risk noth will chang . success is a process not a static thing . success will happen just in a frame of time . for exampl a product , let say a mobil phone . the first seri of mobil had appear year ago . they had been a great success for nokia , siemen etc . but if thi compani did invest in research to invent new featur , better technolog , the product mobil phone would not be interest until now , becaus after a certain amount of time everyon would have own a mobil and thi compani would be nor more successful . thi point bolster the statement that success come with tri new thing . that peopl have to take risk is also veri good shown by peopl who are veri success in sport . for exampl ski flyer . they have to improv their techniqu everi time . trainer tri to achiev better result of them in teach them new method , invent new materi . if thi sportsmen would just reli on what they did last season how could it be possibl that everi year the result are new high score and record . on the other hand tri out new thin also risk their abil to win . in conclus i would like to say that peopl that are success are awar of the fact that there is a need for develop and risk for everi singl success . a famou statement say that the success will not come follow the mass to the sea but look for the spring . that what the point is , you have to walk on individu path and not on the path of somebodi els .
