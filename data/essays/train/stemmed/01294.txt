as a human be we are get older day by day uncounci and most of the time unwillingli . most of the time it creat seriou problem for the adult . but i believ that grow older doe n't mean that you have to lose your joy of live . i total disagre with the belief that young peopl enjoy life more that the older peopl do . there are more reason and more possibl for a older peopl to enjoy life . first of all it is so obviou that young peopl spend their time and energi by deal with the requir of their social enviro . for instanc after the graduat from the high school i immedi start to studi my lesson in the univers . i could n't find time even to go on a vacat . moreov young peopl not onli spend their time but also spend their energi in order to deal with the handicap that they have been face . in contrast to them older peopl can save time becaus of their experi . they do not need to deal with those problem and they do noyt have to spend time on it . in contrast to thi they can go on a vacat everytim they want . further more they seek for enjoy time more than the youngster do . young peopl think that they will have time and chanc to enjoy life in the futur but sinc older peopl are well awar of how fast the time past . they do n't wait to do someth that they realli want they use their sens rather than their logic . my father ha start to deal with the garden after he retir from the court . he had work for sever year continu . right now he know everyth about plant . he know that he wo n't be abl to make hi dream come through if he wait longer . on the other hand i could n't find time to improv my clarinett . i believ that thi is best exampl which suit to the dicuss about time becaus i still imagin that someday i will find time to improv it . as a conclus , i do not agre with the statement about the amount of joy that older peopl get from life . as i face dure my entir life older peopl know better how to enjoy and how to spend good time by use their experinc and sens .
