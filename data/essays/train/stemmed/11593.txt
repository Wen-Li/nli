i beliv that all the peopl want to enjoy their live . not onli old peopl but also young peopl , too . i agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . young peopl are more energet . young peopl can make more time than old peopl to enjoy . young peopl do n't have to think about the other peopl in the famili like old peopl . first , young peopl are more energet than old peopl . they work hard and the next day they can enjoy snowboard whole day . then they have no problem to go to work the next day . the do n't get tire easili , becaus they put prioriti to enjoy of their live . howev , old peopl do n't want to get too tire sinc they care about their hearlth more than young peopl and their bodi do n't follow their mind . second , young peopl are more flexibl at their time . old peopl have to think about thier job and consid the other peopl 's schedul , too . on the other hand , young peopl can make time whenev they want to . they can come home late to go to the movi and go to the librari until late at night not consid the time . final , there are more possibl that young peopl are singl . when they are singl or do n't have the babi . they do n't have to think about what other famili member ' opinion about their enjoy of their live . they can go to the night club . they can go to trip whenev they want to . but when they are not singl , or have children they should consid mani situat , and ca n't be selfish . from abov the reason , i think young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . they do n't have to think about mani situat which old peopl have to do . health , flexibl time and what other famili member .
