the art of advertis advertis is one of the most influenci techniqu in peopl mind , human ha invent a weapon to control the market . mani major industri expend million of dollar in advertis , becaus advertis is what realli pop up their sale . product may be good , but advertis tri to make them look better . most of advertis onli show the qualiti of product , but deffinetli they dont show the bad face of them . we are total surround by advertis , there are everywher . the citi are full of them . almoust all product in market are advertis in differnt place . our mind are fulli influenc by them . in my point of view , i agre with the statement , most adverstis make product seem much better than they realli are . to support thi idea a perfect exampl is credit card comerci : if we see a credit card comerci on tv , tit might show us an incred vacat in the himalaya or a beautiful yatch in the middl of the caribbean , so the first we imagin is us on that situat , then the next think we do is appli for a credit card , deffinetli we will be the next person in the himalaya or the caribbean , and that 's not true the true is that we might have the credit card , but we cant affort the trip , we need to work harder to get the money to pay the trip , if we dont have the money to pay , we wont be abl to go , and the credit card wont be as useful as it look . anoth exampl might be the food advertis , non of the food you get , are as good as big or as tasti as the one they show on the advertis . also must advertis are proffesion , and they know how to manipul produc and make the look the way peopl want them to look , but when peopl buy the product , they are total differ from what they saw in the advertis expect . for me , advertis industri is valid , peopl can make effort triy to show the best characterist of a product , but what is not valid for me , is that advertis manipul them to show advantag that the dont have .
