i definit agre with thi statement ! everyday govern use differ measur and tri to involv peopl in the pollut problem that our planet face at the moment . there are two type of measur that the govern use to discourag peopl to use their car so as to fight with the pollut . on the one hand , ` green ' or social valu get more and more import to the societi and are stress in newspap and advertis . for instanc in my citi we can often see advertis for use public transport instead of your own car . in addit to thi type of commun , the citi of lyon introduc a new concept of move from one point to anoth by use bicycl . thi compani is call velo'v and allow peopl to borrow a bicycl for a certain amount of time practic for free ! the subscipt fee is about 5 euro per year which is veri tempt ! on the other hand , govern put barrier to the use of the car in the citi center by fix entri fee or by make park fee veri high . for exampl in london you have to pay 8 pound to get to the citi of london ! and also you have to pay again when you want to drive back home . thi measur ha encourag mani english peopl to use train or underground , but also help to decreas the traffic problem and the air pollut in the citi . from all these statement and exampl we can draw a conclus . i think the govern is realli concern about ecolog problem of our planet and use all kind of measur to encourag peopl to use their car less . as for me , i definit agre with these polici and hope that in twenti year we could slow down the air pollut problem .
