i agre with the idea that young peopl do n't give enough time to help thier commun . the young around me particip in the tradit ceremoni and activ at least . howev , the number of the young whe are involv with such kind of activ is not so mani . my friend engag in the protect the tradit danc and ceremoni even though they were not born in the citi , and they build the good relationship with local peopl . i heard local peopl admir the attitud and pasion toward the event . i wa move to hear hat , but most young do n't have time to engag in it becaus they have what they have to do befor help thier commun . for exampl , they have to studi and work as a part time job . therefor , they do n't have enough time to particip in it even though they are interest in activ . a friend of mine said that she want to take part in the activ that they can play with local school children , but she ca n't do that becaus of lack of time and larg amount of homework . second , the adult are also neg for the social activ . for exampl , some parent do n't allow thier children to commun with neighbor , and they grow up thier children in that way , as a result , they ca n't help grow without know the system of commun . sinc i wa born in the commun where the relationship among the commun wa strong , so i could particip in mani activ . howev , the peopl who wa born in urban area have n't experienc activ . i guess if the young , who have n't experienc the activ and been taught the import of relationship among the communitiy , grow up , the number of involv with the activ would decreas more and more . we can learn a lot of thing from commun activ , so we shoud take part in it and the adult shoud teach the import .
