in my opinion would be great to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject but to be more realist i think that is better to special in one or a veri narrow rang of specif subject . first of all i guess that it would be veri difficult to learn about mani subject and that who want to follow thi way have to spend so mani effort on it . i total disagre with the statement and the reason , which i mention previous , is becaus i prefer to be more realist , in fact i think that if you are special in a specif subject you can improv your skill about it and you can get a job or be hire from someon more like than if you have few notion about mani thing . anoth import point is that if you are spacial in a particular thing you are suppos to be veri interest in it and you can realli enjoy to studi it and go more in depth . with a broad knowledg of mani academ subject you can probabl just have a shallow knowledg of them instead of studi them deepli . at last i think that is pretti wrong to have a wide knowledg spread among a lot of subject even becaus i think that without specialist , the world , would n't be as it is know , i guess that it would be still as it wa in the past , without all the new invent that chang histori societi and our way of live . i know that probabl i did n't argument my idea in depth and i am probabl too confus but that is becaus i wa tri to disguis that i do n't agre with the statement becaus i do n't believ to be abl to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject and i am disappoint about it . lol .
