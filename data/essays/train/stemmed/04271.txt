i think that a student first must learn to judg . what do i said ? in the school often the teacher do n't teach at student the differ between the concept and fact . thi situat creat a not qualiti and abil in the student to understand what is import for him and for them . i agre with the statement becaus in my school carrier i have learn that it 's import chois and to say make a chois , sometim fact bring you on wrong way . student are put themselv everi day to contact with real world and with difficolti life , opposit than the last own life , for thi way at thi time it 's import for student to understand idea or concept than it is for them to learn fact . for to improv their capac is well thing read all day one or more journal , read book watch tv news program and discuss whit professor or parent , and with friend about a problem . the tought of the most famou professor is that increas tha capac of judg in futur gener made decreas the problem in the world becous tha knowledg of a problem join with the own idea and concept help to solv by fact . in itali are born specif colleg cours where the professor teach what are the rule for increas the own person and introspect analis and dure the primari school the student learn the basem of sociti 's costum . anoth import passag is for the student , and i think is good thing improv , `` the reason meet '' found in the wold . in my studi first and in my profess now i have research alway the idea and concept becaus without thi aspect wa for me imposs know and learn fact .
