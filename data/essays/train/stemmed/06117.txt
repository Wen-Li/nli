i complet agre with the statement . advertis is for definit fals , it primari task is that of convinc , persuad or bring someon to do or buy someth . in do thi , it can reli on a number of strategi . the first one is present a product with mani more qualiti than the one it realli ha . a perfect imag , or a modifi pictur , can catch the attent and convinc the public . also , i saw a lot of advertis omit the neg thing concern the product . i think anyway that we are consciou of thi but we accept it . when i read a newspap for exampl , my attent focus on a nice colour pictur and often i do not spend time read at the bottom of the page what is written in littl charact , even if i know if i woud read i would probabl find someth bad about what first impress me . or also , i am watch tv and there is a famou actress advertis the new lipstick of a brand . .. immedi i feel like i want it , so i go and buy it . but when i have it i realiz it ha noth more than the one from the supermarket i had befor ( sometim it could even be worst ) and it wa just more expens . anyway these are the rule and law of advertis , they have to sell and they do everyth it is permit in order to reach their aim . advertis the fals is not legal , but they alway find a way to escap thi crime and as i said befor it is also our fault as costum . i am convinc that there is a kind of silent agreement between us and the advertis , as in some way we support thi . to conclud , ye , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , but thi is also our chanc to get in touch with an ideal world . the fundament thing is be consciou .
