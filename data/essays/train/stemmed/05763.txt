the issu at hand is whether advertis make product seem better than they realli are or not . thi is a veri import issu , becaus advertis have a great influenc on our everi day life . in my opinion advertis assum product to be better than they realli are . for thi i have sever reason . the first is that i experienc how advertis can lie in my own life . i saw a new hair shampoo at the tv , which should make my hair more shini and easier to form . becaus of thi advertis i went to the shop and bought the shampoo . mayb my hair wa shinier after use the shampoo , but it wa not easi to model it at all . in realiti it wa even more difficult . thi is one of the exampl which made me cast doubt on advertis . now i alway question what is shown . anoth reason is that i compar what i see in the advertis with the thing i can buy at the shop . through thi it is obviou that the advertis are lie . everyth look so color at the tv but in realiti it is not color at all . it is just like everi other product you can buy in the shop , which is not advertis . final , one can sometim see how advertis are produc . that complet convinc one that advertis make product seem better than they are . take for exampl some sort of food . when peopl want to advertis such product they have special strategi for it . the most interest is that most time the food is not real . advertis just put it togeth with artifici materi . so it look better and you just want to buy it . you will never find product in advertis in their origin way . that is a big lie to the custom , is it not ? to sum up , i think that advertis make product better than they realli are becaus of my own experi , compar between advertis product and the actual product in the shop and becaus of the way advertis are produc .
