i agre with the idea that now a day young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i feel thi true atleast in my countri . in olden day dure freedom struggl mani young peopl felt it is their respos to help their countri to regain it glori . thi can demonstr from the fact that most of the nation leader at that time had a veri good record in help the commun when they were young . may be it is becaus they are veri enthusiast or may be the condit demand them to do so but they definit spent more time in help commun than modern day guy . now a day young peopl have becom more lazi mainli becaus the hard ship face by the peopl over the period of time ha reduc and that they gener do n't face the hard condit face by the peopl in earlier time . more over with the advenc of entertain industri the young peopl have found a way to kill their leasur time there by not bother about the thing that are happen around them . more over with the advenc of import of studi now a day young peopl often get preoccupi in their own problem find it difficult to care about problem face by the commun . but they are not realis by neglect the commun they are neglect them selv . the point that peopl are neglect their commun can be demonstr by the point the number of strike against bad govern polici ha reduc over a period of time . so i say that now a day peopl dont give enough time to help their commun and by do so they are spoil them selv and also the commun . i final say that peopl should spend more time for commun as did by their predissor
