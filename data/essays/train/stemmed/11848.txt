i disagre with the follow statment , `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . if we are just tri take a glanc to the increas shift of the technolog all over the world , then we have to believ that the number of the car will accodringli increas reach the top of the peak . the reason which contribut with thi huge car inclin are mani , such as the great advanc develob in the technolog , and the remark extinst of the popul who live on the earth at the same world . there is an advanc technolog exisit not onli everi day but everi moment these day , and the peopl tri to provid the custom with best product . if we comapar to number of the model of the car befor twenti year and now , we will see the remark differ . the same way if we tri to comar today 's model with twenti year from now , we will diffenitlli be shock by the statist . moreov to thi advanc technolog , the number of the popul which are n't onli exceed the estim limit by our mind , but we can feel it indirectli through the nois , crowd , and the number of the peopl who die from these car accid . let say that thi is the tax of the technolog that we want to live in . in other word , the number of the car will rais , year after year , and thi increas will be out of our control . becaus of the technolog and the popul growth , the car after twenti year will be more not fewer that today . if i get the chang to own my own car i will never hesist to do so . at leat i can get red of the driver , depend on myself , and do all of my requir by myself . no one will do them better than me .
