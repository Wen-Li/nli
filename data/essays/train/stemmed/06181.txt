i total agre with the statement . i think that a student would acolmpish more with thi techniqu of learn . thi way he/sh will not memor while learn but rather understand how the person invent the theori . thi ; is an effect way of learn but a teacher would not have the time for teach everi person in the class where that theori came for and what wa the way of think . by teach like thi the teacher open the theori in to debat and student will ask tonn of question . eventu there will be no left becaus everi student will have differ kind of question and some of them will deni the theori due to the lack of experi and proof . in the other hand ; write some equat on the board and make the student memor them will be much easier becaus the student ca n't question but the they wo n't ani more then they are given which shut their mind to think and improv the theori . at the end they forget what they have learn throughout the year becaus they have memor . final ; thi way of learnig is onli for the student who have the abund resourc of teacher who can argu with them and for the student who doe not studi onli for the exam and who want to learn for life .
