i disagre with the statement that there will be fewer car in twenti year than there are today . at first question i mention about if i am read statement : what is the definiton of a car in twenti year ? are we talk about car like today ? with a ga enging or are we talk about a vehicl with altern enging ? if so , for me thi vehicl are not car . they are anoth kind of transpor machin and can not be summar under the topic car . so , it might be possibl to say there are less car in twenti year , but onli becaus of a statist trick . anoth reason whi i disagre with the statement is the fact , that most peopl in thi world nowaday still have no car . of cours the most peopl in the western world got are car but what about all the peopl in asia and africa ? onli in one of thi area live more peopl then in the western world togeht , e.g. india . also the industri revolut alreadi start in those countri and it is onli a matter of time when they will get the same life standard than the peopl in the western world . life standard in the western world mean to be an owner of at least one car . today it is possibl to see the statist fact that one cititzien , e.g. in germani , often own more then at least two car . so if onli the peopl in india at least will own onli one car the statement fals . the last reason whi i disagre with the statement is that the industri need car to move their good between there product area . therefor it doe not matter if we are talk about a compani that produc heavi product or just produc servic . to connect the peopl with the product of the compani it is necessari to use a car . the employe must be abl to meet hi custom and the custom need the possibl to get to the compani for e.g. to buy someth or to ask for servic .
