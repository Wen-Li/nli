person , i preffer to travel without a tour guid , tour travel are regularli done by a schedul , it ha it own agenda and i preffer to take my time in thing that in thing that interest me the most . the best way for me is use a map , which i found veri easi to use , and befor go out on the first day do an itinerari of thing you are more interest in see or do . for exampl i wa in pari last summer with my girlfriend , we bought a map of the citi and we research on the internet the most interest place in pari , we search each site on the map and did a 3 day rout of what we want to do , all the place of those area we want to visit and in the end we still had a lot of time to enjoy more place than we tought . thi way you dont have to be stuck in place you might get bore . when i got home i show all the pictur to my father of all the place we went , becaus he went to the same citi 2 year ago , with a tour guid and he said they didnt even visit 50 % of the place we visit without the tourist guid . i recommend tourist guid trip for older peopl who have never visit a citi or for teenag who want to know more about the cultur of the place . travel on your own help you grow as a person , help you not to depend on other , help you to be more independ and also to discov thing for yourself . tourist guid may think what place are better for your learn and what are the most import place of each citi , but in the end i preffer to travel alon .
