the issu at hand is about the number of car that will be present in about twenti year from now . i strongli disgre that the number of car would decreas in the next twenti year . the first reason to support my belief would be the popul of the world . the popul in thi world is increasingli so drastic that there is no question of decreas in the number of car in ani way in the near futur . if anyth , i think that there will actual be a sharp increas in the number of car . nowaday have a car of the latest model and technolog is a style statement . so much so that teenag demand realli expens car from their parent at a veri young and impression age . on an averag everi famili might have eventu have two car eventu as the children grow up . i would like to quot a veri person exampl in thi context . my own brother had hi own car when he wa about eighteen year old , when he enter hi undergradu colleg . and as gener expect by now he is realli `` bore '' with hi car and want to chang it and consequ my mother ha to weekli dispos numer pamplet of variou car that my brother get home in order to convinc my father to buy him a new car . in my immedi famili of about fourteen member ( of which seven are teenag ) we own about seven car . exactli half the number of the member of teh famili and the famili is onli go to increas . furthermor , the variou advertis on televis and the huge hoard all over a citi success entic sybarit . it ha been notic that the richer are get richer and the poor are get poorer . the rich indulg themselv and pamper themselv and their famili with the most expens car and other commod such as mobil etc . but one can not deni the conveni associ with own car . one doesnt have to be depend on public transport which is time consum and often make a person irrit and henc more inclin to the idea of own a car and dwell in it luxuri . alll thi will further enhanc an increas in the number of car in the futur . i would like to mention one instanc which i think is relev to the topic . i wa have a convers with a close friend of mine who take a fanci for one particular car call ` swift ' . she told me that the first thing that she will do when she save suffici money is to buy that car which she love . she is not teh onli one who dream about such a thing , there are thousand of peopl out there who have such plan for their ` futur ' . current i am live in a citi which is famou rather infam for it traffic and innumer car , attrbut to the it develop in the citi and not one day pass by when i dont complain about thi fact . recent , while i wa read a local newspap i came across a survey of the number of car in teh citi and it rapid growth , which predict an increas in the number of car and thi further strengthen my view on thi topic .
