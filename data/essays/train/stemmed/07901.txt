i do n't agre the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . as for me , travel is kind of like trausur hunt . whi travel is alway interest ? that 's becuas a unknown futru . onc u are on the way , you 'll never know what will happen or who will u meet . everi experi will be like a surpris gift and ever friend will be your valuabl fortun in your life . the best thing to explor the world on your own is to crate memori by yourself . some peopl would think it 's conveni and safer to follow a tour guid becaus he could lead you to visit the most import spot right away . that way , you do n't have to wast too much time find place . and even the tour guid could explain the inform or histor stori to let you know without a book . actual , the tour guid nowaday onli show the travel to the spot who can make them money . the rush schedul and the arrang from a tour guid will ruin the true mean of travel . most of peopl usual feel physic tire and empti in their mind . the point i want to make is the real mean of travel is not onli to relax yourself but also to learn the experi from the real world , not from the book anymor . it 's not hard to arrang a safe and fun tour by yourself . befor you go to travel , you can collect much inform from the internet , your friend who have ever been there or even the travel book . through the suggest they give you , and do a well prepart in advanc , there 's no doubt you 'll have a wonder tour without a tour guid . you can freeli charg your time of stay or decid what kind of place you prefer to visit .
