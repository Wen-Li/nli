i disagre with the statement . it seem to me that those who hold thi kind of opinion limit the mean of `` help their commun '' to activ that a tradit local commun use to requir of their member , help neighbor , clear away the road with them , particip in the local festiv , for exampl . howev , sinc chang in societi and life style made tradit comun almost disappear , it is now difficult for almost all peopl , not onli for younger gener , to be help to other in the tradit way . thi might seem a lack of interest in peopl other than one 's own famili and friend , but thi is in fact not the case . peopl still feel the need to help other , and have begun to do so in a way differ from that which wa common in the tradit commun . for exampl , instead of talk with their neighbor or rel to solv the problem they have , they use internet to commun with other who live in a distant area but share the same problem . thi help the vex peopl more effect than the tradit neiborhood commun did . anoth exampl is the growth of commun of those who share the same hobbi , cook , photograph , travel and so on . they also work as the substitut for the tradit local commun and provid peopl with the oppotun of make friend of differ statu and differ age . perhap the most import instanc of peopl help other is the exist of mani volunt in the time of earthquak , flood and other disast . there is , i think , no need to mention that mani young peopl particip in these new kind of activ of help other .
