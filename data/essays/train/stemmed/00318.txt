at the school or at the univers , we often have to learn thing , and we are judg upon thi capac . howev i think that it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first of all , an automat learn of event , date , or fact , is onli the proof of a good capac to memoris . .. but to my mind it doe not reveal an aptitud to solv a problem or to understand a situat . even if have a good memori is a qualiti , it ca n't be suffici . then , it is clear that understand concept is a good way to help the student structur their idea . unless understand an event , it will be veri difficult to memoris it ! how to understand a situat or a problem without know how it function ? learn fact without understand them would be the revel of a lack of intellig . moreov , the aim of the univers is to prepar the student to have a job in their futur life , in which they will probabl need capac of understand and react in front of a situat more than pure memori . it is clear that in all work you need capac of memori , but to understand the situat and to act in consequ is much more use . final , we can say that if learn fact is realli the basi of the educ , in my opinion it is not suffici , and to understand what we learn is the more import . we need to know concept and reason to structur our think . i think that the univers and the school should make an effort to teach us how to think by ourselv , more than to teach us event , date , that we will forget .
