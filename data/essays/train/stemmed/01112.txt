there are a lot of peopl who think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . in my opinoin , i total agre with thi statement becaus the young have a more healthier bodi , also the world is new to them . we can not deni that the young have more healthier bodi which make they can enjoy their life much better . nowaday there are mani activ and sport for peopl to relax themselv such as the hike , swim . but these activ and sport have someth in common , a good bodi . for exampl , the hike request peopl be strong and full of energi . even some young are not dare to tri the hike , so how could the older peopl ? moreov , now mani travel is not permit to the peopl who have the heart diseas . as we know , it is a common diseas among the older . for exampl , onc my famili decid to go to tibetan to have a journey , unforturenatli my grand-fath wa not allow to go there becaus of hi heart diseas . mani young peopl are curiou to the new field than older peopl . becaus the whole world seem to be new to him . there are a lot of food or sceneri they have never experienc befor . but as to the older peopl , they are alway stubborn and they do not listen to other ' advic . when i ask my father to go to seasid , he alway responc me that he wa not will to go . becaus in hi mind , the sea is no differ although it is in the differ area and go to seasid would not appear him ani more . but the young peopl never have thi feel . all in all , from the reason and exampl given abov , we can easili draw the conclus the young peopl enjoy life than older peopl do .
