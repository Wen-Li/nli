cultur ha to be veri import for all peopl , it is better thet eachon know much inform about differet argoment and topic . it is veri beati studi mani academ subject becaus you could discov much thing that you do n't know . at same time i think that for work is better to special in one specif subject . for exampl befor the last reform of school italian univers give you mani academ subject and less specif subject , you studi in univers a lot of book and after univers you do n't know the way for enter in word 's job . for a student is veri difficult understand the applic of inform in a jo . i think that the gener academ subject is import for myself and specif subject too . the best way for me to improv your cultur and found a good job is that you have to learn veri well all the inform that school give you and after that , dure the work , thi inform have to use for do a good job . now italian univers is build in a differ way than the past . you studi for 3 year mani academ subject ( mani inform about a differ kind of disciplin ) and the and of thi 3 yea you have a degre of first level . after you decid if you continu your studi or not . if you continu to studi you can choos one special and learn one specif subject for 2 year , dure thi time yuo at the and you have a degre of second level . in short i think that is better that i learn mani academ subject for improv my cultur and my life at the same time i learn one specif subject for found a job that i like me .
