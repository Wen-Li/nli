i do not agre with the statement that in twenti year fewer car will be in use than there are today , becaus of the import of car as a mean of transport . in a global world car have veri much influenc on our whole life . they are an import mean of transport in trade as well as a mean of a flexibl lifestyl . without car the exchang of good in a global world would be much more complic . also the exchang of peopl , in the sens of employe and worker , would be much more difficulti . mani peopl depend on their car to reach work . for exampl peopl who are work in frankfurt or other big citi are often forc to drive mani hour to their place of work , becaus they can not afford appart in the citi to life in . without a car they would be forc to move hous or to find work next to their home , which is in mani case becaus of the high unemploy not possibl . without a car peopl would not be flexibl ani longer . they would be forc to take the bu or the train , which are often overcrowd , late and in the case of train in germanz veri expans . the limit of car would have a deep impact on the whole societi . if there would be less car it would be necessari to replac them by other sourc of transport , like train or buss . today mani citi lack the financi capac to financ such a big project . becaus car vari in their price and are therefor also acces for peopl with a smaller amount , mani peopl will keep buy them in the futur . to come to a conclus i would say that today car are an import mean of transport as well as a statu symbol , and will therefor increas in the futur .
