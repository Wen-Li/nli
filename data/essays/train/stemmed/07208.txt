although i do n't deni that some peopl prefer to travel with other peopl , i person disagre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid as per the follow reason : first , i can not control my schredul and select the place to visit in the travel with a group menber by a tour guid . of cours , the group type travel is the good way for someon like beginn of travel , such kind of control travel is not interest to me becaus i had a lot of experinc with the travel not onli in domest but also in all over the world . second , in case i can travel just alon , it is possibl for me to enjoy the scene and atmospher without ani disturb by other peopl . howev , if there is a guid or other travel menber , i could not enjoy the travel itself under the calm circumst . not menion , some peopl ha a purpos to be friend with other by travel , but i do not need such friend in travel . third , if i join the group type travel , i have to burden some unnecessari over head cost such as fee for a guid . on the other hand , in case of travel just by myself , i can find some kind of discout ticket and cheaper hotel like youth hostel and enjoy such kind of cost save travel with my knowledg and plan . lastli , if i join some group type travel , i believ that i have to see some unnecessari place or monument and buy some unnecesari gift strongli recommend by the tour guid . i can not endur such kind of nuisanc becaus what i would like to enjoy in a travel is the freedom from the daili control societi . in thi regard , i strongli hope to be free from the control or compel recommend dure my preciou time use for travel . as a conclus , i prefer to travel alon rather than with a group menber led by a tour guid in accordan with the above-ment point althogh someon would like to trave with a goupmenb in term of safeti purpos or easi of the travel schedul and plan control .
