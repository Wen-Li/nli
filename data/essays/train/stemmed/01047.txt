there are mani product that seem to be too good to be true and i believ the influenc of advertis to creat thi imag doe not use the right or ethic procedur to achiev thi goal . for thi reason i agre with the statement present in thi question . as a tourism manag i know perfectli thi situat by stude the case of tourist destin ' plan of market . in one hand , they usual offer an exot and pristin place that invit you to go there and make use of thi facil : well-equip resort , horseback ride for lone beach and hike in magic mountain , on the other hand , these plan omit crowdi beach dure high season , hotel room that do not have ocean view and so on . we could mention thousand of exampl of thi situat . for me thi should be rule more rigidli and lead to protect in a better way to consum who are cheat for thi advertis . in thi virtual world where inform goe faster and faster by internet , the idea of advertis is becom sampl , cheap and less rule . it is easi to see web site show marvel hotel and resort pictur and with just one click make a reserv that cost hundr of dollar . when we get there the realiti is so far away we realiz that the hotel is not in the locat shown or at least doe not have the featur present , we understand the pictur did not show how mani ad and signal everywher it wa possibl to see , make our enjoy destin as pollut as a capit citi and make our frustat the most unforgett of our vacat . thi is a typic case of make product seem much better than they realli are . as an exampl let 's take ocean citi maryland in the unit state , whoever go to the differ websit offer thi tourist destin can see the atlant ocean as the perfect background for a nice trip , we make a reserv and final get there , nobodi told us about the vehicular congest , visual pollut and the nois made for teenag run their car overspe . but that is , and there we are be part of a fraud as mani other product that seem to be much better than they realli are .
