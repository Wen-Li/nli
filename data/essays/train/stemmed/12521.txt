i agre with thi sttement . most advertis on magazin and tv are realli atract . everi time i see them , they say to me '' i am tasti '' or '' you will look better if you wear thi '' . it is dificult for me to stop buy them . for exampl , when i bouhgt a food which i had seen an advertis on tv or magazin befor , i usual think '' thi is differ from an advertis . they did not say tyuth ! '' a real food is usual smaller . also the tast of it is not good . mani cooki in advertiz are made fresh and savori and crispi . not onli food but also cloth , i offten disappoint the real cloth at a depart store . when i tri them and look at a millar , i think `` thi is not one which i saw on the magazin ! '' it is true that everi cloth look veri fine and gramar when super model wear them . and such a advertis make me think that i look thin and have fabur style if i will wear them . some electl such as tv and person comput and cell phone in advertiz are differ too . mani of them are complic and diffifult to use actual . but an older man in tv advertiz use a cell phone without memo or a woman use microwav with onli an index finger . after she prssing a bottun , she do onli wait . it is veri use and help .
