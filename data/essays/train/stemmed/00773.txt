nowaday almost everybodi can afford a car , someth unimagin a few decad ago . i ca n't now imagin a world without car . i believ the use of car will never decreas . furthermor , i 'm sure there will be more car in use each year thank to the develop and need of societi . there are sever reason to think so . to start with , we all know the convini of use car , such as have more freedom or determinig one 's sozial statu . i will give an exampl to support that they can determin a sozial statu . my neighbour ha been earn for some year to buy a veri expens car . he 's not rich but he just bought thi desir car to make peopl think he is a veri prosper and rich person . anoth argument is that technolog is in constant chang . probabl in twenti year car will have such entic thing that everybodi will desir one . no matter how much expens it may be , a lot of peopl will be afford all their live to get the best one . a third reason is that economi is thrive all over the world , and more peopl will be abl to buy a car in some year . i feel that those who nowaday use other mean of transport desir to have a car . from the argument i have state abov it can be seen that in twenti year there will be as much car as there are today , or even more . they provid us a lot of benefit such as make our live easier and exit .
