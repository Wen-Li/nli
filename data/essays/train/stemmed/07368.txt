as far as i am concern , the best way to travel is free tour . in other word , i think not plan tour will give us more pleasant experi . you may argu that the group tour led by an adept tour guid can show us more thing to see and feel , but it is just a second-hand experi just given away to our hand by anoth person . in my case , i am plan new york tour after two week . i 've save my spare pocket money and earn money from part time job for two year . i prepar sightse visa and flight ticket just on my own without ani help from tour agenc . it gave me a self-confid that i can do anyth for myself . it wa a littl bit hard job to prepar document for appli visa and cheapest flight ticket , but i think it reserv thing to do . you can save your time to prepar your travel with agenc and skill guid , but you can not get a experi to do someth on your own . moreov , self plan travel can give you a great experi differ from a group tour have to obey time tabl schedul by tour agenc or gude . the peopl who went to trip with guid can see famou tourist attract and get a same memori with other , but tourist without guid will go anywher want to go even if it wa not a plan thing to do . the plan-less trip can give us real freedom becaus no plan is our plan . i think mani tourist commit oblivion to get freedom . our own intend to travel is feel free and experi exot cultur , but mani group tour is not avail to feel freedom but just cram exot cultur . therefor i think travel with no guid will be better for our independ and more experi .
