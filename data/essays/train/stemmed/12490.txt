i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are two reason . first , young peopl nowaday tend to be rais to be more self-cent in capitalist place . they are be told , either directli or indirectli , that fulfil person desir or achiev person gain is more import than help commun . in capitalist place , peopl emphas more about their person abil and achiev rather than their sens of devot and care to a larger group other than their compani . although our school system and commun tri to send out the opposit messag , individu competit and the collaps of the sens of cooper are on the win side . second , young peopl today are rais to be more spoil . they get what they want eaiser . they are more indulg in their person comfort and pleasur . mani of them may consid help commun a wast of time . they may think , `` what would help commun do me ani good ? that wo n't necessarili make my report card or resum look good . who care about commun servic certic ? besid , i will get more fun to hang around in a mall and eat ice cream with my friend ! '' in my opinion , the most inner reason that they see no point of help their commun is becaus they are not use to help and give , but more to receiv . nowaday , parent who rais children tend to ask less but give more and more easili . when peopl start to rais fewer children , they make their onli or few children the queen and king of the famili . modern parent ' indulg creat more selfish and indiffer children , which is harm to our commun and societi .
