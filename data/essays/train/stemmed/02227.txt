in my opinion it is more import to understand idea and concept . student must deal with thi mental build , as i would call them , all the time . they have to be flexibl and have to know how to use them . if a student , or later as an employe , is short on fact he or she could alway look them up . of cours a base of fact is need to understand idea and concept aswel as it is import to be flexibl . if you do not know anyth about your task you can not be flexibl without a certain knowledg . but thi should be just the basi on which one ha to act . student have to know and understand the idea and concept with which they are work . for exampl in histori you have to know what happend when but if you know what happend whi and you do not know the date you can put the date in a propper order becaus you know the idea behind it . you do not have to know the propper date of the boston tea parti but if you know who did what and whi it had been done you know that it wa one of the crucial point to american independ . or if you can understand the differ between to idea you can make up your own opinion on them . learn by just learn fact give you big knowledg but no own opinion or own way of deal with idea or develop idea or concept . if one just know the key fact one could still deal with the idea . you just have to know a littl about the crucial point as for exampl marx and engl pictur of human be to know the problem of commun . the fact of the way the commun devlop and the idea differ are help later on but not necessarli . to sum up fact and idea have got their place but the empasi should lie on the idea .
