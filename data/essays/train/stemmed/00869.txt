today , the world ha becom a huge `` amus park '' for the young peopl . no one can deni the fact that the young gener is realli enjoy their live . nevertheless , did the elder hide in their room and never come out and have their own fun ? i believ the answer should be `` no '' . all of us could not refus to admit that the daytim inde is the `` amus park '' for old peopl . it is not imposs to see park fill with happi old peopl dure the day while their children are at work . they can certainli enjoy the sunshin and the fresh air dure daytim or sit down in a bench and chat with each other . there are no work troubl , no compitit , no anxiou feel about want to do about their own futur . recent a research about satifact of peopl 's life have been made in my citi and the result show that among those who are 100 % satisfi more than half of them are over sixti year old . such as human natur , young peopl would take respons for their parent and make sure they are happi about their life . in my commun , it is realli common to see a great mani old peopl walk with their grand or great-grand children , smile on their face . and the movi ` on golden poud ' did show the enjoy of the elder with their own children . we have to accept the fact that be with their children is the most enjoy thing to do . in conclus , the old peopl could easili get protect from the societi and their children while they do not need to face the matter anoy us everi day , their life with grand children could not be happier . so i disagre with the say that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do .
