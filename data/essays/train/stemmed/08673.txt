although tri new thing , and do what the man alreadi know are usel way in deal with differ situat in life . but tri new thing is a wiser choic i go with , becaus it open new window and give a new solut , tri new thing and take the risk in some situat can also make a big differ in the decis taker 's life , furthermor , take the risk and tri a new thing is import when the man stuck face a new problem he never had been through befor . open a new window while tri to find a solut is such a relif from pain caus by prolong think , becaus take the pain away clear the mind . when someon stop at a point in hi life that need a real brave decis he cant just look behind to search for an old situat or advic , it can make a differ . while peopl consid take new decis a risk , i consid it as the opportun that never came to anybodi els and it is some time give more that the man expect . on the other hand , do what the man use to do , or do what the comun like to do is to some extent safe , also it consid the area of experi , the thing that u know how to do well . if no one of us tri to take the risk onc in hi life there would be no step taken forward , everyon will remain in the same place after a year or ten year . therefor , i agre when they say that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , becaus take risk open a new window , find a new solut , give a new experi , and chang the man 's life .
