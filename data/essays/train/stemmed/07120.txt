i disagre with thi idea becaus i do not think idea and concept are more import than the fact . there are three reason to support my opinion . first , concept and idea are onli need to be well on their school . student have to understand the concept and idea to solv question on their test . but i do not think it is `` learnig '' . acutu , it is `` memoris '' . second , fact are the most import thing in thi world . no one can deni ani fact and break it . we have to know the fact to be well on our sosieti . if student understand onli concept or fact , they will be confus finali . third , not onli student also adult have to understand fact to understand it 's concept and idea . in my opinion , nobodi can understand complet the concept and idea without the fact . that 's whi they have to understand the fact first . a lot of student are learn onli concept and idea to be well on their school . by thi educ , they can not solv ani irregul question even if it is use same idea as what they could solv befor . becaus they do not know the fact for the problem that 's whi they can not enhanc their knowledg . those student would be wonder that whi they are use those concept and idea to solv their problem after they start to work on their major corc . i think , peopl have to know the fact first to studi what they interest in . when i studi someth new for me , i am alway wonder that whi we are use thi idea and how it is use to solv problem in acutu situat . to solv these question , we have to know the fact for the satat . from my opinion , i think the fact are more import than the concept and idea to solv our question or studi what we are interest . that 's whi i disagre with the statement .
