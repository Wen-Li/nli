i do agre in toto with the statement given , `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their communitei '' . as we march on to the cyber age , the respons on person ha increas to find and develop new thing which would help in the better of the human life . but one should not forget the moral valu which they learnt . one should take out some time for help there commun . these commun can be anyth . not onli thi , the young brigad feel that they are wast there preciou time in all these scrapi activ . the young peopl of thi age are more intrens in natur , they are like introvert , onli think about themselv and not about the societi . one singl individu can not chang or contribut to the entir commun , rather a lot of peopl should do it . thi can be done by draw inspir from such person who contribut a lot to the societi . they should make them as role model and draw inspir from them . not mani school emphasis on moral valu in the class , which make the student feel the frivol and stuff in commun . it not there fault , it the fault of the chang world , and they have to catch up with the run technolog so a lot of prefer is given to academ than the moral valu . one can even contribut to societi through technolog , by invent new medicin and help the life span of a person grow but thi mere happen . one should elect their role model , who contribut a lot to the societi , like mother theresa , an old woman who didnt even car about herself and wa all time engag in help the societi . one should look for such qualiti in a person . if an 90 yr old woman can do such amaz thing for a societi then an 20 year easili should contribut thrice what she contribut to the societi . if person save atleast a 1 dollar per day , that would be 30 $ per month and spend it in the welfar of day societi then there everi chanc of the commun to build up . so what i say is young peopl , they have the strength , capabl and the money , all what is requir to contribut to the societi but he ha to find some time so that he can particip in the better of the societi .
