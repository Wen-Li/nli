it is debat whether young peopl give enough time to help their commun these day . some peopl say that young peopl are dedic to help the poor live vividli give lot of donat and share difficulti with the difficult in our societi . howev , i disagre with the idea that young age are pour their time into share difficulti and help their neighborhood becaus they are like to concentr on their privat thing such as enjoy their live , earn a money , and studi some subject . in addit , the tradit cultur in our societi such as share our food and advers is like to disappear veri quickli nowaday . first of all , young gener ha a hard time to find free time . they are veri busi and they put their all energi to their privat sector . for instanc , my brother who work for hanyang hospit in korea as a doctor concentr on hi job . even when i invit him to my housewarm parti , he did n't particip in the parti becaus he had bulk of schedu such as surgeri oper , meet hi professor , and studi for some exam . not onli he can not help their commun but he is also unabl to find free time for our famili . second , i believ that the atmospher in our societi is chang recent due to rapid develop and strong competit like surviv game in movi , which might make young gener disinterest in other 's problem . especi , young gener did n't experi the hungri era from 1950 to 1970 when some our peopl were starv to death . so , they did n't know the issu of the poor who are now starv and do n't pay their tuition . some peopl say that in our tradit societi , our ancestor firmli believ that the first prioriti in our life is virtu , especailli help our neighbor live happili and overcom their difficulti , howev , nowaday most peopl tend to be not care about other 's difficulti . i agre with that idea and our educ ministri should tri to make effort to announc the import of help the poor for our young gener . in conclus , i think that young peopl should put their more time into help our commun financi and emot .
