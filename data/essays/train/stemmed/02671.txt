i disagre with the statement show `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . for exampl , whi do all of us deepli studi about histori ? thi is becaus the knowledg of fact which happen in the past may lead us to think of how to think or how to act , now , and in the futur . there is a famou japanes sentenc shown as `` open your futur by learn from the past '' . thi exactli explain whi it is import to learn fact . furthermor , i think that ani kind of idea or concept is creat by an event or fact which happen in the past . for instanc , the idea to launch the unit union , involv all nation in an organ to build an organ for them to solv nation conflict by prevent war , wa creat after the big event , the 2nd world war . after learn that thi kind of war mean noth to whole of the world and all of the popul , the geniu leader had reach to thi idea . therefor , i think that it is also veri import for student to learn fact as much as understand idea and concept .
