if someon is success and want to tri new thing and take risk it is her or hi decis . it is a big challeng becaus you do not know whether you will success in thi new thing or not . anyway , there are some posit aspect that we can look at . first of all , if peopl tri new thing it will be a challeng for them . as a matter of fact they will learn new stuff and mayb they will get success in thi one also . the peopl who like challeng can get success if they realli want to learn someth new . for exampl i took in highschool fashion design although i had never done it befor and did not know how to work with it . of cours it wa a challeng for me . i got success in it becaus i want to do it and becaus i had fun . anoth reason whi success peopl want to tri more thing is mayb they are bore of the thing which they alreadi know how to do well and alway do . mayb they know that they take risk but they tri it and if it will not work than they tri other thing . my friend wa so bore of be a babysitt and work as a babysitt . she tri to work in kindergarten but unfortun it did not work and she still tri to find a new job which will be a challeng for her . as a result i agre with thi statement . you can whether take a risk or you get success again . but it is a challeng and if you take a risk and it did not work than you know you can tri other stuff becaus there are thund of stuff out there that everybodi can tri if he or she realli want to . some of the peopl are just success in everyth .
