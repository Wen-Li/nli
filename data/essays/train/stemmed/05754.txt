my point of view is , alway oppos individual . caus been individu , is cosid to me as selfish . by take the statment as an exampl . the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . from there , i learn two good point . firt , is been in a group everyon know each other and be there for each other , caus if you are in troubl while you with the group , it is more uneasi for that troubl to approach you . or if you are sick , it more safer to be aroud thi group caus peopl know about your sick or deseas , and you feel more comfort when you know someon . and the other part is , to led by a tour guid . thi part explain to me , in group is a lot of individu whom think differ way . for exampl a group of peopl 's go on a trip and part of them are adult and the other part young , you know that the young peopl will definet not remain silenc dure the all trip . but the adult on their own if they stay quiet or have some seriou convers will be disturb by these young . so there will be no harmoni , so than it troubl . if there is not a tour guid , to put an agreement into thi , to settl thi caus we do not share the same idea , some peopl could think that is possibl to talk as loud as they want , but other peopl do not . there suppos to be a leader who could settl thing down , someon who can discuss thing in the right way . after all , thi my point of view .
