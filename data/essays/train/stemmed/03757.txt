i do not agre the opinion of that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help commun . i argu that thi opinion is not true for tree reason . first , i think that all younger are live by suport each other . though my experi , my friend alway help me when i got troubl . even i wa support by my fliend more than my friend . i can say that if i did not have ani friend , i could not get over the so mani problem that i had in the past . of cours when my friend are in troubl , i tri to help them . we have learn the import of fri and support each other freom thous experi . secound , in the public , i see so mani young peopl who help elderi peopl . for exampl , peopl give up their seat and give them to old peopl on train , buse or on ani public ride . in addit , some peopl carri havi bag for elderi peopl in store . tire , in my school , when someon break hi leg , arround hi friend help him by car hi stuff or lead him . or when someon is appcent , hi friend take note for him . i believ that all young peopl know the import of help other peopl and everybodi help their commun .
