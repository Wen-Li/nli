today everi fifth person in the world ha a car which he call hi own , that 's what the statist tell us in the daili news . to have a car mean not necessarili to have a driver licenc but a high number of car owner have one . at the moment we are in 2006 and the price for one liter of disel petroil cost about one euro and eight cent in germani . let 's switch to 2026 , 20 year later , the question which will be ask is , are there fewer car in use than there are today . what could be reason for drive no more car in twenti year . in 20 year the petroil price will be rais enorm becaus oil get more and more rare . and if it get rare it get more expens . onli less peopl could pay a much higher price for petroil than they do today . where do we get petroil from . new invent like the solar car would be great to have at that time . no more petroil , onli sun . i think that will be a great opportun to drive car in 20 year . but doe it work . if the climat chang as fast as it chang at the moment you ca n't be sure that thi theori work well . car get more and more expens . new invent , new design , new colour , new size , new model . .. how could we pay for that . in germani peopl have less and less money to pay for car . car will get more and more a luxuri product and onli peopl with an high incom and with less children or no children can afford a car . the unemlpoy rate grow more and more , in 20 year we will have a lot of unemploy peopl around the wold . on one hand you have poor peopl who never can afford a car , on the other hand you have unemploy peopl who will get poor after a short period of time , so it 's a viciou circl , loos your job , have less money , get poor and we are at the point where you ca n't afford a car . in my opinion we will have a great barrier between those who can afford a car and drive a car and them who ca n't buy car to drive . those who have money will be abl to buy the new luxuri good like a car will be at that time , but these peopl show a minor of the world 's popul . so as a result i would say that in 20 year there will be fewer car than today becaus of price of petroil , the stronger environ rule , the unemploy situat and the not avail peopl who could buy car . in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are todi !
