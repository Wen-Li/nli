when travel in a group led by a tour guid , one person will feel conveni becaus the tour guid will arrang the routin and lodg , and can share happi with differ peopl in the group . howev , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . firstli , travel in a group led by a tour guid will wast a lot of time on wait for other peopl . i onc had a trip in a group of 20 peopl . befor visit a place , everyon wa told to come back in one hour . i came back on time but stay there for half hour just to wait for those who did n't return punctual . as a result , we had no time to visit anoth place which interest me . secondli , travel in a group led by a tour guid will base upon a fix routin . the routin is arrang not accord to the tourist ' interest , but accord to the purpos of the travel agent firm . so dure the travel , we will lose chanc to explor new site and routin , which are more attract . thirdli , travel in a group led by a wrong tour guid will be a nightmar . if the tour guid just care about money , he will alway lead the tourist to some shop where the price are extrem high . in thi way , a lot of time will be wast and a lot of money will be spent on the commod which do not worth that much . on the other hand , the guid will earn commiss from the retailor by take the tourist into the shop . for exampl , last year my friend spent usd 100 on a necklac on a travel in a group led by a tour guid . but the same necklag can be bought at a price of usd 25 in anoth place .
