i agre . the student should understand the idea that they are studi . the learn process is not about memor chapter and concept , it is about understand and analyz . if they understand the idea and concept they would not have problem to `` learn fact '' . they would be capabl of solv problem , which is the idea . educ is about what the student is capabl to do , per exampl , if the student ha a bad situat , a problem or other struggl , hi proof would be tri to find by himself what he need to do to get out of the situat . hi level of educ would help him to analyz the problem and then , solv it . thi man will think about what he ha learn and after that he will find a consluss for hi problem . other exampl , would be a person without ani educ level . thi person would not be capabl of get a fast consluss becaus he ha not had ani educ help in all hi life , which mean that he ha not develop hi razon part at school . for thi reason , educ is not just a word that indic `` go to school '' ( colleg or univers , in other case ) , it is a word that indic : `` analyz '' , `` logic '' or `` learn '' . if some subject is too difficult for a student but he must pass that subject , he would use hi logic skill to solv the problem . the most logic respons to thi situat would be go with a tutor to get help . i do not agre with the idea that it is import for student to learn fact becaus would be a support to those peopl who just memor thing and they call smart to themselv . in some situat would be good to learn fact , but it would not be the point of the educ matter . the point is tri to learn and analyz situat in life . for these reason , the understand is most import in a student ' educ process .
