i think older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . there are two reason . will , knowledg and money . first of all , it is will . older peopl think how to life . becaus they had busi time when they were young . for exampl , do job and grow own children and housu keep and so on . i have heard that they want to do someth which they want . they talk to me what they want when they have free time . in other word , they have someth to do after retir . and they have `` will '' , which they are go to enjoy it . i otherwis there are less exper for young peol . so they want to do mani tinng , either . for exzmpl , sport and studi . do those is veri fun for young peopl . but sometim young peopl do not those by own wish . someon , who is their parent and teacher so on , let them do . i think think of older peopl is real enjoy life . second point is knowledg . third point is about money . money is necessari to enjoy life for peopl . in japan , older peopl can get pention . so there are mani moni which they use for myself . i think money is not everyth , but it is import to enjoy life . older peopl can go to trip , go to hous where their grandchirldren ive .
