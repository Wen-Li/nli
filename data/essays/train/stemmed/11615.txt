the issu about whether understand idea is more import than learn fact is a complex one . person , i am convinc that fact are less import than idea . in the follow paragraph i will tri to explain the reason whi i believ thi . first , understand idea is more difficult than mere memor fact . even a littl child can memor date , name of famou battl , name of king etc . but it take much more effort to understand the idea and the implic behind these fact . take for exampl the french revolut . anyon can memor the year : 1789 . but understand the far-reach outcom of it is a much more complex issu ! the french revolut 's result can still be observ in the world we are live right now , where govern reli on democraci rather than monarchi . while rememb a date is someth anyon could do , perform a profound analysi on the plethora of caus and the multitud of effect of such an import event is not so easi . the second point i would like to stress is that learn fact is not so use in everyday life as it is understand concept . what i mean by thi is : what is the point of learn the exact year of a battl or the death of an import person ? it might onli come use when be on a tv quiz show or when play `` trivial pursuit '' . instead , delv into the caus , the effect and the main idea behind it , can prove use . understand the main idea that lie behind a fact can help someon obtain preciou insight on veri import issu like , for exampl , human natur . mani antropolog studi in fact , reli on histror event when tri to explain human behaviour . to summar , i believ that idea are more relev than fact when it come to studi and that the univers should be more focus on have student understand idea and concept behind a fact , rather that the fact itself .
