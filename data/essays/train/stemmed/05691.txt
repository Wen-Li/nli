i disagre with the statement . from my point of view , i think it is more import for student to learn the fact rather than understand idea and concept . my reason my go as the follow . start off with the disadvantag for learn the concept , student will have a hardship to get invoulv in the societi . although a student can be arm with lot of knowledg or deep thought , it is still unabl for them to aknowledg the sofisc societi with out learn the fact . for instanc , a graguad student form a well known univers , it is still quit diffcult for him to find a job without ani experi . that is whi univers offer mani co-op program for the student . anoth point i would like to share is that learn fact can help the student with understand the idea and principl . a perfect exampl for thi will be the experi in school . mani school spend thousand of money to improv the lab facil for student . that mean student should not onli learn the principl but they need to know how doe the thing function in realiti as well . practis make progress . in addit , learn the fact can help the student in handl the problem . thi point happen alot on the soccer field . as well know , everi team ha their own plan for the game . howev , thing can be chang suddenli in the field . by the time the plan doe not work , the player on the field have to make chang to slove the problem . and there it show the valueabl of the experienc player . they encount thi kind of fact befor , so they are quit good at it . to conclud , learn the fact is more import for the student becaus the sever reason list abov .
