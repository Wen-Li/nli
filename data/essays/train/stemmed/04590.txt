in the last year thi topic becam veri actuali in my countri . the last univers reform chang a lot of thing in univers career . we are go to a world that alway want student more and more special and thi reform goe in thi way . i think that we need a right rate of both subject . a specif subject sole is not a good thing . i think that becaus in my field , i studi engen , tecnolog chang veri fast and it is possibl you like special yourself in a subject that onli 2 year later is preistor . in other way a broad knowledg sole is too much out of world for student , which gener want to '' take by hand '' what they have just seen into book . i think univers must do more broad knowledg of mani subject than specif one . i think that knowledg of mani subject help student in the earli age of univers to choos their way . they can help their to choos their major and what they want to do in their life about work . the specif subject , after a good choosen , can help student to know good part of real situat of tecnolog at the moment when they want to go in work world . i think that the realli import thing is how a student challeng hi school problem . i think that give yourself a good preparet is the best thing to do . it is veri import to have a good mind to challeng problem of everi natur in school like in life . if you have the right '' forma menti '' ( way of mind ) all thing are more easi .
