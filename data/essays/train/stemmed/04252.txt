i complet and loudli disagre with the statement - `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one subject '' . agre to it sound like one is agre to `` it is better to have one foot on one boat and the other on anoth than both feet one a singl boat '' . the given statement remind me of a famou aesop 's tale in which a young boy learn , unfortun after hi death , that if he had dug a well instead of dig sever pothol , he would had not die of thirst . special in one specif subject is like climb a ladder while tri to get knowledg of mani academ subjet is like tri to hold mani branch of a veri broad and high tree . it is obviou which one is more fruitful , which one is easier , which one is wiser and which one is better . it is better to be a full artist than a quarter mathematician , a quarter chemist , a quarter biologist and a quarter physist . the world rememb name of newton , einsten , shakespear becaus they specialis in their field , not becaus of their part-tim job or knowledg . in today 's world of sheer competit it is not import for a student to have gain mani bachelor 's degre in mani field but to have a special in one particular field , if he want to secur a good job and futur . one should alway remenb that it is better to be master of a singl trade .
