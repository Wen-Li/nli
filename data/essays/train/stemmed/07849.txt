in my opinion , it is more import for us student to understand idea and concept we are taught . everybodi is abl to learn but we will see in thi essay whi understand make the differ and what are the advantag come along with that studi method . i consid understand as the masterkey of learn , i have mani exampl to support thi idea such as the follow one : when i wa fourteen , i use to take biolog class and my big brother use to help me befor my exam . depend on the topic he wa explain to me how a part of the human bodi would work . i rememb it would take him 10 to 15 min to explain the function and to describ what wa in question . i did not even need to studi or do anyth els to rememb everyth and i wa then even abl to explain the topic to my classmat and get the best grade . it wa as easi as understand . on the other hand learn take time , and if we think about my previou exampl we can easili understand that if you do not understand what you read it is go to take you ten time the time to learn the subject you are studi . in addit , what is the point to learn concept if you do not understand how they work ? we are not machin . the main point is the follow one , you attend school to shape your mind and in order to shape your mind you read and hear about concept that veri import research work on and the main purpos is to understand how they work to build their theori . to conclud , it is quit obviou that understand is the most intellig way to studi . it is the best method to shape your mind and get the best result . understand is also a good method for lazi student .
