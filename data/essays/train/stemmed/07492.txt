from my person experi and those of peopl around me , i strongli disagre with the opinion that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . first of all , in order for one to realli enjoy someth , such as life or ani kind of sport , he/sh must first know what it truli is . when peopl say that they realli enjoy do someth the first time they are do it , what they realli mean is that they like , rather than enjoy , do it . when peopl get older , they see the rise and down of the life , and they have a better idea about what life is and what the most import thing is in their live . i think such a deep understand about the life is exactli the prerequisit for anyon to enjoy it . after all , how can one realli enjoy someth when he ha littl or no ideaabout it ? secondli , when peopl becom older , they have more thing to appreci and enjoy . for exampl , famili might mean much less for a young man than go to the parti and hang out with friend . howev , as peopl matur , they see their responsibl they owe to peopl around them and those they love and cherish . they could still go out to the parti and play with friend , but they also have some truli enjoy thing that most young peopl do not know to appreci , such as famili . certainli , there are mani interest thing that can said to be franchis to young peopl . for exampl , while mani youngster are fasciant about the extrem sport , there are a significantli lower percentag of older peopl who would dare to tri . their health condit might not allow them as well . in conclus , i disgre with the assert that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i believ that the follow modif would be more appropri : `` young pepl experi life , but older peopl enjoy life .
