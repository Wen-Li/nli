i do not think that travel in a group lead by a tour idea is a great idea . while mani would point to the benifit of have a season , knowledg resourc who understand the lay of the land , the local languag and is familiar with all the place and fact in the area , the idea of travel in a tour group definit doe not appeal to me . my person experi have not been veri good with tour led by tour guid . first , the guid tour tri to squeez as much in as possibl and as such the schedul are veri gruell and tough and one doe not get to enjoy the thing one want to do . it is not alway easi to tailor a trip that suit everyon 's requir . human be are differ and have differ prefer , for exampl someon interest in art may want to visit london onli for it museum wherea someon els may prefer to go to london primarili for it fabul shop . it would be veri difficult to tailor a tour that keep both these interest at heart and the outcom mayb a combin which satisfi neither . secondli , there is alway the factor of control and independ , an impuls side trip or extend stay may not be an option on these tour . imagin be worn out from a trek up the hill to see a castl and not have the abil to turn back to go to the hotel becaus the tour bu ha a schedul to see five more place . final , there is the question of lodg and dine choic . individu tast are veri divers and sinc it is veri difficult to cater to the tast of differ individu the tour guid may choos the least common denomin which again will leav mani dissatisfi . to summar i would not recommend guid tour as a way to travel on account of problem you may face due to the reason highlight abov .
