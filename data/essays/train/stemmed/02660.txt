i agre with the statement which inde result in the student futur and thi is import for the student that understand idea and concept is more import that it to learn fact . accord to my concern i will say that if a student is perfect or atleast have the basic idea of what he is intrest then he will be the elig person to learn the fact , it may be ani thing like studi about archietectur or concern about sport and intrest in discoveri or els studi about a comput program all thi type of qualiti are need to know about their fault and advantag and when a student is enough to learn then should learn fact on their particular stream . i agre onli if a student is have particular qualiti not like a child come to u and ask u to teach me comput program it just can not happen in everi situat and when a student without have ani concern of play the gittar and he just want 's to give a play on hi concern of intrest than if u allow him it will be a great problem , similarli mani such kind of situat are there which just can not lead learn fact it should be a step by step process then onli he will acheiv the concept in hi intrest . other kind of situat which i intend to present in my essay is if some student who are intrest in mani thing and will achiev the greater height are those onli who work hard and they learn through step by step process onli but the have practic a lot which inturn produc them to reach victori , it not like that if a child learn the concept of addit in hi math subject and sudenli when he look hi elder brother note and want to intend to solv divis concept which is at that movement difficut for a child but when he studi step by step he will be th eliglbl person who can achiev fact quickli but not know the idea of the particular subject or view . so accord to me i beliv that everi student should have particular idea in the field of their willing without ani idea their is noth to have a particular learn , what ever it might be but the student should have some knowleg regard that
