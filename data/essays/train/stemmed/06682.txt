i disagre with thi statement becaus ( but i hope it will be true ) there are a huge number of interest link with the car industri and it will be improb that in onli twenti year someth will be chang . first of all , i do n't think that in a small time the tecnolog devolp new kind on movement system and , more import that they will be secur for the human ( like what happen in germani with a new kind of train that wa base on the magnet forc , a disast , mani peopl dead ) , we must be sure ! . second , in my opinion , the owner of oil product had invest a lot of money in industri that produc car , so if these industri chang their standard of product , probabl , a lot of them would close and a lot of peopl will be unemploy . also if the oil will end , i am sure that all these rich peopl will find someth els to mantain their control on the transport organ . howev the mainli reason , that make imposs the statement is the absenc of high investi in sector like scientific-transport research . altought the govern continu to say that someth is go to chang , i do n't trust with thi sentenc , for me is onli a way to make peopl sure . mayb in twenti year will be more car than now , and probabl , but i hope that someth will chang for real , the ambient situat will be more danger than now . in conclus the huge interest , the absenc of seriou investi and the less attent that peopl do on thi problem , make not possibl what the statement say . i think that a solut for what i have expos is : the govern of the most rich countri ( where car are in larg number ) would invest in industri that want realiz car without the use of oil and more import , there will be industri that take an hard decis : produc in a differ way .
