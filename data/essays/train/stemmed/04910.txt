i will begin my essay by say that i agre with thi statement , and then i will go on in explain whi i feel thi way . base on my own experi as a student , the most reward knowledg is the one that is cultiv by hard work , and understand of the great idea that are behind the fact that are expos to us . from what i can rememb , the thing that i consid i have realli learn in my life as a student are those that came from the process of tri to understand the logic and the dynam of the problem i wa challeng to studi , as oppos to those thing that i tri to learn by memor date , name and place . if anyth , the onli time when i have realli come to learn and acknowledg import date and name in a relev process in histori , it is becaus i have taken the time to understand the logic of the histor sequenc , so that i can place the event accord to the idea and concept that are behind each episod in histori . those student that learn onli fact with noth behind them , will sure be forget what they learn within a month , becaus the learn process did n't come form understand the import of those fact in an specif situat . the learn process , in the case of those student , came from the need to be pass through the cours , test , and exam , without know if the thing they were ask to know were important in their life , or their carrer . asid from that , i believ that idea and concept are tool that student have for their ongo studi , and also for life . onc a person ha studi a concept , and ha struggl with the logic of it , and ha final succed into understand it , that concept will last on in their mind forev as a tool to understand other process , or other concept . it is becaus of those reason that i believ that true knowledg come from understand idea and concept , rather than from learn fact .
