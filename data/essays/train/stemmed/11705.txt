well , in my opinion it is import for the student to learn the fact , rather than understand the idea and concept . becaus in my view the fact of ani situat or the subject itself is more import . the fact form the real basic of that particular situat or topic . and fact are more understand and beleivebl than have some kind of an idea or know the concept of the topic . for exampl if the student is work on a project relat to the subject he is stude , then it is allway better for him to understand and learn the fact of that particular subject than just get the idea about it . by learn the fact he could allway produc more inform or the real work . if the project is about the topic in scienc . like the import of nutrit in a human bodi . then it is better that the student understand the real fact of the import of nutrit in human and then he can creat some idea while do some reserch on thi topic and final come to a conclut and understand the concept of the topic itself . furthermor , i would say that if the student ha onli some idea about the import of nutrit in a human bodi then he would not present a good and complet pictur of the topic . therebi give a superfici idea of the topic . and make it look verri simpl . anoth exampl is if the student is stude stude in a medic colleg and attend an anatomi class , then he should realis and know all the fact of the part of the human bodi , and also the import of them . if he ha just the idea and understand the concept of how the organ work then it would ` nt help much in get the entir inform and work of the human system . therefor by state these exampl i would like to conclud that the fact are more import than idea or concept in a student life of learn or stude
