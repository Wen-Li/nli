i storongli agre with the follow idea that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' there are reason that i agre . first of all , what is the definit of learn ? in gener , what do student come mind when they think about mean of learin ? i think each student have differ idea . some of them think learn is same as studi . also , other think that it is just read text book , or attnd class , but what are they gain from learn ? of courc some of them might answer that learn is given better understand of the materi . howev , if student do n't concentr dure the read or in the class , they might learn , but they do n't understand the idea and concept that they suppos to cover . therefor , understand idea and concept is not alway gain from learn . next , understand idea and concept are remain stude n't memori longer than just learn . sometim , even student learn the materi at the moment . if they did n't understand , it is veri easi to forget and hard time to understand again . becaus one of the reason peopl forget materia is that student did n't understand concept of the materi even they learn befor . they thought they understand idea and concept cleari but it wa misunderstand . therefor , as time goe by , it might hard for them to remind the materi and rememb again . on the other hand , onc you understand the concept and idea , it take longer to rememb and sometim they never forget . even they forget it , becaus they understand it befor , it more easier to come up their mind . therefor , learn is not alway help student understand . some of the peopl even learn hard , but they do n't understand materi . also , even student did n't learn , they understand concept and idea of materi . understand materi is more import form them .
