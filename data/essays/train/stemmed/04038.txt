i strongli believ that student should understand idea and concept rather than they just learn them as a fact . i found that import sinc thi is more benefici for student for their futur life . to begin with , while student understund the idea and concept , they begin to set connect between all the idea they have learn . let take an mba student . if he understand the differ busi concept for a compani , he can understand how a whole busi work . for exampl , let say he take account cours and market cours . at the end , he should make a connect between them to have a profound idea about that busi . if he learn the concept just a fact , he can not have a broad point of view about that busi . moreov , student who learn the concept as a fact tend to forget them much easili than the student understand concept . for exampl , if a student tri to memor matemat function , he will most probabl forget all those equat in a short time . on the other hand , if a student understand those function , he will less like forget them . concequ , i agre that for student it is more import to understand idea and concept . therefor , student should take into account that how they learn make a real differ .
