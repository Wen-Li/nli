i do not fulli agre with the statement that it is better to have a gener knowledg over a special one . i believ thi matter actual depend on wich stage of his/her career a person is and which his/her ultim goal in profession life are . for starter , everi person who initi on a field of studi should commenc by assimil the simpl concept ; for exampl , an engin , a person who is do mechan engin and one who is studi aeroespac engin will both studi dure the first semest the basic cours of all the engin carreer ; like : algebra , mathemat and physic . there is no way a mechan can design a machin without understand first the basic rule of physic . but thi should not stop here , onc the basic are built more detail work need to follow to grow on knowledg . on the other hand , to have onli peopl with broad or not special knowledg could lead to less develop on societi , it is crucial for a cultur to have individu with a particular field of studi , with focu in specif subject that can result on effici solut to nowaday problem . that is whi for exampl we need to have oncologyst , who are doctor that after complet their basic medicin school went beyond it to studi on a deeper way cancer and way to treat and cure it . furthermor , if we take thi subject again to the colleg environ , we will see that the concept of have first a broad knowledg to later special it is impli on the normal carreer path ; a person start with a broad degre , let say for exampl industri engien , then after some good exposur to the work environ and experi with his/her prefer , that person will pick a subject for a master like manufactur , then after more knowledg and practic exposur have been accomplish it is possibl to go through a phd program which is even a more special vision of that particular path , in the case of our exampl manufactur of polym research . in conlus , i believ that the goal of everi profession is to achiev certain level of masteri or special on the veri subject that give passion to his/her life ; but , to acomplish so , it is crucial to acquir basic knowledg first that will provid the foundat for thi develop .
