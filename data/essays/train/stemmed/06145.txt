whether to travel by form a group or individu ha been controversi among mani peopl . howev , i basic disagre with the posit that it is a best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid . i have two reason for my claim . it prevent peopl to enjoy their person privaci and enabl them to visit onli limit place . most of all , peopl are hardli like to enjoy their privaci onc they had a trip by join a group . as a matter of fact , particip a packag travel need oeopl to organ altogeth and alway neccessari to have a cooper with the stranger . besid , peopl are even requir to eat their meal at same place and a same time . thu , there is no privat time avail to enjoy themselv such as walk on the beach and have some relax when they wish to . as a result , travel in a group can make peopl feel frustrat and quit dissappoint . in addit , it is hard to travel around some place where they want to . gener , the trip 's schedul ha alreadi plan by a tour guid which make it difficult for peopl to visit their own desir place where they alway dreamt about . in contrast , by travel around some countri alon , will allow peopl walk around place and take some photograph and enjoy thier holiday . accordingli , go on a trip individu will be benefici for peopl to acess divers place . to sum up , everyon ha differ opinion on thi issu . howev , i strongli oppos the perspect that travel as a group is better . thi is becaus it provid lack of time to have privat time and onli few place are abl to visit .
