success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well . i agre with it , and i think thi is perhap the summari of how to be a success person . first , to be sucess , one should be at least in the five percent top in the domain he work . it mean that if there were one thousand peopl which do the same work in thi world , you should be better than other nine hundr and fifti person . more competitor in the domain , more difficult to be success . want to be success , creat second , alway repeat the same work , satifi with the recent life , not be will to take the challeng , all these are not the characterist of the success peopl . if you want to be success , you have to surmount the achiv you have got , you must get higher and higher . when you chose a new thing which nobodi els had tri , thi is the challeng and thi will caus the risk .
