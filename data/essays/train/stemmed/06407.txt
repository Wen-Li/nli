i agre with the opinion that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better that just have studi one special subject . i believ that know mani academ subject wide would help peopl understand more about what you realli want to learn . peopl can get mani point of view from that . for instenc , when you are studi econom you can not forget about intern relationship which can chang economi of the world . also you have to think about how think onli about good economi system may caus bad effect on the natur environ . peopl can learn more about what they are major by know other academ subject . there are also other reason . not studi other subject , which you thought not interest may took your possibl . i had a friend who thought she doe not good at mathmat , but she gave herself one last chanc to studi mathmat in the last year of high school . she end up with find that she actual like to studi mathmat . she have found her new possibl . to decid not to studi a sbject with first impress of your can be danger sometim . you may miss your favorit subject . futhermor , studi mani subject widen your futur . if a person onli knew one specif subject , you may have a few choic of job . if a person studi mani differ subject , then those subject can give him a lot of opportun to think what he realli want to do in the futur . when i wa younger i had a total differ job in my mind for the futur , but studi mani subject in high school and univers ha chang my opinion mani time . it is becaus i have found other possibl for the futur by studi mani differ thing . to studi mani subject will take time and a lot of effort . howev without studi them you will never know your possibl in the futur . it is not too late to studi specif subject after you have studi differ thing .
