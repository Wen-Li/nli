i disagre with the statement . if anyth , there will be a lot more car in twenti year . first of all , accord to what i have learn in school , oil is not a renew energi sourc , but there is defin enough of it to meet global demand for at least the next fourti year , if not more . second of all , the number of car ha been increas sinc they were first invent around the earli twentieth centuri . so accord to thi trend , i do n't see how the number of car will suddenli drop within two decad . the reason thi statement is even debat is probabl becaus of the fact that oil is a non-renew energi sourc so some peopl may think that it will eventu run out ( which it will , but not within twenti year as the statement say ) and we will have to find or invent differ mean of transport that do n't requir oil . but as long as oil is around and access , the number of car will continu to increas . car compani - like bmw and land rover for exampl - are do everyth in their power to increas sale . they 're give better offer , their increas the qualiti of manufactur and they 're meet public demand . as long as they can keep their custom content with their product , which they have been do sinc their compani are flourish , the number of custom will onli increas . i honestli do n't see how the public will just stop buy car for the sake of it . they have n't stop for the past ten decad , whi will they stop in the next two ? i have absolut everi reason to believ that the number of car will continu to increas as they have alway increas , for the next thirti or fourti year , till oil eventu run out . a car is probabl the most import mean of transport today . if oil run out , anoth energi sourc will just have to replac it . if it doe n't , then ye , perhap the number of car will decreas . but i disagre with the statement becaus i believ that the number of car will continu to increas for well more than twenti year therefor the number of car will not be fewer , they will be greater in twenti year time .
