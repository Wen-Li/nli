i 'm total agre with thi statement . thi is a problem which is alway more frequent in the last time . thi is for differ reason : the first is that today the advertis are much common then befor . we can see and hear it everywher , not onli by the normal medium which the televis or the radio . look a sport match , or simpli take a walk on a street we will notic that the numb of advertis is visibl increas . and if there are alway more pubblic , the corpor who made the advertis are in a strong compet with the other corpor who made the advertis for a similar product . thi competit are the main reason who move a corpor to tell lie about hi own product . in thi way they want to convinc the acquir to buy a product who should be posit differ by an other from a differ corpor . the one who could tri to stop thi process are the custom . in the last fifteen year sever custom associ are born to to contrast everi form of unreal illeg advertis .
