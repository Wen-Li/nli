in the oversea travel , peopl can take a choic of be guid by tour in a group or go sightse individu . in my opinion , i think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . there are more fun to travel in agroup , and tour guid guid the whole team in a suitabl way by the experi leadership . first , tour guid have rich experi to plan the whole trip and guid the group in an appori way . some tour guid can custom the trip that is most suitabl for all the menber under lot of constrinst such as limit time and money . second , a group of peopl can alway be a helper or support for an other . we can take care other and it is more secur for all the member when go outsid our hometown . whether there is some accid in the travel , member can take care your belong and help you to call your famili if it is neccesari . thirdli , it is alway true that member are more enjoy when share and experi the same happinesss in the travel . the whole environ is enhac greatli . along the trip , member can review and show some their intestest and experi . from the share , i am sure you will understand other happi from their talk . lastli , member understand other deeper through the make of consenu in the trip such as what kind of live place and what is target of the trip . learn how to respect other ' opinion and find a critic balanc between member ' agreement . there mayb lot of disagr here , sometim it is differicult make a balanc or even confict between the dicuss . howev , i believ the situat can be improv by first understand member ' interest befor the discuss and respect other ' concert . in conclud , it is good to tarvel in a group with tour guid .
