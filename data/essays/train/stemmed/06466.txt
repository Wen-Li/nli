there is a say , `` knowledg is one kind of power . '' i agre with that phrase becaus you can use knowledg as much as you know . some peopl think it is more use to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to have specif knowledg that you know veri well . howev , in my opinion , it is better to special in one specif subject which you are good at . to begin with , they are so mani peopl who have common knowledg . specif , the knowledg they have are not uniqu or special . therefor , in thi competit societi peopl would have to compet with each other for a job that anyon can appli . it is not effici to have knowledg that everybodi know . broad knowleg of mani academ subject is not a merit . for exampl , suppos there is a graduat who major three subject , histori , busi , and math . he would know mani thing from learn all the content of three major and util all the subject he learn . becaus there is limit time , it is hard to learn all the three subject precis and deepli . he would onli know the basic of each subject , not the advanc thing . in addit , focus on one subject will make you as an expertis . other subject that you do n't know well can be solv by an expert on that field . it is more effect to take advic from him and ask question that you are not clear with . it is better to focu on the thing a person are good at so the expert can share their knowledg in an advanc way . for exampl , peopl from differ field , can help each other by combin their own knowledg . it is a win win game . in conclus , for these unavoid reason , i firmli believ peopl should develop and stick on to their own special knowledg .
