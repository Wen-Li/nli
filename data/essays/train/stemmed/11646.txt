i disagre with these statement , that succ peopl tri new thing and take risk than what they alreadi know . as a person to be consederd a success man he ha to carrey a good person and a good amount of wise and a lot of knowalg to deal with hi alreadi known work for him or in the new thing that he is go to do . here i have a person exampl about thi , i am a doctor , and i am onli understand in hospital and medicin i open my own clinic and besid it i open a pharmacey , as the pharmacey in almost my field it is quit good project and it get me back good amount of money . on the other hand one of my friend ask me to share with him anoth project faraway from my field i lost a lot of money in thi project , so , either you have a good background about the project you are go to do or leav it to someon els who know much better than you in thi field and you can achiv much more in your field that you alreadi have year deal with it than in the newli deveop idea . anoth ea my friend he is a bussinessman in tourest and all thing relat to the tourest like shop that sell thing to the tourest , also for ship and buss , so everi thing and all of hi project are relat to what he know , so , now he is quit a success man in the market . besid thi , do new thing give you advantag of prove yourself and feel that you still a creativ man , and still you can be a succes man throug all of your life , and peopl will learn more from their mistak , and everi one have everi day learn through all of hi life it is better to be a new , creativ mam than to be the same man everi day , but for me i like to be new in everi thing but not in bussiss
