i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i sometim buy the fashin magazin . when i read it , i have seen mani advertis . first of all , it is about the diet food . some peopl which tri it and sucsseed the diet wa intervew . mani of them said that `` to be on diet is easi becaus it help veri much '' . other peopl said `` it is veri delici . i recommend it , so pleas tri it onc '' . the advertis have also the pictur befor the person who tri to use the diet food and after the person who tri to do it . i think i ca n't beliv it . to be on diet is veri difficult . i also think it is not good tast . few year ago , i attract thi advertis , so i tri the diet food . it is written `` if you eat thi , you can lose 3kg for one month '' . i trust it , and i countin to do it , but i could n't lose my weight . the diet food say it is delici , but it is not delisi . it tast the robber . second , it is the cell phone . when i buy the cell phone , i see the advertis . it is reason whi i can compar the mani cell phone at onc easilli . a lot of advertis show how easi to use the cell phone . it also say a lot of function . in conclus , i think a lot of advertis make their product look better than ther realli are .
