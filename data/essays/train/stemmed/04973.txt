in our societi there are mani commun repres the melt pot in our countri . the idea that everi singl person repres the whole commun ha chang these past ten year . in the past the commun repres a familli , a circl where peopl of the same appar could stay togeth and grow . today , most of the young peopl grow without even know about major event , they are simpli live in a virtual world base on the video-gam , the cartoon . .. they do n't care about be up to date with intern event , and major chang in the societi . moreov , the youth is an age when one doe n't realli realiz what impli be part of a social group . for exampl , group are made with peopl who share the same purpos , more than the same shape or root . thi is whi we can say that young peopl do n't spend much time tri to help their commun : they just do n't feel it 's their commun . i will use an exampl that occur in decemb 2005 in franc , there ha been sever destruct in the ghetto near pari and mani main citi . these children who were in major less than twenti year old just react to what a politician said about a bad part of a certain commun in the ghetto who keep on violat the law : live as outlaw . they thought their commun wa insult but it wa in fact a group of gangster who do n't repres ani commun . the fact is that young peopl lack q ident , be given an ident more than choos one , by forget who they are and what is their true commun . i think the most import thing is that young peopl receiv a good educ by their parent first and by the societi : it is their role to be part of a societi as they are citizen and own a citizenship . to conclud i would say that i agre with the fact that young peopl do n't help their commun , given they lost their ident of be import actor of a societi .
