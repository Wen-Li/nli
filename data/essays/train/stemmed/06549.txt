there 's a varieti of reason to support the idea that a specif compet in a particuar field is much better than a wide , unclear knowledg . i want to underlin the term wide and unclear , becaus most of the time they match ; i want to clarifi thi aspect with an exampl ; becaus of my technic studi in mechan engin i ' ve alway had contact with pragmat subject such as the project of a machin or the capabl to recogn the caus in an accid ; with the prepar you aquir in a litteratur univers you will have for sure a wide knoledg about the fact that play a role in our societi or the abil explain an autor opinion , but the lack of a specif prepar could negatev affect the job opportun . inde without a great prepar on a specif topic , nobodi will find on you a valuabl reason to take you as a part of the factori . anoth plu point , is the amount of money you could earn ; i ' ve been impress by the salari that a member of the chouru in wich i sing earn , and ask him the key of success he answer : `` noth come without the sacrific and the constant will the deep your knowledg '' . speak my mind , i can assur that if you acquir a posit in the enviro in wich you work , nobodi will ask you to leav the desk , and that ' s becaus you are an essenti and vital part in the product . i can prove thi with a person experi my father had with hi factori ; with the grow compet , especi from the china an india the factori the sell were serious affect and as a result of that some of the employ were fire , nonetheless the more abl to regain a lead posit in the market were preserv and after the first result they gain an award . in conclus , we can say , how import is to have a good educ , especi in the nowaday life , with the hope that all the effort we have made could give a great result .
