ofcours , i agre with the statement that , `` advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' the main point of an advertis is to attract peopl into buy the product . to achiev that , the produc of the advertis program go to ani extent to make their product look outstand . even if the good product are not advertis , they will be on sale but an averag or a bad product do need a good advertis to make itself appeal to the custom . what happen dure the februari end ? it the time for super bowl ad . these advertis are worth about 10 million dollar . that 's a lot of money into the ad but if the ad click in the `` peopl 's '' market , the owner of the ad would make lot of money . i wa watch a televis channel and there wa an advertis about a face clear lotion . i ask my friend if she watch the advertis . she said that she alreadi bought the product which is worth about 20 dollar . but she wa frustrat at the product becaus it made her skin look wors . in the advertis , there were 3 averag look girl who tranform their skin to an attract one use thi product . it wa noth like it appear . few day back , i wa in the mall tri to get some stuff for my soccer practic . i went to the model 's sport good , there wa a packet with basebal card on it . on the cover , there were about 10 card , so i decid to buy it . i went to my hous and open the cover and found onli 3 card . i wa veri frustrat at thi . although , it my fault , i felt it wa n't right . in the abov exampl , it wa evidenc that advertis make product look better . there wa a say , `` not to judg a book by it cover . '' in the same way , we product seem much better in their advertis .
