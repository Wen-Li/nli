i do not believ that there will be fewer car in twenti year from now . my doubt are particularli fuel by the aspect of mobil which i believ to be have an even gain influenc on our live . in the face of incess global , peopl will most probabl be more and more forc to be flexibl in a physic sens . both the abil and the willing to move and to have a long way to work will be essenti in the world of tomorrow even more than they are today . higher mobil will natur requir more car . the main argument against the continu spread of vehicl may and can be seen in the environment issu affect by their use . the certainli ever-grow awar of these often feroci environment downsid will for sure have a long distanc effect on peopl by car . but i believ that thi will onli be the case if car manufactur will not succeed in develop car with consider less harm environment side-effect than they have today . if these corpor , howev , do achiev thi goal on an effect scale , and there is at least some reason to believ they do , i am convinc peopl will not be deterior from by car in ani way . but i believ not onli the improv environment issu to be a potenti enhanc factor on car sale . look at the technolog develop of the last hundr year , it seem quit plausibl to assum that car will keep becom less and less expens , at least as far as low - and mid level car are concern . i believ that the car will not onli pursu but also broaden it domin as a mass product , increasingli reach more and more potenti custom . natur , my argument is onli convinc if the automobil industri find a both afford and effect way of reduc the devast effect of car with regard to air pollut , i.e. global warm . one may , of cours , doubt whether the industri is will and capabl of reach thi goal . if not , custom will certainli shi away more and more from the car as an every-day item that we use even where not necessari . in the case of the latter , peopl will , i believ , be way more sensibl in their conduct in twenti year , probabl to a degre at which thi sensit even effect their consum habit . in the face of global warm , i would certainli support such a chang .
