not all the time the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . it depend of the countri , the age and the manner of the person . when you are go to travel to a countri that speak the same languag , it is not as necesari to have a guid as if you do not speak the same languag . it is like if you speak spanih and you are gonig to travel to germani you need someon to help you to understand , but if you travel to spain is not too difficult becaus despit that you do not know that countri you can talk with them without problem . other thing is that old peopl do not like to travel with a guid , and young peopl ye . thi is becaus for exampl a coupl of old peopl are go to europ , if they go with a group led by a guid , mayb they can not mantain the rythm all the time like waik up earli , walk a lot , or eat in ani restaur . i mean , they are go to want to do the thing in the time that they want , and not be direct by anyon . everi chang if go a coupl of young peopl , beacus they are go to want to make all the day activ , and to visit evey part of europ . the manner of be of everyon also depend a lot , becaus if you are someon that do not like to receiv order , or follow instruct , you are not go to accept be led by a tour guid . also if you are not friendli , mayb you can have problem with the other peopl . with thi we can see that it depend of the person and as everyth it ha good and bad thing to go with a tour guid .
