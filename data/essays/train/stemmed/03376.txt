i think that a young person enjoy life more than an old one do . a child have much energi to spend in play , in fact he experi the world play . in contrast an old person prefer to be quiet and avoid to move if he do n't need it . a teen first want to discov new thing , he increas interest , he fall in love , he start the way to becom an adult person . differ an older person rememb what he did and could becom a savior . in realiti i do n't think that the differ is the enjoiment of life , inde a person can appreci life if he want , but the topic is the qualiti of life . a young person live better becaus is more sane , dynam , couriou , stronger than an older one . i am twenty-two year old and sure i should enjoy life more than an older man , but i think that a child should be better than me in enjoy life in the same way . though thi compar depend from the rang between the age of the two peopl , i am sure that a young person enjoy life more
