the statement that to understand idea and concept is more import than to learn fact is a contoversi one . on one hand learn fact is import get into the research made in the past on the other hand it is alway saidthat think and understand is the mother of all invent . how ever in my opinion it is better to understand idea and concept rater to learn it . the reason for my belief is , that if someon understand the topic and appli it the past experi help to memor the thing . the best exampl i can think of is doctor it is the idea and practis that make him a good praction , if he go to learn everi thing he might be confus all the time . the second reason for my belief is , it is alway easi to underestand the thing rather to mug them up . concept format start right when he wa in school and it gradual build over the time and will not finish till the end of hi life . it is scientif prove that what we learn each day we memor onli 30 % next day and it will keep on decreas with time . thi happen to us dure exam if a pereson is well activ dure lectur and do hi home work regularli hi perform is better than a person who work last night of exam , the activ learner can handl all type of question ask effect and effici and a problem can occur for a person who did learn the answer of the question ask . last reason for my belief is , that in the field of research the knowledg is more import than the learn fact . the scholar alway test on thi parametr , for fact there are book inth libarari for refer , internet to search but no option for understand . , it is hi idea and concept which help him to suc in life . final i strongli support the statement that `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' .
