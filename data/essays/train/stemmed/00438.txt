i do agre with the statement say that success peopl are the one who take risk with innov thing instead of what they knew alreadi . to support my idea , i will first show that innov thing such as innov and new technolog are factor that encourag success . then , i will explain whi peopl do allway the same thing may not be success . innov is one sector that ha evolu a lot dure the last centuri . men are creativ , they allway tri to invent new tool to help them in their daili life or to allow them to do new thing . it is then easili understand that through all the main evolut , such as the industri revolut , or the internet , peopl who want to take risk had veri high potenti of be success . per exampl , the peopl who were confid that internet will becom veri import made the good bet . today , mani of them have been success and are rich and/or famou . then , peopl do the same thing continu are less like to be success becaus they stay focus on exist sector and activ . it is evid that if we do n't take ani risk , we can not have ani potenti in success . as an exampl , we can talk about a worker in a factori . some of them work dure more than twenti year in the same posit , with the same duti and salari . usual these peopl are n't like thi becaus they are less intellig than other , but rather becaus they prefer to have a confort life with no risk . but without risk , we can not chang and evolu . to conclud , we can say that peopl who invest themselv in thing which are relat to innov or new technolog are more like to get success due to the potenti of growth of it . in the other hand , peopl who continu do thing they know without look in other direct and sector will not be abl to be success . these are the key factor that make someon success or not .
