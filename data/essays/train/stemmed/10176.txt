i agre that is most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . for exampl last week i saw an advertis about soup for clean the car , they said it w 'll clean ani think incloud hard spot so i tri that product and it doesnt do ani thing for my car , may be the normal soup is better than thi product . anoth advertis wa talk about some food and they say it is veri healthi and good for your bodi do i buy it too , but after i tri it i dont thing i feel ani chang . and there is some product for a fat peopl they said it w 'll make you lose wight and make you thiner but alot of peopl tri that product and did n't lose ani wight . but some time there a honest advertis . for exampl there wa an advertis about some food and they chaleng ani one who can prove that is the product ha ani unnatur product so when some peopl do some test for thi product they say it wa true the product doe not contain ani unnatur product . but the we ca n't say about advertis alway make thair product better than they realli are and in the same time we can not say the opssit becaus we have the to face , honest advertisemn and dishonest advertis . therefor , i thing that back for the person experian and what he beliv in and if the product equal the big advertis they have so do n't beliv ani thing you wach becaus some time you just wach a minet of layer from thi compani .
