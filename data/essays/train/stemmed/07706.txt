without question , i agre witn thi idea that young peopl enjoy their live more than older peopl do . i have two reason for thi opinion : energi and freedom . first of all , i think that young peopl are abl to exercis more harder then older peopl becaus they are young , so they have a lot of energi in gener . in my grandfath 's case , he said that he could run veri fast and carri everyth even the huge thing when he wa 21 year old . moreov , he play basebal everyday after school with hi friend and never injur when he wa junior high-school . i guess he wa a tough boy , but he never play sport now . furthermor , he say that you should play sport when you are young becaus you will not be abl to run faster end play some sport when you are 70 year old . secondli , i assert that young peopl can fall in love with their classmat , school friend and so on easili . in my case , i love some girlfriend when i wa a high-school student . it wa veri enjoy and veri sweet memori for me . howev , the older peopl can not propos the peopl they love or like , i think . it is becaus that older peopl have their husband or wive in mani case . of cours , if you are young and not marri , you can make boyfriend or girlfriend freeli . while it may be true that not everi young peopl can fall in love with someon , and older peopl tend to have much money than young peopl . howev , young peopl are given the freedom . that 's whi they may be find their love affair and are given money by thier parent . to be young mean that to be free , i think . in conclus , i support the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . his/her energi and freedom enabl him/her to enjoy life , i think .
