nowaday , competit among compani is increas . compani use ani mean possibl to make profit . advertis are use to reach their target and to sell their product regardless the qualiti . i do agre that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first , advertis present onli a pictur of product . televis are one of the main way use by compani to conduct advertis . product seem veri great when watch televis . there is no way to touch the product . one can not have physic contact with thi product . subsequ , it is hard to verifi the product 's qualiti . i recent order a cell just by call the phone number i saw on televis dure advertis . the cell phone seem veri good . it had mani featur . but , i did return thi product becaus it wa not work . it wa quit differ from what advertis show . second , advertis are conduct to make money . compani pay a lot of money to get their product known by custom . televis or media in gener do not care about the qualiti of product be advert . it is therefor a contract between compani supplier of product and televis compani . the contract ha to be fullfil bu each parti . custom ' interest are not realli a concern . compani expect to sell their product toward advertis . most of time , these compani will refus to replac a defect product . custom are therefor victim of fals advertis becaus of compani that are onli motiv by make profit . make profit is common . becaus advertis make productt much better , custom have to pay more attent . they have to make sure that produc are of great qualiti . product should therefor be sold with mandatori warranti period in order to prevent custom from fals advertis . thi is veri import today .
