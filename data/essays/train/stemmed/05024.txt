for me , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in onli one subject . becaus the more knowledg we gain the more opputunitu for have job we would have . have broad knowledg is the key element which we can gain job . for exampl , i want to studi account at univers , and later i will have got the cpa . howev , i will choos to studi how to direct film as my subsidiari major becaus if one day i am tire with my carreer as an account , i can stil choos anoth job as a director . secondli . i think when we gain more knowledg we can learn a lot of benefici thing of those knoledg . for instanc , when we learn about the histori , we can learn about the major fact or issu that happen in the past , we can tri to circumv those malici fact such as the ww2 and other disast , and we can make some improv from those historiuc fact . thirdli , learn more thing can give us anoth aspect of view the world . from learn we can not onli gain the knowledg from the academ subject but also expand our mind . for exampl , when i wa a child i view everyth in the world with a narrow mind , but sinc i went to the high school i lea in conclus , i agre on that we should better to have broad knowledg of mani academ suject becaus it can give us more advantag than it give us drawback .
