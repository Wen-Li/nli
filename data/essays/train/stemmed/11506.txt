each one ha it own way in travel , so i am disagre about have a tour guid is the best way to travel . first of all , i have travel mani time in my life and all of my travel were realli good even though i had not have a tour guid . becaus you might have a tour guid who like someth special that you do not like so that will caus mani thing such as : spend time in someth that you do not like , and then you may not have time to go to the place that you do like . although , you could be a tour guid for yourself by get inform from mani sours , and that what i do . these are some point about travel with group led by tour guid . moreov , travel without tour guid is help you to depend on yourself by use the map , or ani other way . even though you might get lost sometim but get lost dure travel is good some time , i mean you might see someth new that you do not about it . also , you could use the money that you will spend on tour guid in someth differ in your trip . for exampl , if you plane to pay a hundr to a tour guid , you can use thi hundr in buy some stuff to your self . in the other hand i can not say that the peopl who are travel with tour guid are wrong , becaus as i said everi one ha it own way in travel . travel with tour guid ha disadvanteg as it ha advantag . it could the thing that i think it is right mainli wrong in other opinion . for exampl , some peopl hate to get lost in travel while i have fun in that . actual those peopl are also right becaus if you gat lost in new siti that you do not know could be danger on your life , espesi if you enter those scari , and dark place . in conclusin , the peopl are still travel with or without tour guid , but in my opinion i prefer to travel without led by tour guid .
