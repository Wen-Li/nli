mani peopl assert that youg peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun . although it would easi to accept thi statement at fact valu , it is such a complex one . person , i disagre thi statement for two reason . the first reason for my disagr is that personailti . a man 's worth is not lie in what he ha but lie what he is . that is to say , personailti is essenti . take me for exampl . when i wa colleg student , even we had a lot of thing to do , we still seprat the rest of time to help our commun . we do a lot of thing such as assist take care homeless child , play with them , and read stori for them . therefor , i did n't yough peopl spend few of time to help their commun . anoth reason is that young peopl would like to enrich their experic and increas their awar and consici . to help their communti is nessari and import . young peopl will spend a lot of time to help peopl who is ine . they think is valuableto do thi . so , i do n't believ that young peopl do n't give enough time to help their commun . all of these reason have deepli influenc my point of view on thia issu . that is not to say , of cours , that other point of view are complet without merit . howev , i believ that the reason i have provid in favor of my point of view are stronger .
