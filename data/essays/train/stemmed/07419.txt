i disagre with the given statement `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . although one may arriv to thi conclus by observ a particular group or kind of peopl . howev , one should rememb these group do not repres the whole of today young gener . i disagre with the idea becaus i myself have seen mani instanc of commun work done by school and colleg student . mani social work organ accross the countri constitut of veri young peopl . for exampl in almost all institut of excel in higher studi through out the countri ( india ) , they have a credit cours on social and commun servic name ( nation social servic ) . in thi cours student tri and help their commun by do variou social work in their free time . for exampl teach english to villag children , educ villag about certain diseas and hygin condit , etc . also , sinc thi statement seem to be a realtiv one . like compar today younger gener with that of past . i dont think scenario ha chang a lot with time , i mean youth today are awar of their respons and duti toward the commun as much as their ancestor . we can find all kind of peopl at ani given time period , moreov , there are no conclus evid that section of youth work for the commun have increas or reduc with time . accord to me nowaday the young crowd is more inform about it duti and respons . it is quit evid from the fact that competit is increas in everi area . more and more peopl want to becom someth be it doctor , engin or scientist , they all are will to serv the commun in one way or anoth . the abov exampl may be a bit confus as , how these academ advanc can be relat to help the commun . but , in my view , a student studi engin or medicin is sure serv the commun , by provid it with doctor and engin for the futur . to summar , i disagre with the given statement due to lack of ani given statist and my own person experi . infact , accord to my point of view the young peopl nowaday are more awar and respons toward their commun .
