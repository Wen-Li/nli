i strongli agre with the statement that that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . it is veri difficult for ani person to be satisfi with hi or her achiev . moreov if a person is success and ha mean to tri someth new he will never hesit . it is a human natur to desir more that what he ha . it is said that if a glass is half fill and half empti one should be satisfi with the portion full with water . but it is never seen . a person alway want to touch new horizon of success . for an exampl if compani becom the topmost busi of a countri the owner will tri hi best to make it the most success busi of the world . rather thi will act as a drive forc and he will be readi to take ani risk for it . if a person is success and ha enough cash and credit he will be more inclin to take risk and explor new area of bussi . he can start a new work with a small portion and in case he would not secce he will not lose much and still have enough from the old bussi . moreov a person who ha prove him self in the market ha gain respect and faith of mani peopl , so other are alway readi to help ficanci or by other mean . thi is not true onli in the busi world . world is full of such exampl . there are mani scientist , artist , mountain clinber , and mani more other peopl who did not stop after be success and earn reput and money . rather have alway tri to do more that what they did till now . in sum i think that sucess act as a drive forc make a person want more and more and a success person ha tha advantag of have more support and resourc so he can take more risk to achiev more .
