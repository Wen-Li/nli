when i wa fifteen year old , my father told me somth which i have never forgot it , and actual it help me mani time , he said `` tri to know small thing about about everi subject and tri to know everyth about one subject '' . for that i tri from that time to identifi which kind of scienc i should special , and what are the relat scienc which i should know about it . i dicied to special in the structur design engin and that forc me to do well in the academ subject deal with that scienc . but i find that to do that well i should have a good knowledg of mathemat , physic , mechan and in sometim medic subject . it seem to be strang , how can some medic subject relat to relat to structur design ? the answer is the way the human is stand with by hi bone is similar to the way of structur to . so accord to my experi i think that special in a certain academ subject is veri import , but you must have a small knowledg about the other academ subject . on the other hand peopl that support have a board knowledg of mani academ subject say that ; it will help student to have a bigger chanc in the market , but that is not correct . the market nowaday is search for the special person in a certain subject , and also they pay for these kind of experi too much . actual not special peopl alway play small rool in their compani and even if they are work too much they did not get a good apprici as the special worker got . and ofcours that will affect the work environ by spread the feel of jelou and make the one team project hate each other .
