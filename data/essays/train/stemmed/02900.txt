to tri new thing and learn about new thing is alway good thing and get advantag from tri . i agre with the idea of success poepl tri new thing and take risk even if they know how to do well . it will be alway pul thing for them . and also tri new thing can improv themselv and might realiz and find out thing that they did not know about . one of my best friend , she start belong to basketbal team . she wa realli good at most of kind of sport so of cours she wa the number one person of begin . she start pali basketbal for not seriou reason like she just want to belong to somet to spend time of her asterschool for fun . after while , she start be absent for practic becous she knew that she play the best in the team and she believ that she is alway the best for sport . one day , there wa a game for tornament and coach wa go to call the name of player . but my friend wa not call . sinc she start skip practic , other girl are get better becous they were tri and tri to get better . i thought she need to tri more hard even if she doe better than anyon . after that , she start to tri and go to practic and the next game she wa call as a player and she play even better than befor . in conclus , i thgouht , to tri is alway pul thing to do even for the success peopl . and what i think of success peopl is who tri hard and alway tri new thing and take risk . even if they know thing alreadi then they do not tri , i think those peopl are not success . so i agre with the state of succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
