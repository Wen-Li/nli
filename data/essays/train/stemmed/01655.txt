first of all , i would like to say that i agre with the statement . in my opinion success in life ha to be with risk . one can be do well in their live ; for instanc , one person can be a good profesion in hi field , but veri often happen that peopl tend to go follow the easi way . for exampl , our hipothet person can be a good teacher in a high school nad for that reason he will stay forev in the same school , or teach the same level of student . he , might be to have quit an interest life , but while do the same he is not go to `` grow up '' . i think that for that person would be more interestin to continu studi , tri to get a master degre in hi field , and after that work in a colleg as a teacher at that level . of cours , he is go to need to work hard ; teach in hi school , and after that go to the colleg , and hi life dure that time is go to be busi and stress . also the risk he take while tri to fullfil hi dream is go to deriv in panic sometim , but at the end , he will feel that life make sens . sometim peopl need to take the risk of chang the place of resid to tri to have a better life or job , and they could feel panic . i am alway in the opinion of move on to have new opportun , which can have the consequ of success . in conclus , i admir those peopl that are not affraid of chang when the idea is to be a more interest person and live a more interest life .
