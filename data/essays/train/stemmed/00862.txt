where i live , japan , poepl spend their vacat on travel around the world . therefor , there are mani tour design by tour compani . some pepol prefer to take these tour with friend led by a tour guid , but i find more advantag that plan a tour by myself is suitabl for me . therefor i disagre with thi statement . of cours , there are some advantag to travel led by a tour guid . for instanc , peopl feel at eas when they are led by a tour guid who know veri well about the area which they visit . also , sometim a tour less cost to stay hotel or transpot than pay by myself . although there are some advantag to take a tour , i definit choos to travel by myself . the primari reason that i can cite is i can more enjoy a tour with free plan , bacaus i do n't feel comfort if i have to travel with a person who i have n't met befor . it is more comfort for me to travel alon or with friend . socondli , if i travel led by a tour , i feel i have to be punctual even though it 's my vacat , my preciou day off , becaus i must not make a tour plan confus and get other in troubl . on the other hand , i can take my time to visit , buy someth or eat nice meal as long as i want . i do n't feel guilti at all . therefor as i mention so far i definit choos to travel without a tour guid otherwis i feel stress on my preciou time . i just want to enjoy and relax on my vacat effect .
