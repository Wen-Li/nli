advertis is everywer ! it is hardli imposs to escap from it . on the one hand you get a lot of inform about new product but on the other hand it is nearli impssibl to stop it . in my opinion advertis doe not make product better as they are , it manipul us in differ way so that we buy the product . advertis tri to show us the opportun and advantag we might have when we will buy thi particular product . it could also creat new need . some time ago nobodi would beliv , that we would drink water out of bottl . it wa the advertis which told us , that onli the water in the bottl are clean . and on the other side they told us that the water out of the tin is dirti although it is nearli the same . advertis doe show product in an other way . it ha to becaus otherwis we would not even notic , that we miss someth . with a lot of competit in the market everi product ha to be someth special and uniqu . nobodi would buy just an ordirnari chocolat bar or just a shirt . brand and the trust that peopl have toward them is veri import . advertis tri to creat emot . when we go to the supermarket and we would like to buy some sweet we should rememb that good feel as the girl in the advertis tast thi chocol bar and how happi she wa . thi pictur should lead us to buy thi product . the product doe not differ from other one but we get influenc by the advertis . the reason for do advertisin is that the sell increas becaus of it . with that background you might think that the statement is complet true . but as i mention in the text it ha a lot more to do than just show there product . the connect between the custom and the product is much more import than just the sell number of the next month . the difficulti of advertis is to make a bond between the two side so that the custom will onli buy the own product now and in the futur . that might be the biggest challeng in that busi .
