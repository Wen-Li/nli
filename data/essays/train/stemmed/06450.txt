nowaday , more and more peopl prefer to travel when they have holiday . is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid ? differ peopl have differ answer . as far as i am concern , i total disagre with the statement . travel in a group ha three main neg function : rigid , expens and bore . first , travel in a group is not flexibl . peopl go out for trip is for relax . howev , travel in a group sometim make peopl feel more stress . peopl are busi dure the workday . of cours they do not wish as busi as usual when they are on holiday . there is a rigid timet in a group . nobodi will wait you if you sleep late or you want to stay in a place longer . if peopl go to travel alon , they can chang their timeabl anytim and do not need to wast time on these place where they do not like . in addit , travel in a group is veri expens . travel with a tour guid need to pay some more money to the guid 's instruct . it is a extra payment . peopl should save these money so that they can go to more place . guid usual take visitor to some special store for shop . actual , the good in these shop are much expens than nomal shop and most of them are old-fashion or have someth broken . peopl want to use more money to make the trip more color . howev , they can not get a equal servic as they pay . final , travel in a group take off almost half fun of a trip . accord to the recent research , peopl have more fun when they search the inform of the place they will visit than visit itself . peopl collect inform from newpap , tv program and internet and when they go to the place , they feel familar and more interest . if travel with a tour guid , there is no need to search the inform becaus the guid will tell you everyth about the place . all in all , takin into consider i have discuss , travel in a group is not the best way to travel . not onli can not the timet be chang , but also it is a wast of money and take off the interest of search as well .
