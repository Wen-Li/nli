first of all , i would like to refer about the rang of `` young peopl '' and `` old peopl '' . i would like to refer `` young peopl '' , as an univers student , and `` old peopl '' as those parent . these day , parent , who have sent their children to univers , tend to restart enjoy their own live . until high school , a number of parent consid their children as immatur . although , as soon as they enter univers , they chang their idea that their children are no longer immatur . therefor , after their children are grown up to univers student , parent shift their life for enjoy themselv . in my opinion , i am against to the idea that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , in term of studi and relationship between friend . firstli , young peopl , who are in univers , have to studi a lot . most of them have lectur everyday , have to make a present , or submit report . on the other hand , old peopl , have no school nor lectur . they are total free to spend their free time . secondli , about relashionship between friend . when peopl enter univers , the first thing they tri to do , is make friend . it can be an enjoy thing , but in return , it might be a stress thing . they have to seek for an opportun to speak to a new person , and get to know each other . although , parent , who have alreadi gain a friend , do not need to make new friend . they do not need to experi those stress time ani more . to give an more consider instanc , my mother enjoy more of her life after my enter to univers . she goe out with her best friend more often , go out with her to see a play , movi , etc . moreov , she is make more time to stay with her husband . they go out for a drive , or take a walk with our dog . from these fact i can maintain that parent are enjoy their life , as much as univers student do , in term of school affair and relationship between colleagu . as we see parent , as old peopl , from these two point , we can say that it is true that they are enjoy their life . it might be not an exagger to say that old peopl are enjoy their live much more than younger peopl . from these reason , i am against to the idea that younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
