i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will fewer car in use than there are today . as car becom cheaper , safer and more user-friendli , more peopl will choos car as their main mean of transport . some peopl may argu that technolog advanc in telecommun may reduc the need for transport . i think that , while it is true that there ha alreadi been a gener decreas in busi trip , the use of car for privat transport will continu to increas in the futur . other may argu that more effici public transport will render car obsolet . howev , i believ that although public transport is a key factor in develop , it will never substitut car becaus of it inher limit . the cost of produc a car ha been greatli reduc in recent year wherea their conveni and perform continu to increas . nowaday fulli equip car such as the renault logan or the subaru pleo cost around three thousand dollar to produc and are sold for aroudn five thousand . anoth import factor is the rapid growth of the automot market in develop countri such as india , china or brazil . in these countri still rel few peopl own a car but there is a great potenti for growth . in china , for exampl , last year saw a twenti percent increas in unit sold . follow thi trend , mani car manufactur are launch low cost bric ( which stand for brazil , russia , india , china ) product line design to meet these market 's demand . in conclus , although it is true that the use of car may be reduc in specif situat , i believ that in gener the number of car will continu increas .
