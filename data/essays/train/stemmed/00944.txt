i agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first reason whi i think the number of car are decreas is that oil price are increas sharpli . research are say that the fossil resourc such as coal , oil , natur ga are be deplet everi year . moreov , the economi of china is boom up sinc late of 90 's , and oil demand are sharpli increas becaus china buy consider amount of oil all over the world . if oil becom expens , peopl do n't drive a car and instead they tri to use public transport . therefor , high oil price result in fall of demand car , and these kind of trend becom gener , the number of car are decreas . the second reason is that more countri are concern about enviroment problem and believ that car produc some harard meteri . environ problem ha been issu by intern societi such as un and intern enviro organizt such as wto . therefor some govern would lead to make the number of car decreas and it would affect to the number of car . the research of substitu resourc would lead to the same result . as far as i know , subsitit resourc that appi to modern transport is onli electr . nuclear is too danger to use for transport and the other resourc is still on go research . by the way , if elect resourc for individu tranport is use in daili life , that mean peopl can not afford to pay oil price and car batteri would be use . but it is veri uncomfort to charg and danger to use when someon is lost hi way and batteri 's out . peopl would not use batteri car and they would rather use public transport . if there is no innov invent of substitut resourc , the number of car will be decreas . there are some other reason of fewer car use such as decreas of popul , govern restict to use oil , lack of social infrastructur and so on . howev , the most imporat reason is the fact that our fossil reasourc are deplet , and we should prepar for that next a few decad .
