thi question perfectli fit with my person experi , in fact i had to face to thi import question dure my career as a student befor and a worker after . at univers i have studi polit scienc , a faculti which gave me a wide knowledg other differ subject , such as polit , histori , economi , languag , sociolog , philosophi , mathemat , law , etc . dure the period of my studi i have found them realli useful and not bore at all , becaus i could studi differ issu at the same time , make univers a vari and alway new method of learn . the same day i had lesson of privat law , mathemat and sociolog , and thi varieti of subject avoid the risk of get tire of stude alway the same thing . then i graduat , and i had to face the incred world of job . and onli at thi point i have found out that all what i had studi at univers gave me on one side a wide rang of knowledg , but on the other a lack in the specif knowledg of one main subject . in all thi , which knowledg is better ? the broad knowledg of mani academ subject or the special in one specif subject ? i still have to find myself the right answer , so that i have to arrang thi lack give a compromis answer : it 's better to have a special knowledg in one subject which we like and on which we can focu our job and career , but we should optim thi special by widen as much as possibl our basic knowledg of differ subject . anoth import factor concern our goal : if our goal is to find a good and well retribut job , so we have to special in one subject becaus thi is what is more need and ask in the job 's world . nowaday there are more graduat with a good wide knoledg than graduat with a good special in one field of studi . on the other hand , if our goal is to have a gener knowledg other differ aspect which may help to understand one singl sector of our life , such as for istanc polit scienc , we have to spend year other differ academ subject , studi a bit of everyth .
