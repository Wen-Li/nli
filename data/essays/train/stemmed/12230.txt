in my countri , the parent usual say to their children that you do n't have to do new thing for success , risk your life , but just do what you have done well so far . for me , howev , success peopl seem more creativ and adventur rather than conserv and tend to be safe . the world is relentlessli chang . without ani chang of one 's self , one can not come up with the chang of the world , even if one alreadi ha becom success . consequ , one will keep stay the past , and not be abl to make an achiev meaning for the present . in addit , if peopl onli keep do what they know how to do well , someon els will tri to do what other peopl know how to do well , and he or she final will becom anoth master of it . after all , there will be no differ among them , and therefor be no new succeed for previou success peopl . accordingli , in order that not onli normal peopl becom success peopl but also alreadi success peopl keep up with their past succeed , they should make a new tri . needless to say , alreadi success peopl have done like that , will do so for their futur succeed . but , i do n't mean that the what peopl ha done befor is not import so far . it can be great basi for new thing . so , it is also essenti to respect what we have alreadi done .
