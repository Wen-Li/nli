some may beliv that traval abroad or local is best when one travel with a group and accompani by a tour guid . i howev complet disagre . in my opinion , the whole purpos of travel is to experinc a new place , cultur , and lifestylf for how you perseiv it not how a whole group of tourist beliv it to be . althought led by a tour guid or leader who is well inform , brochur and privat tour guid are just as use and much more conveni . also travel without a whole group enabl you to have more privaci and complet enjoy the new environ and surround . it is veri possibl that when one travel with a group and a guid , all the peopl can distract you from the beauti that you are suposs to be experienc . it is also possibl that in a new countri or environ , a group of tourist with a tour guid is not the safest way to travel and site-se . mani local may see the group as a veri convini situat to steal , or also known as pick-pocket when in larg group . not onli do some local find it lucr to steal but a new busi of kidnap and human traffic . in today societi , violenc is spread faster , farter , and in increasingli more brutal way . if one were to travel in a group with a guid , it heighten onc chanc of be kidnap or what is known as traffic . although it mani sound far fetch and unlik , i have person done a studi on thi topic and grow problem . statisticli , peopl are more like to be not notic when kidnap if they were travel in a larg group becaus so much can be happen it at one time that peopl attent can be captur . depend on the destin may also affect the travl circumstan . if one were to travel to a larger citi , it might be wise to have more protect like a privat guid who know wher they are and the local peopl . still , i beliv it is better to travel without a group . no matter where one travel and what one see , the best and more enjoy way to experinc and new environ is not in a group , but with onli a small number of peopl , for exampl 2-5 but noth larger and accompani by a privat tour guid .
