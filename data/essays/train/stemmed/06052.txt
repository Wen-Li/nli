i disage , for me the best way to travel is by your slef . becos travel in a group lede by a tour guid il not comfurmtabeul , and he will take you to the most touristiqu place , the most expens pleas . if you go allown you will be abul to see the real part of the cultur and the rieal peapul . for exampeul , if you go to india with a guid he or she , will chow you the monumunt 's but not the villigi . .. you will not be aibul to teast everi thing becos thay will teal you that you will be sick . .. but if you go allown you can take your time in the stor and in the monumint . .. if you go allown you can talk to how you want . .. you can give monni to the needi , but if you go wiyh a guid he ou she , will teal you not to give them anni thing . som peapl lick to be allown . in a bu you ar not allown and there are smell , a chidran crine . .. wen you go by your self , you are more relaxt then in a bu . .. a guid will teal you to harri up and teak photo , but you are on a oliday , and you want to take your time rith ? if you go by your sel with just a travel bag you will meak meni contak , rich and poueur peapel . .. you will lurn much more by go by your self . the poueur peapeul will com and beg more wen they see a goup of with peapel then wen they see just own . so that is wy i disage with the fact of travel in a group lede by a guid .
