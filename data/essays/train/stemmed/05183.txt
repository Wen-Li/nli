the issu at hand is to know how the evolut of the popul will contribu to the develop of the utilis of car . i 'm agre with the prompt , thet state that in `` twenti year there will be fewer car in use '' first , the develop of technolog make that it easier to use other way that car for travel . in fact , nowaday , the underground are veri develop , and faster than befor , and also realli good accomod to the peopl 's need . moreov , peopl have been use to use car to travel far away or to go to vacat site , but today habit have chang . peopl want to spend more time to enjoy than to travel so they choos to go with plane or train , and so do n't need car . those new habit made me believ that it will be fewer car in use than there are today . secondli , i believ that it will be fewer car in use , becaus there is to much trafic in the citi . the fact tht in the last few year the number of car increas make a lot of diffuculti to drive into the citi . to do just one kilomet you spend more time to wait in your car that to drive . i know from my own experi of driver , that if i want to be on time for a meet i 'd rather choic to wolk or to use the subway , so we do n't need a car anymor . therefor i believ that it will be fewer car . futhermor , i believ that it will be fewer car becaus peopl are more and more understand the inpact of car on the envir . in fact , the increas of car those few decad made the level of pollut veri high . with the help of scientist who explain affect of gase on the envir , peopl will choos anoth way to travel without have an impact on the envir . for thi reason i think that it will be fewer car in the futur . final , in my view it will be less car becaus it becom veri expens to have one . in fact , i 'm live in pari and with all the new investig there no place to park the car without pay , and with all that the price of the fuel doe n't stop to increas , so you understand that peopl thimk twice befor they decid to by a car . thi point also make me believ that the number of car in use will be fewer than today . to conclud , i think that it will be le car in twenti year thant today becaus car doe n't still have all the advantag of those day , and now much more desadvantag make the driver use other wat to travel .
