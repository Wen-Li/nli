in my opinion , i think that for student it 's more import to learn fact . dure each lectur of someth , professor are use to give the student too mani idea and concept which it will never remain in theyr brain . so , the best way to teach someth to the student is give one thousand exampl about fact that can make improv to the student . on the other hand sometim is more use for student just learn the basic of idea or concept understood dure the lectur or studi in the textbook . infact , student 's get in troubl when he ha to understand a fact which is full of concept or idea that they didn ' studi befor to hear about the fact . moreov the answer at the question could be as differ as the brain structur of everyon . although i suggest to everyon to improv theyrself learn fact i think that for somebodi it 's not the best way to look for . firstli , student who ha a good memori should use it to rememb the idea and concept that they have been learn . instead student who ha just a vision memori might use thi memori rememb all the imag present in a lectur as a fact explain the issu . moreov , who get easli in confus read differ concept , most of the time difficult concept , could't undestand what he ha to do in some exercis or in ani text where 's show the issu . final , i think that student have to do want they want
