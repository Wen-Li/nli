in my opinion , i disagre with the statement . i think both of the situat is veri import for the student . ( understand idea and concept , learn fact . ) the two situat combin with each other . firstli , understand idea and concept is use for the student . by the way the student can learn the idea . so the student have an opinion about the situat . for exampl ; while learn about a war , the student should learn the idea and concept of the war . ( what is the import of the war for other compani , the other person opinion about the war , where it began . .. etc ) befor the student dont understand the idea and the concept of the war , they cant have a focu on the war . not onli understand idea and concept of the war but also learn the fact of the war ha an import role for the student . if the student want to learn about the war , the student have to be success in two situat . secondli , when learn fact is not enough for the student . for exampl ; the student learn the fact of the happen , ( for exampl by learn the fact of the war , the student can understand the war anda then the student can built their opinion strongli ) but if the student dont understand the idea and concept of the happen , the situat doesnt have a place in the student mind . then , the student wont rememb the situat . so it mean the situat is temporari for the student . by understand the idea and concept , the student can develop their idea . so the student can improv yorself about the situat . in conclus , the student not onli understand idea , but also learn fact . they gave enough import for both of situat . so they learn the situat well by understand idea , concept and learn fact .
