from my point of view it is more import for the student to learn the fact and then start learn the idea and the concept . student must know the fact befor he learn the idea and concept . becaus without the fact he cant easili understand concept and he cant even memor the idea which he would have been learnt . so the fact are veri import befor we learn annyth . the basic concept will be learn from the fact and the idea can be easili learnt . for exampl if we want to learn about gravit law we would first think about the newtonslaw . but the fact is that he found out the gravit pull by the appl fall from the tree on to hi head . . and thu by thi we can easili understand the idea and the concept . these fact will be easili leran by the student and they can reproduc them veri effect . they wont even forget the idea and the concept with taht fact . thu by these fact we can easili learn the topic veri easili and effect . anoth exampl for undesrtand the idea and the concept is that if we want to know how light wa evolv there are mani theori and the major fact is that light wa discov by thoma edis after hi 99th failur thu by thi we can easili captur our mind relat to the fact so that which can be easili stay in our mind . thu i strongli disaagre the abov point it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . so student must be first learn the fact relat to what they are studi . these fact are easili avail and thu they should learn them first and they must keeep them in mind . these fact will sure help the student to increas tgheir memor skill and their intrest to the subject .
