although i can understand peopl , who think that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , i think that speacial in one specif subject is better . i want to point out my opinion with the follow 3 argument . first of all , in ancient time , the greek and roman need manz academ skill . for exampl , aristotel wa a philosophist , mathemat and a astrophologist . they need these mani specialis to earn money . but sinc henri ford invent the construct band , the specialis expand . secondli , you have to be a geniu to have a broad knowlodg of mani academ subject . for exampl student need three or four year to studi onli one academ subject . so it would cost the person a lot of time to get a broad knowledg . furthermor studi are not for free . the person would also need a lot of money , and thi is not veri effect , as he or she do n't earn a lot more money , when they start work . so in fact , you should studi two thing side by side . but thi request a high iq , which onli a few peopl have . last but not least , as mention in the begin , specialis is need today in everi work . today compani search for specialis worker in onli one specif subject . the work doe not requir other academ subject . so a person with a broad knowledg would propabl be annoy , do thi job . so the compani will propabl prefer the specialis worker . i studi busi , thi is alreadi a specialis , but i have to pick out onli one part of busi . for exampl , control or financ manag and when i work in a big compani i even have to go deeper into specialis in one aspect of control or financ manag . and by do thi i have to learn everi day new thing , so i will never have the time to learn other academ subject .
