youth is often consid as the best part of life . youth mean energi , project , entertain and happi . is it a realiti ? i think that , in order to answer thi question , young peopl 's problem must be show . youth is a period of tremend stress and fear . stress can be infer by respons , in front of studi , social life , or studi . for exampl some cursu are extrem hard and stressful . it is the case of medicin studi in franc , or some busi studi in japan for exampl . social life infer fear , becaus of competit for exampl . young peopl want to do their best , but are often disppoint by life . for exampl , student social movement that franc knew in the begin of the year two thousand six show that young peopl , even when they have project and are highli graduat , can feel fear about their futur . my opinion is that young peopl often are more interess in polit that their parent , becaus it is about their futur . they understand their own situat , and their countri 's situat . on the contrari , old peopl can enjoy life . more and more , old peopl can enjoy life , becaus they do not work anymor . they can do what they alway dream to do . as a matter of fact , old peopl more and more travel , have good standart of live and entertain themselv . it is prove by sociologist that , in some region , old peopl are happier than young peopl of the same region . besid , it is now prove that old peopl help young peopl , by give them money or allow them to stay in their parent 's hous wherea they alreadi were live alon when they were young . it is an import evolut of societi . young peopl do not longer help their grandpar , it is the contrari . all those element tend to show that young peopl do not enjoy life morethan old peopl do .
