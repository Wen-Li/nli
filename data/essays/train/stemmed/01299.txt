each person ha hi own way of travel . some peopl like travel alon and other like to travel with a group . it depend on the person 's person . but for both case , a tour guid is need special if someon is travel to a countri for the first time . in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . be in a group while travel is so import . it is help and benefici in mani aspect . one of these aspect , is to help get red of boar . no doubt that lole caus boar to everyon . so be in a group would solv thi problem . anoth benefit is that peapl useual feel strang in other countrei becaus they miss their famili , friend and peopl . be in a group obvious help reduc thi feel . final , the last benefit of be in a group , is that you can find help from peopl you know if you need help . you can share your broblem with them instead of other that you do n't know in the forign countri . no doubt that the tour guid is veri import and neccessari . he can provid tourist with inform they need about the forign countri such as law , rule and way of life in that countri . moreov , he know most of the place and how to get to them . so for instanc , if a travel is look for a restaur , hotel or ani other place , a tourist guid would be help . in conclus , it is advis to be in a group led by a tour guid while travel . they can be realli help and use . also they can caus the trip to be more enjoy and easier .
