i total agre with the statement . ad do `` make product seem much better that they realli are '' . that 's the whole point , is it not ? to entic custom , to lure them to buy someth . to somehow convinc the buy mass that life will be oh-so-much-bett with such-and-such a product . to do that , advertis and other assort market type must make the product stand out from the plethora of good out there in the market place . and what better way to do that than to tri to convinc joe q. public that hi life will be dramat improv , in mysteri way , if he buy widget a or gizmo b ? two exampl that come to mind in that regard are car ad and cosmet . most car ad ( there are except , of cours ) do not focu on fuel economi or the qualiti of the seat belt . that would be factual . that would also be bore . instead those ad show the car in a varieti of dramat set -- the desert , rug mountain , a curvi sea-sid road -- go at high speed , and gener do all kind of thing that a sane , normal , suburban driver would never do . and at the end of the commerci , in tini letter at the bottom of the screen , you get the standard disclaim : `` profession driver on a close cours . do not tri thi at home . '' if that is not ` make the product seem much better ' than it realli is , i don ' t know what would be . but it make the car look cool , and that 's the whole point . the other , even more egregi exampl is provid by skin-cream ad . specif , those that claim , for instanc , that one 's skin will be `` 62 % smoother '' or `` 43 % brighter '' or somesuch nonsens . of cours , those ad never actual explain how one measur skin smooth or bright . or what that `` smoother '' refer to . smoother than sandpap ? who know . but use a number , and ideal featur someon in a white coat , will give a seriou , scentif aura to a product which would otherwis be yet anoth skin cream . heck , if it make my skin 62 % smoother , it ha got to be more than twice as good as the compet product that onli claim a 30 % improv , right ?
