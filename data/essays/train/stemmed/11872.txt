i disagre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' i think that peopl can enjoy if they have enough ( i ) money , ( ii ) time , and ( iii ) physic power to enjoy their hobbi or thing which they are will to do . with respect to ( i ) money , it is the mani case that young peopl do not have enough money to enjoy their reasur time . on the other hand , older peopl have enough money to use for their fun . honestli speak , my father have more money than i have . older peopl have deposit their earn money from their long time 's work . and there is the nation pention system in our countori , so older peopl do not have to spend their own money to live and they can get enough money from such pention system today . with respect to ( ii ) time , young peopel have lot of thing to do , such as studi , work , and local activ . in my case , i am work more than 200 hour a month , in order to get money requir to pay back to a bank ( i borrow some money for buy my hous . ) . so young peopl do not have enough time to enjoy their hobbi . with respect to ( iii ) physic power , the physic power of young peopl is higher than that of older peopel . but accord to the articl i read in a magazin , older peopl 's physic power is get higher and higher in accord with the develop or inov in the medic busi . so older peopl today have enough power to enjoy their hobbi like young peopl do . from abov mention , i must state that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl .
