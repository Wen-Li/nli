as it is rightli state by someon that ` prevent is alway better than cure ' . the world is look to thi by save and prevent the extrem use of natur resourc . so i definit agre with the idea or statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to support thi i would like to state few of my view as follow . in my coutri like india , where there is tremend popul and for travel purpos there is enorm number of vehicl . more vehicl talk about the privat vehicl especi car , which is use as mode of transport for the entir famili , or say individu car for each famili member . just imagin what do they do ? they onli add to the pollut of the environ . as in air , nois and water pollut . it doe not onli add pollut but also wastag of natur resourc like petrol and diesel . and for thi we have to depend on the gulf countri . wherein it is onli upto the econom crisi , which indirectli is seen in hike price of petrol . what when thi resourc get over , travel will not onli becom expens with other altern but also imposs one day . some western countri have accept the fact and start more convent , cheaper and better way of travel . like travel on cycl to their work place , place where they have to visit often . by cut down on air and nois pollut , i think that 's a veri wise decis one can take , in order to prevent futur problem . also travel on bicycl , one can do cycl exercis everyday which is alway good for one 's health . i think that it is smart decis , if taken by our govrnment can prove tremend use well on which govern is alreadi think . and be a ` step stone ' to prevent hazard problem . and with thi think and implic in futur definit i think that there be reduct in privat vehicl especi the car in next twenti year .
