how mani car there will be in the futur ? it 's imposs to know , but we could think about differ ipotet solut . for exampl if the petroil will be less in the futur probabl an effect reduct of car could be there in the next twenti year . but mayb a new scientif solut will be find , and a new engin like oxigen or hydrogen could be empli for replac the petroil . in my opinion i think car will not decreas in the futur . whi ? it is veri simpl , everi year there is an esponenti growth of peopl in the world . what doe thi mean ? onli one thing , more peopl more car . i think at thi time , everi famili ha one car for each familiy 's member more or less . for exampl my famili is compos by 4 person , me , my brother and my parent . me with my mother drive the same car , my father ha two car , my father 's compani give him one , the second car he buy for sparetim . my brother ha a car and also a motocycl . at the end there are 4 car in my famili how we are . how i could think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use there are today ? it 's imposs . the onli solut , it is enlarg the public commun system , for exampl put in the citi 's road more bu or tram than now , or increas the railway servic , built underground system in the big citi . to support thi solut is necessari also an other factor : make cheaper than now the public servic . until now if i use my car is cheaper than buy a railway ticket . everi year the ticket is more expens . whi doe it happen ? the govern shoul make easier to use public servic not harder , also for a differ reason : decreas the pollut of environ , use in the best way the natur 's energi and doe n't wast them becaus veri soon can be end . for all of these reason , i think is necessari a larg dose of good intent to make possibl the statement : fewer car in the futur . everyon must to do someth to built thi dream !
