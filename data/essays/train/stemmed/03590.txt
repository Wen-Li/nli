today 's youth is a busi and stress one . too busi to interact with their commun and their surround . young peopl have respons such as school and afterschool activ as well as the desir to have a social life . it is becaus of these element that i agre that young peopl nowaday to not give enough time to help their commun . as a highschool 12th grader , i must admitt that the mayor of peopl my age to not have time to help their commun . school is a hectic respons and homework is increas throughout the year . when i have time off , i need to work on futur homework assign or on organ my time for the other respons that i have priorit as more import than my commun . anoth element in young peopl live that take away from help the commun , is afterschool activ . as an avarag highschool student , i take swim class afterschool or help the student council set up school event . if i am not work for the school or for my physic be , than i am in town practis for my sat . i spend most of my weekday worri about my grade and my repons as a grade repres , than wonder what i could do to help the commun . onc school and afterschool event are over , i use my weekend to relax and go out with my friend . young peopl nowaday do n't realli care about the commun and rather worri about their own problem . if you ask young peopl what they find most import you will realiz that their answer is selfish , in that it onli think about themselv , becaus they onli have time to worri about themselv . in conclus , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun out but , it is onli becaus we lack the time to do someth about it . if our live were more organ and less occuppi , perhap an interest in help our commun would surfac .
