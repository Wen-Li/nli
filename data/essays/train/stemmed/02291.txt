would you like to studi broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one specif subject ? i believ differ peopl have differ answer . howev , i prefer to studi broad knowledg for sever reason below . first , in fact , mani student do not konw what they are realli interest in . as we know , nowaday , mani student have a same problem that they do not like their major . whi dose thi problem happen ? i believ that it is result from that they are not interest in their major . if they can studi broad knowledg of mani academ subject , they would find out that what they are realli interest in . thi is veri import . actual , i have thi problem , too . my major is materi scienc . and i can not studi other subject in my univers . howev , i do not like my major , becaus i can not find out ani interest thing from thi major . everi day i have to do experi in my lab , which is bore . in fact , i want to learn some subject that i could commun with other peopl . i believ if i have anoth choic , i would not choos thi major again . as a result , i choos anoth major when i studi for my mater degre now . second , in modern societi , most of job requir student have mani skill , instead of a certain skill . as we know , when peopl work in a compani , he ha to know how to use comput , becaus today most of work are finish on comput , and the commun with other thoughout email or msn also need to be done on comput . if thi person onli know about hi major , such mathmet , art , or someth els , i do not believ that he would have a capabl for thi work . that is to say , he would be fire in futur . i believ thi is a piti for our educ in universit . consequ , we should learn broad knowledg of mani academ subject to fill the variou requir of mani job . if we have kind of knowledg , we could do mani job in a compani , and we have more chanc to get promoto . for exampl , if we learn knowledg about engeer and manag in univers , we could appli for two type of job in a compani , which would be veri use for our career in the futur . howev , to learn broad knowledg of mani academ subject doe mean that it is unnecessari to special in one specif subject . what i mean is that we should also be profession expert , becaus when we face with some difficulti in our work , we must have academ knowledg to address them . thi is of great essenc to us . in sum , we should learn broad knowledg in the first place , and then we also have to special in one specif subject .
