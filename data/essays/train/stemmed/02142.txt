there are sever reason whi i agre with the propos statement . first of all , becaus the abil to understand the esenc of the inform provid in school will give the student the possibl to appli that knowledg to as mani situat as they have to face in the futur . meanwhil , know fact will just provid them a mountaion of rare use inform . in fact , the comprehens of the idea and concept should be teacher ' primari concern . learn fact can be use for life , but much greater is the import of understand of whi those fact happen . dure the practic of my profess i can rememb a larg number of opportun in which i took the exampl and explan given by univers professor . even when at the moment of learn the i did n't give them the import that they deserv , eventu they turn out to be valuabl asset for my career . probabl , that is whi some good advic will never be fogotten and will possibl be appli to mani up come experi and situat . person , i find veri difficult find the esenc of thing . mostli i chose the wrong way to solv problem of my life and profess . actual , that can be the main reason whi i have n't gotten to the top yet . usual the most import leader are those that possess bright mind , so bright that they get to see thing in a differ way the normal peopl do . in other word , they are abl to see the most import aspect of the issu they are face , while the rest of the peopl just get to see matter that surround the most importan point . i think that i will probabl spend the rest of my day tri to understand the idea and concept with which i have to deal in both , my life and my career . in short , i will alway recommend young student to learn and understand the concept and idea they have to studi , otherwis they will have just a great amount of useless inform .
