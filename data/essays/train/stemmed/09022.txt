i strongli agre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun becaus i have observ that nowaday everybodi is occupi with her or himself . for exampl last month i had a terrif accid and i wa not abl to attend my class so i wa depend on the help hand of my classmat . but although they recogn my absenc knowbodi wa will to help me with my homework . that wa an hardtim experi for me . thu , i have mani friend i felt so alon . anoth good exampl is the behav toward older peopl . i sometim sit in and overcrow bu and an old woman is come in but nobodi besid me want to stand up and offer the woman hi or her seat . that make me sad . or help old peopl with their housework would be a good possibl to pay attent to them but nobodi ha time to do thi becaus of a full activ plan . to my opinion everi person should treat the other person like he himself want to be treatend by someon els . that mean when you are observ that your neighbour need help then do not hesit to help him becaus next time probabili you will need hi help . the most import thing to me are the peopl who suround me for exampl my parent , fri and neighbour . and therefor i alway tri to keep my eye open and help them when they are in need becaus i now know how it feel to be without help . for me it is also clear that i would help oder older peopl in ani occas becaus when i am old i need the other help to . to sum it all up i strongli believ that young peopl should chang their attitud toward other peopl by spend more attent to the need of other peopl . so that they will chang from selfish young peopl to one who pay attentin to their friend , neighbour and to all other peopl .
