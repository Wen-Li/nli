some peopl would like to travel by themselev , while other prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid . of cours , there are some benefit of each side ; howev i would like to travel by myself especailli when i have a long trip so i do n't agre with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . becaus it ha no pravici and inconveni . first , i would like mention that the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid is actual not becaus of it invonveni . sever year ago , i went to austarila for travel by myself . i visit so mani famou place in big citi and also went to non-fam area in such small town . bascial i could go wherev i want to go and do whatev i want to do . due to the fact that i do n't need to think about the schedul of tour guid . if i wa in a group led by a tour guid , i had to follow the schedul . besid , someth that i want to visit or do may not be part of the tour . second , the best way to travel is not good becaus i do n't have much free time and pravici . for instanc , when i visit a certain place that i may want to spend more time . if you travel in a group , there is less free time and pravici . in addit to , you will have to follow the rest of your group in conculs , if you want to travel in freeli whatev you would like to do and visit without concern the tour schecul or time , in my opinion , the best way to travel in group led by a tour guid is not good . sinc we wo n't get much free time , pravici and tour in a group is inconveni so i would rather have a trip alon eventhough there are a few advantag of group tour .
