learn is a natur process that everybodi own , most of children go to school and start learn veri earli . the point is , do they realli know what they are do or do they just learn without understand ? we will see what is the most import for a student , learn fact or understand idea and concept ? in my opinion , we can not separ those two part one from each other . it is imposs to understand a theori or a process if we do not know the underli element ( the fact ) . i would say that both part of the statement must be given an equal import . it is the basi of the knowledg that to learn fact and use them in variou situat ( talk , lectur or project ) . otherwis we would not be abl to speak or commun to each other . thi is our gener knowledg . in the other hand , you learn fact or lesson by heart , it is often not veri useful , becaus a few day later it is almost imposs to rememb everyth we learn . for exampl , for my a level in franc ( baccalaureat ) i had to learn by heart map of europ or usa describ either popul or exchang etc . the month after i wa not abl do draw it again becaus it came out of my mind . i agre that sometim it is useless to learn fact . precis in the case if we know we will not practic what we learn anymor . regard understand of idea or concept , thi is a veri import process for a student . that is how peopl acquir a specif state of mind , and with practic thing can be understood faster and faster . the purpos of an idea is to be well understood and thi idea ha no reason to exist if not so . therefor i would give a special import to the understand of concept and idea too .
