i 'm go to have to agre with that statement with most case around the globe , but the attent that young peopl give to their commun reli mostli on their cultur . in the western world , in countri in europ and north america mostli , the notion of `` duti '' and `` honor '' have almost entir disapear from young peopl conscienc , parent are not teach their children to love and defend the communit they 've grow in and there is no misteri about whi young peopl don'i contribut much time , that when children are go to turn into teenag , then young adult they wo n't give much about what happen in their commun . today `` commun servic '' in the west is a form of punish for the minor who draw on wall , sell drug , steel or commit other violat of the law . take for an exampl the number of young peopl who would go to a rap a concert where they are encourag to consum drug and told to sleep with prostitut , and compar that number to that of the young volount who want to help the catrina or 9/11 victim for exampl . in other part of the world , or in `` the third world '' as the western call them , young peopl still care about their comun and countri much more to dirti music , we can see a much diffrent atmospher . take the last war israel wage on lebanon and the countless young men and women who volount to help the red cross or other humanitarian organis in order to help the civilian victim who might 've surviv the isra raid . when you see young one still helpingthat much their comun , you ca n't say that everi where young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . to conclud , we can say that wether the young one help their commun enough or not depend primarili on the cultur of the concern countri or commun .
