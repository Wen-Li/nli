i disagre with the statement that young pepol nowaday do not give enough time to helpl teir commun . there are two reason . one is the recogn of the import of volunt in disast and the other is prepar for age societi . first , the import of volunt have been recogn among young peopl recent . for exampl , strong earthquak hit the hanshin and awazi area in 1995 . tv news show broadcast the situat and mani young peopl shoke with the situat of the area . at that time , mani young volunt went to those area and work for the commun . tv news show also broadcast those young volunt . as a result , mani young peopl have realiz the import of work for the societi . so mani young peopl have start to think about the commun in emerg sinc the disast . second , popul in japan is age veri rapidli and also infer more and more in the futur . even now there are mani older peopl in japan , it is also estim that about one third of the japanes popul will be the peopl over age 65 in 2050 . some older peopl are healthi , but some are not . unhealthi older peopl usuali need help to do their daili work . so mani young peopl nowaday think that they must work for the older peopl . for exampl , nurs home insur system ha been introduc in japan in 2000 . peopl have thought about help onli their parent befor . but age of societi caus peopl to think not onli their parent but also mani older peopl in their commun . thi made the japanes govern introduc that system . in the system , mani young pepol are take part of help the older peopl in the commun . so mani young peopl are concern with help them . for these reason , i disagre with the statement that young pepol nowaday do not give enough time to helpl teir commun .
