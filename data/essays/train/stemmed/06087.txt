advertis ha been increas a lot dure the last 30 year . doest it work or is it just an illus ? know how much money compani are will to put in advertis i have to say it must work . now there is some more reason way of respond to the question . we coud talk about packag fo instanc . between to product that offer the same thing , that are at the same price , i would rather choos the best look one . for me the product aspect reflect it real qualiti . in thi case the true problem is comparison . i do n't think you make a product seem better than it realli is , the point is make the product seem better as the other product ! i think thi is realli work . there is anoth way of advertis a product : get the buyer to know the product befor he even get to buy it : advertis in magazin , televis . .. in my mind thi may be more effici becaus the buyer wo n't necessarili compar the product to the other one . he will just get in the store and search for that exact product becaus he ha been told it is the best . in thi case it is true that advertis is use to make the product seem better than it realli is . now is it realli work ? it depend on the price of the product . if you buy onli onc someth realli expens you will realli look into advertis becaus you ca n't predict the qualiti of the product with previou one . now if it 's a cheap product that you buy everi week , i think advertis ha no influenc except the first time . in fact buy the same product lot of time abl you to compar the real qualiti of the product .
