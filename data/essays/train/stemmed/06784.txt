is that possibl determin a period of life for enjoy life ? do young peopl enjoy life more than the older one ? i biliev enjoy life is a metter of state of mind . whi ? i met a lot of young peopl who were onli concern about the futur without live the present , in other word young peopl not appli the `` carp diem '' philosophi , and i know what i 'm state becaus i 'm one of them . we carri about the futur problem that may can not even occur , we do n't have time for noth that 's not correl to studi achiev good mark and work . and as i state , from my experinc these behaviour are incriseangli common . now , what can be said about matur and more savi peopl ? they are often not so young and the have learn a lot from the difficulti of life . from that , these `` light mind '' can realli understand what is realli import in life and what worth to be worri about . as a result , by use thi knowledg and life experi thi peopl can alloc energi and time to readili come up with good solut for the problem the encount . for exampl , an experienc manag see hi stock go down doe n't get too much worri becaus he know that 's part of the game and he will be like to wait for better to time to sell hi stock . probabl he will play golf and enjoy hi time while the younger are desper think about how they 'll manag to get rid of immin loss . in sum , in my opinion enjoy life it is for sure not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind , and it depend on matur and have a good vision of life . pleas be optimist ! pleas enjoy !
