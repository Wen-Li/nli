peopl can be success in mani field such as art , sport , or studi . in my opinion , success peopl have enthusiasm that lead them to tri and achiev someth that seem challeng while other are just be lazi . as if there is a say , '' no pain , no gain . '' . first of all , i would like to say that peopl who are success are challeng take risk . in my countri , there wa a famou swimmer . he wa veri famou , especi when he wa young . he use to take all of the medal from the competit and wa consid as the best swimmer in my countri . he wa veri eager to tri the father distanc to swim . after he retir , despit hi age ( 40 ) he tri to swim across the river in korea . the river wa the biggest in seoul , and the everi scene were be air on tv . even though he look veri hard , peopl could see that he would success to swim across the river . after the success , he tri anoth river and also to the island near the mainland . actual , after that , he fail by tire and long distanc , but he kept tri to achiev hi goal with hi challen spirit . secondli , success peopl have common in their willng . what i mean by that is that peopl who are success have strong will . there is a singer who is veri famou in korea and asia . when i saw him first , he wa ugli . mani peopl thought that he would probabl not be popular and quit the job as a singer . but hi capabl to danc and sing wa so amaz that peopl were surpriz . after get popular , he had lot of interview and he use to say that even if he is ugli , he promis himself that he would success as a singer by hi talent . now he is a attract and talent singer in asia . he never gave up and strive to becom a singer despit the peopl around him who use to oppos him to becom a singer . in a conclus , success peopl have their strong will and challen spriti in common as explain abov . even if peopl know how to do someth well , if they just lose their enthusiasm , it wo n't certainli lead to a success . peopl need to take the strong will befor give up .
