there are sever advantag and disadvantag on thi topic . some peopl think that you can onli have success when you take risk , on the other hand there are a lot of peopl who do n't think like they do . one of the advantag can be that you gain experi of tri someth new . you can not talk about it when you never made the experi . for exampl the last time i went to a restaur and order lobster . i have never had lobster befor , and i wa afraid that the lobster would not be good . but it wa not just good , it wa great ! furthermor , there are also disadvantag of be riski all the time . when you tri out new thing it can also happen that you get dissapoint . for exampl when you buy a movi on dvd that you have never seen . after watch it you mayb regret your decis in buy thi movi . but there are also advantag of do `` alreadi known '' thing . no surpris , no catch , no string . la quinta for exampl , a well known hotel in the southern state of america , make commerci advertis with thi statement . so you know what the hotel is go to do to make your stay there as much comfort as they can . on the other hand there is also the disadvantag that you can not develop yourself by tri out new thing . though , you alway stay on the same level . from thi , i think there is not onli one way to go . sometim you have to be spontan and tri new thing out , but it 's not alway necessari . in my opinion , the best thing is to find a mixtur between these two statement . i think that the `` middl way '' is alway the best , do n't go for extrem .
