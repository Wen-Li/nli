i agre that it 's import for stydent to understan idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there is sever reason for that . we do n't have to learn fact . becaus we can find fact and know it form internet or book or televis . and these day rather than know fact , understand idea and concept is more import . what is mean learn fact . it mean just know the mean of scientif phenomenon . historuc truth . thi is knowlodg not can be wisdom or real mean of studi . now day , we can improv our knowledg about the most of thing from the internet or book or televis . mayb long time age learn fact might be import . becaus at that time it wa hard to get inform . forexampl hard to get book and more hard to read book . onli few class can read an wrote . so sometim the peopl had a lot of inform and knowledg could get respect from other . howev , today is diffir . as i mention befor . knowledg is just knowledg . inform is no more valuabl . caus everi one can access to inform and use that . so now they we should put more valu to understand idea and concept . then what is understand of idea and concept . if we understand the idea and concept it 's not onli mean know the fact but also mean the ablilti to adjust the idea and use it properli and practic in our life . understnad idea and concept can directrli connect with our daili life . so i can say understand idea and concept are more importhat than lear fact . base on fact we alreadi know and learnd understand it is more higher level of lear . also thi ablilti is just what we want to improv in these day and sea of inform . so these two are the main reason that whi i think that understand idea and concept is more import than just learn fact . one is fact that usual we call inform is now easi to access rather than ani time of human histori . so just have inform is not necessari . and second , understand idea and concept is more preciou becau it can adjust in real life .
