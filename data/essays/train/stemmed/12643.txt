to answer thi question , i will organ in two part . the first part will explain who i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , and ( even if i 'm not so old ) the second part will explain how i think older peopl can appreci life more than younger . we all rememb the first time , the first time we made love , the first time we went to highschool , the first time we smoke a cigarett . i think thi is one of the reason we might say younger can appreci life in a more intens way than the older , just becaus everyth they do is knew . teenag is the period where you hqve lot of experi , it 's an adventur , you discov all the time . i rememb my teenag . it wa kind of amaz and i think i would never be abl to experi the same feel i 've experienc dure thi period . i wa alway go to parti , when i wa 15 me and my freind would go to night club and everyth ha a import impact on me becaus it wa knew . an other argument is that young peopl have no repons : they do n't have money problem , or job problem or even children problem , there parent take care of everyth so they do n't have to worri about all those thing that make life difficult . but in contradict with all that i said befor , i would point that mayb older peopl are abl to enjoy life in a better way . adult have a larger experi witch give them a knoweledg young peopl do n't have . have thi experi they can appreci thing young peopl woud n't even care about . it 's hard for me to give exempl becaus i do n't consid myself as an complet adult . but mayb adult can enjoy veri infim thing like a good glass of an old wiskey for exempl . one day a professor told me : the more you know , the more you like . i think old peopl , as they know more about life , can enjoy it even more . on more point is that young peopl do n't have the time to establish import project . what is life about after all ? i think life is about be happi and make such as wonderful thing as children . adult have the oppurun to live thi kind of wonderful project . they have the opportun to make plan . the plan of creat a societi , the plan of creat a famili .
