now i am at the later of 20 . combin my own experi and borrow experi of my friend in china , i tend to disagre with the statement . in my point of view , both young and the older peopl know the import of enjoy life , howev , young peopl are differ from the older one in how frequenc , what and whi to enjoy life . to start with , mostli young peopl enjoy life in a differ pace from the older one . i think thi is one of the factor that mislead other believ that young guy are enjoy life more than the older one . dure weekend or typic vacat season , we can easili find young men or women emerg almost everi corner of trendi entertain place , rang from hot scenic spot to cute bar in the town . on the contrari , older peopl are rare found . howev , we have to understand more behind that . these occass are the best time for the young guy to go out sinc normal dure the weekday , they have to spend time in the offic from 800am to late as 800pm . it should be more fair to conclud if we consid that it wa also the young peopl who spent most of time dure the weekday to work overtim . secondli , young peopl enjoy life in a varieti of form which are quit differ from the older one . activ such as read , play card or majiang ( a tradit chines game ) , or watch tv program are favorit one for older peopl . howev , nowaday , young peopl have differ fun to enjoy . they enjoy to have activ in a more live and trendi form such as fit exercis , hike , drink and share with friend in the bar . sinc those trendi activ are more public , it is easi to conclud that young peopl enjoy life more than the older one . lastli , it is the differ view toward life that determin the varianc between young peop and older one when they enjoy life . contrari to older peopl who more often view life and work are seamless connect in china , youngster will treat life and work separ . they understand that work is disconnect from life . in some extent , a happi life is the basi for a success work . therefor , it is critic to enjoy life to full when off work while to concentr on work vice versa .
