i am not realli agre with the question . in a first view it is true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . they take all their life with a smile on their face , they are happi for all think also for a stupid think . young peopl have not a problem , they depend of their famili , their parent , they are `` on the cloud '' . young peopl enjoy themselv with the major stupid think , for exampl i have a brother that is 20 year old and he with him frind laught for all think , they enjoy with videogam , they spend all day play footbal or goo away . but the differ about the older peopl is not that the older peopl do not enjoy life , they also enjoy life but in a differ way . older peopl have a big think to resolv , they have a respons of their home , they must pay the telefon , they must cook the dinner also for their children that could be outsid play with their friend . older peopl have less time than the young peopl have . they have all day full , they can not enjoy life if not dure week_end and also they have a differ way to enjoy their life . when you are old , after 22 year old , you look to life in a differ way than when you were 16 year old . you have a differ way to enjoy life . for exampl now i am 23 year old and i like to do differ think from 5 year ago . i enjoy my life go to mountain and look with my boyfriend the landscap or to go to eat , in a famou restaur , some good fish drink a good vine . so i think that it is not true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , i think that cahng the way in which young peopl and the other do that .
