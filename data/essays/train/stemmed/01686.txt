thi topic ha a two way answer . mankind ha alway 's been known to thrive abov ani speci . man ha alway been the domin factor in thi life . when a man is success , he could have anyth he want . some peopl are afraid when it come to take risk 's , becaus it might jeapordis their current financi posit . some success peopl like to tri new thing 's becaus it would be an adventur , it would be fun and it might just ` work ' . a person should onli take the risk if he feel that he is one hundr percent sure that it fool proof , by say thi word i am contradict the word ` risk ' , which is whi a person can never be too care . although take a risk may seem breath-tak , it sometim is devest , one small risk could send a person down in flame 's , send him to the abyss if he is not too care . if i were a success person i would like to experi , take my chanc , live life while im still aliv , embrac failur as i would success . although disagre with the statement would sound more reason , i 'd like to agre with it , a time will come when a person is go to have to take a risk , be it a big one or a small one .
