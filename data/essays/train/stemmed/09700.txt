to my mind , it is more import to understand concept and idea than to learn fact . i think it make student more intellig by give them the opportun to developp their way of think . learn fact is use for individu memori . it help to develop one 's memori by learn by heart fact , that is whi kid learn a lot of song and poem by heart . learn fact is also use for collect memori . for instanc , student learn histori to tri not to repeat the same mistak as in the past such as the world war . understand idea and concept make the student understand a way of think and a way to see the world . it can also help him to understand whi the world is as it is . for exampl , understand what american live on the 9/11 and thought after can help to understand the present polici of the unit state . furthermor , understand idea and concept make the student abl to develop hi own think in order to undertstand other idea and concept . for exampl , if a student understand mechan of fluid , he will be abl to understand modelis of traffic becaus both subject are base on the same theori . some univers seem to think like me , give right to all book and paper dure their test but ask for a lot of explan about concept and idea and relationship betw for all these reason , understand concept and idea is the most import for student .
