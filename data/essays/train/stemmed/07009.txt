the variou educ system all over the world permit student to special more or less late . that lead to a tricki issu : is it better to special earli in the studi or later ? i disagre with peopl who think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special . it is true that it is necessari to have knowledg in sever topic befor special . for instanc , children have to learn about geographi , histori , biolog , math . .. thi permit tu realiz what we like to studi and what we would like to do to work . but , i am convinc that in order to be effici in the work , we have to know specif thing in one specif area . for instanc , i made an internship in a hospit last year in the area of financ . so as to understand the reason whi some medicin have been bought more that year , i had to ask to nurseri . the latter knew the use of these medicin . but on the contrari i knew about budget and account . so , as it is imposs to learn about everyth , we have tu special in one field . and , in the compani , work with the cooper of the other member of the staff is necessari to work with effici . nevertheless , special in one subject do nor prevent us from be interest in other subject . but it is uneccessari to have a high level of knowledg in these field , it can be just for leisur . besid , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject contain a risk . as a matter of fact , i tend to think that it prevent us from have a high level of knowledg in all these area . consequ , we would be less good at our work . so , i bare in mind that it is better to special in one subject rather than in mani subject .
