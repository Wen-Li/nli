although i understand peopl who think that young peopl nowaday do not spend enough time on help their commun my experi led me to disagre with thi statement . nevertheless , there are reason to believ that thi statement is true . young peopl nowadi are often afraid of remain jobless after finish univers . as a result they spend all their time on prepar themselv for their profession life . for exampl , most of my fellow student spend a lot of time on make internship , so there is no time left to voluntarili particip commun activ . further more the peopl in our societi are get older and older wherea the govern ha less money to spend on social servic . consequ , there is a need for young peopl who give time to help their commun , especi in home for the elderli . on the other hand give time to help the commun where you live in , can howev be import for your profession life . in spite of the fact that you are not deal with the topic of your studi while work , for exampl , in home for the elderli it might make a good impress of your social engagem if you appli for a scholarship . a lot of student know thi and therefor it is often the case that student engag voluntarili in commun project . furthermor there are a lot of peopl in my social environ who are realli interest in polit and the develop of our societi . as a result they particip in local polit project or in one of the exist polit parti , which mean that they also give time to their commun . in view of the fact that i know a lot of young peopl who engag in their commun my conlus is that it is not true that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun .
