i think ye ... the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do for exampl : the young peopl can go to a footbal match everyday and play as long as he want to if he is healthi sure . . but the old man cant go everyday mayb onc in a week cauz he is too old and he cant run . .. and i think is the old man is busi with wriseng he child and be a good father like pute he child in the most famou school and that ofcours need money soo he will alway tri to get the best job to get money for he child and he home , and that ofcours dont leav time to hem to enjoy he life and see the beautiful thing in it . . except the weekend and mayb at the week end he will be tire from he work and he will sleep and lay-down for whole day . . but there are some young peopl who enjoy there time by drug and drink and that ofcours is not an enjoy time for us . .. and i think that is the old peopl who spend there time at work or anyth els are more enjoy from them that in my opinion . .. and i think is the young peopl will tri to do everyth new in their life otherwis the old man had finish do he new thing when he wa a young man and ofcours he will be bor from everythinig . . but i want to say that not everi young man is enjoy he life more than the old man do . ..
