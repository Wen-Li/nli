i am in favour of the argument that over the next twenti year the amount of car in use will be decreas . even though larg part of the world 's popul will increas their mobil through econom growth , the neg impact of car will outweigh thi natur growth potenti . for exampl if china 's and india 's econom growth allow peopl to buy more car , govern in both countri will need to react quickli to avoid the advers effect of increas individu mobil . firstli , ecolog it will not be possibl to continu use as mani car as today in the futur . our environ is alreadi suffer strongli from pollut caus by car . for exampl breath and skin problem occur more often on peopl live in citi centr locat than on the countri side . furthermor our cultur heritag is endang by car pollut as exhaust is attack architectur work . secondli , econom it is not intellig to count on individualis transport mean . increas congest lead to larg loss for an economi . a lot of peopl stuck in their car are not work and loos time to contribut to growth of gdp . first step to integr the cost of thi time loss have been taken in london and singapur by introduc a congest charg in citi centr . therefor , in futur it will be more expens to use car than to use public transport . thirdli , most car requir petrol or oil for their engin . consid that the exploit world oil reserv are not increas anymor , oil will becom more and more expens , make car drive a luxuri . furthermor as larg amount of oil reserv are locat in the middl east or in polit unstabl countri such as venezuela it is becom increasingli danger for societi to reli on oil as the engin of their transport mean . thi is possibl the strongest argument to move to other tranport mean than car as we know them . in conclus , the trend laid out abov are provid enough inform to suggest that there will be less car in use twenti year from now .
