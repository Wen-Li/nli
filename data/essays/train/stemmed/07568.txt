talk about the futur is alway a veri difficult thing to do . so to decid wheter there will be fewer car in use in twenti year one ha to discuss sever aspect that may influenc thi gestur . fir step , there is the definit of car . if car have to have an engin that use fossial sourc , i am sure that there will be fewer car in the futur , even when talk about such a short point in the futur as twenti year . if also other sort of power a car are within thi definit i will need some more step . second step is the aspect of popul . up to now the grow of the world 's popul is said to maintain the way it doe . if that will still be true in twenti year we will definit have fewer car . as an exampl take vienna , the citi i live in . road and car , and park space need that much space in the citi , that the space for hous and peopl walk is limit . so if there are more peopl , i suppos they will need more space , and therefor thi space ha to be gain by abolish , or at least deminu road . third step is to think of other sort of transport and their progress . underground are alreadi part of almost all big citi and their posit influenc is obviou . if there is no neg trend , think of secur within public place , caus by sustain terror threat , thi mean of transport will have it effect to decreas the number of car . train also may becom much more import than they are today . i suppos thi sinc i think of the grow size of the suborb . more peopl need more space , which result in longer distanc to the work place , which have to be pass by faster . so if technolog mangag to control higher speed and can ensur thi by a higher secur standard , train will overtak the car 's function for take peopl from and to their work place . so as an conclus i suppos that in twenti there will be fever car than there are today , sinc at least on of the aspect abov will becom true .
