while it is alway difficult to make such strong claim and there are for sure some except , i overal agre with the statement . we are live today in a much more individualist societi than twenti year ago . i believ that the underli reason is mainli econom . decad ago young student could aim for fairli reason job and access to decent hous without care too much about their career . the situat is veri difer today . the list of requir of access a good univers , and ultim a good job , is endless : languag , experi abroad , extra-scholar activ relat to your field , good grade to pass the increasingli select filter , a renow mba , etc . competit is get harder and student have littl time left els than for care plan their curriculum and career in order to outperform their peer . when i wa a student , i for exampl ad to my morn class at the univers extra daili class in german and french , and use my summer break to travel abroad to hone my fluenci in these and other languag . i had obtain the degre of camp counselor and use it a coupl of time in camp with less afluent children . it wa veri reward from a person perspect , but i decid to focu on my languag skill . now with perspect , i wish i had help more . i know that the situat is chang now and present extracurricular social activit may repres valuabl earn point in the select process at some univers and even with some employ . these experi are a way of distinguish the individu from the rest and stress hi or her person valu . i believ that govern should encourag social activit by propos altern which let student help the commun while reinforc their curriculum . as for exampl exchang program where young peopl could help local commun abroad , honikng their languag skill and at the same time fulfil their wish to help out . i know now that these possibl exist , but the role of institut is to promot them . should i have know about them , i had not wast the opportun !
