peopl have their own idea about whether travel alon is better than travel by a tour guid or not . in my opinion , the best way to travel is by alon in that it can be free to tour place and easili make new firend in the new place . first , travel alon enbl us to feel free to move on tour site . some peopl may think that move new place alon is danger becaus we do not know about the place . in my opinion , howev , travel alon can benefit us to have more chanc to see sight see . for exampl , if i tour with other peopl on schedul , i can not see museum and church that i want to visit exept determin site . then i do not feel satisfi with the tour . in thi way , i can say that travel along give us more chanc to visit than travel in a group . second , when it come to make new friend , move alon greatli contribut to make it possibl . it is gener agre that travel in a group is difficult to make new peopl as they have to move schedul the sighte site . howev , when we are free we can meet other peopl that may be travel peopl or local resid . if they are resid , we can get more detail inform on the place . it will be more help to take a trip alon than travel in a group led by a tour guid . to sum up , travel alon is better way to trevel in a group by a tour guid in that we can have more chanc to visit freeli favorit place and meet new friend who can give use inform about the new place . all thing consid , i can definit say that travel in a group led by a tour guid is not the best way as the advanteg of travel alon mention abov .
