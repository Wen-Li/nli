i disagre the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i will prove it in sever exampl below . there is a larg amount of car now and so mani car compani produc the car for bus . if there will be fewer car use in twenti year , the car compani will encount the disast that thousand of car work will lose the jop . what the societi can suffer the million of work who lose the jop walk into govern hall to fight . secondli the mani famou compani such as ford will bankrupt , in econom aspect , if so mani big compani bankrupt , the wealth the compani make for the societi will delin . thi may caus the product to rise their amount that mani low payment worker can not aford to buy the daliy product . more peopl will suffer the pain . on the oher hand compani will resarch the technolog to decreas the pollut of car instead of desdroy them . in the scientif aspect , scientist will satisfi the deman of envion pollut by chang the ga we use to someth like electr batteri or product which produc no pollut . though it is a hard work for the compani and scientist to do , we believ the car without pollut will make the dream come true in a few year later and car are not decreas , and even more peopl will buy the new scientif car to drive . despit the mani car compani exist , the larg number of worker can keep the jop and economi will rise becus the worker who get jop buy good . at the same time other industri will rise due to the demand of car element such like , iron . the societi benefit the car and will not let the car decreas .
