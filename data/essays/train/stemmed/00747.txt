i agre the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are lot of product that peopl can see or buy in the market . but the advertis want to make money , so they just make the product seem much better to make peopl wo n't know it good or bad insid . for exampl , the littl boy in the cadi shop , he would like to have a big color cadi but not the no color one . becaus the color one seem better then anoth one . it doesnt mean that the color one test better then the other . but the littl boy chose the color one so the colo one win anyway . i believ that 's whi advertis make product look good then peopl would buy it and they can make money . and usual the thing which look good outsid it cost more expencin then the thing which look ugli , but the expenc one may not realli use then the cheaper one . anoth exampl , i think that peopl alway choos the thing that look good but they dont realli care what is realli insid of the product so that whi the advertis keep make thing like onli have outsid . so when peopl chose the thing we shoul read the manul care befor we buy it . there are the exampl of whi i think most advertis make product seem much better then they realli are . i think now day is imposs to chose the thing that not onli look good but also use .
