student have a number of way to learn nowaday . person , it is much better when i studi a topic or a passag understand the main idea . i believ that grasp idea and concept rather than fact is the best way to suce . learn fact are veri hard keep becasu you could forget them over time , understand concept is valuabl when you are in differ topic or environ , and final student skill could be enhanc . it could be veri valuabl to studi date or name of event for exampl . they could help you answer the question of your test of histori . but you could forget it after few day . while understand the concept could help for a long time . for exampl , understand whi the a battl start , what were the condit after the battl finish , and son on . it could be in your brain longer than learn fact . undestand concept could be valuabl when you are studi a differ topic . for exampl , the battl could help you to understand the econom situat of peopl or the geograph situat after the conflict . on the other hand , if you just learn the date or name of the peopl who fought in the even , mayb you have to studi aga for your busi or your geographi class . student could develop better skill if the learn concept and idea . they could argu for exampl , whi the battl happen , or even learn that war conflict are not the best way to thrive . they could even interest and pursu a carer in histori . i think learn concept and idea from a topic , give you mani opportun fot your futur life . for all these reason , i support the statement that student should learn idea and concept rather that fact . it impriv their skill , help them to other subject and enhanc their skill .
