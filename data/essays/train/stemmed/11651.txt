in our societi , young peopl tend not to spend a lot of time help their commun , and that is due to the societi in which we live . inde , we observ at the moment a sort of individu , which is express by the fact that peopl tend to live by themselv without take care of their neighbour , act like sheep . young peopl use to care for other peopl , but that wa what the societi told them to do . nowaday , the matter is not that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun , it is just that they do not have time to do so sinc our societi is base on work and money . how could it be possibl for young peopl to care for commun when they have bare time to take care of themselv . it is true that more and more young peopl live their live accord to their person need , which is kind of hypocrit in a way , but one ha to admit that our societi doe not help young peopl veri much . on one hand , studi is becom more and more expens . if you are courag enough to make your dream come true , you can tri to find a job in order to financ your studi , but thi doe not seem normal . on the other hand , you have some countri where studi are paid by the govern , as it is the case in denmark for instanc . in scandinavia , one can notic that peopl and especi young peopl care for other , take part into help commun . in brief , they are deepli involv in their societi , will to help in order to make thing go better . in a nutshel , i would say that the young peopl 's invest in their commun is close relat to the societi they live in . if young peopl have to bear adult ' role in life when they are not adult yet , i do not see how possibl it is for them to get involv in their commun .
