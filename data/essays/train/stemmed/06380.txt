as the famou say goe ` jack of all trade and master of none' i believ if one day my mom tri to make cooki with the method of make cake , pud , ice-cream etc. all togeth it would tast rather ridicul . tri and imagin a person wear a white shirt entir cover with circl of red , green , purpl and blue . iam sure it remind of a clown . on the other hand imagin a persson with white shirt and tini scatter red and blue squar ; look assum . similarli if a person ha broad knowledg of mani academ subject and no deep knowledg in ani specif of them then it could not be put to ani specif use ; and if tri to use in some way would actual spoil thing . consid an exampl wherein the teacher of histori in the lectur while explain about civil war start relat it opera it would rather lead to a rather useless junk of thought in the student mind . in order to be abl to appli the knowledg one ha gain to some practic use deeper knowledg regard the same is requir . thi is neccesari in oredr to ensur that what we do will be flawless . a student to stand up strongli in futur is no doubt ha to be vers with everyth under the sun . but the depth of such knowledg ha to be limit and wherea knowledg in one particular area ha to be realli strong . now is wan era wherein the complex in variou fieldf is increas ten fold and so is the avanc . to keep pace with both of them what is neccesari is specialis . it ha been observ for thi matter that post-gradu and more precis doctor are in graeater demand in profession world than are mere graduat . thi is due to the fact that they definet hold more depper , more preics and absolut flawless knowledg in order to be aplli directli . also the apllic point of view for their field is more clear thu , although one should have knowledg about what is go around and what in , it is also essenti that he is abl to get the deeepest possibl knowledg in a particular field and appli the same in oredr to stand up strongli and more confid in the profession world .
