i do agre with the statement , in fact the most part of the advertis we are use to see show onli perfect product , for instanc : wornder hair when present a shampoo , absolut slim dancer when promot a diet pill . .. thi are onli a coupl of exampl , but everyon of us have been upset at least onc look at the mirror and see that after one month use the ecxept mussels-stimul saw at ( and bought from ) the televis , he still doe n't look like jean claud van damm . thi mean that the exampl of how differ are the real product from what is present in the advertis , can easili be collect from everyon 's everyday life . nevertheless , i do n't feel the need to critic thi featur of market itself : obvious it might illud peopl about the effect of a product while it may not be as effect as that , but as long as no one is phisic forc to buy the product , i do consid thi one as an absolut convent market strategi . in fact , in 2006 , nobodi still pretend to believ in the realiti of what is present by televis ( movi , as well as realiti show , as well as advertis ) , and with the progress made by the graphic art , which are now avail to the most part of the popul , we are total awar of the manipul that are use to imag ( just as pictur of product , or video ) to reach the best result . thi is probabl the most import featur of thi market strategi . in the past year , in fact , it wa not as easi as it is now to modifi the imag of a specif product to make it appear more desir : it requir lot of expens and sophist tecniqu , which were n't avail to everybodi . nowaday the progress informat revolut ha also improv comput 's graphic skill , which allow compani to maxim the effect of the advertis present a maximum grade of perfect of the product . i final think thi is a featur of our societi : to be attract by the ( at least appar ) perfect , which might be fals , but peopl like to dream , even if it is just for a while .
