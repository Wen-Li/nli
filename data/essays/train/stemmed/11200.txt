i absolut agre with thi statement , i think that everybodi that want to be a success person at work but also in hi privat life need to tri alway someth new and take some risk . i also think that to reach some success in life somebodi ha to take hi respons , for what he think or doe , and must have the veri difficult abil to learn from other peopl and from himself . tri new thing , mean for me a need of chang , a sensat that what 's surround is not big enough , but i also think that the first step for tri new thing start from the insid of everybodi , such as tri new feel . take the risk is also veri import becaus if anybodi arriv to the success without ani risk or stop it 's success doe n't mean anyth . the respons are one of the most import part of the success , becaus when you take some decis for your futur you must be abl to face the problem that thi decis will caus you , and if you can manag well your decis and your respons you can also fail but with a smile on your face . to reach the success i think it 's import also the abil to learn , and i do n't mean onli from other peopl but also to learn from ourselv and from our mistak , and not to think that we alreadi know what to do and nobodi els doe becaus there will alway be someon els that that alreadi commit the same mistak and that can teach us someth to find our solut . if we onli do what we can do well we 'll never be abl to follow our path but we 'll onli walk around in circl .
