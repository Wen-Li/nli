knowledg is devin . have knowledg on differnt subject doe not lead to ani confus , rather we have more advantag . i disagre with the mention statement . in our day to day life we see so mani chang , the thing you see today might no be there tommorow , when we talk about technolog the abov statement is true , howev there are few subject , where they remain constant , for exampl histori , the term itself describ about past actviti . if an individu stick to thi subject through out his/her life , there is posibl of not know the latest updat of our surround . master in a specif subject is a good option , but at the same time everi individu should have the basic of other subject as well . consid a small exampl here , say there are two student a and b. a is special in histori and ha zero knowledg on other subject b is good at comput and also show intrest in other subject . if both were told to give a ceminar , a would be stronger onli in present the lectur but where as when b give present on the same topic as a did , b 's present would be more affect and the reason be , b 's present includ a graphic represent which will strike the ordian mind with great impact . if parent have knowledg in differ subject , it help their children to think , understand and analyz and if we are stick to one topic forev , it might creat a problem for us and for the younger gener . knowledg is prower weapon and it is an ocean and have a broad knowledg will help us in better think and share it with other put us one step ahead .
