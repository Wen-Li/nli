first of all , i disagre with the say of have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becuas of the import of been a special in one subject mean that you have more inform anf knowledg in thi area more than the other . to be specialz in ani subject help the peopl the be expartis on there work and they can intreduc more help and knowledg on thi one subject . as an exampl , if i am work in onlu houbara conserv which is veri rare field that mean that i will know more that other peopl in the mithid and the tool to save thi indang bird . if you are specialz in one subject you will have time ti fine and to do more resrach on thi subject and also to find solut if ani problem hapen and attach to thi subject . other exampl to be a doctor , if you sick you will go to a specialz doctor but you will not go to ani doctor . special mean that when and how you use what . fainal , to be special is mean that you but the tight thing with the right pearson or specialist .
