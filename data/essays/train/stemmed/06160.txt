there is an opinion that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . as far as i 'm concern , i believ that thi issu should be evalu in the certain context . have a broad rang of knowledg subject , we willl get exposur to a varieti of knowledg field , which will prepar us with some univers knowledg which are necessari for ani futher reasearch . also , the access to a wide rang of studi subject will help us to foster a good think mode to reason the ani academ issu from a high-level perspect befor we go ani further . howev , the knowledg the learner get through thi way may not be much substanti at the cost of the wide rang . specif subject , on the other hand , will benefit the learner , with an in-depth knowledg and skill set , which are critic to explor in the certain field and to get substanti understand of the major he work on . onli with intens train in the specif subject , one could be expect to make impress achiev in thi field . compar the advantag and charecteristi of the broad knowledg and specif subject , we can tell that they help peopl in differ way . as a result , the focu on the differ side of these two studi mode vari accordingli to the studi period the learner is in . for instanc , if a person is a beginn , it is necessay to instil him with a wide rang of knowledg , such as philosophsoy , geometri and math , etc . onli through the extens learn , he can build himself a well-prepar platform for ani further research . in anoth circumst , if the learner is alreadi well equip with a broad rang of knowledg and doe know where hi academ interest and strength lie in . the specif subject learn should kick in . sinc he need , at thi time of period , the solid specif subject knowledg to prospel , even accelar hi reasearch in certanin academ field , rather than stay in the phase of expos to a broad rang of knowledg as much as possibl .
