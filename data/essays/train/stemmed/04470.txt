i think help student to understand idea and concept is import . that is not the onli way about how to teach student . the other idea is teach them to learn fact . student may get mani differ way of educ when they start to learn . no matter the educ are the parent or the school teacher , the differ way will influenc student so much . lead student to understand idea and concept is a veri import way . thi way will help student to learn how to think . if teacher teach student to understand the idea and concept of one topic and teach them to think those concept more detail . student may use variou kind of way to realiz that topic , like find inform from the book or discuss with other student . student will develop the real think in thi process . thi way even can help student to develop their creation and also learn how to use the good interact with other peopl . the other idea is teach student to learn fact . most of parent or teacher usual use thi way . they will tell student which is right and which is wrong directli . student know the fact of everyth they have learn . they alway accept what they learn . student do n't need to think too much . that will caus student ca n't differ what is the truth if no one tell them the fact or when they face what they have n't learn befor . that will be a veri danger way to educ student . i think the good way of educ is teach them to understand idea and concept . student may realli know how to learn more and can think everyth independ .
