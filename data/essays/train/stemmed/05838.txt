i agre with thi statement of cours . nowaday young peopl are not involv in help their own commun . for me the problem is young peopl educ and our modern way of life . in fact in the modern societi the most import thing is succ , and the first thing that is relat with thi is certanli the idea of competit . sinc we are child everyon ( parent , rel , friend , teacher ) teach us that the onli thing that is import is to be the best . a good exampl is a footbal match where for everyon the onli one goal is the victori , and partecip and meet with other peopl is not import . so we tend to see our social life in thi way too . we do n't have to help the commun were we live , we have onli to fight against the other and tri be the best one . and the greatest exampl of thi concept is given by televis , that nowaday is veri import in young peopl educ and so it is respons of what they will do in their commun . but there are also other reason to thi attitud . for exampl in the modern societi averyon ( also young peopl ) have realli a littl time to tri to help the commun . we have alway someth to do , and it is alwaiy someth too mutch import to spend our time help the other . but often it is onli a simpl illus . young peopl in fact tend to give a great import to thing that are realli ridiculu . for exampl for a kid have time to play with videogam ( and a kid is abl to play for hour and hour ) is one of the most import thing in hi life . thi is a great problem . nowaday young peopl tend to misunderstand what are their real priorit . and thi mistak is help by our modern concept of competit for success . in the end , young peopl think that help their own commun is not import becaus for them there are mani other thing to do and help the poor and the sick is not a way to improv their statu and compet for the success . thi attitud of young peopl is veri tragic becaus act like thi demostr the they are loos the real valu of human be .
