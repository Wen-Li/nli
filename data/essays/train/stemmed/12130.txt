young peopl and the commun i think that i would have to agre with thi statement , accord to nowday young peopl dont help or particip enough in thier own commun , and i mainli think that thi is becaus of the world today and it busi busi life . becasu nowday a lot of young peopl ca n't even afford to loos time on play or engag in ani kind of fun activ , becaus they bare can make it from home to colleg and from colleg to thier part time work ( if they have one ) and then go home again to do thier chor and finish studi and do thier homework , which take a lot fo them drop them beat on the bed at the end of the day . but then again thi doe not appli on everi young person , some peopl chose not particip in thier own commun becaus they dont think that the commun itself is not do a good job maintain thing at hand , and so they dont want to interfer with the bumpi road ahead . but also there is a quit fair amount of young peopl with plenti of free time who would love to help thier commun to prosper and to feel good about them selv as indivisu in do so , and not to forget that work pro bono for the commun mean no money , and not mnay peopl who would want to wast thier time and not get paid in the end , so stick to thier job is the better answer fo their time . so in conclus , i do agre with the statment that young peopl dont give enough time to help thier own commun , but in the same time i dissagre that should help the commun and give thier time and effort away on the count of their futur , but thi doesnt empli on those young peopl who dont think and give much time about thier futur or their commun becaus they should , after all our commun is what we have and what we stand for .
