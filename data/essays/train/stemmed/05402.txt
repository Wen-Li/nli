i agre to the statement that young peopl do not have enough time to help out their commun . there are mani reason attach to thi statement . the modern world ha becom veri busi and commerci . peopl work for time , the more time they work the more they are paid , thi is directli proport . let us start the discuss from root level . at a veri tender age children are sent to the school , where they go in the morn and come back in the even . slowli the student get habitu to live that hi / her parent show . when they finish their metricul they are join in higher studi and thi goe on for five to six year . after hi complet of the graduat he is place in ani big compani or in ani field that he is interest in . from the abov metion data it clear that the peopl do not get enough time to their person time for the commun . most of the young peopl work for the multi nation compani which do not provid you the time to spare for extra curricular activ . the peopl of thi gener have becom workahol . no bodi care for the societi . they do their thing money orient which for them is the primari thing . peopl of thi gener think that there is governm to look after the thing about the commun . but they do not understand the simpl fact that `` team work mean more we and less me '' . there are veri few peopl who you can count on your finger who care for the societi and their commun . it is becaus of these peopl that the world is still aliv . the young gener ha becom more famili orient and care least for their commun . i here by conclud my discuss that the corpor cultur ha slowli but sure imbib into everi one of us which ha given less chanc to serv their commun . i sincer hope that peopl would realis the fact that everi bodi should live happili . thi onli happen when you serv your commun atleast inch to it success .
