'' the answer depend on a lot of factor such as hi own experi he had with car in the past . after state that everyon opinion can differ about thi , i am confirm that the amount of car which will be use in 20 year will increas . i guess it is a broad accept agreement that car make life easier . they can take you to far away lay place in a pretti luxurey way . and the way of travel must be conveni for the human . futhermor , you konw , it is a fact that the amount of car still becom bigger . a lot of peopl ca n't imagin a life without a car , i assess that they depend on the exist of car . for exapl , today i came from stuttgart to heidelberg to take part at the toefl . and if i had n't taken the car , i would have spend lwice the time in a bu or on the train . ok i agre that thi is a question of luxuri . but do n't want to miss it . as an engin i think that we are abl to find a new method to get the car not as harm as they still are , for natur and for our natur . you know i mean the smoke which is caus if you take a car . and if the gazolin or oil becom less , i gess , we will find a solut . the last thing which came up into my mind is , that germani ha a great automot comani which are interest in sell car .
