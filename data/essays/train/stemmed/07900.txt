advertis a product is an effect way for compani to increas their revenu by display their product or servic in variou way ( tv commerci , poster , show , etc . .. ) . it can be argu that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . advertis will never show the disadvantag or problem with a product that is be display . the compani of the specif product will onli show the posit side of the pictur , wherebi they will exagger upon the advantag of the product . thi is onli natur , as they are tri to sell their product and in order to accomplish thi , they need to catch the eye of the consum . for exampl , advertis or commerci of suv are alway over-the-top . they will show their suv go on the worst possibl terrain , show how effect they are and they will alway point out small detail that make it `` the best in the world '' or `` better than their rival '' . they also point out that their suv is the one for everyon . that may not be neccessarili true , as everybodi ha their own tast and not everybodi is forc to like the same thing . the specif advertis i talk about will never show how reliabl the suv is or what problem one can encount compar with it 's rival . whenev a price is given of the product ( for exampl an suv ) , that price is usual the basic model or the minimum that wo n't get the consum much . in other word , they are cheat in a way becaus a consum who becom interest in the suv will find out that for all the facil the suv ha in the advertis , there will be a big increas in the money paid from the price given in the advertis . the compani know how weak the consum can be onc a success advertis of a product is given and will therefor make the product look like it 's the ultim thing to have . their onli aim is to make the consum buy the product . they do not neccessarili care about what happen after the purchas , as the compani ha alreadi benefit from the profit be made . all of the abov support my opinion on agre with the statement that most advertis do make product seem much better than they actual are , as they do not give the consum a clear idea of what the product is realli like .
