i agre that the person should focu on one specif subject . basic i can summaris the process for success as `` find and dig it . '' discuss might be relat to what subject rather that how mani subject . sometim peopl are concern of money or reput . money is a demonstr of success and reput is an elev of social statu . i agre that money and reput are import . howev , i also believ that if someon is love what he is do , ultim he will receiv what he plant . the person occupi busi with more dedic , it will be bloom with mani flower . those who reallli perform what they like they can show endur dedic . roumi onc said that a person who stand in all gate can never stand in ani gate truli but a person stand in one gate will stand in all gate . peopl who tri to collect everyth will end up with noth . they will have mani distract idea . hi effort were dispers in mani issu and hi knowledg will be limit . he can not deepen the subject and know the detail . howev when a person special in one subject , he get a perspect of analyz the problem . sinc he concentr all hi effort in one field , he can becom more creativ . he will think of the subject all the time . mani peopl have a problem about time . they critic their mismanag schedul . therefor the time manag concept wa reveal as a part of busi field . the time manag is about work less and do more . how will we creat thi seemingli paradox case ? well , while we are squez our day in a few issu , we will becom more product . everi action will be complement each other rather that obstacl each other . so , i final recommend to all mentor ( parent , friend , teacher ) to help kid to find the belov subject and to encourag them to work hard .
