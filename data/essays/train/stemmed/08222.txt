no , i do n't agre complet with the statement that in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i have mani reason that support my argument . firstli , there is no immedi reason whi peopl are go to do away with car in anoth twenti year . car is one of the most commonli use automobil these day , human use it for mani of their daili purpos and a whole industri thrive on thi . and car is a symbol of statu in some of the develop countri even today . and the way technolog is progress by leap and bound , one can onli imagin the variou level of comfort and advantag a car provid in contrast to ani other vehicl . but , as ani studi on the problem plagu the road transport would rightli indic , car are creat some problem that may prompt anyon to suggest their ` extinct ' . there might be sever reason for the author to give thi statement , some posit and the rest indic the ill effect of usag of car . one reason that might have prompt the author to state that the fate of car in use is go to seal , in the next twenti year , is that nowaday we are tri to find altern mean of road transport , becaus of variou problem a car pose today . definit , a huge amount of research is go on thi direct , to find better and better mean of transport , that will subsid or elimin the use of car and their corrent problem . but noon would disagre that at the same time , lot of effort are go on to address the current problem car are pose , and thu make car a better vehicl . come to the problem car are pose these day , the first thing that evinc is the pollut caus . automobil caus a lot of pollut and car do form a lion 's share of thi . but , research is give suffici attent to thi , altern way to avoid the use of petrol and deisel as the fuel for car and other automobil , are be studi and experi . we alreadi have some car run on the road use solar energi or biodiesel for fuel , which though are in their infant stage , provid attract prospect for car in the futur . moreov , these altern may , who know , eventu make the car a better vehicl than what it is at present . anoth reason is possibl the traffic problem pose by the increas car . govern are encourag peopl to let their car rest in the garrag , atleast on some day of a week , so that both pollut and traffic problem can be attenu . but even these problem plagu the whole of automobil industri , and the onli way to control thi is by have proper strategi for all the automobil , not car alon . further , an attempt to amelir the current situt of road traffic should work towar make the roadway more effect as a whole by better manag and other mean . just tri to avoid the usag of car wo n't do . thu , from some of the plausibl reason put forward in the abov argument , it can be said that car are not go anywher in the next twenti year , but they are go to have the same domin role they are play now in the road transport . further , i suggest that if the tone with which the author ha given thi statement would have help much more in the analysi .
