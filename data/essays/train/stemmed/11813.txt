i think that it is import for student to understand idea and concept but i think that it is also import that studenst learn fact becaus thi two learn strategi have advantag and disadvantag . one advantag if student understand idea and concept is that they do not need so much time to learn for an exam becaus if you have understand the fact the teacher ha said in the lectur you can remerb easier to the fact . in addit to that you do not forget thing so earli becaus you know a lot of background so you will be a veri clever person in the futur and becaus of thi you will have more success in your job becaus you are a well inform person . but the drawback lie in the fact that you have to afford more time to undersand idea and concept so if you have an exam and you do not have begin learn earli it is not good for you to follow thi learn strategi becaus you need to much time to prepar for your exam . on the contrari there are some advantag if you onli learn fact . the first advantag i want to point out is that if you have to learn a big amount of someth you are not abl to understand all idea and concept becaus it is to much to rememb for you for exampl in an exam . furthermor if you onli learn fact you have more freetim for instac to meet friend , go to the cinema or relax in the sun becaus if you onli learn fact the amount of learn materi will be reduc and so you will be abl to finish learn ealier . but there are also some disadvantag about learn fact . one disadvantag i want to mention is that if you onli learn fact you will not have a good grand in your exam becaus you can not answer the question which are ask in the exam veri good becaus you don not know some background about the theme you have learn . if i compar the both learn strategi i think the advantag from the strategi to understand idea and concept predomin becaus in my opinion it is more imort for a person to be veri good inform and have some background . so you can see that it is a veri clerver person and have succe in hi or her job .
