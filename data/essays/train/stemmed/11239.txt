i agre that student should understand idea and concept than learn the fact alon . with out understand of an idea or concept , the applic of a fact doesnt happen . if you just learn the fact , you may memoris it but do not know where to exactli appli it . practic applic requir understand of a concept . for exampl if a child simpli learn the fact that `` tell lie is bad '' with out understand the import associ with the statement , it may end up in dilemma in mani situat . on the other hand if the child is explain and given proper idea or concept of what happen when you tell lie , use real life simpl exampl , it may confid avoid tell lie and adher to habit of speak truth . also you can take an instanc of a student who memoris the whole theori but unabl to demonstr a practic techniqu becaus of lack of understand of the concept . so understand the concept or idea is requir to know it import and to enabl them to appli it in practic situat . furthermor , learn a fact is better if you understand it in a right way . in other word , if you understand the concept or idea involv , learn a fact is simpl . it can be illustr with an exampl of child learn fraction in mathemat . if child simpli memoris that 1/2 is greater than 1/4 , it may get confus while take test . but if you make the child understand the concept use a cooki by divid one cooki into 4 part and explain that each part repres a fraction . so the three part are more than two which inturn is more than one part . so child can understand that 1/3 is greater than 1/2 which is in turn more than 1/4 and be confid solv fraction on exam . also understand a fact or concept promot deeper understand . for eg a child who memoris the fact may not be abl to answer if a question about a topic which he/sh memoris is ask in a differ way . but one who know it 's applic or understood the concept answer without hesit . learn onli promot short term memori , which is suscept for get lost . but the idea and concept we understand enter the longterm memori and henceforth sustain forev . moreov while do thing , the concept of which is understood , we can act spontan . in short develop concept or understand idea about thing will make learn more easi , perman and logic . henceforth student should develop understand of a fact befor learn them .
