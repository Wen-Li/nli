person , i outgh to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus i am a person of open mind , for exempl in my personel case , i am student in chemic engin but i am interest in chemestri too , in fact in franc peopl who studi chemic engin do not understand anyth in chemistri subject , mayb it will be crazi but is true . i had made differ intership in peru and franc and i saw thi problem . i . these subject were in chemestri and chemic engin , i did not afraid becaus i think i have broad knowledg in both . dure my studi at univers i learn to work in specif and gener subject . i got the capac for work in both of them . in fact i have a few knowledg in differ domain like manag work group , comput system , in my opinion it is veri interest to know a littl of differ subject . the maner of compani are interest to recrut peopl who can work in differ subject becaus it could be more easi to give them differ respons becaus they are more adapt to chang . in thi global world peopl have to have an open mind for get more oportunit in the life work . if peopl is special in one specif subject they wont understand the differ way to resolv a gener problem . final , i think is a personel decisit to have the knowledg in particular or mani gener subject
