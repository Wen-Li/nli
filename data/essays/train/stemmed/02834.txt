`` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' it 's realli an interst subject , and i agre with statement and i think it would be better and i have three reason to support my opinon . my first reason for beliv that it 's would be better to have fewer car is , that if we have fewer car in the citi , that will help to redus the crowd in the citi , in addtion everi one will reach hi work at earli time , and olso we can stay a way from the late and absent at the unviers . on the other hand we will stay a way from accid , that mayb happend becuas of crowd . my second reason for beliv that it would be better to have fewer car is , to protect the envirn from the pollut which is happend becaus of the crowd i mean when we have a million of car that will caus mani danger poision , so if we have a fewer car that would protect us and hepl or children . so i think that main point that we have to protect it and stay a way from it `` crowd '' . my third reson and it the last one for beliv that i would be better to have fewer car is , that mayb when we have fewer car , that would help the other , imean if we have fewer car , mani peopl will use the other way to go from place to anthor . it will encourg the other tranportn like the train and buse , so that will help the peopl to complet i mean to get the money that they need . in conclus , i want to say it realli import to redus the car number in the area and i think i would better to have fewer car in the world for these reason . becaus it caus the crowd . becaus it mayb pollut the envirn . becaus it mayb help the other peopl by give the money as i mention in the third reason .
