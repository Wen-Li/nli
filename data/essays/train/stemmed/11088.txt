dure their all long period of educ and graduat , student are learn mani thing on differ topic and are develop mani skill . that give them the opportun to improv some of them . is that more import for a student to understand what he is learn , or just to keep thing in mind without ani explan or ad valu ? on the one hand , i think that it is essenti for a student to understand what is teach to him for the simpl evid that he will better keep it in mind . if we take the exempl of an econom classroom , it will be more effici for the student to understand the concept of `` the liber '' for instanc by understand the way it work and it featur , than just know the fact that thi is an econom way in opposit to other as `` sociaism '' . but on the other hand , it sometim difficult for a student to understand everi aspect of an idea or a concept . thi made the fact that some student are tough in an area and weak in an other one . in thi case it would be a better way for the student just to learn hi class without ani more understand , just like a robot . my person exempl can be releat through the phylosophi classroom i had im colleg . i wa defenetli weak on thi area and the onli profit way for me to get a not too bad resul at the exam wa to learn fact and to prevent myself to write extra-explan that i did not realli understand . to sum up , i will say that it is of cours essenti to understand the idea and concept given through our schoolar educ , but that we are not necessarli awar to all the field and some are so harder to learn depper in or improv . we can introduc here the concept of natur select which drive peopl to some field of studi and some other to opposit area . ..
