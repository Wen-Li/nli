first , i think that it is better to have knowledg of mani academ subject , becaus you tend to improv your critic mind more than when your are special , but in an other hand i think that a special may be benef in some case too . in one hand , i think that a gener knowledg of mani subject increas the abil of a person to understand the societi and the world in it mani form . inde , when you know the origin of a phenomenon that media are talk about , you understand it better : in it construct , and in it effect . becaus most of the time , a phenomenon or crisi , is base on and ha develop from a caus that is import to know to realli understand the problem . for instanc , when you have both studi geographi and histori at school , you are more abl to understand the origin of polit problem such as mass immigr than when you onli have studi geographi or histori . inde , a problem is the result of caus that are often more variou than we think . so when you have a wild cultur , ( that mean when you have studi mani subject at school , such as biolog , physic , or geographi ) , you tend to have a more critic mind , and a better approach of the situat . but in the other hand , a special on a specif subject is a good thing , becaus you are stude all the detail of a specif phenomenon , and you are abl to explain to peopl the accur realiti of a process . you are also abl to make the scienc go forward if you work on scientif subject for mani year , such as medic research . inde , becaus time and special allow peopl to make big discoveri . in conclus , i realli think that a wild knowledg may increas peopl critic mind , but there are also advantag to be special .
