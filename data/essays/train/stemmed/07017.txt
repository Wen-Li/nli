most peopl like to travel . some of them are tri to travel by themselv . on the other hand , rest of them intend to follow a tour guid . both of them have each reason advantag . howev , i do not think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . if i have a chanc to travel , i will travel alon or with a few friend . firstli , i believ that travel is to get my own expir . initi , i know that follow a tour guid is more conveni , but i think that purpos of travel is not be conveni . expirienc new world and new cultur is goal of it . i had two exprienc of travel . one of them wa travel to japan , and anoth wa travel to u.s. the travel to japan wa not to follow a guid . my friend and i made everi plan and reserv . sure , it wa a littl bit difficult but experi that we got at that time made us mental strongli . on the other hand , travel to u.s. wa fun and easi for a guid , but i did not have ani special memori about that trip . secondli , one of mean of travel is take some space from our regular live . if we travel alon or with just a few friend , we can do it . but , follow a guid should not allow to do it . there are so mani plan and event . sometim those thing can make a travel funni , but often those can make it irrit . nobodi want to spend money on meaningless thing . if a travel is a way that make you escap your life and refresh , which one is more help ?
