for a student like me that must choos hi futur , thi question is the question that probabl i present to myself everi morn that i wake up . from a side , probabl have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better becaus in thi way peopl have much opportun . the world of work will offer to us a small choos to do . infact , mani time peopl do n't work for the specif subject that they have studi . perhap , have a larg knowledg of mani academ subject , can help the man to have and to accumul experi from sever field . i must say that special in one specif subject can present easili a great opportun than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject : a beauti carrier . i think that have a great number of inform on a specif subject can help the man to have a great vantag to other peopl . he can work on the subject with all knowledg and he can discov or develop the materi that ha dealt of . a man that ha a broad knowledg of mani subject ca n't develop the materi without a good experi . he must work mani time on the materi for have the same prepar of a man that ha special . it must explain howev that when to a special man is present a materi that he ha n't studi , he must search some help to a man that have broad knowledg or to a man that ha studi that specif subject . probabl in life is often a matter of luck , even if it must be consider that everyth that we 'll do in our life we must use our intellig . i do n't know what i want to do in my futur , i do n't know if i will have broad knowledg in mani subject or i special in one specif subject but i know that i hold my life in my hand and i want to use everi occas that will present to me .
