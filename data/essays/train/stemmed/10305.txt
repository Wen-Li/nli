product that a compani make must look in front of the custom uniqu and use through advetis . therefor i must agre with thi statement : most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . let us take a simpl exampl , chocoat bar . i am sure that u have seen an advertis for one . dont you notic the express on the face of an actor who eat that chocol bar ? if i ate that bar i dont think the express on the face of the actor will come to my face simpli from the tast of it . thi exampl is onli to clarifi the exagur in advertis . if i own a compani i would rather make my product look the best and most use for the custom therefor other owner will also do the same exact thing . i am not encourag the compani to exceed realiti but to use imagin instead of exagur . sinc in nowday advertis take more time than our daili watch progarm , so i think the best way to attract to consum is by entertain adverties rather than fake one . i think that it is the owner right to show hi product in the way they want and also it is the right of the custom to buy the product that suit him . in the monopali of a bussi howev , the compani could be punish to not clearli show the realiti of the product and in that case , instead of the compani gain profit it could close down . at the end i want to state a plain idea that i mention befor which is to use creativ advertis rather than fals one . and that i am in total agreement with thi statment mention abov .
