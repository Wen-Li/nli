help our commun is a veri import point in our world . do young peopl not give enough time to help their commun ? let see . first of all , young peopl are often independ , so they care more about themselv than about other peopl , they think those peopl will never help them in return and they can onli trust themselv . a young person will often want to do what she want when she want and she may not understand whi she should spend more time help her commun . there is also anoth problem , the studi . studi for young person are veri import and it requir a lot of work and a lot of time to spend , becaus studi will help them in their futur to find a job and win money , again they care more about themselv than about their commun , for exampl in my univers peopl say that their first wish is to suce in thi univers and be abl to work in differ countri , so it is a pressur for them . so it is mainli a problem of prioriti , young peopl prefer be an import person who win money instead of give time for other peopl . there is an interst sicilian setenc which say : `` the onli person you can total trust and you can help is onli yourself . '' i agre with thi sentenc becaus you will alway do your possibl to be someon , and the most import thing is our live . so we can not often help other peopl becaus help ourselv take much time and it is necessari . as a conclus , i agre with the follow statement , but i would also say that i understand becaus life in nowaday is veri difficult and we must first take care about ourselv .
