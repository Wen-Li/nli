as a young turkish man , i am disagre with the statement . in my opinion older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do . the reason whi i think are older peopl have more experi than young peopl , they do not have to struggl with life and they can be happi with their children . firstli , older peopl have a big advantag to be happi , they have live differ thing befor than young . for exmapl , they know a birth 's happi or a death 's sad , thu they have to chang to be happi more than young peopl . i think there is a lot of event which can be hurt for me , but they can not hurt an older one . secondli , older one have not got a struggl in life as big as youth . i for instnac ; need to more work than my parent becaus they got their side at life befor me and their task are reduc . for these reason older peopl live in more comfort than young peopl . in my opinion older peopl 's comfort is the best happi at the world . final , older peopl have their children but young one not . although young peopl have respons , they can not know the respons and happi to have their own children . children may be most import thing to happi for a person . for thi reason young peopl should not be sure about their real happi befor they have not got a child . to my mind i will be realli happi when i see my own child . to conclud , although young one have lot of advantag to be happi , in my opinion matur have real happi , and have more thing to satisfi . i think vast major of peopl think as me in turkey .
