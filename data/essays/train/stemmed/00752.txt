that a realli realli good subject , but acctulli i have to say that i agre with special in one thing , beacus if some one did then when he well give 100 % to make hi catagori the best and make hi job the best . like if we had a cardiac doctor if you ask him he well tell you that he is tri to be the best and to invent a new method to fix the heart . so , at the end of the road if he wa ambesiuo he can do it . all am say that it better to special in on subject . one , it better to improv that subject . two , it well be better for him not to be puzzl . and three , it well make him the best in that subject . howev , i think the it good to have a broad knowledg but while foucs on one major . like some one is an engen but at the same time he can creat other bussni away from hi major , like he could work at the stock or open a store to sell ani thing . but , there is some thing verey importanat . that thi other work well not effect hi major work beacus in thi way he will be a loser in both subject . anyway my point is that both of them is good . but , for some peopl that is good for other the other one is better . and as the old sayin `` defer in opinun will not destroy the case '' .but i said mine and thank you for thi verey good subject and thatsal i have to say .
