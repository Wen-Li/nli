i person travel a lot in my life becaus i think it one of the best way to learn about divers and cultur . sinc i wa born my parent would often take me and my brother on vacat . i consid my self lucki becaus i had the opportun to visit countri such as venezuela , india , canada , brazil and mani other . well none of these travel were guid by group led . from what i know a tour guid job concern whit show to tourist the beauti or someth in particular of a certain countri , and i am sure that they do their job in the right way . but i think that one of the most fascin and interest thing when you are visit a new countri , i would call it the `` tast '' of your vacat , come from your desir to discov the same beauti by your own . when i visit a new countri a whant to feel all the tradit and cultur that carachter it , i want to becom , dure that period , part of what is go on . for exampl while i wa in india i 've been invit to a tradit buddist wed ; at the beggin i wa a bit suspici , i wa not sure to ware their tradit wed dress , it wa a larg pair of pant full of differ color . at the end i decid to ware it and still now after five year i rememb that day as one of the most emot intens day of my life . in all my trip arround the world i 've been in mani situat that gave me lot of satisfact and i am sure that i would n't feel in the same way if wa a guid who took me to that wed . to end my paper i want to decair my advers to tour guid vacat , you spend more and enjoy less .
