i total agre with thi statement becaus of sever reason . first of all i want to mention an experi . in my final class at school i got a complet differ type of teacher in the histori cours . the previou one want us to learn date . the new teacher organis hi lectur complet differ . for him it wa import that we understood the whole pictur , the process of histori and the relationship between import event in time instead of learn date . that wa veri interest and much easier to learn becaus everybodi understood whi the thing happen and in which chronolog . from my point of view it is import that the student \ pupil have fun by learn the object . to understand the idea is in my opinion alway more interest than learn fact . the next point in my argument is the import of understand the idea itself . if somebodi doe not understand the idea behind for exampl an econom model he can not explain what he calcul . anoth exampl is if somebodi did not get the messag of market and how it function , he probabl will write a good test becaus he learn the market ps or someth like thi , but he will never be abl to work as a market . the reason for thi is that he did not understand the concept behind market and probabl will not rememb the 4 ps , although he had learn them . here we are at my third point . the rememb of someth . if somebodi ha understood anyth it should be no problem for him to rememb thi idea after a long period of time . it is in hi mind . he will never forget it becaus he understood the reason , the porpus behind the concept . for thi argument it is also import to look at the circumst the idea wa establish . by understand how the idea came upon it is also easier to understand the idea itself . at the end i want to say , that i am realli think that understand someth is more import then learn onli the fact , although sometim it ha to be .
