an idea or a concept is a point of a view about a fact and differ peopl may have differ thought and use differ method about the same topic . i believ it is equal import for student to understand idea and concept and to learn fact about a topic . to explain better , it can be said that the fact are like the target and the differ idea and concept about that fact is like the differ way go to the same target . for exampl one can say that the best way of melt the ice is by heat while the other can argu that put the ice in the room temperatur and wait till it melt is a better way . the two have differ idea about melt ice and of cours have reason explan for their own method , but thi doe not chang the fact that the ice turn into water at the same temperatur under same condit . i think , the student should first learn about the fact but it is an import for them to learn also how other peopl reach to those fact . to give an exampl , fact is like a car and the idea and concept are like how to use a car . one without the other ha no mean , and both are necessasri to drive a car . consequ , to learn about the fact is crucial for the student but at the same time to learn about the other peopl 's point of view , their thought and their method is also an import part of their learn process .
