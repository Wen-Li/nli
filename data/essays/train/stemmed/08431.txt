ye , i agre with the statement . young peopl are the futur of the world , they remain activ in thier young period but while they get older they loos patienc , concentr and the bodi organ get weak , they may see inact compar with young peopl . as young peopl have mani dream and have mani goal to achiev . they work accordingli to achiev their goal and their age is in the stage that they are readi to do anyth , young peopl say and prove ` noth is imposs ' .they can jump , play and enjoy the wholelif at maximum extent . well about the older peopl they will loos their patienc , they have to look after whole famili and would face mani problem regard famili and now they have no strength to do more work , no strength to danc , jump and travel . for exampl , let take my young cousin , when hi famili went for an holiday includ hi grandfath who is 70 year old , my cousin explor whole citi and visit mani religi place , which make him happpi or he may enjoy that . while hi grandfath who is also interest to see those place but due to hi physic weak and due to the temperatur varianc he did n't resist at that palc . and mani place are in the hilli area which are to be travel by walk , as hi grandfath have no strength he did n't enjoy the trip . young peopl have mani way to enjoy their life at maximum . now-a-day young girl are the main factor for their enjoy , they go out with their girl friend in which they find much enjoy . but older peopl ca n't do that as they are marri they are restrict to thier limit . thi is a silli exampl but it is a huge realiti statement . i conclud by say that young peopl will have more fun in thier period by compar with the older peopl . due to their strength and enthusiascim which can find more in young peopl rather than in older peopl .
