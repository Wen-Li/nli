today car are consid veri necessari for everi travel we have to do dure our life , but i strongli believ that the number of car will decreas in twenti year for sever reason . the first reason for the decreas of car is that as the year go on the petrolium and consequ oil reserv will dramat decreas and thi will influenc the cost of carbur , which will increas a lot , and so peopl will be not encourag to buy a car know the fact that oil is so expens . secondli , there is also an ambient reason that make me think that the number of car will decreas , the fact that car pollut air and so are a risk for our health : for thi reason i think that govern will not encourag the bought of new car by tax them a lot . in addit to thi , our citi are not onli pollut but also full of car which make move in the citi low : as a result of thi situat i think that the mayor of the citi will not approv an increas in the number of car in order to avoid that town will get full and full of car . i also think that in the futur there will be a rais of differ mean of transport such as train , bu , metro in order to decreas the pollut of the air , in fact it is demonstr that train and metro are more echolog than car ( and they are also more comfort ) ; as a result of thi increas of altern mean of transport the use of car will be destin to decreas sinc the major of popul will travel with train or metro . an exampl of thi decreas of car is provid by my own famili , in fact i and my parent have decid not to buy a new car for my birthday becaus it cost a lot . for all these reason i think that the number of car will decreas .
