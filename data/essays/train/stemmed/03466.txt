i disagre with the statement say that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject rather than special in one specif subject . i will illustr my view below . there is an english proverb which beauti fit in the abov case : `` a jack of all is a master of none . '' in the past scientif knowledg wa rel limit as compar to now . now mani new field have been develop and even in a singl field there are mani sub divis . for e.g. comput . befor there no sub-divis in the field of comput but now we can broadli classifi them as hardwar , softwar , middle-war , internet & network , etc . even in these sub-divis we can have sever more option . the point i am tri to make here is that field are more divers and vari then they were befor . henc it is simpli not possibl to excel in all of them and have onli a gener idea about them will not suffic . addit knowledg ha becom more and more complex than befor . have a gener idea about thing is not enough to perform the task adequ . for e.g. a cfo ( chief financi offic ) of a compani ha reason knowledg about law . so doe it mean that he will be as compet as a lawyer specialis in these task ? altern a lawyer can not do adequ justic to the job of a cfo . let me illustr my point further . would you like to live in a build which ha been made by person have a `` gener '' idea of construct , architectur and engin or would prefer live in a build made by a team of expert in their respect field . focu on one topic inspir confid not onli in other but also in the person do the job . henc with the point abov i have best tri to justifi my conclus .
