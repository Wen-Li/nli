while it is import special in one area , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif are particularli befor dece the area of expertis . it is becaus it is rare the case that an event can be explain by focus onli on one area of academ . furthermor , it is critic to have well-round appreci for ani number of subject in order to determin the area to special . the world is full of exampl where a broad knowledg of academ subject is critical in understand the present situat . understand the war in iraq , for exampl , will requir one to have an in-depth knowledg of polit , econom , busi , religion , social and ethnic issu , and naiton secur or defens . one can not explain the situat without at least have some understand of all surround issu . ( for exampl , can we leav out discuss on oil and focu onli on pursu democraci ? ) although focus on one particular issu is import , it can be achiev onli after one ha becom awar of the fact that mani of the event and issu are close intertwin with one anoth . the purpos of the gener or requir cours that the univers offer to the first-year student is to provid them with opportun to broaden their idea and interest . these cours allow student to experi , by allow them to take cours in the area that they might not have otherwis consid take . be expos to a number of subject forc one to `` connect the dot '' and to analyz . for exampl , in one cours on religion of african diaspora , i learn that understand of religion , polit , and social factor were necessari to appreci those religion . had my focu been onli on one issu , i certainli would not have had as much fascin with the signific of certain item or ritual than i did . therefor , i believ that while it is import to special in one specif subject , it should be done onli when one ha obtain braod knoweldg of mani academi subject . henc , it can be argu that have broader knowledg is better than special in one area .
