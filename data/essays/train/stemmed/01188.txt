i agre with thi statement . success alway come from tri and take risk . peopl in the world all knew that if you want to becom success , you got to tri . you may learn a great experi while you are tri new thing . there might have someth that you were afraid of and never want to tri at all . howev by an accid you got to do thi thing and you actual did it , thi will give you encoura and you will feel veri proud of yourself . thi is how success work . those peopl ca n't becom success is becaus they do n't want to tri , everyth just stay the same , alway do the thing that they alreadi know how to do well . new thing alway let you grow up , if peopl rather stay the same they wo n't grow at all . i wa a veri good exampl that rather tri new thing instead of do thing that i alreadi know how to do well . when i wa young , i do n't know how to ride bicycl , and i wa afraid of it . howev i keep tell myself that `` if you wo n't tri , you will never knew how to ride a bicycl . '' and at first it wa veri horribl , i alway fall down and get hurt . although i wa not veri good , i still tri the new thing and i knew that i could becom better and better . becaus of thi thought and persveri , in the end i know how to ride a bicycl . form my exampl we can see the differ between tri new thing and stay the same . we alway afraid new thing taht we did not know about it . but think about it , if you tri the new thing you will learn a new experi and you might like it after you tri , so do n't just stay the same , tri new thing .
