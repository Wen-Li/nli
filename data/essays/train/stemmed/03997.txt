i think take risk is a must in real life sinc we can not determin everyth in our life . risk can lead peopl to earn much as well as to loos much . in fact peopl should consid on loos someth if they want to obtain a success . peopl can choos to keep on do the thing they have been alreadi good at , but i think by that way peopl forc themselv to be happi with the current situat rather than tri to find out someth better . for exampl owner of a small pizza restaur can earn enough money to look after the famili and to afford the rent of a hous and a small car . on the other hand if he choos to extend hi busi , he can earn more money and he can use the money for the other thing he want such as go on a holiday or buy a summer hous . i am one of those peopl who take risk . last summer i went berlin for my summer train in stead of perform it in my countri . it wa a risk becaus i did not know german , i had no friend in german also the compani did not afford me a place to live . i believ that have a traine in a such big compani will help me soon sinc i would gain so much experi and also i would have the chanc of work in an intern compani . it wa realli hard for me sinc i had have to live in a hostel for two month with littl money and i had some difficulti in commun peopl . consequ i convert that disadvantag to an advantag for me . the compani made an announc that they look for engin that can be work in their istanbul offic and i am the strongest candid for that job now . to sum up there is no limit for upgrad the situat , but it is up to peopl at which level they stop to upgrad . also it is up to peopl alway ask for more invest sometho \ ing to h \ get more
