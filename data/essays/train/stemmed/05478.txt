i total agre with the statement becaus i consid if peopl did n't take their chanc and take risk tri to gain someth els in reward the world would not be the one we know today . if hundr of year ago a crazi guy would n't have taken the risk and tri find a differ rout to get by ship to india we would probabl still be live in tree and hunt anim to obtain food and the rest of the world would still believ the earth is n't round . or if the wright brother would n't have risk their live as well as their pride tri to invent a revolutionari way of transport base on bird it would still take for us week or even month to travel from america to europ . that 's whi i think peopl should alway be will to take their chanc and not be afraid to risk someth that in the end might bring an enorm bennefit not onli to them but to other as well . we have alway fear what we do n't know and that 's whi normal we tri onli do what we know to do well , but in my opinion we are the onli creatur on earth with the abil to learn someth new everi day and evolv thank to those knowledg . if we have that possibl we might as well tri to gain someth from use it , or els there would be no differ between a person and an anim . i also consid that a peson that doe n't do anyth new in hi life and alway tri to do the same thing will end up by not like what he doe . and even though that person might be success in life do what he doe it wo n't matter becaus in the end he wo n't be a happi person which is , in my person consider , even more import that success . in conlcus i agre with the fact that it 's necessari for us to take risk , we even take them everi day when we get up , but it 's onli a matter of luck to gain someth in return if we not onli risk someth but also tri our best while do ani activ .
