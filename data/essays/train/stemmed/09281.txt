i believ thi statement is true , but i would rather blame the commun or the societi than the youth . our societi have gone through lot of chang in the last centuri . in the past , the societi of the middl age wa built around the commun and the villag and further the basic famili , which is the father , the mother and the children . there wa no need to leav the hous , unless mariag , and the school wa mostli for the wealthi . thi type of organis made it easi , and essenti , for the commun and especi the youngest to work hand in hand for the commun , for instanc on the field , becaus the life of the all the commun reli on the amount and the qualiti of crop . and also becaus the yougest had no choic than to work for the commun in order to secur their own exist . the societi of the 21st centuri is pretti much differ from that pictur . the young from the age of 3 or 4 to the age of 22 or 23 ha to go to school in order to learn a profess and find hi place in the societi . as soon as you got a job , the secur you were obtain through the middl age commun in the past , is all gain through your salari . the today world ha becom veri orient on the person itself , and not so much on the commun . peopl rais their children alon , go to work and come back at even and prepar for the same ritual the next day . commerci appear all the time on televis or radio send clear messag `` good for your person need '' as a person . the sens of commun ha almost disappear from the screen . anoth factor to the discharg of the youth of today , is the lack of time . talk about school or workplac , thing have to be done more effici in a shorter period of time . so it becom more difficult for peopl to concentr on the problem of the other . that reaction is exactli the one of the youth of today , which should n't be blame but the societi we are live in .
