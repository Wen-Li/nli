i do not agre with thi statement . thi essay will explor my reason whi i do not support the statement that understand idea and concept are more import than it is for them to learn fact . first , i believ that learn is a step by step process . understand idea and concept , and learn fact are both form the crucial step of thi process . if one step is miss learn can not be complet . for exampl prepar a meal requir some necessari step . if the cook ha all the ingrediten and the cook pan but nevertheless he doe not have an oven there will be no meal . i believ that it is the same in learn as well . if someon understand all the key point and concept but doe not learn the fact the learn can not be complet . second , thi statement doe not explain clearli which kind of subject are the main aspect of the discuss . as some meal do not requir cook such as a salad , in some subject area learn the fact is not necessari as understand the idea and concept . for instanc especi in social scienc understand the issu matter most than learn the fact sinc student are requir to form their own fact through analyz the idea . howev in scientif subject such as chemistri or biolog understand the idea will not be enough and learn the fact is crucial . for exampl a chemistri student can understand that the idea of explod element but he need to know the result what happen if those element come togeth . as be a fourth year busi administr student i do not rememb a time when just understand idea were enough for me to learn a subject as a whole without know the fact . i believ that idea and fact go hand in hand in the process of learn . in conclus thi statement miss out the import of the differ learn requir of differ subject area and discourag student from tri to learn the fact . no matter what is the level of import of the fact on the subject area , as i mention befor the learn process is a step by step process . thu , without the step of learn fact it will not be complet as it is suppos to . mani peopl do not even eat salad without chicken or beef in it , so even salad sometim requir cook . therefor i believ mani student may need to know the fact of a subject whey they understand the idea of it as well .
