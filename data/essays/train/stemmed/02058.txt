in a student life period and educ process student learn mani idea and fact . sometim idea and fact combin and can be learn togeth , sometim we can learn them seper . both of them are veri import part of educ but , i disagre with the statement and in my opinion learn fact is more import than to understand idea and concept . first of all , fact are more memor thing than idea and concept . fact can contain histor victori , new improv and also someth import that worht to rememb . student can easili rememb the fact that they are interest in and do n't forget easili in their lifetim . for exampl , world war ii is an import fact in world histori and it is easi to learn thi fact rather than the ideolog that caus the war . secondli , fact are more realist thing rather than ideolog . you have proof and histor document about the connect fact , but idea contain utop and individu belief and valu . it is a littl bit harder to understand these utop valu if we make a comparison with the learn fact as a learn process . furthermor , learn fact is more impress about take interest in the issu . idea and concept make them curiou onli who are interest in the issu such as aristotl ' s philosophi . but fact are more gener thing and can take more interest rather than idea and concept . to sum up , i believ learnin fact are more import than understand idea and concept
