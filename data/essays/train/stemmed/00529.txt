i think broad knowledg of mani subject is good , but not alway . so , i strongli disagre with the statement . i think , in mordern world one should be specif toward the subject , becaus there is a limit for human be . a person ca n't be perfect in everyth . for exampl there is a differ between the knowledg of an engin and a doctor . an engin can better think about mechan thing like machin , instrument etc , where as a doctor can have better idea of present of human bodi than an engin ha . so , a doctor can better manipul human bodi . so the knowledg is alway limit for both of them . that is whi , a person ca n't be a doctor or engin at a time and ca n't be expert in both the field . among doctor , a gener practiction ha knowledg of human bodi but are not special in purticular area like cardiolog , neurolog etc . as they have limit knowledg , they refer the patient with cardiac problem to the cardiologist , who alway ha better knowledg of heart activ than them . so , a specialist in specif subject is alway better . . at last i will say that , due to limit it is alway better for a person to be special in a specif subject , becaus thi is the way one can be perfect in the subject , and one can learn deepli about that subject that have littl knowledg of mani subject . thi is the way one can stand in thi competet world with the perfect knowledg in the particular subject , otherwis the person will neither have good knowledg of all the subject nor will be the master in one . thi is the way i want to be in futur , and would expect the same from other .
