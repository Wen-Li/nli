i disagre with the issu that a person should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to specialis in one specif subject becaus of mani reason . first of all , like it is said that littl knowldg is danger and harm . when u know about a lot of subject but a veri littl of each , you may probabl mislead other becaus you are not awar of small n accur inform which can lead to a lot of problem . secondli , when you know about the subject in and out , you can alway deal with ani problem that come across that issu . for exampl , if you have done a major in account in your colleg , then you can probabl teach in the colleg or atleast help someon who is in need , becaus that person can trust you with the inform becaus you are a testimoni in that case . but if you have littl knowledg of mani subject , then you cant be a testimoni and peopl will not trust you for ani inform becus you do not specialis in ani subject and moreov when you are a testimoni becaus you have specialis in one subject , you get a broader aspect of get a good job . but if you have a littl knowledg of mani subject , you end up nowher . for instanc , a professor who is specialis in account can influenc other with hi achiev in hi field . and can encourag other to follow one specif target in life becaus it lead to a brighter horizon . but when you are not sure abt your strength , it lead you veri doubt becus you are not sure of your capabl . atlast i would say that special in one subject make you a testimoni in public for the same and it lead to a secur futur becus you are sure of what you want to do and you dont mislead other with wrong or inaccur inform .
