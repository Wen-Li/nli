actual , whi do children go to school ? thi question should help us decid whether it is more import for student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . i would personn say that sudent need first to understand , then to learn . i would n't say that one is more import vthen the other , i would more like tri to convinc peopl that one ha to come befor the other . order usual doesn-t seem so import , but in my opinion in thi case it is . i-d say it is a matter of democraci appli to school : as peopl need first to be abl to choos , the onli way to put them in the right condit to do so is to teach them how to think how can children be thaught how to think ? their curios must be call , they need to be interest in the subject they-r stude . if the teacher succe in that , the children will ask question as a result of a person thought . a respons to that question will make them understand the concept and rememb at the time . and put understand and rememb togheth the teacher lead to . .. learn . that- whi understand ha to come befor simpl learn . let- assum , for exampl , that a student is thaught that in 1789 french revolut took place . he will know the fact , but will he be abl to explain how french popul ha arriv to that situat ? and most of all , will he rememb thi fact and thi date for more than the lesson time ? i don-t think so . i pretti sure he will forget as soon as he will exit the classroom or , in the best of the case , after the examin , precis becaus the fact ha come alon without a person and mayb emot particip to the moment of learn . understand provid thi essenti need person particip . peopl are not comput , the onli way to give them a real effect cultur is to make them think and understand , although we could say that cu ; lture is made by the knowledg of fact .
