i disagre with thi statement becaus it 's true that is necessari for student to understand better the concept and the idea show from the theori but i think if student do n't learn fact and do n't learn the way in wich all fact are produc and could be solv , they are not well prepar for the daili life and for take the work they are studi for . now i 'm go two show two exampl about my life in order to support my theori . i 'm studi busi at politecnico of milan . all cours that i have done dure my bachelor degre and also cours that i 'm make in my master of scienc , spend so much time for show idea and concept and not for present fact . in one bachelor cours call ect ( econom and technolog chang ) i have studi a lot of theori , for instanc the theori of monopolio , porter 's theori about the four forc that are import in the regul of enterpric 's busi , but our professor spent less time on the case , on the realiti . the result of thi cours wa that all of the student were n't abl to solv a case studi and were n't abl to solv a real problem . i had got the same problem also in my mo , becaus all the subject that we have to sustain in order to take our master degre provid onli for a teoric prepar base on concept , idea but there is a great gap relat to the understand of the fact . for instanc , three day ago i have done an exam call econometr that is statist appli to econom . but there were onli model to write but noth relat to fact . i think that for student , learn concept and idea is veri import , in fact if they do n't have a great theoric base they ca n't give brilliant solut to solv ani problem . but also is import that they learn fact , the way these fact are produc and the best way to solv them .
