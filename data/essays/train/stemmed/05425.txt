i agre with the statement , i think that for the student is more import understand idea and concept , becaus when a person understand idea ( he or she ) can applic thi in real life or can teach to ather peopl that concept . but i think also that for understand better idea or concept a person must learn fact , bacaus fact rappres a great exampl about idea . at school student studi a lot , for exampl , histori becaus thi subject is veri import for understand a lot of today thing from the past mistak . if you know the human histori you can do the best chois , but a lot of student stadi the histori but sometim they ca n't understand the real mean of thing that they have just read on the book . for thi reason , for me , it is veri import learn idea , becaus not all peopl can interpret in the right way the fact . it is much faster studi a fact then understend correctli concept . the real problem about thi learn metod is that there is n't a singl way to interpret fact , all peopl have a differ mind and not alway they give the right sens to thing . a professor can interpret in wrong way a fact and tell to hi student wrong thing .
