it is well known that educ is a tricki issu . it rais a lot of question and everybodi doe not agre on it . inde , educ differ between countri is a tell exampl of those question . special is prefer in some countri and other adopt a gener educ pattern . from my point of view , a gener broad knowledg is better than to spezial in onli one subject . i support the idea that with a real gener knowledg you develop your abil to have a gener view of the world . a case of point to highlight is that , yet among ancient greek philosoph a gener knowledg wa the condit of the achiev of the truth . that is a gener statement in which i believ . second , thi ancient belief of gener knowledg ha gone across centuri . i am convinc that it is still true . for instanc , in my school , i am studi sunstain develop . although some good action are done without thi gener view , it is not enough . you have to consid all the part of an issu befor act . if you tri to develop fair trade , be sure that transport will not be to harmful for the environ . final , from my point of view you can special after have receiv a gener educ . it is the french educ polici . children must go at school and learn variou subject befor special at colleg . in my opinion it make children more like to becom good citizen , they have some knowledg in mani subject . for instanc to vote , they are more awar of main issu . by way of conclus , i would say that even though special is import and allow peopl to reach an accur knowledg in one subject , a gener view provid by a gener knowledg is the way to avoid some big slide .
