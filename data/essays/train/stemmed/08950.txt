well that is a good question , becaus i never thaught of it befor ! in my countri young do n't get a chanc to see eachoth after class ! for most of us alway goe to cram school till 9 or 10 p.m. after we will have to go home immidiutli or els the polic will think that : hay ! what is a middl school fool around at that late , is he go to rubb someon . and then he will take you back to the polic station . after that your parent will have to pick ypu up ! but , we alway log on msn or sky-p to commun with each other ! and we might spent 1 or 2 hour do that a day . by do that we will spent about 6 hour to commun . other than that we often og out togeth on weekend to go bike or fish and even golf ! sometim we go to other hous to discuss homework togeth . even if we are not talk about homework we will talk about someth like ecosystem ecolog and scienc . that way we can spent some time togeth . but if ani big test is com we will stop do that , that is for our good . after the activ we have done all week we proubabl spent more time with friend than our own parent . so i think we have given enough time tohelp our commun . and even too much ! now i think i can say that we have alreadi spent enough time on that . and also i am not agre with that . i think i have alreadi expland whi i made up my mind to disagrss with that , so i do n't have to do it again right . no matter who said that [ young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun } he should take the word back !
