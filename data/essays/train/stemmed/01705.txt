i think that thi is not a veri simpl question . especi not for me becaus i am still young and not yet old . so i have onli the opportun to summer out of my sight as a young man . nevertheless , i will tri to find a well argu result . young peopl on the one hand are in common healthi . they have the physic possibilti to jump around , danc , make sport , or to move from one point to anoth . and all that without ani disabbl or ani pain . older peopl on the other hand have often pain time . doe not matter , if owe to a life 's work , or common diseas . they are often not abl to walk for a long time . they often have problem with their heart or their blood circul . but as they work for nearli their whole life , older peopl have gotten the possibilti to save some money . young peopl did not yet had thi opportun . and nowaday money is an import factor to enjoy one 's life . as a result of thi let me say that old peopl are rich and young peopl poor . anoth result of thi fact is that older peopl do not have to work anymor . so they have the opportun to schedul their time as they want to . young peopl on the other side have to go to school , to univers , or even to work . now let me say that time is also a veri import factor in our current time . 2:1 for the older peopl . and now let me summer . young peopl are healthi . but they have neither money nor time to spend in life . for me time and money is the most import to have fun , i. e. to enjoy my life . all these regard let me think that older peopl enjoy their life more than young peopl do .
