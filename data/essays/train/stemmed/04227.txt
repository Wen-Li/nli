i agre with thi opinion . i have some reason to help my opinion . first , idea and concept are alway basi of everyth when we make a new product or fact . if someon have onli a fact , he/sh can use that fact but they ca n't use proper usag of thi fact . we can use our fact to know their idea and concept . when i wa a child , my uncl gave me a airplan of paper craft . i can throw it and it will be fli on air . it wa sure interst and excit for me but i could n't understand whi it can fli . it is a childish question but i wa so seriou . so , i learn to know idea and concept are so import at that time . in addit , some peopl feel annoy on fact if they did n't know idea and concept . one of my friend will be angri when he ca n't understand anyth . we can say mathemat is also consist on idea and concept . he wa answer a question while we were take a test , and i guess he had a question which hard to understand when an incid happend . suddenli , he kick hi desk and went out from opuor class room . sometim not to know idea and concept make peopl upset or somth feel bad . at last , if we know idea and concept , it will be fun to live in our life . becaus we might find other usag to enjoy play or know on some fact . thi discoveri might be big achiev . it might be preciou treasur on our life that can help other peopl life or influent good fact to our preciou person . so , student should learn idea and concept becaus it can help them to know import of everyth how can we chang someth bad to good thing . it can suppli us posit think . conclusingli , these are my opinion to understand idea and concept that it is more import than to learn fact . i think it is import to know how those fact consist on what idea and concept .
