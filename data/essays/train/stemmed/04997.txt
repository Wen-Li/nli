i do not agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . the main featur of academ studi is that they are more special studi made by profession research . these research have to be the one who could devot themselv to learn what the other do not know . all their studi have to be base on thi idea : to creat , to produc , to invent and to discov . in order to achiev these , they have to be specialis in their specif subject . secondli , academ studi are consid to be referr . a lot of research , observ , studi , conclus , result and refer or relat to other studi take place in the academ studi . thie reliabl is directli relat with the way how scientif they are done . academ studi are distinguish form the other profess at thi point ; anybodi may gather inform about ani subject , may have broad knowledg of mani subject , but academ studi are the deep studi that are suppos to be refer to . unfortun , today , there is a tendenc that the academician do not like make such big effort to specialis in their subject and tri to have broad knowledg on mani field . most of today 's academician prefer to reproduc prior studi or gather prior sudi , rather than produc origin and totali brand new one .
