the mean of be succes can vari person to person . some peopl go on do the thing that they believ they are good at , while other prefer to tri new thing despit the risk that they need to take . i think a success person is the one who like tri new thing and not be afraid of fail . a success person should not be satisfi with what he or she ha achiev . there can alway be anoth area to explor . i think it is veri import for a person to be will to improv hi or her qualiti by tri new thing . by that way , thi person can see what other area she or he is talent and interest in . for me , a person is a success one when she or he is open to new thing and get the success at the end . do what you have alway done is not a good way to show your success . if somebodi is good at some activ and ha just thi achiev , it doe not mean veri much to me . the real success can be observ when a person tri to be success in a new project or an area . for exampl , i am good at swim and i have had mani award from variou competit . but i also had an interest to play chess . i have taken cours for it and i am now a success chess player . with that success in new area , i see myself more success and talent . a success person should be abl to transfer hi or her success from one area to anoth . have confid that you can be good at in differ area and take risk is an indic of your motiv be success and thi is a characterist that i believ a success person should possess . in sum , i consid a person as a success if that person give import to improv her or her qualiti by tri new thing , avoid from onli do the thing she or he know well and open to the new experi . moreov , i think a success person should be good at transfer hi or her abil to variou situat . i also tri to be a person have such characterist and motivationg myself to tri new thing and not to fear from take risk .
