base on my current observ and person experiec , i agre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . first of all , young peopl nowaday are too occupi by class work . take myself for exampl , when i wa young school did not demand so much class work as they do today . my younger brother who goe to colleg now spend almost all of hi weekend work on class project . he bare ha anytim to do anyth that he is interest in . while in the past , my colleg wa not so demand and i had much more free time to engag in cummun activ . secondli , due to the advent of the internet and mobil phone , young peopl nowaday have veri few connect with the commun . young peopl nowaday spend most of their time in their room surf the internet or talk to their friend through the mobil phone . they seldom go out and meet peopl in the commun , not to mention offer ani help to the commun . recent , i had a chanc to visit a children hospit that i use to volunt when i wa in colleg . i wa surpriz by the few number of colleg student now volunt there . final , i find an obviou trend from recent newspap and magzin ; the number of hosipit and non-profit organizaion lack volunt is increas . especi , those activ that were tradit carri out by young peopl . for exampl , the taiwanes govern start a program some year ago to recruit young peopl to offer volunt work oversea . recent , i read an articl on the newspap say that now the govern is have difficulti get enough young peopl to help the commun . base on the three specif experi and observ i decrib abov , i agre with the statement that nowaday young peopl do not help their commun enough .
