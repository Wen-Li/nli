nowaday , oil becom even rarer and even more expens and some peopl believ that in thwenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . we will explain whi thi statement could occur or not in the futur . on the one side , petroleum is becom more and more expens to produc becaus there are limit area where we can find it and lot of them are unreach or unavail , for instanc becaus they are under big citi . moreov , govern are develop tube , train or bu to encourag peopl not use their own car and to pollut less . for exampl , lot of advertis for take the train instead of drive are current shown in the tube in pari . on the other side , the popul of third-world countri is grow , and at the same time , lot of peopl who were use the bike in china are consid by a car . futhermor , lot of worker still need a car when they do not live in big citi becaus buss are not as frequent . for thi reason , it is still easier for them to reli on their own car rather than on a bu that can pick them just everi hour . besid , scientist are consid develop car with hybrid motor , which reli both on electr and oil . it could be a veri good solut to the cost of the oil . for the moment , those car are puchas abov all in japan but thay may be soon be sold in all the countri of the world . to put it in a nutshel , the issu of the car is rather an issu of oil suppli . till hybrid car are not veri fame , the number of car could henc decreas . howev , it would rather be the case in big citi where peopl have other way to go to work . to my mind , twenti year is a veri short time to introduc hybrid car but it is also a vey short time to make peopl chang their behaviour by not use their can as often as today .
