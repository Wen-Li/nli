in korea , student who are befor enter a univers should memor most of evrryth to prepar the test of univers . whi should hey do memor everyth ? i think understand those and experi are more import than just learnig . there are some reason . first of all , if student just memor idea and comcept fot theit goal such as enter a univers , get a job , and graduat , will they rememb it long time ? i think the answer is `` no '' . becaus thier ultim goal are not learnig and understand for themselv . thu , they just have studi to enter a univers and if they enter a univers , they will forget it eaili becaus they got thier goal yet . second , if student do n't understand idea and concept , those will be furtil . it is becaus although they studi those , they did n't tri to understand idea . if they did n't understand , will they use the knowleadg ? and then can we call that is `` knowleadg '' ? the learnig that is not be understand is just wast . i think rather that not to know those better than it . final , in korea , there are a few exentr school now . those are same other school to learn . howev , the style of studi is differ . it is that their lesson are focus by understand studi . so , sometim they go out to learn in class time . they experi and understand everyth so accumul those . as a result , the student of the school enter a univers easier than ordinari school . thi tell us that understand is more impr in conclus , if student tri to understand idea and concept , actual they should spend time long . howev , the effort of them will appear clreali and develop themselv more .
