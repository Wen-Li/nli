in contemporari societi , special in one specif subject tend to be the most common thing . some peopl spend all of their live studi a particular year of the life of a king , or some kind of abstract thing relat to an unknown topic of algebra topolog . thi kind of peopl tend to extrem focu their point of view on a singl topic , and to examin it in everi side . i think that such an approach to an academ subject is a bit limit . in my opinion , one should have a broad knowledg of mani academ topic , rather than fossil himself on a singl point of a matter . first of all , i think that everyon should have a person amount of knowledg , and be prepar at least on the basic thing . everyon should know , for exampl , that the earth orbit the sun and not viceversa !! some peopl , instead , may know everyth about the poetri in south itali between 1900 and 1910 , but ignor at all such a basic thing . thi is rather an extrem exampl , but it is what happen in practic . anoth point pro have a broad knowledg of mani subject is the fact that there are mani thing that diserv to be studi . the world and human histori are so rich in beauti thing , that i think it is a crime to not take them in consider . an object to what i am say could be made : such a way to proceed , that is to fli from a flower to anoth like a bee , could lead to nowher . act thi way would bring noth more to societi . no improv can be reach . my opinion is that to invent someth new , it is necessari to grasp relationship between thing . for exampl , it is the contrast between classic mechan and electromagnet that lead to the theori of rel . no one would have though to rel if think to classic mechan or electromagnet separ . for thi reason , i think that everyon should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledg is better than a special on a limit , specif subject .
