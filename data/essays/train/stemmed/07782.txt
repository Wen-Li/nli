in fact , i disagre with the statement . whi ? becaus the internet . when the internet have n't been built , there are more interact between peopl . so you can see mani young peopl in their commun to care about the commun . the internet is so popular nowaday , those young peopl in public occas might disappear , but they have been use their way to take care of the commun . for exampl , young peopl can set up the commun in the internet . if the resid in the commun have some issu to discuss , they can enter the visual commun to chang their inform or give advic . commun by the internet is faster and more power than the tradit face-to-fac method . everyon in the commun ha access to the informaion immedi after these inform wa post in the commun of the internet . and they can react it right away . the govern can know the informaion sooner than befor and they can adjust the polici about the citi . moreov , young peopl do not alway sit in front of the comput . in my commun , mani young peopl volunt to help the elderli peopl in the commun . i , for instanc , make a routin to clean the hous belon to theelderli peopl whose child are far away the commun . sometim , i also serv as the tutor of the orphan in the orphanag . my neighbor , jame , also do the same thing with me and we all feel satisfi after help other . of cours , there are mani young peopl like us in our commun . base on the preced point i made , i can conclud that the new gener doe help their commun both vitural and pratic .
