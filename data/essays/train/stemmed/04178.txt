travel is a veri nice thing to do , for me i love travel and i did travel alot . there is actulli a diffrent idia for travel ether you travel with a group led by a toer guid or travel by your self . for me i prefar travel by my self becous i ca n't make a commet with a group that i do n't know . i love to have my own space in the citi i go to . i might need a guid for the citi , but i usuali take all the inform i need from the recept at the hotel and i just go everywher i like by my self or with friend but not with a group or guid . forthermor , i can combin between have fun of travel and relax at the same time , yet when u commet with a groub led by a tour guid you miss your relax some time by bee there for them on time or go to place that you do n't like just becous you are commet to them . final , i prefer travel by my self or with peapl i know and i like to have the best time ever .
