it is known that sever product do n't fulfil all the requir , which have been present by sale of these product . therefor , i agre with the idea that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . howev , i can understand the reason becaus these product have been produc and sale on that way . the econom system of the most countri in the world is the capit . in thi system peopl have to earn their own money by buy product or by do an activ or work . that mean there must be some peopl to sale product and other one to buy them . if nobodi buy a particullari thing , the market will stop produc that object . the product of that thing would be wast money . inde , the best way to make money must be found . becaus of thi , the trade of product becam import and the market could be invent . it develop help the politico-econom situat of each countri . on the one hand , there must be the posibl to buy necesari product like food and cloth . offer the necesari product with accept price , the market give facil to get these product in acces place ( e.g. food store ) . on the other hand , it is not possibl that everi store sale similar product . therefor , the market tri to discov new product which have to get necesari in the new societi . thi open the posibl to creat new articl and activ . altrough the human societi is chang and new product are be invent , peopl do n't buy all the product , becaus they are n't convinc of the qualiti . perhap they do n't realiz the advantag of have that new product . therefor , advertis have to present the product on way that convic the person to buy them . i can understand thi situat in the market and i think that thi way is sometim necesari to keep the econom situat of a countri stabl .
