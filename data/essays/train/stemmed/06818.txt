in my opinion an individu should poss suffici knowledg about hi key academ subejct along with posses excel skill in hi choic of specif subject . in thi competit world , one is suppos to have an all rounder person with a special or in other word masteri over that specif subject . from my experi , an all rounder person will be abl to achiev greater success social and profession as he 's sound in all of the relat area of hi studi but at the same time ha suffici knowledg so as not to fall back on ani discuss other than hi special . to start discuss about my opinion , let take the situat when one chose to studi all of hi key subject without master anyon of those . thi practic will result him be vulner to loos to each oppon who ha at least one of these subject as hi special , not ignor the increas possibl that the individu will be abl to particip in ani event or convers pertain to ani of hi subject area . anoth situat to consid will be , when one master onli specif subject without give consider attent to hi other subject , will lead him to a situat where he 'll excel in hi subject area convers but at the same time , he 'll not be in a situat to particip in a convers about ani other topic which is not hi subject . in thi situat the individu ha greater chanc of successd in hi area of special . we can clearli see that the number of benefit an individu can gain by follow either of the two statement will lead to number of disadvantag as well . as both of the statement ha it 's own set of pro and con , i would disagre with ani of these two statement taken alon . howev , combin both of the statement would lead to a much more sensibl and pragmat way of advanc in competit world .
