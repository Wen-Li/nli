i disagre with the claim that the best way to travel is in a group lead by a tour guid . sinc travel is often for leisur and entertain , travel in a group with a tourn guid would restrict my individu interest , my pace , and the intimaci of the group dynam . first , travel is suppos to be enjoy for the tourist . although a tour guid may be abl to lead the group toward the major and well-known attract , in hi or her attempt to appeal to the major of the tourist , mani tourist ' individu interest may be compromis . for instanc , if the town is intern famou for it wine but also ha a nice but small museum of wwi artifact , the tour guid is most like go to focu on wine tast rather than the histor artifact . howev , one of the tourist in the group may be a histori buff and is hope to expand hi collect of wwi artifact , he or she may miss out on the opportun of a lifetim conform to group interest . thu , in mani such case , travel is better done individu or in a small group of friend rather than in a group led by a tourn guid . also , travel is a chanc to onli to see and experi new thing but also to unwind . thu , the pace offer by a tour guid may restrict one 's abil to relax . for instanc , in a tour group , there may be peopl of all age group . typic , the younger tourist would be more energet , attempt to see everyth and speed up the group 's pace . howev , the older peopl in the group may just be hope to relax and enjoy the view at few select locat . thu , the dispar between the goal and pace of the tourist in the group may restrict mani 's travel experi and may even be the caus of addit stress . final , much intimaci and freedom is loss when travel in group led by a tour guid . sinc tour group are usual compos of random peopl across the nation , or even across the world , it may be difficult to feel comfort in their presenc . also , when travel in such a larg and unfamiliar group , freedom of speech and behavior is lost . for instanc , with adult around , teenger wo n't be abl to blast the music they love on the radio and with the children around , the adult wo n't be abl to talk about mani of the person detail of their life . convers tend to becom more superfici and restrict . henc , in mani case , travel in such a group led by a tour guid is not the best choic . thu , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . with restrict interest , pace , and freedom , i would not have a good travel experi and i think mani would feel the same way .
