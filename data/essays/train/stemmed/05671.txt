there are mani type of teach style in school . some teacher emphas to understand idea and concept , but other emphas just fact and result . both of teach style might have adventag . howev , i think the statement that unerstand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . befor we know a result , we have to know procedur , and we have to understand idea and concept to know procedur . in korea , they emphass fact and result . we just learn how to approch the fact and result . we do n't know whi some fact do that . we just know the fact . we just memor the fact . for exampl , when i learn about multipl , i just memor the fact as 2 multipli by 2 is 4 , 2 multipli by 3 is 6 . it also happen in high school becaus student in korea have to take a korean s.a.t for go to univers . korean s.a.t question want to just fact . in contrast , in the unit state , they emphas to understand idea and concept . student in the unit state learn mathmat less than korean student , but they learn whi the fact happen . it 's differ . student in korea learn `` how '' , but student in the unit state learn `` whi '' . a friend of mine , for exampl , came to the unit state when he wa a high school student . at that time , he wa good and high grade about mathmat in hi school in the unit state becaus he previous learn in korea . howev , when he went to a univers , and he also studi mathmat , he could n't veri well rather anoth american studen becaus he did n't understand the idea and concept , also he did n't know procedur . it is not onli mathmat . so , i think that understand idea and concept is more import and a kind of best learn skill .
