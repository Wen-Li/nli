there is a seri of factor or consider to take into account concern thi issu . it is a commonplac that the risk is a foundament and effect part of our everday life , despit thi some peopl tend to avoid the risk in order to maintain a sort of stabil . the obviou question which aris is : `` whi some peopl are more inclin to risk than other peopl ? '' . in my opinion success peopl are more well dispos to risk than other , becaus of variou reason . in the first place peopl who are alreadi success could risk in order to improv their own condit of life or of work or , in some case , in order to be richer and richer . howev the tendenc to risk is not onli caus by someth of materi but also mental factor could , in part , contribut to thi behaviour : who is success is more sure of hi own abil and capac than a dustman ( for instanc ) , for thi reason he believ that the risk could not affect him , or at least , it could affect him in minim part ( natur it is not true , but it could be hi belief ) . certainli risk call risk but success men know well thi theori : thi is prove by the fact that often success men are owner of big financi compani , and the financi world rapres the most signif `` habitat '' of risk : for economist accept what they present have , even if it is for instanc a remun thing , mean be in a state of lack of opportun , for them not risk is as danger as risk . there is no point in consid the attitud to risk as an extrem subject way of think but for men who have an import role in the societi it is , i think , a kind of drug , without risk they are empti , they are alway push by the possibl to improv their life or the life of their compani . take everyth into account i believ that success peopl tend to risk for their `` natur '' , but it can not be forgotten the the risk is someth of acquisc and unfores . and we need to pay attent at it .
