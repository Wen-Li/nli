i total agre with student should understand the idea and concept rather learn about fact , becaus get idea or concept on a particular task lead them to analys about the concept and think about it advantage and disadvantag and how it work and final how it can be manipul . learn about the fact is import but it not that import as understand an idea becaus learn a fact is someth perceptu that is we can come to conclus what we learnt out of the fact after the incid took place recent ar in the past but in case of get an idea or concept we can ourselv analys the end result . onc in our univers we had a chemistri class on variou type of chemic substanc their usag and their harm effect . mani of the student were not concentr on the class . and few were listen but not tryiong to get the exact matter what the professor wa discuss . and they were mind their own way and the professor announc we are go to have a practic lab assign next monday and the class dispers . when the class met on next monday we all were in the chemistri lab for our lab assign . mani student were a bit worri that they did not pay attent in the class last friday but if they are not go to complet the assign they will be loos the grade . and most of the student were worri but out of fear student start practic out of their previou knowledg and after some time there wa an unfortun incid which happen in the lab there wa a huge explos in the lab and the group of student who were perform the experi and few besid them got injur slightli . but final they recov after a week that wa good part though . so no one can ever say we can learn out of the the fact after such a unfortun happen . thu i believ it better to get to know about the idea and concept for a student not onli in few matter but if he get to know the concept that will remain in hi brain forev . not onli regard subject but also in other worldli matter understan concept play a vital role .
