educ is understand as well as learn . in my opinioun it is import for student to learn fact and at the same time also understand idea . it depend upon the situat and experi . understand idea and concept is import so as to hnow how thing could be . for exampl , a concept of drive or like travel faster to a place give us the idea of a car . it tell us to use a car for travel . but for travel a car we have to also need to consid the fuel to be use for it , the cost of drive etc . henc the student need to relat their idea with fact need for it . idea are more imagineri while fact are practic . but if we dont imagin or think how can we make thing happen ? but to make a practic thing happen we need to learn certain fact that are necessari to realis the idea . for instanc , a student think to make a garment . it is firstli import for him to have an idea of what kind of garment doe s/he want to make . s/he must decid the look of the garment like the colour , the lenght , size etc . but thi is not over . to make the garment s/he ha to know the fact that thi will need a fabric to make it , a pair of scissor to cut it and then to sew the garment . henc a final product can be made . therefor the student do need to understand the idea and concept but at the same time also learn fact to realis thier idea . onli understand and conceptualis idea is not enough for a real thing to be made . a practic knowledg is also requir for a student to be success in hi life . henc i think a student should give import to both , understand idea and also learn the practic of life .
