i disagre with the statement . i know that older peopl work hard and have to take care of the famili , bill and other stuff . but student 's also have to studi , obey parent and young peopl 's life is limit . i born in korea . and my parent told me that i should be happi becaus i do not have to work . but they do not know what young peopl are go through . thi wa the typic life of mine befor i come to u.s.a , go to school 8 , come home 3 : 30 , go tutor from 4 until 8 , and then go to anoth tutor . when i get home it 's 1 a.m . mayb older peopl think that we live happi life we have no life for fact . and reason that we do n't have life is becaus of adult . we are told to do what our parent tell us to do . they tell us if you studi hard you will have better life later . moreov , younger peopl have limit life young peopl can not work if their parent do n't allow them to work or drive . older life are not they can do whatev they want . their life is made by their choic . older can chose wether they want to work or not . nobodi is go to say , '' hey !!! you have to work ! '' becaus they are adult nobodi can control them . they have their own right to be that way . howev , think about the young peopl like high school student . they have to studi for sat , psat , act , toefl ... etc. we also need to worri about friendship , look , love , and colleg payment . so mani thing to worri about and the pressur of the parent . young peopl do not have the freedom of choic and they are attach to lot of test to worri about . i bet old peopl do n't think that test is enjoy of their live . for these reason , the statement should chang like thi `` old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do '' .
