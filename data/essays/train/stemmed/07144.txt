i never think about thi argument befor . i hope that the phrase in bold at the left of monitor are true , but i do n't know if thi will be in the futur . i am onli twentythre year old and twenti year are a lot of time for me , and so in thi period will happen . my dream is live in a world wirh fewer car , becaus i think we can do everyth with public transport or bike . now i live in milan the one of biggest town in europ and i alway can move to one part to other part of the town by my bike , so i think most of popul of citi can do it . if is immposs move by bike i thin k that we can take an autobu or other pubblic transport move i nhe citi . anoth exampl of thi argum is the china . in thi countri the most of popul move by bike . thi is import in my opinion and thi kind to move can permit a world with fewer car . i think that car are a good mead of trasport for the travel and a good logist solut . some year ago i wa in spain for a trip with my four friend , and with them i went all spain alog by car . thi wa good expier for me and so in my opinion in relet case the car are allow . anoth aspect where the car or simila meand of transport are necessari is to solv the import logist problem like the transport medicin , ill peopl or for emerg case like a fire disast . in conclus i hope the number of car decreas immediatli , day by day , so when i will be adult there will be fewer car in the world .
