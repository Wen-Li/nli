the world is in perman chang and evolut therefor we should follow thi evoluion in order to improv our life and knowledg . so there are some peopl who tri new thing and take risk rather than keep the old method even if they know veri well how to use it . person i like to be differ from the other , so i use all the time new techniqu and method . thi new way to do is veri import becaus it could be a sourc of success . to illustr more what i am say i have an exampl ; last year i had my train at a small compani exactli in the financi depart . what i discov dure my presenc , at that firm , is that the financi staff doe not use the technolog in order to improv the qualiti of the work . they do not have a comput , imagin a compani now in 2000 year and it doe not have a comput . thi caus a lot of problem to the compani especi in analys the daili situat of the compani . so what i did is that i talk to my boss in order to buy some comput becaus they will improv the work and he will need less peopl . after a veri long discuss he accept to buy just one comput at the begin in order to test what i said . after one week he told me that hi staff is veri satisfi and they have now more time to do other import thing rather then calcul some small oper . but if you decid to work with news thing you should accept to take risk but i think that is a veri logic result . becaus you will use new method and mayb new procedur that are not all the time good . so to solv thi problem , i think that rsik repres a part of our life especi if you decid to tri thing differ . but you should rememb that when you take a lot risk you will win more . to illustr that , i will tell you an exampl base especi on my life as a would a bussi woman . when i invest more money at ani project automat i think about the risk that i run . becaus it will be as hudg as the imprtanc of the money i invets . so to sum up i want to say that i agre with the statement simpli becaus new method and risk are a part of my professionnel life .
