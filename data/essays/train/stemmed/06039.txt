i disagre with the statement that say it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are sever reason whi i disagre . the first reason is that if student onli learn the fact than they would not be as creativ as the other student who actual understand idea and concept . peopl have the abil to think so that if they just learn the fact they might memor the fact and not understand . for exampl , i have experienc that situat . i studi for my test and not understand but memor all the fact . so i could not think of anyth outsid of the box . i fail that test from that now i usual tri to understand idea and concept . the second reason is that if you understand idea and concept you will eventu get the fact too . like i kind of said at the first paragraph , understand help you studi more . it stay in your head longer and you will not forget easili . on the other hand , learn fact , you will forget easili becaus you just memor it and did not understand . the third reason is that understand idea and concept are the basic step . if you want to use anyth you have to understand idea and concept first . for exampl , if you want to use a comput you have to understand idea and concept of how to use it , like read the direct . it is not just learn the fact . to sum up , i do not agre with the statement . i serious think that the more import for student are to understand idea and concept and not just learn fact . i think that learn fact would help student for at the moment but not for the long run .
