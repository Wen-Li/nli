sinc i wa a child i thought that car wa the most import way to transport in the world . now i think that there are too much car on the street in the most of industri countri . big number of car in europ , usa , japan . .. is the most human problem in twentyon centuri . more peopl think that in futur we will drive futur car with hydrogen aliment , becaus thi element can not produc ani pollut . but i do n't think so . i 'm a student of engin logist and transport and i know what i say . big studi about thi hydrogen car shew how hidrogen aliment is more expens than oil or natur ga aliment . i 'm so disagre with the phrase that i can read on my left . in twenti year i think will be more car than there are today . i 'm so sure of that becaus there are much statist that shew that salari peopl will grow up , so they can buy a car easier . i think also that anyon like travel in comfort way . about thi i can say for myself experi that it 's so bettr travel by own car than train for exampl . .. if you have a trip with your car you do n't have ani time to respect and you feel more free and indipend than ani other way to move . final i think that thi afferm wo n't true , but i think car pollut is a great problem in our societi .
