in the modern world we are abl to sell good which are product in europ all round the world . to let our potenti custom know about our good or servic we need to ad them . thank to the modern mass media : tv , internet and the press , we can ad our product everywher . ad could be pictur or tv clip or internet banner where we can explain which are the use of our product , what custom can do by it and how their life will be improv use that product . so we use the ad to pesuad peopl to buy our product for it characterist or peculiar . someon said that `` the advertis is the soul of the commerc '' , no sentenc ha been so true like that . often , for thi reason , who make ad tri to give to the product more than it ha realli got . in thi sens i agre with thi statement becaus veri often thi peopl tri to persuad us with fals adject , fals implicit mean tri to forc us to buy that product . produc of ad often can persuad peopl to buy their product , but i think that , if the product is n't like the ad on tv , peopl will be veri disappoint with it and they will talk to other peopl explain what happen . in thi situat the compani which ad will lose hi possibl to sell anymor hi product . anyway i think that we need an intern author which check all the ad tri to delet lie and what can illeg persuad peopl to buy that product . we need a code of advertis and who make ad must respect those law and he should be clear with the potenti custom . i know is difficult to creat an intern author , especi in those countri where also the market is without specif law that can regul it . but i think that if all the develop countri join the effort , some improv could be done .
