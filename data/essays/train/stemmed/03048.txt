i complet agre that most advertisement make product seem much better than they realli are . i guess thi ha becom a common way of plubic to all kind of product . commonli the public agent are order to make the product look better in order to make the client obtain a lot more costum . thi public agent use a lot of technic to make the product look better , for exampl they use especi softwar like photoshop to increas the size of the product or make it brighter , or mayb an artifici imit of the product that not necesarli have same textur of look . eventhough one can observ thi situat mostli on food product . the fast food ha becom a product that often make advertisement that make food look a lot of more better than they realli are . for exampl the big chain of fast food restaur often show some pictur of each of the product they offer so the person can make his/her choic by observ the pictur . when the food is deliv to the costum he/sh notic that the apper of the real product is not even close to that one shown in the pictur , for exampl , the person can get a smaller hamburgu or mayb a differ type of bread in a sandwich . more over the fast food , thi situat ha been increas in all type of product like tooth past , deterg or even cloth or shoe . sometim when a person see an advertis comercialis shoe , they commonli look softer and more confort than they realli are , when the person get into the shop and fit them often notic that the shoe were not as good as they look on televison . thi certainli is a problem that is sourround us and overal is make peopl lose a lot of time . i think there should exist some kind of reagul that could control the content of the advertis , so peopl alway can receiv what they are look , in that way there would be less problem of reclam , and it will be reflect in the reput of the compani .
