i think it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject that to special in onli one subject . if you have a broad knowledg you have a wider rang that you can refer to in all situat of life . as a child for exampl it help you in school , afterward it is easier to get a job becaus you can easier pass the applianc test and in the end it help you to prepar your own childen for life . on the one hand you get a lot of profit out of a wider rage but on the other hand it may be more suffici to have one subject where you have specif knowledg in . thi specif knowledg is especi inport in work life . for the most job you need to have sprecif knowledg about one subject . for exampl travel agent need to have a veri good knowledg in geographi . but in addit to thi i think it is impor to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject at the same time . if we keep with the exampl of a travel agent , travel agent have to have a wider knowledg than just in geographi . for exampl they need to be good in mathemat to be abl to calcul the price correctli and furthermor they need to be abl to understand , write und spreak differ languagu in order to commun with agenc and hotel all over the world and in the end they also have to be in good knowledg of the languag of the countri they life in becaus that is the languag they commun with everyday . and it is not just the travel industri that ha to have all those differ skill . in all diplomat , busi , sientif and mani more job you need thi wide rage . or what do you think would happen if a sientist know how to do the math to finish hi experi but the doe n't know how to commun in hi languag and how to write down hi result ? - no one would profit from thi . with thi exampl you can see that it is far more import to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one sprecif one . all in all i think it is import to have both , to special in one subject but to have the wide rage of all subject at the same time .
