i agre with the statement . i person strongli believ that as an student , to understand idea and concept in ani subject is veri import . there are sever reason of whi i support the statement base on my person experi . first , to understand idea and concept requir certain level of read comprehens skill so that student can fulli acquir the essens of the fact or the context that they are tri to understand . in other word , student are not just understand the concept , but gain and improv the read skill to interpret what is written and said in their textbook . secondli , by fulli understand the context of the fact , student can translat what they have learn and share with other , which enabl them to discuss their own idea and opinion . i think thi is a veri import excercis as student bacaus by do that , student can learn how to express their level of understand as well as to have the oppoutun to hear about other ' opinoin on the same subject , which also enebl them to look at thing differ if other opinion are differ from their own . thirdli , just learn fact might end up make student to memor the fact and end up forget everyth as time goe by especi if the context are not interest to student . grow up in japan , where style of educ tend to focu larg on memor , i know how danger it could be . in japan , even in the subject of mathemat , which is requir high level of understand the concept and logic behind the equat that are often use in solv problem , student are told and encourag to rememb fact ( in thi case , mani complic equat ) . just memor the fact and not fulli understand the idea behind them , those fact can not be stay in the student `` brain '' not even as inform , but disappear soon later on . have lisit those reason , i strognli believ that it is import for student to understand idea and concept about whatev they learn in school . in addit , to make them realiz what they have lear , it is ideal to have the opportun to share their thought . by do those activ , their knowledg will not disappear as `` memor '' fact will do .
