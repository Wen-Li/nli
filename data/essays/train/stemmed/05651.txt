to my mind it is not correct to say that one had to take everi risk to be success . mayb it is easier to becom famou with a revolut idea and a chang or even break of common rule but i think it will also work with tradit method if you are qualifi enough . the phrase `` noth ventur , noth gain '' might be correct in some situat of life but i think if you make up relev and import desicion too quick and without think care about it you can easili stap in a trap . of cours you should not be stubburn and close your mind against everi new technolog or invent . to be open-mind is one of the most import characterist in time of global . but i think that it is even more import not to forget our root and listen to old peopl with their long year experi and the wisdom they get through it . i will present an exampl out of equesterian sport . dure the last twenti year a mass of new , differ , altern and better method becom popular through the mass media . but if you see the work of a tradit trainer you often observ better success in the end . if someon tri everyth new , he/sh can not focuss on one method onc . and the hors you work with will be irrit . so tri out everyth and take everi risk is the wrong way here . if you risk everyth you also can loos everyth and if you built up your life on solid , tradit bottom without take everi risk you do not reach everyth but you also did not loos what you alreadi have . as a conclus i say that sometim it is better to do what you alreadi know and do thi perfect than alway focuss on new think and take the risk .
