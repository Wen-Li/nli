i agre with the idea that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in one specif subject . there are two reason for that . one reason is becaus i believ that broader knowledg make me possibl to interact with more diversifi peopl and thi will result in creat a new view or new perspect in my mind . if i were someon who know onli chemistri and ha no intim knowledg of other academ field , peopl with whom i can make friend would be onli someon like me who is a glutton of chemistri . i imagin thi would not be salutari for myself , be aloof from the rest of the world . in the contrati , if i had interest and knowledg about , for exampl , german literatur as well , asid from the major in chemistri , it would be possibl for me to get acquaint with german peopl as well as to join a literatur club . in thi way , i can broaden my friend network which enabl me broaden my view . thi broad knowledg would also be favour for childeren when we conduct educ . the children tend to ask us so mani question , thi or that . if we could not answer at all , it would be disastr for their growth . the other reason is a littl bit more practic than the first one . in my opinion , have wider knowledg make us more advantag dure job-hunt activ . thi idea may not be appli if somebodi want to becom an univers faculti or scholar . in thi case , we are requr to have veri special knowledg on one topic . howev , if you want to work in an organ , the personnel depart check whether we have diversifi knowledg , so that we are such peopl who accept ani kind of direct , which show our flexibl attitud . from these two reason , i think it is better to have a wide-rang knowledg .
