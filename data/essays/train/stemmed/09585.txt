i total disagre with the given statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject than to special in mani subject for mani reason . becaus in that case one lose hi interest about one particular subject , lose hi masteri skill , and worst of all he wo n't get a good posit in hi job . to start with , one ha to develop interest to get a good hold about a subject but when the student ha to do masteri in all hi subject than it put extra demand on hi mental as well as physic statu . thi in turn consum all hi energi and then make him more letharg toward hi field . sooner he will lose interst and won , t concentr in studi . thi can affect the grade . secondli i strongli believ that a student ca n't get masteri on all subject . ther are some limit on all human be , in term of cognit abil , the memori and learn part . it will be veri rude on our part to strain the student with so much of difficult task . we can alway adapt to someth simpler and make life more beauti . it fare enough to be master of one subject . the third and the most import arguement is if a student ha not done special in one particular subject then he may lose the oppurtun of get a good job becaus nowaday busi look for skill individu . that will be a great loss on hi monetari part which inde is an import commod . after all we all studi to earn good money for ourself and our famili and make a bright futur . howev , one can not deni the good side of thi issu , that is one may sound fool when a person don , t have a good background about a particular issu other than is special subject , especi in a friend circl or while teach lesson to the student but i feel that the advantag of masteri outweigh the drawback . so i believ it good to do masteri than gain knowledg of everyth as i don , t like to be jack of all and master of none . i don , t want to lose interest and neither a good job .
