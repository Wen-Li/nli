i do not think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are two main reason to support my oppinion . when peopl thnk about futur of the car , mani of they might be think about the oil problem . actual oil price is geet higher and higher in these day and some analysit say that all the oil we have now will be gone next 50 year . but we can not ignor about abil of the new technolog . not onli japans car compani but also all of the world compani are fascin to creat new car which is not depend on oil enagi . soura car and car run by the power of hydrogion . and aol new enagi is realiz now . for exampl in brazil they get the enagi from the plant . other reason is that we are so depend on car life . weus car everi day . we ca n't live without car . especi unit state , countri is too learg so that other trnsportat is not be devepo enough . in jaapan peopl are also depend on car life . to tell the truth , leg of human are car . so we will never be abl to say good bay to the car . i think it 's sad thing that we are so depend on car life . but i also think we can creat much better car to us and to the environ after twenti year . so that i think there will be not fewer car in use than there are today . i think it can be increas .
