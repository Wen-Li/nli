it is well known that the amount of inform is increas exponenti and becaus the develp of global and massiv comun technolog such as internet , the avalaiblil of inform is increas too . that is the reason whi tradit educ method must be reconsid . inde , it is virtual imposs to aboard knowledg procecess , with onli memory-focu aproach consid the human limit , and the amount of inform avail . i think is better to tri make the student to learn and understand idea and concept rather than tri to make them learn a lot of fact . howev i consid as necessari fact to give them enough skill for search and handl inform propertli . in addit , student should learn in their class how to correl concept , fact , and idea in order to develop new concep . that is the way knowledg and scienc grow up . the memori can fail some time ( i know that by my own experi ) , but the concept are alway there to help . i think that as an exampl of what i am say is the scienc symposium and meet . the speaker just have like twenti minut or so to talk about their research project which had taken them sever year in most of the case . so what they do ? they talk about the concept they studi and they develop . in conclud , i think that the student that have clear their concept can go on faster in learn precess .
