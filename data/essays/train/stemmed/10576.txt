i agre with thi statement . here is my explan whi and how i beleiv so . success peopl do not quantifi their success by where they current are in their live . they constantli strive to acheiv more than what is normal possibl . they have a desir to constantli excel and acheiv a higher level at anyth they do . onc the next level is reach that doe not satisfi them , they continu to charg along to the next possibl level . often time thi involv take risk in situat that ha never been either tri or known . these individu have a special knack of push the bar to the next level and chang ` statu quo ' . thi doe not mean they do not fail but they do not take failur to be the end . they are quick learner and are abl to adapt and identifi new way to approach a tough problem . one key characterisitc of a success person is that they are innov . there are world-wid exampl of innov like thoma edison , bill gate etc . they are never afraid to ventur in to the unknown or take risk . and becaus they do so they are often goal-driven and do not give up until they get to a solut . thi allow them to develop and test new concept by master the well known one . they understand the differ between do thing well versu except . their ` out of the box ' idea provid them the opportun to creat solut that other would not think of . but it is not just the thought of great idea , it 's their abil to work dileg and have the tenac to surviv all odd to execut on those idea that help them produc result . thi is what differenti them from other . success peopl do not think their current place in life defin their futur . they know be success in life mean stay in the game , never giving-up and treat it as a marathon not a race !
