these day there are a lot of trip in a group led by a tour guid but i do not agre thi idea . of cours , a tour guid know everi inform about the destin and tell us kindli . howev , i think that thi kind of tour make the pleasur of a travel limit . the pleasur of a travel mean that go to the unknown place , talk with the local peopl , you name it . in the travel led by a tour guid you can go to famou place , eat local food , stay at nice hotel but it is difficult to experi the pleasur which i said . i went to new york with my friend on summer vacat and of courc went to the world trade center , empir state build and so on but the most interest memori is to talk with local peopl . i am not good at english but new yorker i met were veri kind and they tri to understand my bad english . then i felt the happi to commun with foreign peopl . in the travel led by a tour guid all schedul are decid by the guid so i think that you can not have enough time to do what you want to . in term of money i think that th travel led by a tour guid is cheaper than an individu travel but we can not buy memori by money so i choos an individu treavel . some peopl like to go to famou place and stay at great hotel . for such peopl the travel in a group led by a tour guid is better but for the other peopl like me the individu travel is better .
