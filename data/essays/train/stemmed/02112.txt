i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus of the follow two reason . first reason come from the freedam of each person 's thought . our present societi allow us the freedam of valu . whether enjoy life in the former part of the life or in the latter part basic depend on each person 's judgement about valu . there is no predomin notion that young peopl have to serv for the nation nor peopl have to enjoy their life when they are young . the gener statement that youg peopl enjoy life more than older peopl might appli to some , but never appli to all the person . for me , i think it desir to enjoy life equal both in the former part of my life and the latter in a differ way . on thi point , i will explain later in thi essay . second reason is that our lifespan ha extend veri much compar to the past era . in the past , it might be benefici to enjoy much dure the youth time becaus it wa difficult to enjoy life in the latter part of life own to the diseas and the limit life time . now averag lifespan is over seventi for male and eiti for femal . after the retir , we can enjoy a plenti of free time . they can also use their experi to enjoy life better . as for the second reason , oppon might argu that young peopl also have the advantag for enjoy life . for exampl , young peopl have the advantag in the phyisic . moreov , in term of the mental aspect , young peopl have the fresh feel and think . therefor , they might argu it is unwis not to enjoy life when we are young . on thi point , i agre that young peopl have thier own advantag for enjoyn life . howev , as i note abov , old peopl also have the advantag in term of freetim and experi . therefor , my answer is that peopl should enjoy life both in the former part of life and the latter part util own advantag .
