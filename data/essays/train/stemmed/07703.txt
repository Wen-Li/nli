in these last year big discuss have been rais about the most effect method of teach . two main faction have result : one magnifi the advantag of learn concept and idea , and anoth stress the import of a solid knowledg . i think that neither of the part is definit right , sinc i believ that `` the true lie in the middl '' . the first faction highlight the import of know fact in order to continu to advanc in learn . moreov , they critic the counterpart assert that without strong knowledg the most complex problem can not be solv even with the strongest deduct . for exampl , if a student need to face ani kind of studi , he need to know all the fact on which each argument is develop . on the other side , their countepart contrast such opinion affirm that teach concept and idea permit student to reach automat everi kind of fact . moreov , it allow student to reinterpret all the fact they learn from new point of view . for instanc , learn the basic concept of the style of an author in literatur allow student to understand well all hi book without ani strain . moreov , they can compar their own opinion with that of the author and can reinterpret in a differ manner the same argument . in fact , it is quit common in class incentivijng student to discuss about social condit in which dant wrote it commedia to obtain a differ point of view . in summari , mani debat have been rais about the optim method of teach . mani teacher assert that fact are need to learn in order to obtain a complet and strong knowlegd from school , while mani other think that basic concept and indea are enough for student to undestand and learn fast . i person believ that a strong knowledg should be integr with a good possess of the underli concept , becaus in thi way student can reach a real critic knowledg .
