i do not agre at all with the fact that is more import for student to understand concept rather then learn fact . therefor my opinion is that both those goal are need to be accomplish from a student dure hi or her studi period , thi could be hight school or univers . preciselli it is even more import at univers becaus , in thi period of hi life , the student is supos to learn a job . for instanc i studi polit scienc in itali , at la sapienza univers , witch is consid one of the best universyti in my countri . while i wa learn all the subject of my cours i realiz that they where perfect and complet in the teoret area but they lack in the practic area . for exampl in the law cours whe studi all the articl of our civil code , and the professor wa veri strict dure the exam . on the other hand nobodi of the student had the chanc to look to an exampl of contract . obvious thi is a realli import part of the cours , in fact a friend of mine who studi with me , had enourm difficulti on work after graduat . she went work in a veri famou law farm , and she had to work four month not bee pay becaus she did n't know how to write a contract . althought i had anoth fantast experi that confirm my opinion . a coupl of year ago i went studi at the intern center of photographi in new york citi . eventhought i wa a littl afraid of studi with a differ system i found it much easier and much more challengin at the same time , even if it seem a contradict it is not ! in thi school i learn a lot about the theori of photographi , like tecniqu and histori of photographi . yet i practic even more . i shoot with lot of differ kind of camera , the view camera , a digit camera and the olga . for all these reason i think learn fact and how to practic them in the real life is veri import for all student .
