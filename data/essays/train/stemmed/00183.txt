the problem is if it is better to have a gener academ prepar or to have a special in one specif subject . i am not so agre with thi statement and now i will tri to explan whi . the advantag to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is that you know `` someth of all '' , you can spend it in mani sector of the `` world of work '' and you can do well wherev you want . but on the other hand , you know someth of all but you know it less than a person that have a specif prepar in that , so for an ipotet work a special person will be prefer instead of a person with a gener prepar . instead a person with a special have some problem if he find a work that he doe not know well , he can be confus on what to do . on the other hand the advantag to have a specif prepar is to do well what we kn final in my opinion we shoud have a basic knowledg , a basic prepar on mani academ subject , and then we shoud have a specif area of knowledg to spend better on the `` world of work '' .
