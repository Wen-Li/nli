i person believ that one of the main trait of success peopl , is their abil to tri new thing and take risk , while keep a veri moder and limit approach in life will probabl diminish a lot the opportun of a person . in my opinion the key aspect is be open to new idea , trend and influenc becaus onli by have an approach like thi you learn about new thing , push your boundari and discov new opportun . all of these requir a fair amount of risk . i do n't neccessarili agre that the more risk there is involv and the better it is . i just think that by take calcul risk a person could incred increas it 's chanc for success . a perfect exampl is my grandfath . he wa a small carpet wholesal in itali in the mid 60 's , when he realiz that he could have made much more money if he went directli to turkey , and directli import carpet from there . he wa the first one to do it , and when the other dealer heard what he want to do , most of them tought that he had lost hi mind . it soon turn out to be a veri smart idea , and within a coupl of year he becam the biggest wholesal of antiqu rug in europ . i think that the approach that a person choos depend a lot from it 's aspir . not everyon want to becom rich , powerful or success , some peopl are happi with what they have and do n't see the need for chang . thi is whi they keep on do what they alreadi know how to do well . the problem is that if what you know to do well , for ani reason is not good enough anymor you are in big troubl . some one could know veri well how to use the telegraph , the problem is that today most peopl either use telephon , fax machin and email . these tool achiev the same thing , in a better and faster manner . the way that i tri to leav my life is by bein open to new influenc , tri new thing , take calcul risk with the hope one day of becom success
