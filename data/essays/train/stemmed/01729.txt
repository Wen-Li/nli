i think that for student is more import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . in my opinion , if you understand the concept , you have alway time to learn fact or date . in children educ , for exampl , it 's import to give them the instrument to understand natur and societi . i think it 's not so import to fill them with date and fact . morev , if a child understand a concept , he will keep it in mind for the rest of hi life . if he learn a fact without understand it , he will forget it in a month . for exampl , i can rememb poem that i learn when i wa 6 year old , just becaus my teacher explain the mean of them . i can rememb song and histor fact becaus i had an explen of them . if a teacher tell a fact without explain it for the children ha no sens and they do n't put attent on it . the same is in adult educ . in the univers of medicin , for exampl , is much more import to understand how to visit a patient , than to know exactli the name of the 56 bone of the bodi . you alway have time to take a book and learn it . i have to mention that there are fact or notion that peopl need to know . for exampl a doctor , of cours ha to understand how the bodi work and how to visit a patient , but he also ha to know the dosi of the medica or the name of the most import part of the bodi . an antropologist ha to understand the human behavior but he also ha to know about histori and languag and cultur . so , even if idea and concept are more import in educ , there are some fact and notion than student have to learn .
