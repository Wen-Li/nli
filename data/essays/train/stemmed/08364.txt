ye , i am agre with thi statement becaus if the student understand clearli and know the idea and the concept of someth , they can expect what to wait and how to act in ani situat . is better be prepar than learn on the way and receiv punish por that . so is veri import that the student be prepar all they can , studi and learn all the tool the human be need on their live . the educ is veri import becaus thi help the person to resolv the daili problem and get a better live . i think a person dont have knowledg is a person dont have noth to talk and to say the to the other peopl . an educ person is better becaus thi knowledg help you to your entir life and not to be an ignor . ye ignor is the better word to describ a not educ person becaus if you dont know about noth how you can share with other your opinion about someth , about ani topic . so if you understand the idea and concept , you are not a ignor person and you the talk with anyon about ani topic and you can defend your point or statement of someth . then you go to the fact , that is like an exampl of the idea or concept you are observ . actual , thi fact help you to undestarnd more cleari your idea and concept but , if you don know and understand what is the concept you could never see , how the fact work , whi the fact is , so you maintain as a ignor all your life becaus you see someth but dont know what is it . in summeri i agre thi satat about that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , becaus the intellig and brillant peopl have a trick , their trick is , the knowledg and the educ . if you are a educ peopl you are a person with a lot of experi and knowlegd to share in your life . that is veri good .
