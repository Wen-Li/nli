young and old peopl both enjoy life with their best they can do . young peopl have some problem too same as to for the older one . but here i think that the young one gener enjoy more that that of the old peopl . in my opinion , young think less about their futur and the outcom of their deed . while in case of older peopl they generali think about the outcom of their misde so what they do is care as compar to young peopl . most of the old peopl gener lost their purpos of live and wait for the death , inde , some enjoy their life , regardless of the worri at home . in joint famili gener old peopl get the respect but when thing come to the nuclear famili , old one are neglect . but it is not in the case of the young one they are love by the whole famili member and most of their mistak are neglect . thi carri them to go on enjoy more . appear the the next thing in the context . obvious , the old peopl have lost their charm face , their well tone bodi and now they have lose skin with lot of rach and water is comong out of their mouth . they seem littl ugli but young-on are cute and lovabl . thi make them to be love by most of the peopl and get support to do thing more and enjoy them . one of the most import thing old peopl gener sleep late night and wakeup earli in the thi distract most of the peopl and me too . they wakeup and will do someth , which gener disturb other sleep and i love mornig sleep . and young peopl also enjoy it a lot . in thi way i think that accord to abov base exampl young peopl enjoy more than old peopl .
