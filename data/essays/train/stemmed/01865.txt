i disagre . there are sever reason whi i disagre with statement that say like young peopl do n't have enough time to help their commun . first , i think help their commun can be a great chanc to learn about how to work . i focu on have lot of experi dure the twenti all the time . there is a word in korea , `` to be a success man , you should learn and learn , get more and more experi '' . as thi word , learn and have experi is realli import for ani kind of person . besid , you can have a chanc to get togeth with peopl meet first time . from my person experi , the time you should have to be more friendli is not easi . howev , after that difficult time , you can have new friend . and also , i think peopl should know about their commun well . becaus , the commun are the place where peopl decid to live , they must have mani imform about their commun to do n't have a bad sight of their leader and chang . to do a new thing that is not concern with your studi or work can be felt as a burdern . also some young peopl think it as a wast of time . but if peopl chang mind and encount brave , peopl can obtain new thing and make their life more fresher . these are the reason whi i prefer to help commun than not to do .
