although some peopl prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid , i strongli prefer to travel individu . in my opinion , travel in a group offer sever drawback . first of all , travel in a group prevent you to discov thing by yourself becaus you alway stay with the group . in addit , you alway reli on the guid . in contrast , travel individu allow you to discov place alon . for exampl , when i wa in egypt , i notic that the local popul wa nicer when you were travel alon than when you were part of a group . second , group travel have the same schedul . they usual eat at the same time . in addit , they alway have the same food . besid , group member should stay togeth . that mean that you can not realli be independ . wherea , travel individu can let you more opportunitu to discov the local food , local monument which are not describ by a guid . furthermor , you can choos to visit the monument when there are less peopl . therefor , i think that you are in a better posit to appreci the sight see . third , i think that group travel are too noisi and are sometim veri disrespec toward a cultur . as a matter of fact , i notic that the group tend too be veri annoy . on the contrari , the individu tourist will tri to fit into the environ . he gener show more respect toward the local popul and show more curios . besid , travel individu can offer the possibl to be in contact with the peopl of the countri . in contrast , when you are in a group , you are less curiou to go talk with the local popul . final , i would say that travel in a group led by a tour guid can be the wors way to discov a differ countri and anoth cultur .
