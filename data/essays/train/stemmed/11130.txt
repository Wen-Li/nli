from my point of view , i total agre thi statement : young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . nowaday , a great mani phenomena demonstr that mani youngster are enjoy their golden life time than elder peopl . i can list them more reason as follow . first of all , we should accept thi turth about the limit on human 's energi dure their whole life-span . as a matter of factor , young peopl have more physic energi than elder . an increas number young peopl can have extra energi to enjoy their beauti life with mani method . for instanc , they can make a wonder trip or visit to variou place as also go oversea . let take my own experi for exampl , in thi summer , i had a wonder trip to five differ countri of europ , includ germani , switzerland , franc , netherland , as well as beligum . at same time , i took total sixteen day to visit the berlin wall , lourv museum and also mani famou histor site and fantast landscap . both of them can demonrtr a young peopl ha enough energi to enjoy life . the second reason is from financi aspect of a person 's daili life . young have the econom abil can offer their expens on entain , trip and ani kind of abil for their life enjoy . from the statist data of person expens all over our countri in the first three month of thi year , alomst 85 % young peopl can offer themself on enjoy life while onli 15 % in old peopl . as far as i am concern , everyon can enjoy their lifetim both young peol and aslo the old peopl . we both have wonder lifetim and variou kind of abil can relat to enjoy our life . but i do believ our young peopl can make full use of thi opportun to enjoy the fantast world than old peopl .
