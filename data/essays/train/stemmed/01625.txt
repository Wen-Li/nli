it can not be deni that travel may bring lot of fun and pleasur to the peopl who travel . howev , concern which is a better way to travel , by self or in a group led by a tour guid or some way els , it is still not reach a same point . person , i quit agre that travel in a group is the best way . in the follow , i 'd like to provid my specif reason to support the attitut . obvious , i think travel in group can reduc the troubl dure the turism . gener , the place we are go to travl may be a brand new locat which we have never been to and know less befor the travel , therefor , lot of practic problem such as accomad , transport and so on will be encount , led by a tuor guid who may help us to reduc the time wast on those poblem . moreov , if the travel is in a group led by a tour guid , more inform concern the place visit may be provid . as we can imagin that the responsbl of a tour guid is to provid the background knowledeg of the place visit . with such a person , a lot of inform of the place such as the histori and cultur which should be record and abstract respect may miss dure the visit . that doe not sound to be a lot of fun . the third and also the last , larg amount of travel fee may also be save . gener speak , a tour guid . are those who have been to the visit place more time than us , which enabl he or she provid a well-organinz scheldul . therefor , a lot of money which is not necessarili spent may be save . to sum up , in my mind , i consid travel in a group as the best way and best choic for me , which is more joy and gain .
