i do agrr with the fact that success peopl are those who tri new thing and take risk rather that those who onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . first of all , the abil to tri new thing is a qualiti that allow you to learn new thing all the time . by do thi , a person will certainli know mani divers thing and develop open-mind . compar to peopl who onli use what they know and do well , a curiou person will master mani differ thing and be abl to be realli success . for instanc , steve jobb , appl 's ceo , master comput sinc he wa veri young . howev , by tri new thing , in hi case sell hi product he becam one of the most success man in today 's world . i thu , strongli believ that thi open-mind wa , appart of hi geniou , what made him success . secondli , i think that take risk is someth harder than just tri new thing . take a risk ha , by definit , good side and bad side . the bad side are that you can take a risk bee as enthousiast as you want , you can fail . nevertheless , i think that risk-tak is a key to the success . inde , take a risk is the equival of bet on the futur and i believ that someon who can not take thi risk and think about the futur wo n't be success . of cours , all of thi is gener speak and each person have a differ vision of what success is . howev , at last but not least , i believ that know how to use what we alreadi know and learn ing new thing will make someon success .
