i think that is better befor to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus in thi way i can enlarg my knowledg and learn all that is possibl . but then it is import to special in one specif subject , becaus in thi way i can deepen my knowledg on a particular argument that i prefer and that is more interest for me , for satisfi my curios . for exampl i have studi in scientif school for five year where i must studi all the academ subject ( for exampl : biolog , filosofi , histori , english , mathemat , latin . .. ) so i have learn much academ subject . now instead i am studi at the univers architectur subject , becaus i love thi job and i have ever love all that is art or design ( modern art in particular ) , so now i prefer special in thi specif subject to becam an architect and to make what i love and i prefer in my futur life . instead if a person whant to special onli in one specif subject he unknown all that the normal peopl known , and so thi person can onli speak and work in
