for the follow reason , i person agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . first of all , young peopl , includ myself , can not afford to spend their time for the sake of their commun , becaus of their hard work . for exampl , in japan , where i live , economi remain good and stabl . sumitomo electr industri , ltd. a lead manufactur of automot part where i work , need to produc more and more in order to satisfi tough demand from toyota motor , co. , ltd. , a worldwid car manufactur . as a result , my colleagu and i are forc to work like a dog everi day and night . at weekend , we have to take a rest in the dormitori so as to prepar next week . as the exampl demonstr , young peopl do not have extra time to help their commun . in addit , nowaday , there is littl opportun for young peopl to help in their commun . for exampl , in the middl of august , my commun use to hold a summer festib name as '' obon festiv ' . when i wa a child , i took part in the festib togeth with my friend . howev , a few year ago , obon festib wa ceas to be held becaus the number of children had been dramat decreas . although i thought that i would help obon festib when i grew adult , now i do not have an opportun itself to support . as the exampl show , young peopl do not have an opportun itself to use their time for their commun . in conclus , for the reason state abov , i strongli agre with the point of view that young person do not provid enough time to help their commun . i believ that young peopl want to give suffic time to help their commun . unfortun , as state abov , young peopl do not have time and opportun to back-up their commun by spend their time .
