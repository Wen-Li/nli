i agre with the fact that most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . of cours when you watch televis a lot of infom and pictur goe in your brain . you record all you have seen and after you want to buy it it 's a fact . but when you go in a restaur for exempl sometim you are veri desapoint becaus it doe n't look at all with what you 've seen on televis . the produc are realli strong becaus they can make an illus of lot a thing and the peopl fall in thi illus . i have a person exempl for thi situat . last nignt i wa watch televis and i saw an advertis about the newest cell phone . the commerci said that he is veri small , one the most resist . .. in fact one of the most everyth . when i went in the cell phone shop indic on the advertis i discov that the phone wa veri big that he wa n't at all resist and in fact that he wa veri bad . i understood after that it wa onli a commerci witch make me go to the cell phone store to buy an anoth phone . i got punk by thi wrong advertis . and i do n't think i am the onli one who leav thi experi in fact i believ that everyday peopl like me do the same thing but some peopl sometim doe n't go back like me and on the contrari enter in thi viciou circl . it 's the purpos of those commerci . it 's to send you somewher to make you buy someth you did n't need at first . but whe cant alway said that the commerci are tri to play with us . sometim the commerci are true and show us true thing . they do n't play thi game often ( make product seem much better tan they realli are ) becaus in thi case a lot of person will be sent to jail !
