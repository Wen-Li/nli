advertis ha a lot of effect on our behaviour when it come to choos certain product . i most certainli agre with the statement that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i have a lot oe reason to believ that first , like when we watch advertis about chocol and cigarett , are they realli tell us the truth about the chocol , or the ciggar of cours not we onli watch the add that encourag us to buy them , we know chocol behind a lot of healh troubl and over weight problem we faith now in the usa . we also know that cigar is nuber one killer but with advertis that make them great we lure to buy secondli , advertis can make certain product veri popular , which in realati ha a harmul effect on the human e . for exampl , we are bombard everi day with new and more sophic cell phone in which some of them should be band becaus some researh prove t thi new cell phone emit some kind of radiat which in the long run can caus cancer .. but still around and popular becaus the way the advertis appeal to the custom and the way they butifi certain product make it around for a long time moreov , the advertis dure the time of elect . thi advertis can make you chang your opnion about certain candid , and you might choos him also he is not the right person but becaus of the advertis and the way they chang the truth and the realati we end up taken the wrong decis . all in all , i believ that advertis can realli creat a product sound more than it desev , advertis cn
