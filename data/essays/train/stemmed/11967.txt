as technolog ha been develop , mani job and skill have been creat . for exampl , bill gate who is the richest in the world and have compani that relat to comput program . histori of the compani that name ` microsoft ' is shorter than other . but bill gate knew what will the import thing becom in the world . and not mani peopl tri to these new part . that wa easi client of comput . he invent easier client . and he spread out to averag user . i think that , like thi exampl , tri new thing is better way to becom success peopl than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . here is some reason . first of all , there are less rival in new thing . for exampl , there were alreadi a lot of coffe shop . so mani invest struggl to make extraordinari shop . and also thet have to care locat of shop and menu . becaus there are rival shop . but if someon tri to new thing , he do n't have to care about the rival . as i state about bill gate , when the new compani develop new thing , there were ani rival . they did n't worri about challeng with other compani . so bill gate concentr on hi new thing . secondli , onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is more danger than tri new thing . as the age ha been chang , import thing are chang . for exampl , long time ago , laundri wa veri import . becaus laundri machin wa expens and hard to manag . so mani peopl use laundri shop . but nowaday mani compani invent new and easi laundri machin . so mani peopl have laundri machin in their hous . and also mani owner who have laundri shop had to closs hi shop . for that reason , onli do what they alreadi know how to do well is dangerous for their work . becaus world trend ha been chang . for those reason , success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well .
