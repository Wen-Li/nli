i think that it is correct to say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . young peopl are more energit and dynam than the old peopl . young peopl enjoy in differ way by engag in differ activ . for exampl they enjoy by play basket ball , soccer , rugbi and so on but the old peopl who are not that much energit can not get engag in the sport as much as the young . also the young peopl have no respos as they are mostli depend on their parent for the money so they enjoy as they wish . the older peopl will be mostli retir from the work and they need to save the for their futur purpos . exampl for health care need , food , shelter and so on . the old peopl are more prone to diseas than the younger peopl as they tend to have lesser immun than the young . so they will be spend more time in the hospit than outsid . for exampl you take a old man who is suffer from pain of the joint due to osteoarthr he will not get cure dure hi life span but it can be suppress by use medicin . the diseas like carcinoma , gout , arthriti occur more comonli in older peopl as their immun system ha degrad with age . the old peopl also may have their wive or husband who is not a work partner may increas the renspons of the other person . the old peopl also have lot of thought in their brain might be famili problem or the bussi tension but such thing are not there for young . they can enjoy to the maximum as no oppos forc like money might not be a real problem . i conclud by say that old peopl are the peopl who have mani respons and mutil by so mani factor but on the other hand young peopl donot have so mani tension and problem . so there is more chanc for the young peopl to enjoy than the older one .
