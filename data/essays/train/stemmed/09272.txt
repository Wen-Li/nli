when we are student , most teacher teach us idea , concept , and fact . i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . thi is becaus there are sever benefit . one is that we can use the idea and concept not onli one case . it mean that learn the idea and concept make us intellig . for exampl , my teacher who teach middl school alway say that it is meaningless to rememb the answer . it is more import to think that whi it is happen or occur . to understand the idea and concept is go to be not onli the memori but also the power of think . the other is that the fact is not alway true . for exampl , famou tv show wa stop in japan last week . thi is becaus the tv show said complet fake thing . if peopl do n't know the idea and concept , they onli beleiv the fact even if that is incorrect . we get the knowledg from research . when we doubt someth , we have to check and find the true fact . in order to get the true fact , we should understand the idea and concept . so , teacher want us the flow to lead the answer dure the test . concequ , i agre that understand idea and concept is more effici for student than lear fact . abov those , one is that idea and concept proveid us the power of think . the other is that fact is not alway true . we need to research someth in themselv .
