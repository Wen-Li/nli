to express my opinion about thi subject , i must say that , thi statement is veri unclear . i will agress with thi statement , when the young peopl are live in an individu societi . on the other hand , i will not agre with it , when the same segment of poepl are live in a collect societi . our cultur are veri differ also our imagin of the moral . each cultur ha anoth famili system funcion . and as a result ; the attitud to the famili will be the same like for the commun . for the explanit : the individu sociti ; is thi one who prefer that each member of the sociti should have a near degre of the absoult freedom do the thing in that way , which he think it is the right one . the young peopl in thi kind of societi do n't give enough time help their coummun , especi the old peopl , for exampl i live here in germani and it normal to hear that somebodi is found dead in hi flat , - but firt six month after hi death - . it mean that nobodi from hi neighbourwood had notic it at all ; that thi man could n't be seen such long time . more and more , the young peopl are veri busi with therselv . thi must achiev everyth alon and for that , nobodi els should particip with them even in their time . on the other side : there is anoth type of societi , which call the collect one . in thi one `` for exampl in arab or asian countri '' the young peopl stand besid to help their commun . it depend on the valu of do the thing togeth . the accept that the member in such societi could do what they want to do , is not there . each member should do the same thing in the same situat , becaus they are act and live togeth . at the end , i can say gener that the cultur differ nowadi are go smaller in direct of an individu societi . so that , i do agre that the young peopl more and more are tendencelli not give enough time to help their commun .
