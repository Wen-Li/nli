i think that it is good idea to go trip as a group with a guid . thi is becaus tourist are abl to know and get knowledg from the guid who know a lot of thing about the place . if it is possibl , peopl should have a guid and get knowledg from them becaus it can be nice oppotun . the point is that peopl are travel to see other place where they are not live in their usual daili life . therefor , it is more reason to studi other cultur and think . those idea will probabl help to make their think wider . in other word peopl who have seen mani differ countri or place are abl to think everyth more critic and logic , becaus they know whi the cultur are differnt by take a lectur of guid . also , it is import to make the group . the first reason is that peopl can learn from other , not onli from the guid . if somebodi in your grop can share the knowleg with you , it is great oppotun to know other cultur think . if i compar group tour to privat tour , it is clear that a person who is in a grop tour can think more differ way beaacsu ther are other who ha anoth idea which he ha . in other hand , a person who take tour by himself is go to keep hi own idea , beacasu there are no other who provid oth point of view to him . the guid is the person who is special to teach histori or local knowledg about him or her palac . as i mention in abov , it is neccessari to know other cultur becaus you may think everyth from mani point of view . also , make group is easier way to understand how other peopl feel and think . therefor i think that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guid .
