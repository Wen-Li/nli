when i first came to sri lanka , in 1993 , there were hardli ani car . instead , buse , train and tuk-tuk were ideal mode of transport at that time . there were lot of biker in the street as well where some would be sell icecream or simpli be on hi way to work . after live five year , my father had taken few year off hi work . togeth as a famili , we emigr to edinburgh for coupl of year . i wa around 15 , when i wa back in sri lanka . everth wa differ . ye , i could still see the tuk-tuk and the buse in the street . howev , biker where some use to sell icecream or bread , had complet disappear . instead , there were million of car . known for have wild drive style in sri lanka , moment spent on the road were n't veri safe as it use to be . more traffic , more accid . current , the situat ha gotten much wors . where it use to be just 15 minut from school to home , it is now 45 . of cours , it vari on differ time of the day , but howev the fact is that the number of car have certainli increas . i can not see whi that will not be the case 20 year from today . the situat will onli be chang , if there were an altern mode of transport which will offer the same advantag offer by a car . for exampl , convini , availabilti and comfort . train , nor buse can neither fulli satisfi the demand of the peopl . unless there is a superior advanc in transport , i believ car will hold domin over all other mode .
