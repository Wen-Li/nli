`` king of everi thing but jack of noth '' may be point of view of few peopl who think broad knowledg doe n't help . but i do agre with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . thi do help in shapng the futur of a person . as technolog progress the similar happen with human be . there start a race between mani but the winner wa one . in order to coup up with it , there is alway a need of get an upper hand among the other 's . thu if we look in the field of engin which requir a person to have knowledg relat to variou field in order to be higher than odd . but if that person ha insuffici knowledg as he had studi onli one particular subject may let him down . for exampl , a person who is work in an electron compani if he doesnt have ani knowledg of oper and electron transform that will let him down in front of mani . thu , if he had a sound knowledg about transform he would have solv the problem within second . in school day there are number of subject studi such as histori , geographi , math etc . the real ainm behind it is to help grow knowledg of student so that they do n't encount ani problem in life . suppos if onli one subject wa thought then it would have affect the futur of that student . i my self be an instrumwent engin know the actual essenc of studi broad rang of subject dure my student life . we were success in studi instrument as it contain mixtur of variou subject from differ branch . the main benefit i got is dure my last year graduat project where i have to make and design robot . the robot field be main part of mechan engin wa know to me as it wa in my cirriculum . thu , i complet the robot project success as compair to other student . becaus of have studi variou subject i wa abl to achiev my goal of becom a success engin .
