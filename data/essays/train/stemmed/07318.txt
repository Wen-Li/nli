compar with travel along , while most major of peopl prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid , a small group of peopl choos to travel alon . there are advantag and disadvantag lie on both side . when the question come to me . i would rather vote a tour guid all by oneself . inde , travel alon involv a larg number of benefit . the most obviou advantag is that you gain the maxim freedom when get to some place alon . as a singl tourist . you may get rid of be regul on the schedum by the tour guid . you may make a paticular schedum special tailor for yourself and to meet your own demand while a tourist who follow a guid may not ha such right to chose freeli . therefor , the flexibl in make a plan serv as a signific forc motiv me to travel alon . the second advantag is that you can also chose the place most satisfi your person tast freeli . just imagin about it , your guid foof your group forc you to visit a famou church , but unfortunit what you realli want to explor is a medievil castl nearbi . at thi circumst . youhav to follow your group , therefor you have to follow the guid . what a tragedi . what 's more , from travel alon , not onli can you chose the place to visit freeli , but also you can make a larg sum of new friend . shch opportun can mere be obtain when you travel with a guid . it is realli excit and fantast . on conclus . if there is one day i travel to a place far away , i would rather travel alon for the sake of freedom , flexibl and potenti friendship i may gain from my jouney
