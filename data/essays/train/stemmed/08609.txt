first of all allow me to say that i total agre with the idea that it is much more import for student to understand idea than to learn fact . the import of understand underli idea instead of onli learn mere fact can be summar by say that a student that ha learnt by heart a lot of fact can be defin for sure as a student with a lot of notion but at the same extent can sure find him or herself in a lot of problem when tri to appli the fact they know in order to understand differ situat . let ' think of histori as an exampl . if it is true that on one side it is certain that a student must learn a seri of fact that have determin the histor event of a certain age , on the otheron it is equal certain that a student that doe not understand all the driver and all the underli caus that driven those fact will never be abl to realli understand what ha happen thu impeed himself or herself to avoid same mistak made by former gener and to replic the succes idea appli to differnt context . obvious thi is just an exampl but basic all subject can be use as exampl in order to sustain the import of understand more than lear by heart . take math as a last exampl . if a student learn by heart a math rule without understand the gener sens of it , he or her will onli be abl to appli the memor rule if it present itself in the exact same form of the rule studi by heart . well thi is simpli imposs in math sinc a particular rule ha to be appli to a potenti infinit varieti of possibl occas . as i wa say , sinc lear by heart someth infinit is imposs , understand is the onli possibl solut for a student . these are onli two exampl , but the same concept appli to basic all the subject that student approach dure their accadem year , thu understand is fundament whilst lear fact is a waist of time .
