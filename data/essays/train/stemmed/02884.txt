while some may argu that learn fact may be the best way to impart educ among student , i do not believ so . learn core concept and understand idea are import for a holist learn experi . in the follow text i present my reason for thi belief and my content that learn and understand of idea and concept is in fact better than sole learn fact . firstli , learn idea and concept help in clearer and a more thorough understand of a topic . state fact in addit to thi would serv as an exampl that make it even clearer . a thorough understand of a topic help in engend a scientif mindset that encourag inquisit and a pursuit to learn even more . secondli , fact are useless without knowledg . fact might help in the develop of a student 's memori , but they in no way impart true knowledg . fact are inform , while knowledg is what need to be impart to the student . thirdli , idea and concept are the core fundament without which learn would be an incomplet experi . mere scratch the surfac by discuss fact and exampl would be an injustic to the student . thirdli , a discuss of idea and concept bring out the knowledg a student alreadi ha and share with hi peer . such a set where idea flow freeli among student and professor paint the pictur of an ideal educ environ that everi student dream of . in addit , such an environ kindl student ' interest in the topic and make them even more interest in it . ani student would be more interest in learn concept and idea and practic appli them than to mere memor fact , which have littl or no applic in the real world . it need to be realiz that fact are complementari to the idea and concept that are tought , and they should be treat so they should be state as exampl for the purpos of clearer understand of the topic of discuss . howev , they should not be use in isol as it would lead to an incomplet knowledg transfer between the teacher and the student .
