first of all i think that both knowledg , specif knowledg or mani knowledg have both advantag and disavantag . when you special yourself in a specif subject you can studi everi singl aspect of thi subject and you will be veri consatr in it . for exampl when somon want to studi busi in colleg and he know that he want to special hi studi in market , it would be better for him to start directli with market studi so he would learn everi thing about it in specif way . when you studi mani subject you might be lost and you will have a lot of inform go true your head wich could be a bad thing . you might then find yourself lost in what you want to do . for exampl when somebodi want to studi busi in colleg but he doe n't wich major he want to do , it 's better for him to studi 2 year of gener busi wich mean to studi everi subject of busi like market , advertis , financ , intern busi , etc . . actual i find my self in thi situat right now , i 'm do my last year of school and i 'm go next year to colleg and i would like to studi busi but i love financ . i decid to studi 2 year of busi in colleg where i could learn extra subject and then i would special my self in financ . thi way i would have learn other subject then financ . in conclus i think that broad knowledg of mani academ subject and broad knowledg of a specif subject have both posit and neg point . a person should decid in the best way wheter he want to studi a specif subject of a lot of them .
