that is a realli good question becaus today , the academ system permit the choic between a broad knowledg of mani academ subject and specil in one specif subject . the choic can be depend on the futur of the person who have to do thi choic . in fact , accord the job who decid to do , it is better to do one choic or the other one choic . for exampl , when you decid to becom a lawyer , the best choic is to special in one specif subject becaus it is a realli special job and it is difficult to someth els in the same time . so a realli good knowledg is necessari for do thi job . but if you decid to becom a manag , thi is differ . in fact , you must to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . for do thi job , you must be good in mani subject like the manag , the market , the relationship , the comptabl or the law . .. that is whi , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is realli necessari . so , if i have the choic , i agre with it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . but , i think that it is import for sever job that the knowledg is realli special becaus it is imposs to know everyth and it is more safe to concentr hi knowledg on onli one subject . so , like i said in the introduc , the choic must be depend on the job what would like to do .
