thi statement is , in my opinion , incorrect , sinc i do not beliv that someon with a broad knowledg of mani academ subject could compet on a specif subject with someon specialis on thi subject . in today 's societi a great field of expert , special into certain academ subject , exist . so it will be hard for somebodi with a broad knowledg of mani academ subject to be more effect in fulfil hi profess , than someon who special on thi subject and is perfectli train in hi profess . of cours some basic knowledg of mani academ subject is neccessari in order to make connect between differ field of studi and to spur develop and improv of subject . thi occur especi in scienc where for exampl calculu and physic are veri close relat and could have never been develop as far as they have been without scientist have a good knowledg of both . but without special into one of these subject , or even into subfield of these subject , no more improv could have been made at some point sinc it is not possibl for the human brain to take and work with all the inform that exist on the two field of studi today . so it is also not possibl for anyon to gather broad knowledg of even more subject . so i believ that nowaday it is even better to focu on one subject onli , but therefor to studi it as perfectli as possibl and then form research group with other expert in other specif subject in order to develop new invent , then to tri and cope with all the exist inform and to accquir a broad knowledg of mani accadem subject .
