i do not agre with the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today . there are sever reason for think so . global speak , the transport media is not chang for a long period of time . we have car , airplan , bicycl , motorcycl , train ( abov an under ground ) , ship for provid differ mean of transport . car are the vehicl that are commonli use for privat transport . they provid peopl privaci dure their journey everywher and privaci is someth that man want to have especi dure transport . also there are other social criteria that forc the usag of car . the first thing to mention is that it give it owner a social state . own a car mean a higher standard against the one that ca n't afford a car . so it 's in fact a sign of wealth in most of the world . the use of the car is not directli relat to the purpos , - transport - there are mani other factor . one of the biggest factor is the car manufactur . car manufactur play a big role in the macro-economi . if the manufactur are still make car , then someon should be there to buy and use it . but if the manufactur can find a differ way of gain money , like manufactur sci-fi vehicl that can be use instead of car then the number of the car that are go to be use in the futur will be fewer that the amount we use today . one other reason that we will not be abl to help ourselv use car is that there is still huge amount of resourc around the world . most of the car today are run with ga , and the earth still ha n't run out of it yet . mayb in the futur when the ga resourc will dri and new kind of energi will be use in differ type of wehicl . to summar , there should be certain fact in order to predict that the usag of car will fade out in twenti year . but we do n't have those fact now .
