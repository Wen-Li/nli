i think it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my own experi , i have seen thi all along my life and work . if you special in onli one specif subject , you will alway be limit to a veri small field of action and will not be abl to work or give opinion in other area that could be relat to your if that were the case . thi tendenc sytart with ford compani in the assembl line in the begin of the centuri when henri ford launch hi first mass produc car . everi person in the assembl line had a specif task to carri out and that wa all they did . well , at the veri begin , thi might have been good but after a while i do not think that those peopl like their job veri much . it is bore and routinari and of cours product level decreas . and thi doe not onli happen in an assembl line , it can be appli to everi field of action . dure the eighti thi special had a terribl drawback gener motor corpor fire a lot of worker and obvious these peopl were not prepar to find and do anoth job but what they had been do for a long time . those worker had to even go back to school in ored to learn someth els to do in today world . thi fact and other make me agre with the statement . when you know differ subject and have knowledg of them you are more prepar to surviv in thi everyday chang societi , you can adapt more to those chang if you are use to manag someth from differ area of knowledg . i am a teacher of english in my countri but first of all i am a teacher who teach valu , habit , cultur , etc. and then i teach english . in thi countri , the unit state , i tri to do the same . that is i am appli my experi and adapt them to a total new atmospher were my cultur and habit could be old fashion or not accept . even , i have had to learn from other cultur in order to deliv my inform better and more accur . as an anoth exampl , i like to answer those question about cultur and all type of knowledg of the televis contest , and of cours i like it when my answer is the correct one . sometim special is good but we never have to be so special on someth we need to know about everyth that is around us and that affect the way we live . i can not onli drive my car not know that i am also deplet the ozon layer when i do it . we have to be more conciou and in order to do so we need the most import thing these day knowledg .
