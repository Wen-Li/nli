i disagre the opinion `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' i think the best way to travel is alon and to plan myself . trip is not onli dure travel anwher but also dure plan for trip . where is the best place i want to go ? where will i stay ? where will i eat for lunch and dinner ? i think we will be happi befor trip by plan about it . i have join tour onc . but tour is n't fun for me . i have two reason . first , i had to care about time alway . tour guid said , `` until thi time ! until thi time !! '' i could n't see the place i want to see the most . and i could n't go to see soon when i found someth funni . thi summer i travel to kyoto alon . that trip wa veri wond !! i could go where i want to go and eat what i want to eat . the most wond thing is i could chang the plan soon . when i found some shop , templ and road , i could go there . thi is god for me . so i think the best way to travel is alon and to plan myself .
