are you the kind of person who want to know everi thing about a thing or a thing about everi thing ? . in our life mani peopl have to decid in between have broad knowledg of mani subject and special in one subject . in my openion i believ that have broad knowledg is better than special in one specif subject . howev , there are advantag and disadvantag . first of all , by have broad knowledg of mani academ subject you will be a well round-educ person and have alot of skill that you can use in your daili life . have mani subject make a person well round-educ one who is abl to understand alot of thing that face him in hi life . for exampl , if a person had a psycolog cours he would understand the act of hi teenag children . moreov , by take mani academ subject you might have some skill that help you in certain situat . for exampl , my cousin use hi french when he took hi mother to a hospit to reciev a medic attent in franc . so , take mani academ subject is a good chois if a person want to be a well round-educ one and to have skill that might be use in hi daili life . furthermor , becaus of it wast of time and distract , have a mani mani academ subject might be considerd as a disadvantaf . these subject make a person spend a lot of time on them becaus ther are mani of them and he must give them the same attent . also , they distract the person from fouces on hi own major subject which he use in hi futur job and let him spend hi time on subject that he do not need in hi job . so , a personn should think befor in conclus , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject ha it own advantag and disadvantag , but sinc the advantag have more weight than the disadvantag , i think that have vroad knowledg of mani academ subject is the best choic to make .
