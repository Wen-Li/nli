'' i thought what he said is right but after look at the placement in my colleg i thought they will onli select the learner . the compani who are come to recriut the final year , they give first prefer to the the one who got 9/10 but not to the one who got 7/10 and have all a grade in hi branch subject . but after meet them after two year the one who got 9/10 and not have ani knowleg about the concept are in the same posit and some gave up there job for do there master and the one who got less gpa but understood all the concept are in a high post . i experienc the same in my twealth . i leant the concept and idea in physic and score distinct . but when i am do engin first year i face lot of problem to clear the subject . then after i realis it better to understand the idea and concept than learn them and never fail in do so and made my core subject easier .
