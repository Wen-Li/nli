it more import for student to learn more about the fact . the fact are like thing that are alreadi done , and the idea and the concept are in our mind , so if a student care more about a fact it becaus he is secur about what he alreadi now . the fact of a thing it close to what it alreadi exist . for exampl , the boy jump to the bed and hurt hi head . that a fact , and idea and concept it like , the boy could fractur a leg or arm , it like an idea it all it matter , but what ir realli care it what it realli happen . in school the teacher or professor thought more to us about imagin , it near to the concept of a thing . i never got the idea of what should be done , if i alreadi knew what happen for real . the student need to now how to compar about the definit of fact and idea or concept , caus if it not he is not go to infer what the peopl it talk about , he wouldnt now . i absolut disagre of what the statement say , caus it not realli good not to now an import fact befor to now the idea or the concept for use . but i can said that to now the idea befor the fact it is such a good thing too , caus im not say that it bad , it also import but not more than the fact . we have to now the import of what it real and not of what are we imagin , talk about the concept and idea . we should care more about good thing , and pay attent to all kind of opinion of each person , caus not everyon , even the professor think like we think , so we have to defend our opinion and leav it clean till the end of the discuss .
