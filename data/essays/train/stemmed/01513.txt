i disagre the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus of some reason . my some of the reason to disagre that idea are ; first of all enjoy life doe not connect to age complet , secondli when year are pass peopl get more experinc and final older peopl understand life better than younger one which help them to enjoy more . to begin with , let tri to defin ` enjoying` . is enjoy relat to your phsical situat ? what i think is that enjoy is have fun and be happi in a certain time period which is not depend to your phsical situat but your mental properti . you can be veri healthi about your muscl , organ and all your bodi but it doesnt mean anyth if your mental condit is alright . addit , experi is veri import in life to enjoy it . a famou singer say ` i know what it is to be young but you dont know what it is to be old ' when he reach the consider old age . peopl who live a lot of thing - which can be consir as ` tast ' in life - learn how to defend and stand for bad happen and it must help them to be happi even if they are in veri bed situat . final , life is not veri easi to understand and identifi . everi second pass through our life help us to achiv the understand of the aim and that identif of life . thi identif help peopl to enjoy sinc the unavoid end of thi life is to ` die ' . young peopl live as if they will never die wherea older see that end easier than the youth that philosoph finish . henc , i dont believ the idea that older peopl enjoy life less than the younger peopl do becaus i think it doesnt complet depend on age and the reason i mention abov . i see a lot of young peopl never enjoy wherea a lot of veri old peopl smile and have fun with their friend .
