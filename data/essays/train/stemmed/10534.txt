while i wa in school i wa veri unhappi when it time to learn the fact and memor them becaus i wa have more fun when tri to understand the idea and concept . i still believ on the same way . i think that tri to understand idea make you think on it more and you learn easier . in an other way the thing you have learn keep in your mind in a longer period of time when you tri to understand the idea or concept . when you just tri to memor the fact and do not pay attentinon to the understand it concept i think it like be a car engin who never seen a car . a car engin can know ani technic detail about a car 's mechan but if he had never seen a car he would not understand the what it is for and how it is work . i had two differ histori teaher in high school , the one i had in second class wa alway want us to memor and learn the fact . the histori teacher i had in third class want us just to understand the idea , like whi the war begin istead of when did a specif war begin . i still rememb the thing i had learn in 3rd class but still have noth in mind from the fact that i had memoris dure second class . as a conclus , the reason that tri to underst the idea instead of lear the fact make you think more and help you to understand more , i think it is more import for me and most of the student to tri to understand it . in add'it the thing you understand stay in your mind longer .
