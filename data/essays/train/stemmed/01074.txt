some peopl say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev , where i live , older peopl are veri healthi and acit than they use to . in my opinion , older peopl enjoy more life than younger peopl do . the first reason of thi is that becaus older peopl have more time and money than their couterpart , they can do a lot of activ they want to . for exampl , my parent are both retir . they have a lot of free time than i have . in addit , they work for more than 35 year , so they have a larg amount of money they can spend . that 's whi they travel almost onc a month across my countri and they have alreadi visit all the prefectu in my countri . on the contrari , i have to work everi day and i have less avail time and money sinc i got a job last year . i wa not abl to go somewher even in summer vacat . anoth reason is that young peopl have more concern about their futur , compar to the optimist opinion show by older peopl , which lead to the young peopl 's neg idea about their live in gener . one illustr that make thi clear is that most of the young peopl concern about their pension they will receiv in the futur . now that the age societi in my countri is get seriou , young peopl may not receiv enough money to live on after their retir . therefor , most of them have to save money for their futur live and they can not afford to enjoy their present live . my consider with respect to the avail time and money as well as the neg idea about futur live , i think that older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do .
