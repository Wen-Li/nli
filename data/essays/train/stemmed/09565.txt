i do not think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . to my mind , the main reason for it is that older peopl have acquir a strong live experi . inde , becaus they have live longer than younger peopl , they have experi more with differ lifestyl and thu know which one is like to give them the most enjoy in life . in addit , older peopl may have more time to spend ; younger peopl are like to experi the stress begin of work and educ . thu they have more time to enjoy life : when one is busi work , one can not spend time enjoy life . in what way then can older peopl manag their time in order to enjoy life more ? older peopl can fulfil their spiritu need more easili as their thought are more train . thi is whi is may be easier when one is older to studi seriou matter and read more difficult book , and whi it is so much more difficult for younger peopl to concentr on hard subject . put simpli , the younger peopl tend to be more easili distract by basic need and so are more like to be disturb by them too . for exampl , i could cite my grandfath who say that he ha come to the best moment of hi life becaus he can now enjoy hi present life more than ani time befor by read and reflect on hi experi . henc my idea that younger peopl may have more physic energi than older peopl , but older peopl have equal or more mental energi . thu , older peopl enjoy more life than younger peopl do becaus the former know how to employ it 's time to enjoy life best on the contrari of the latter which doe n't .
