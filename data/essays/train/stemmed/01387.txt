i desagre with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have sever reason whi i think so . first , travel lad by a tour guid is tite schedul so you are not allow to spend time freeli . as a result of it , you can not experi the real life of the peopl who live in the place you visit . tour guid show you onli what they want you to see . there are mani other place you should visit to understand local peopl life . for exampl , the hous they actual live or park local children gather in , not the place such as famou templ or histor build . second , it is better to travel alon than be in a group . to travel with your friend may make you feel relax , but , especi in the case of go abroad , you can learn how to deal with troubl by yourself . it will make you tough and much more self-confid . it is true that travel in a group led by a tour guid banefit you much in term of seculti and safeti , but one of the most import thing you can learn from travel is to acquir the abil to handl the problem even if you are in a strang place . third , travel in a group led by aguid tour is passiv . if you go abroad , it is bettter to studi the languag that local peopl speak . languag can not be separ from caltur so in you would realli like to understand it cultur , you need to learn their languag too .
