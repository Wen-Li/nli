the import of idea and concept in our life i am a hundr percent agre that `` understand idea and concept are more import for student than learn fact '' . fact are gener the result of the idea and concept , while fact are the given situat or just the result . idea and concept and fact have a relationship like the visibl and invis part of an iceberg . as you all know the visibl part of an iceberg is veri insignific if we compar it to it invis part . therefor if student learn the idea and concept they will understand the reason and caus of a fact . if they do so they will respond to the fact differ and more maturli . by learn idea and concept it will be easier for them to chang the world into a better place but just learn the fact will not help them do that . in gener the idea and concept play a role in the format of the fact . for exampl , blind is a fact but produc smth as a blind person is relat to the concept and idea . poverti is a fact but chang thi situat into a better one is to do with idea and concept . of cours it ha to do with the will power . without the will power we ca n't chang the fact that surround us . that is the reason whi understand idea and concept is more meaning in my opinion . the idea and concept in the world that make a chang and have an effect on the fact .
