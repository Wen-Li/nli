accord to me it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i defend thi point of view for the follow reason . first of all i think that a broad gener cultur , in mani academ subject , is extrem import in the same time for professionn reason and social reason . thi broad gener cultur make peopl abl to adapt themselv to a much more import number of life situat than peopl who special in one specif subject . for exampl what could do and becom a person who onli have good qualif in a singl job and that thi job becom old fashion . .. noth . .. thi person will not be abl to adapt itself to hi new realiti . .. secondli i think that the mission of school and even of univers is to allow peopl to make a choic about their futur , and i think that thi choic ha to beclear and well base , so that i believ that onli a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can make people- choic clear an well base . for exampl , if you onli taught scientif subject to children , how could a certain number of them discov litteratur and discov that they are gift for wrting . .. it would be imposs . .. that is whi i think that befor learn a job , young peopl have to discov as mani as academ subject they can to make the good choic . the third reason whi i think it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is a counter exempl . .. peopl who believ that it is better to special in one specif subject will alway say that it is easier , after graduat , to find a job with a special . but i would that thi special is , in the realiti , never a real special and that a lot of practis is still need after graduat to becom a real specialist . .. so in fact special in colleg and even in univers is not a real one . .. that is whi i am deepli convinc that to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is much better than to special in one specif subject .
