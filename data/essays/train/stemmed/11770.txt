i actual do a gree on the statment that say 's success peol tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do whay they alreadi know how to do well . for mani reason , first off all , if you tri a new thing , will take the chanc to discov somethig new and to get the full cridit of someth that you did by your self for the first time . second , if you keept do the same thing that you alreadi know over and over again , you will lose the opportun to learn someth new and to get the cridet . third , peopl might say , if you tri someth new you might lose or fail someth in return , will actual that 's true . but on the other hand you have to dare to be diffrent than the other , to succ in someth . forth , you can not just stay and wait to be succ while other peolp work and fail and fail until they get to what they want . all of the great invintor who , their name still until today , fail at first then had success . for exampl , edison , who invint the lamp , had fail in 5000 invinton until he got what he want eventu . and in everi time he fail he keept tell him self , it is onli small number of mistak , i can do better next time , and tha't what keept him go non stop until toward hi passion . in conclus , if you want to be succ , you have to tri new thing , and you have to expect to lose other thing in order to get to where you want to be .
