in life there are mani event that peopl do to enoy themselv . some peopl go to vacat while some without that much money could go to theme park and ride on roller coaster . to me , i think young peopl do actual enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus they have the energi that could be use to enjoy life better . young peopl would go to place like amus park , watch a movi with friend , hang out with friend and much more while older peopl mostli stay home . young peopl tend to go out more to have a good time with their friend . when young peopl go to amus park , they have a great time . mani go on the roller coaster and have a nice time scream their lung out or they go and ride on the regular ride like the carousel . but to older peopl , roller coaster are veri scari and sometim caus them to have nausea . older peopl would shi away from the amus park at much as they could . at one time , my aunt came with me , her son and daughter to the amus park . her son and i went to ride on the roller coaster while my aunt and her daughter just sat there and wait for us . she did not have much fun . we ask her to go on the slower ride like the carousel with us but she refus so , we just gave up on her and went on some more ride at the amus park . at the end of the day , my aunt 's son and i enjoy the amus park more than my aunt and her daughter . to a young person , go to watch a movi with friend is a veri enjoy hobbi . when watch with friend , they could laugh togeth about funni scienc in the movi and cri togeth when there wa a sad scene . but to an older person , they seldomli go to movi . like my parent , they do not go to movi . i rememb when my sister , me and my mother when to the movi , she got bore and fell asleep . she did not enjoy the movi and just slept through it . my and my sister wa kind of depress becaus she slept through the movi . young peopl enjoy more in parti than older peopl . young peopl in parti could danc , eat , social , and have more fun than older peopl . older peopl could danc , eat , and social but they would not enjoy as much becaus they do not have as much energi . at a parti at my friend 's hous , we had lot of fun . we ate , watch televis , sang karaok , and danc . some of the peopl danc and sang veri funni so , we laugh realli hard and had a great time . we spent almost all of out energi and enjoy everi bit of it . in an adult parti , the part that wa most fun wa eat food . there were not mani entertain and most of the adult just stood in their own corner and social . young peopl do have more fun and enjoy themselv than older peopl . most of the older peopl would get away from all the place the young peopl tend to like . the older peopl would want to mostli stay home and relax while the young peopl would go outsid and have a great time with their friend . they do not have as much energi as the young peopl to enjoy life like us .
