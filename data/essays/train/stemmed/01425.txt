i disagre with the statement `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' becaus by learn the fact of someth , student will realli learn the experi and the knowledg . also by learn the fact of that thing , student can understand the idea deepli and clearli . when student are face someth , if student onli think about the idea of that thing , student will onli think about how to solv the problem . but by do that , student will forget to think about the reason . whi doe it happen , how doe it happen . if student learn the fact of the thing , they will get the answer , the how and whi and someth els . and by learn the fact of the thing , they will realli learn experi and knowledg from the thing , not just do it . i have a friend who is in the yearbook team of our school . she is not as good as other student in the team becaus when she got a problem , she will ask the teacher how to solv the problem , which is right . but she never think about whi the problem appear . when the teacher gave her the idea of the issu , she onli follow the idea and solv the problem without think . by do that , she doe n't realli learn the knowledg and skill . when the same problem happen next time , she still ca n't solv it . so , learn the fact is more import than understand the idea . also , by learn the fact of the thing , student will get more chanc to learn about the thing , therefor , they will get the idea of the thing easili and clearli also deepli . becaus they learn about it . after we learn the fact we will know the idea veri easili and deepli . i have a friend who goe to art class with me . when the teacher talk about the idea of a piec of art , he alway ca n't understand . that 's becaus he doe n't studi for that art . he doe n't know the background of the art and who the artist is and so on . so it 's veri hard for him to understand the art onli by look at it . so learn the fact of the issu help student to understand the idea and concept . after all , learn fact is more import for student than onli understand the idea and concept . student will gain lot of knowledg and experi by learn the fact .
