an educ system should be capabl of give to the student all the element in order to be a better person and profession . obviusli , understand idea and concept is veri import for the student for learnig and anal thing , but i think that is not enough . student should have all the element in order to resolv problem and face conflict in the futur . learn specif fact , like histori fact or gramar fact , is import , but is not the onli way to get a complet educ . the specif fact , student learn them for the exam and forget next day , but if the teacher teach them how to connect idea , how to understand concept , how to make a connect between thi with that , student will have the element to be a sucesful peopl . an student can know everyth about histori or math or mayb chemistri , buy if he ca n't make a logic conexion between fact and idea , it doe n't make ani sens . when student have to face on work expiri , they wo n't need specif fact that they learn in school , they will need the capac of conect idea and understand concept . the last sentenc doe n't mean that fact , as date or formula or specif thing , student doe n't need them in work life , probabl will probabl wo n't , but i think that understand idea and concept is more valuabl for a compani when they want a good employ . student need an educ that provid them a lot of element to resolv problem , creat idea , connect concept and anyth can help them to be a person who can face ani problem or situat succes .
