i absolut agre with the fact that mani advertis make product seem special , even though , mayb , they are not . i understand that the purpos of an advertis is to actual show the product with it best qualiti , but i think that mani time thi is n't realli what is done . first of all , it is frequent that the advertis present the product as the best one on the market , compar it with other similar type in commerc . for exampl , there are dish wash soap that are present as miracol , but i do n't think that they would actual be abl to dissolv all the greas and dirt on a fri pan , after the prepar of a bacon and egg breakfast . in addit , behind the prepar of an advertis there are mani peopl , such as design for graphic , music expert for the sound and so on . all these person work to make the advertis as appeal as possibl . they know the target of peopl who to direct , and who will probabl be the futur buyer , and consequ studi a way to show the product that will be special interest for those . the third reason whi i think that advertis are not alway straightforward is that mani compani decid to pay a famou person , such as an actor or a singer , to make their product more popular . in thi way all the fan of thi person would be encourag to buy what he or she is present . i think that no woman on earth could resist from buy a jewel present next to brad pitt 's face . in conclus , i think that peopl should be awar of these strategi and decid wether to buy the product or not just think by themselv , ignor the sometim `` fals '' advertis .
