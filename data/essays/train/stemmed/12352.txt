ye i 'm total agre with the abov statement . understand idea and develop your way of think about the fac and analyz the problem in variou way is the key factor in the sucess of ani student while hi scholar carrier . it is the fundament onli which provid a stronger base to ani concept or ani deriv of idea , so veri first initi in the student 's mnd should be bari clear about hi fundament . after understand the base one shoul be abl to clarifi the concept hide behind ani probl or solut . the concept is the thing which often mani student escap due to their lazi or their fear for understand the concept , becaus gener it take time to build your concept . student often prefer to learn the fact ang swell then to save time and workship but they dont ever think of it after effect in their come futur life , becaus whenev they wil be use their theoret knowledg on the practic groung definit they will be in troubl to summar their idea and provid a good soultion to ani practic problem . it is realli speak a art for ani learner who is realli keen to grasp and go in depth of ani concept and prove the thing veri clearli . a student alway should be will to learn someth innov . and thi is possibl onli when he lear about the concept and idea and build their own analyi and tactic . for ani student there shold not be ani ken , becaus he is in a state of learn noth can be fix for them to learn onli thi . it show the salubri natur of ani student who is confid about the concept and idea . there are gigant mani sourc avail for build the concept and upgrad the idea . student 's sagaci behaviour make him a well analyz and it the onli thing which hone one skill and knowledg . often some student get intimid by hear the question like ` what concept you made form thi idea ? ' thi should not be ani more difficulti for the student to sharp their skill and learn abil in their age becaus it the fundat of ani bulid which they are go to build base on those concept . if the foundat will not be strong then definit it is go to collaps . the ultim we are in state of realiz the imporatnc of concept bulid and develop your skill . onli by lean fact and swell them one can provid an immedi solut to the problem but definit all hi effort will be in vain if is not well equip with the concept build . when student goe to a practic field of life and they are call for express their idea about anyth they studi then at time they will be produc an ineffect demonstart of their skill . so if we think in long term then we find that the conceptualis thing will be fruitful and also will provid you self satisfact . final i'ld like to conclud with the statement ' pracic make a man perfect ' and practic is notinh but hone your concept and abil .
