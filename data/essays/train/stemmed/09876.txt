whenev there is a lectur beign given , the student often get involv with the subject that they start implement the idea and start develop few analyzst regard the teach , but hardli tri to understand the fact behind them , basic the origin of the subject . even though the fact are retold most of them tri to repos them and concentr on the concept . the fact is that both the concept and theori of the fact are import . it is think and implement some idea about what is beign understood and develop the idea to make it real , thi theori drive behind the knowledg of understand and know fact . mani of them are interest in know the fact behind everyth ( afteral , who doe n't want to know the reason behind each matter or say topic ) . thi also may depend on the person desir to use the fact in understand the topic . the differ in a studi may be figur out due to the lack of fact known regard that particular field . though the reason may be figur out , the fact is that learn through the new ideea and the concept are veri much prefer by most of the futur student , may be thi id the like of the newer gener . for exampl , when a theori of pendulum is taught in a class the student do tri to learn the principl of it but are least interest ( atleast galileo ) in how it happen to be seen light , and again it is a differ stori . the student start develop their idea on the concept taught to them and start work to creat or say invent someth that is base on the principl of pendulum . the same goe with the veri popular newton-appl tree stori . mani theori have seen light after the principl of graviti is given byt he great newton . thereb are mani instanc that go in the same path , likebohr atom theori , rutherford . not onli in the field of learn but also in the field of research these thing do appli . although the research feild requir sthe student to rememb the name of thescientist they do it for the namesak , but are rather interest in their research . final , not onli me but most of them would agre that the student are intend to get to nstudi the concept , undersatnd them and thu lead to the better result . although there may be a piont rais that the fact are a must for experiec the situat and circumct , it may be obviou that it goe thgrough the old say `` failur ( s ) are the step to success '' , wherein the student do tri out get new thing and fail but rejuvin with a roar success . i think for such thing the need of fact to be known is not a of great help but find out someth new doe make the joy doubl , encourag , therefor , the futur studentd
