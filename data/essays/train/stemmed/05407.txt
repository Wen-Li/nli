travel becam a veri comon thing that peopl do for diffrent kind of thing like work , famili , enjoy , learn . .. and peopl do them in diffrent sort of way they go with friend or just with famili member or with a group of societi . .. and somtim they even includ a guid , that usual accompani them when they want more inform about a monument or somth they want to visit and other peopl use him just for guid through out the countri . in my opinion travel is an experi , an adventur , a knowledg . when i travel i like meet new peopl from diffrent cultur , i like to learn from them , learn there languag , see how think , how they live , what they eat , in gener just live a diffrent life . if i m think of travel with my friend all thi passion i have about travel would n't happen . we will be to busi take care of each other . and when we have each other we would n't be look for other thing know that we get along better with our own inviron . when i see new place monument , castl , histor evid . i like enjoy them and tri to figur them out by my self i would like to take my time guess what happen in thi place , and then to clear up my stori i would rather sit in my room and read about it and rememb all those beauti and peac moment i had there . so one day when someon ask me what have i seen in thi word of discoveri i would be abel to say that i discov it my self and be abel to discrib it in my own opinion and not someon els .
