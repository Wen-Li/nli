i do agre with the statement that it is veri much import for the student to understand the idea and concept rather than to learn fact . let 's take a common exampl of a student listen to a scienc lectur . it 's veri much import for him to understand what is dealt about befor form an opinion on the topic . if the lectur just put the fact infront and ask him to byheart them it wud be of no use . the student might forget those fact after sometim as that do not creat a strong impress in mind . but rather if he understand the idea and the concept behind the topic there is a higher chanc he can rememb that for a longer time . anoth import aspect is that just learn the fact would not lead to the develop of the subject . it 's onli when one get a thourough idea of the complex involv in that , one would get an idea of how to develop the concept . for exampl let us take a student do hi project work on develop automobil effici . unless he know what are the factor involv in develop effici he can not succeed . it involv the student to learn the idea and concept behind the subject apart from learn the fact . in most of the case it 's proven that fals understand of a subject would lead to an irrepair situat . and know the fact without probe into them alway lead to a fals conclus . secondli probe into the fact and understand them also help a student on a person front . in one 's dali life one may come across mani complex situat , which if one consid onli the fact might land oneself into troubl . let 's take an exampl of a student get angri on hi father for not provid him more pocket money . the father would not give more money as he perhap feel that hi son is involv in illeg activ . the student should probe whi hi father 's not give him the money rather that to blame
