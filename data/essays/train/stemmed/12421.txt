nowaday , student are expos to learn thing that they do n't even understand . it is whi , `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' when student , must learn fact without know what they are talk or learn about , mean nonsens at all . i agre that a fact is import but if they do n't know whi it ha happen it wo n't be necessari for them to learn that becaus the day after , it would be off their mind . usual , thing that you learn at school must help you for the futur , so if a student learn the fact befor the understand , he will not use thi inform again in hi futur . consequ , it 's better to understand an idea and a concept , becaus when you understand someth it will be print much longer in your mind that you thought . when an idea is understood , the brain will stock the inform becaus thi idea could be use for anoth time . a concept or an idea are exactli the same and they work togeth . first you understand the idea and then when you know it you can imagin the concept more easili . a student will learn more in defin and understood an idea or concept than just learn a fact . otherwis , sometim fact are import in a way that they have a relat with real fact in a sens of natur event . for exampl , when on bbc news they introduc the tsunami event , everybodi wa shock but they learnt someth befor they understood whi . .. final , i will say that the best for a student will be to understand first the idea , imagin it and final learn it .
