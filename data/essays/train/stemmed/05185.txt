i do not agre to the mention statement in whole that young peopl nowaday do not spend enough time to help in their commun . i have made differ experi . on the one hand there are these young peopl who do not spent a lot of time or no time in a commun at all . these peopl are self-centr about theirself and their live becaus they have everyth they need by now and are happi with that . a lot of them do not want to join or help in commun becaus they think it is too much work and they like spend their free time on other thing . a neg thing is that the most of them do not know that help in a commun is not just work but also fun becaus they never experienc it or heard it diffenr from other . but on the other hand there are those young peopl who are help in commun and also join them . these peopl like to be in contact to member of their commun and like to work togeth and make experi togeth aswel as have fun and a good time togeth . there are variou opportun in a commun where you can help at if it is in church or in school or in vacat trip and mani other opportun . these youngster like to spend their time , also their free time , with a lot of peopl that have the same interest . they want to improv thing or make thing like church to other peopl more interest . in my opinion there are about the same number of peopl that are help in a commun and not . i have thi opinion becaus i know a lot of peopl who are activ in a commun but also know a few that are not even member in a commun . in my mind it also depend on the size of the citi . in smaller citi young peopl are probabl more interest in commun than in bigger citi .
