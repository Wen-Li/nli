the question which is discuss in the follow passag is wheter a broad knowledg of mani acadm subject is superior to knowledg specialies in on specif subject . the idea to special in one activ is support by the econom theori . the idea behind thi theori is that the effici increas as we special in do someth . for exampl if we start play an instrument we are get better and beter the more we practic . the more we do someth the better we can do it and the better we know which way it is done best . thi theori can also be appli to educ . a student who studi a subject longer and more intens than anoth is like to know more about it . on the other hand side , there are also mani advantag in have a broad knowledg . everyth that happen , no matter if it is a ecolog , sociolog or anoth issu is somehow link to other academ field . a broad knowledg help to see an issu in the whole context which is in my opinon veri import . if you are run a busi for exampl , it is import to be awar of the ecolog effect you caus . if you would just concentr on the econom side of thi busi and neglect other factor thi could drawback on you in the futur . for exampl think of fishermen who want to increas their profit by fish more in one year . thi behaviour could caus that in the follow year there are to few fish . anoth advantag i see , is that it is easier to commun with other peopl if you have some idea of hi main interest . a broad knowledg can also be an inspir . you can adapt idea from other subject . i person prefer a broad knowledg becaus i like to undestand mani aspect of one problem . i see a lot of chanc in it becaus of the interact between the differ subject . but i also undestand if someon prefer to focu on on subject .
