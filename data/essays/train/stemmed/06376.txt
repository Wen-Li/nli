in gener i do not agre with the satet that most advertisement make product seem much better than they realli are . i say `` in gener '' , becaus there are some except where the advertis show you the perfect situat , which in real life is unlik to happen . from the top of my head i can recal an advertis that show two peopl in a laundri room . destini or the same brand of cigarett got them togeth , show in the end that they live togeth happili ever after thank to that one situat . thi is a clear case where they show cigarett and smoke a lot better than it is . anoth exampl would be the advert sell servic , a bank , supermarket , a public offic , etc , are some unfortun exampl of how the servic shown ha noth to do with realliti . howev , most of the advertis peopl are expos to have no other altern than to show you the product . so , when you see a car ( for instanc ) , you have a realist and clear idea of what the car is like . evenmoreso , the advert make easier to the buyer the process of the deciss at the time of the purchas after have a first visual contact with it through the advert . also they can save time onc a person know exactli what is look for . to conclud , i think that peopl should alway appeal to common scens . think about their need and econom posibl , and not get carri away by fantasi or advertis in the few case where the advert show a product much better than it realli is .
