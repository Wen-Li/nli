i strongli agre with the statement that understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact . while the fact can be basi of analys and develop idea , it is more valuabl to learn abstruct idea for student . there are two reason to support thi argument . one is the applic of concept , and the other is valu of the learn process of idea . firstli , idea and concept can stay in student memori and appli in differ situat . in contrust , fact are fix and forget . for exampl , i use to learn histori in the fact base method and memoris histor event and peopl in detail , but after sever year i forgot everyth which i learn . if i had chanc to think about the reason or possibl solut of the histor event in my head , it would be applic in my own situat . secondari , the process of learn about idea and concept is the effect way of learn rather than memoris fact . in thi process , student tri to underst difficult thing and ask themselv critic . thi is veri import part of learn and it make student more intellig . in conclus , understand idea and concept are more signific in the process of learn .
