most peopl travel to differ destin and visit histor signific monument to know more about them . it expand the span of their knowledg about the cultur and special featur of the kind of peopl inhabit that area . so i would prefer travel in a group which is head by an able-head and knowledg tour guid . for me it would be more explor , interest and a good worth for the money i spend . travel in a group with a guid make one explor an area extens . like a coupl of day back i went for a day trip to the grand canyon in arizona . we had a a guid who made our trip an outing to rememb . sinc he wa a nativ of the region for the past thirti year he told us about all the interest hous of golf player and movi star on our way . he gave a littl background inform about what we were like to see on our way in hi own happi - go - merri way with a small anecdot which made it all the more interest . i wa initi skeptic of embark the trip due to the number of hour spent in the bu but the five hour journey just flew away and seem like an hour or so . we all want that the travel guid we choos should be abl to provid enough inform so that we get our money 's worth . i also think that with a guid i might not feel insecur and worri about lose my way or wast my time look at inappropri site or even . it will make me feel more relax and will fulfil my purpos of embark the trip even more which alway is to invigor my mind and elev my spirit . as far as it is good to have a travel guid , at time it becom messi and irrit have somebodi follow you around especi if you head out on a day when your star are bad . guid can even be quit interf , poke their nose unecessarili in other peopl 's affair , or one might feel restrict to hi whim and fanci . at time they may even get on your nerv . but in my opinion your trip prove to be more fruit when you travel with a guid to lead your way . it will aid in gain a lot more inform about a place and one would feel that they have spent their time and money in a purpos manner .
