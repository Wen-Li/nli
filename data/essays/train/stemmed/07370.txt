i strongli agre that in twenti year there would be fewer car in use than there are today . to support and explain the state point we have mani reason and let review them logic . the main point which hold the statement that in twenti year there would be lesser car than use today would be sinc there is a drastic decreas in the natur fuel be use , such as peteroleum product . to support thi point the recent survey conduct by nation geograph expedit and their studi show that these natur reserv like peteroleum would last for not more than anoth 30 year , if the same rate of usag is continu . thi studi also involv the differ peteroleum product be use as fule , these includ diesel , petrol , gassolin , lpg ( liqufi peteroleum gass ) and other minor fule . we should also includ the case of use natur solar power , or nuclear fuel , but at the present rate of financi invest and other govern polici these donot look to spring up in the next recent year . as for exampl start up a nuclear plant in a place call thungha in the north west part of india took five year . so as a result of increas in the fule price and also the rate of growth of pollut caus by the burn of these petroleum product , peopl are highli encourach to use other mode of travel , for exampl use public transport , metro system , cycl for short distanc . as for exampl in china , employ are adoptinjg techniqui to reduc the usag of car , like locat close to work place , use metro system for travel . also when we focu on the govern polici be laid in recent time , we see that more encourang is give for public transport than for purchas for car . as take for exampl a place call bangalor locat in india , dure the past five year then price for fuel ha grown by more than hundr percentag , while to compens for thi issu , the govern had activ more public transport , alloc industri area next to be in one major locat , where the fequenc of public transport is concentr . thi did lead to the decreas in the usag of car in bangalor . also we may rais the point of use sloar power and other mode of gener fuel for car , like liquid fuel where water is a byproduct ( present use to power up space flight and super sonic jet ) , also use electr car which also need petroleum product to gener , but thi demand for great amount of revenu and also a mojor world collobr . also the research in these file donot show big progress form the past year for major car product . so look at these featur , thi will take time and we can not expect them to happen with in the next twenti year . paral thier would also be the deplet of fuel in the world lead to minorti class of peopl to use car ( those who could afford the high price of petroleum product ) . henc as state and explain with exampl , accord to me i agre that in twenti year there would be fewer car in use than there are as of today .
