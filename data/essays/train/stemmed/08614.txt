regard the statement i consid myself absoluley in favour , sinc under my perspect , advertis are intend onli to persuad the reader or listen to buy the product . they dont realli care if you like or not the advertis , they just focu on the econom effect of it . as a result they are will to give a wrong idea of a product in order to ensur their econom profit of it . as a matter of exampl , we daili see comerci of food , where for instanc food is prepar in a certain manner that it simpli look irresit to your eye . they tend tu use several implement that provid a chang version of what the food realli wa . recal the exampl of a burguer we can appeci the way in which they will show the burguer as a tent meal . some aspect such as it texutr and physic appear might be modifi in order to ensur that you creat a mental imag of the burguer and your futur meal might be it . also they can creat or manipul peopl comment regard the burger so that for instnac you get to know what other felt when eat such meal . anoth type of prduct that tend to be use for advertis are the excersic machin , that are shown to be easier to work on , and prove to have inmedi result . the main object of thi is to sell a determin apparatu that will provid what they think your bodi requir , for instanc the ab pro is a machin to work on where you by just slightli move train your muscl and reinforc their shape . the advertis use well prepar and fine physic peopl to use the machin in order to give you the idea that after use it , you will end as that person . the truth is that advertis actual provid us of inform concern several product . howev due to the fact that their object is to promot a product they are prepar to modifi the product in some aspect in order to ensur the sell of it . just like the exampl given of the buguer and the machin where you actual see a chang product in order to persuad you on buy that particular object . obvious the modif they do on the product is intend to make it look better , so that you are will to buy it .
