we all are awar of the fact that `` knowledg of divin '' . by academ studi we gain some knowledg to prove ourselv in our concern field . i disagre with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg than to special in one specif subject '' . as we know `` roll stone ha no moss '' , similarli the man with interest in mani subject is not worth . the reason for which i disagre is that a person with specialis in one specif subject will have more demand than a person with knowledg of mani academ subject . as we see peopl in our daili life , a lectur , a draughtsman , a lawyer , etc. these are all specialist in one particular subject . the second reason is that as we know that thi world is full of competit . everyon face competit in hi field . if we are specialis in one particular subject , we can thrive hard and we can get rid of thi competit , by have immens knowledg of one subject . the third reason i would like to present , is that a person 's abil of learn may be more , but it is limit to a particular file or a particular subject . if anyon wish to have broad knowledg of mani acedem subject he may not be abl to grasp all the stuff from the subject . it not just the matter of possibl or not , it just imposs to anyon to have such a memoris or knowledg accumul power . the last and final reason is that though have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , he will work to a file or organis where he use the knowledg of one particular subject . but not all the knowledg of hi all subject . if he want to switch over to other file , he ha to work from the begin i.e. like a beginn . so i prefer to have broad knowledg in one specif subject to have broad knowledg in mani subject .
