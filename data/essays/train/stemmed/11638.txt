i agre with the viewpoint that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are mani reason to prove my viewpoint . one of the main reason for fewer car in use in futur may be the crude price . crude price are increas day by day which result increas in petrol and diesel price . increas price will affect the use of the car becaus it might be veri difficult for normal person to cope up wit increas price . there is lot of demand for crude and as it is non renew sourc , it is go to becom expens in come futur . increas in petroleum product have major impact on sale of car . other reason may be increas in traffic due to high number of car sale . peopl may get frustrat becaus of traffic and may prefer use public transport rather than car . for e.g most peopl work in london citi travel by train becaus it is more convini for them to use train rather than car . it will be more cheaper for peopl to use public transport rather than use a car . even govern is tri to improv public transport which result in more conveni to peopl . in futur may be price of car may rise due to increas in raw materi for make a car . to compens with the increas price of raw materi , compani ha to increas price of the final product , so thi increas in price is pass on to custom which may resist custom to buy new car . increas in pollut due to burn of fuel in car may push govern to impos new law which may add addit cost to custom and they may get reluct to buy new car . so , in summari there will be fewer car in use in futur than today . neway it is veri difficult to predict a futur but accord to me car sale will have neg effect becaus of the reason that i have mention abov .
