first of all i think it hardli depend on your busi wheter you should tri new thing and take risk or onli do what you alreadi know how to do well . so in some job it is just import to be good at like for exampl someon who work at a bank and ha to check the financi situat of a compani . therefor you do not have to take ani risk or tri someth new becaus there are strong rule you have to keep . if you are reliabl and do thi job well you can be veri success . on the other hand for exampl if you would like to get a success architect you have to do someth that differ you from the other architect . thu you have to be will to take risk by for exampl develop some new type of style . but that is veri difficult to handl becaus just a realli small number of invent are also done in realiti . so it cost you a lot of time to develop new thing not know wheter you will have success or not , but if you are abl to creat someth realli new and fabol you will normal be much more success than a person who doe not take risk and tri new thing . accordingli i think you can say that everyon should tri to increas hi focu of view and stay in touch with new develop becaus nearli everyon ha to learn hi whole life . you will never be abl to learn everyth and new aspect come to daylight everi year . so everyon ha totri new thing more or less . in conclus i would say that you should tri new thing and take risk if you want to becom a veri success person but you can also have success if you are just well in what you are do . so it depend on your job and what you are will to do .
