nowaday , more and more student start to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . actual it is a veri good way for they to succeed in their studi field becaus of the follow reason . first , idea and concept are the root of ani studi . if a student doe not understand the idea and concept , how can he/sh find relat with the real life ? fact are revel to the idea and concept , but after idea and concept are discov , then we can appli the idea and concept to the fact . so idea and concept are more import than fact . in addit , idea and concept can appli to problem while studi . as mention , they are the origin of the studi . therefor ani problem relat to the studi should be base on the idea and concept or they can be expans of the idea and concept . for instanc , in geometri studi , there are a lot of theori in a circl . the theori are the concept and idea . from these theori , teacher can develop more and more problem . if a student doe well in the circl test , he/sh must have master the idea and concept of the circl veri well . or he/sh would not get good mark just by learn fact . futhermor , while do a lectur about some cours , the student are requir to expand his/her topic from the idea and concept . they are not taught to give the lectur right from the fact . becaus start from the fact will make the lectur hard to be accept by other who are not familiar with the topic . the idea and concept are alway the basi of ani lectur . afterward , the fact can be display fulli to the listen . thi is what a memor lectur requir . in conclus , idea and concept usual are the paramount factor of ani studi . therefor , it is more import for sutdent to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . then they will be master knowledg better in the futur .
