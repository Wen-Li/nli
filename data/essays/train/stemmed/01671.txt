take risk is an import part of life . it involv tri new method , live in new environ , and learn new experi . in my opinion , i certain believ that to be success , you alway have to challeng yourself with new thing to promot your abil . when you are routin do an activ , you becom an expert at it after some time , and you gain no further knowledg about it . take for exampl , a teacher who ha been teach the same seventh grade math curriculum for ten year . at the start of hi work he will be enthusiast , thrive on new way to teach , and tri to do hi best in class to convey the concept . in a coupl of year time , he might develop new and innov way to pass the concept to hi student , but after he reach that , he will have no further motiv to enhanc becaus he will have reach a peak . hi teach method might even declin . consid thi same teacher move to a new school , that teach math in differ way , or even teach other level other than seventh grader . hi new experi will broaden hi knowledg and prospect about the subject , and will make him a more experienc teacher . although move to the new school requir him to take a risk , becaus he wa alreadi known to be good at hi old school in the particular grade he taught , move open a new and challeng field for him . it allow him to learn new approach , deal with differ age group , and add to hi overal teach experi . he can be a more success teacher becaus he dealt with differ area of hi work instead of do the same thing over and over again . to be a success person , you should never let the fear of lose stand in your way . alway take risk , and seek new opportun to help you grow and develop in your work environ or commun .
