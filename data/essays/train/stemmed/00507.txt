on the one hand , i agre in some way with the statement say that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' for specif reason . first , one ca n't deni that young peopl are healthi and it make their every-day-lif easier than for older peopl : less sleep problem , mani outdoor activ offer , etc . then , young peopl do benefit from an other import advantag : they have time in front of them . inde , such a situat help to make plan for one 's futur . on top of that , young peopl can benefit from the fact that they do not have children and the respons go with it . furthermor , life for young peopl often appear as easier and less heavi becaus of their easygo way of be and think . but , on the other hand , mani reason encourag me to disagre with the discuss statement and say that young peopl do not alway enjoy life more than older peopl do . inde , i would first underlin the fact that older peopl often - but not alway - have someth veri preciou that youngster do not have : matur . and it is to my mind a great help to handl everyday life . there are mani thing i have done when i wa young i wish i could do again with the experi i got sinc that time . an other thing which also often lack young peopl : money . for insanc , it is quit a heavi situat to be a student , even if adult often forget thi and onli remind the good side of their youth . as a conclus , i would say that enjoy life is not realli a matter of age but rather the way one handl with it . it happen that youngster with matur , money and health realli appreci life , wherea older peopl can lack matur and money . so there is no rule of age and enjoy age , i would rather say it is an everi day work on oneself
