the import for student to understand idea rather than fact is a crucial point when you are begin high school or when you are go to the univers . there is a moment when you say that the most import thing is to understand theori , concept or idea befor you should do practic or practic work . person , i difer from thi idea becaus i think there are two kind of job , the analyt one and the practic one . when you work as a cleaner o do some practic work where your physic effort is more import , then there ha noth to do with concept or idea to understand or identifi . nevertheless , if you are work as a clerk assist or administr in a bank agenc you should know the specif procedur about the job and the condit that are relev to succeed . howev , it is true that both kind of job need rule and specif condit to be done . in the first case , you will be abl to follow instruct from your supervisor and the area of clean such as the schedul and you will have to respect the time of your labor . imagin you are in charg of clean window in a seventi five build in china . it is probabl that you are a veri well califi clean worker , becaus it is not the same to clean a three floor hous window than the build in china . sure , there are mani techniqu that can be describ in some manual or ani specialis book but the condit about the high and the sensat of the altitud are veri differ from the one describ in the manual . here the point is about the practic fact you should have to succeed in your labor . you may read about the way to clean the window but you will not learn everyth from just read about the concept : you should do the job , you should be in contact with the labour to prove the condit and everyth . as far as i am concern , i think it is import to understand idea and concept but it is more import to learn fact , special when you are do physic work . talk about my person experi i should mention that in most of my profesion perform i learnt the best from the responsibilit in charg of than from the concept i studi .
