i do n't agre with the statement about most advertis make their product better than they realli are . it undoubt give some fake permit to peopl and would make nobodi to believ ani advertis ani more . there wa an old advertic about mallbor . in that advertis an actor who alway act as a cowboy wa show in it . thi advertis made peopl , especi young men believ smoke wa relativ to `` cool '' . howev , thi actor die of lung cancer final . but the fact is that nobodi know dure hi life time how mani young die or would die an same reason becaus of thi fake advertis . thu thi kind of advertis realli doe bad thing to peopl . it 's hard to deni that there realli are some advertis are true , good to peopl . but , ask youself , how much dare you believ in advertis , becaus you can not point out which of them is real . depend on the same reason , nowaday , advertis are not a way to tell peopl what kind of product they can buy , instead they are becom are kind of bore show on tv . so the bad advertis harm the peopl who believ them , and at the same time they hurt thi field , too . from these reason , i think nobadi would n't agre with my situat , especi those who were cheat by some bad advertis . i wa work in thi field , so i could see both of these . so i hope it would not happen again .
