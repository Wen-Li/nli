the issu at hand is whether understand idea and concept is import for student rather than learn fact . thi is an import issu becaus the essens of educ is not `` what '' onli but also `` how '' . in my opinion , i believ that student need to understand how thing happen rather than onli learn fact about these thing . thi is becaus of differ thing . first of all , some student are not satisfi about just learn and memor . thu when the professor explain how certain thing happen , the inform will be stuck in the student head and they will have no futur problem for memriz some fact . for instanc , when it come to engin , it is not like to know onli what engin are but how they work . thi will help in fix both the result and the fact in the student 's mind . moreov , when it come to real life , student will eventu start practic what they learn in academi . some student will mayb forget some fact but just when they remeb how the professor explain thi subject or how it work they will be abl to work accur in their real life . thu , understand idea help the student to accuretli appli what they learn . furthermor , some fact could n't be learn unless understand . thi is the fact of mani physic theori . for instanc , professor can spend a lot of time explain what current is . but student need not know fact about current but they need to know how it work to know where it field of applic is . as a result , it is import for student to understand idea rather than learn fact . thi is becaus thi will help them in their academ , futur career and the field of applic
