it is rather imposs to gener and state that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . therefor , i cant wholeheartedli agre with the aforment statement . travel could be broken into multi categori that may includ tourism , religi tourism , safari and adventur , and busi . the statement may work well for some kind of travel but may unlik be suitabl for other . for exampl , honey mooner are not like to be keen to travel within group let alon have a tour guid with them most of the time sinc privaci is valuabl and treasur by newli wed and even coupl seek to spend qualiti romant time togeth . conversli , travel for religi reason may underscor the import of travel in group led by guid . to further clarrifi thi point , piligrimag is a rather complex practic that may requir travel within group as requir by certain regul and need . that becom clear in saudi arabia , where piligrim can not travel on their own to mecca in the hajj season ( piligrimag ) and they are requir to travel in group accompani by tour guid who are more like to be familiar with the hajj practic and terrain . addit , peopl seek adventur normal prefer to have their own itinirari and most likley prefer to travel accord to their own pace , plan , and prefer . as an exampl , a tourist plan to climb mount evarest will unlik wish to stick to group and share common itinrari . manag cost may make travel in group more attract especi that tour opperat are capabl to get attract deal on larger group . accordigli , thi situat rais the issu of tour guid to maxim qualiti time spent and ensur that the group is expos to the largest number of attract . in conclus , the argument present abov make it clear that it is almost imposs to gener that it is , inde , the best way to travel is in group led by tour guid . it is unequivicolli clear that the characterest of peopl and reason for travel are so variab distinct and differ which onli make it incumb on me to diasgre with the aforment statement .
