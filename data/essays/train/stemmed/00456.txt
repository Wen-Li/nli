although i 'm a young person myself , i have to agre with the statement with a heavi heart . the lack of particip in commun servic among young peopl result mainli from lack of time . i am current a student in a competit high school , and the demand of schoolwork allow me veri littl free time . school begin at 7:40 in the morn and end at 5:10 in the afternoon . sinc i live veri far from the school i attend , i have to commut by train for three hour each day . when i reach home , it 's almost 7:00 pm . the sun ha set , the sky ha darken , the commun is almost asleep , and i have ton of homework to do . there is neither time nor opportun for me to help out in my commun , regardless of how much i want to serv and contribut . most high school student in the unit state have finish hundr of hour of commun servic befor they graduat from high school . colleg in the u.s. often consid the hour spent on commun servic when evalu an applic , emphas the import of a student 's willing to serv hi or her commun . colleg in taiwan , howev , put veri littl emphasi on commun servic when view applic . instead , test score and academ accomplish are given major consider . student devot their time and energi to activ that colleg find more import and neglect those that are thought trivial , result in a lack of dedic to commun servic . some high school in taiwan requir their student to finish a certain amount of commun servic hour each year . the minimum my high school set for us is 8 hour each semest . student use the littl free time they have dure summer and winter vacat to finish the requir hour of commun servic , do simpl job such as sweep up fallen leav , volunt at the local librari or tidi up the lobbi . student have no time to particip in more meaning and long-term communti servic , such as help out each day at the local day care center , orgin a group to reinforc the recycl habit of resid , or tutor for free at a public middl school . from my observ and person experi , i agre that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . it is a regrett situat , but it is a situat that canb improv if student are given more free time and a stronger sens of commun . that way , student will be abl to particip more in commun servic and receiv a wonder experi by spend time help other and build a better commun .
