in later year advertisen have increas a lot , especi on tv and newspap . the most part of spot present product or servic in a way that can make them appear better then they realli are . mani and mani tecniqu are use to present product enphatis their qualiti : for exampl in icecream 's spot they use a camera record at a veri high fp ( frame per second ) and then play the spot at a lower speed . use thi tecniqu icecream will appear to be more creamli even if they are n't realli like that . i complet refus the trend to present product in thi way . in my opinion advertis must present product or servic as they realli are . present product in such a way is also a risk for the firm : custom may be unsatisfay by what they have bought if it is n't as the advertis ha present it . probabl they will not buy someth from that brand no more . i think that also govern should do someth to stop thi trend : for exampl the state should creat a team respons to verifi if product are as they will be present in spot . if a product seem better that it realli is , state should punish trasgressor with financi penalti . nowaday firm must creat advertis that present product better than they are becaus everi firm do that and peopl will not buy at all product if they seem lower qualiti than other even from spot . firm could stop thi trend by creat a team control all advertis : firm produc advertis the best that they can but present product as they are . befor publish advertis the control team will check if the present of product is or not correspond to real product . if the check is posit , the advertis can be publish . thi is also a way to help custom to choos the best product they need .
