nowaday , as we all notic , advertis have been becom more and more atract . as far as i am concern , i total agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . inde , first of all becaus i believ that it is a kind of market just to make peopl choos one specif brand and not an other one . for instanc , you can quickli think that you want to buy someth that you had see on t.v. wherea , if you did not have see it you even may not know that the product exist befor . moreov , secondli i am convinc that advertis are liabl to lie about the qualiti but also about the appar of the product . infact , most of the time , a product can seem the best of the world on the pictur and when you go to buy it , you are generali disapoint . final , even if , sometim , the product conrespond exactli to what the advertis show , that case remain veri seldom today . furthermor , becaus of the progress of new technolog , you can now modifi pictur even on televis in order to turn them more atract and interest for peopl . as a conclus i would say that we do not have to trust in appar but better in our own opinion of the product just to avoid fall in the new consom societi . that is the onli way to be less disapoint byt
