impli that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well '' is not a veri reliabl concept of one 's success in my opinion . ye , it is true that you have to tri new thing or new idea becaus we live in a veri fast move economi and new busi and technolog are rise steadili . but you also have to trust your own way of accomlish thing especi if you know how . to manifest my opinion i want to give you an exampl . let 's say a veterinarian perform surgeri on a dog the `` old-fashion '' way with scapel blade and other devic . it ha alway been like thi and the success outcom and fast heal support thi idea . nowaday some veterinarian use laser to do surgeri . it 's be promot to be faster and less bloodi . but the wound heal is realli ugli . the wound keep drain , the owner are complain about the mess and there is also a veri high chanc of infect . do it the old way with scapl blade incis and sutur afterward is take a littl longer of cours but is more suffici becaus the heal is faster in my opinion and you do n't have to worri too much about wound care as far as drain goe . also the dog itself will be happier becaus there is no inconveni ooz spot on the bodi . and if the dog is happi , the owner are happi and the veterinarian ha success done his/her work . so , you do n't have to tri so-cal `` new thing '' or tri `` riski busi '' as long as you know that you are do it the right way . and by do it the right way you will do well afteral . and to stress my disagr with the abov statement i 'm go to write my favorit quot : `` never chanc a win team '' !
