accord to me it is quit true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the huge amount of industri that make the same or similar product have brought to a point where it is difficult to go on , so they ha start to find way to gain more money otherwis they will not be abl to surviv . as a result they ha begun to reduc cost of product and thi mean also less qualiti in the product they make , but howev to convinc peopl to buy these product it is necessari they believ that thi product are great ; to do thi industri ha start to make advertis that present a certain object as one of the best ever produc and it doe n't matter if it 's not true . a clear exampl about what i 'm say is about mobil phone : the first mobil phone are n't so glamour like those we can find now , but they were realli resist and they could be use for year without ani problem ; the new one instead are n't so resist and ha a lot of problem and it could happen we have to chang them after onli a coupl of year , but the advertis about them paint anoth realiti . accord to these advertis the product shown is the greatest ever sold and focu our attent on the innov thi object ha and also assur us it wo n't have troubl . anoth exampl is about car ; most of car produc when promot their new vehicl explain us all those thing that they have done well and that contribut to make us interest in thi car , like speed , horsepow , acceler , option and mayb after , we buy it , we know that is not safe in certain condit or it ha n't pass some test
