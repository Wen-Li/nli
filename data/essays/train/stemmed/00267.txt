i disagre with the given statement becaus , with a tour guid , we can not go wherev we want . with a tour guid , the place we vist will be sever limit , becaus everyth includ hotel to say , store to go and place to see are all fix befor the trip . it kill an enjoy part of travel . the travel plan by travel agenc usual includ onli famou place , so even if we can go to grand canyon , for exampl , by the tour , we can not usual visit local town around there . but i think one of the advantag of travel is to see and touch the local cultur or ethnic . the place we go by the tour may look to have those but they actual do not . they , i believ , are for travel and wait for us . in order to actual feel the countri or region , we need to go actual local town or villag , where we can not go by tour . concern abov , peopl might say travel in a group is easier and more conveni . howev , these day there is not so much differ between travel alon and travel in a tour thank to the develop of inform technolog . i think the onli merit that travel in a tour ha is that we can reli on the profession tour guid and get variou kind of inform easili . but nowaday , we can use the internet and search for what is famou , the histori of the region or whi the place is attract to the travel . in other word , there is no longer inform gap between ordinari travel and profession tour guid . therefor , there is no inferior in travel alon to travel in tour . travel alon is better sinc we can have all right for the place we go , and onli travel by oneself guarante the opportun to touch the local cultur or tradit . there is no bad point in travel alon becaus we can gain much inform through the internet if we want to go to the place a tour usual goe . therefor , i conclud , travel by oneself is superior to travel in a group led by a tour guid .
