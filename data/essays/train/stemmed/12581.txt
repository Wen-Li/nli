the issu whether the student understand idea and concept is more importnat for them to learn fact is of great interest amont peopl . in my opinion , the student understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact becaus it is reason and it is the first step of learn knowledg . student can studi better if they know the idea and concept . first of all , if the student do not know the idea and concept , how can they discov the new thing while they are learn . student studi new knowledg logic . know the idea and concept is good for their studi . learn knowledg is a thing which should be step by step . second , when student studi a new kind of knowledg , they have curios to know what is go happen in the new studi . tell student the new idea and concept would stimul the interest of learn . i third , while studi student may do a lot of research in librari or on-lin that will bring surpris news to student . student can use the idea and concept which they just learn to solv the new problem . thi method can develop student ' spirit of explor . in summari , i prefer understand idea and concept to learn fact . understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact .
