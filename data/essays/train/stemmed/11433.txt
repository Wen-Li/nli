for our grandmoth it wa the flyer , for our parent it wa the televis and for us it is almost everywher we exist . advertis are cover more and more space in our live ; billboard , internet , build or even peopl can be holder for advertis . yet , the question is whether or not we are be treat candidli about the product the advertis repres . inde , we are often equivoc by ad in the sens that flaw or defici qualiti of a product can be well conceal wherea the suprem qualiti are underscor perfectli in an ad thank to the extrem commun skill of advertis . one could present a comput program which ha the abil to perform a specif task , say convert one file to anoth , and he may never mention how slow it perform it duti . from my experi , i could show the test center in which i am take toefl as a paradigm for thi situat . it is quit a well known and respect compani . when one enter through it door , he is dazzl by the ad everywher claim how superior the compani is . yet , their comput have shown a lot of malfunct befor the test . nonetheless , too much of cynic is not correct . one could present mani situat similar to mine , but that doe n't necessarili mean that we are alway misl by ad . in conclus , i believ that ad do make product seem much better but some product can be realli better . therefor it is better to keep a piec of optim insid .
