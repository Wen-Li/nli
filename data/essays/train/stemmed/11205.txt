the topic is about `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . i agre with the statement for the follow reason . the younger poepl will enjoy in their age as they have more strength and enthusiasm than the old peopl . the old peopl feel that there life is over and they had noth to do . as the life is begin for them , they do not have problem as the old peopl have they will enjoy themselv by spend time with friend , famili , and play sport in their leisur time . they do n't have ani bodi to care at that time . they enjoy a lot dure classtim also by crack joke on professor . they have more fun by go to parti with friend . as they are energet and interest in mani thing they will enjoy by do thing what they want . they will not feel about the futur , they alway think about the present . they will enjoy the life of young age by do mischeiv thing as they are not matur as old peopl . they dont care about other peopl . as the life is almost over for old age peopl they alway think about the past and as they did not have much energi they ca n't enjoy what the young peopl enjoy . the old peopl alway thought about there famili and theur hard ship rather than their enjoy . as there is say `` onc the age gone it will not regain back '' , onc the young age is over it will not come , so we have to enjoy at that period . some old peopl think that they had n't have enjoy in their young age , so one should have enjoy in their young age as the age goe on we can not retain our enjoy . as the time is not regain we have to enjoy at the right time . so i conclud that the younger peopl enjoy life more than old peopl . my view is that we have to enjoy when there is abil to enjoy , it doesnot come back when the time is over and we lost lot in life .
