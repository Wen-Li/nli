i am total agre with thi statement , i think that alway the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are and thi is becaus that is the intent of the advertis . an advertis of a product is creat to make peopl to buy the product , so it must show that the product is the best product that you can buy among other product . in thi way , if an advertis of a product doe not make the product to seem a good product , it is not a good advertis . on the other hand , an advertis must tell the true about the product that it is tri to sell . if for exampl an advertis of an mp3 player say that the devic have 512 mb of capac and it actual have onli 256 mb the advertis is lie about the featur of the devic and thi is against the law . so , what i want to say is that i agre with the statement but onli if it refer to advertis that not lie about the characterist of the product . i think that is total correct to do an advertis that make the product seem much better than it realli is but alway if thi is make by tell the true to the potenci custom . an other exampl of advertis that alway make the product seem better than it realli is , are the one of food . when you go to a restaur they show you pictur a plate and you look at it and you feel that it is realli tast and that you are go to enjoy it veri much , but then when you buy the plate you realiz that it wa not that tast . to conclud , i think that nowaday televis and internet is full of advertis thar make product seem much better than they realli are , but it is not a bad thing becaus that is whi the advertis are for
