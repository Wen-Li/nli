i agre with the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus of follow reason . the first reason is that the popul of the rich countri will rapidli decreas and the number of the peopl who can buy car will decreas . for exampl , the birth rate of japan is approxim 1.1 . the tendenc of thi low rate is similar to other rich countri such as european countri . the second reason is that the public transpot system is rapidli develop and therefor peopl will choos thi system rather than buy car becaus the fomer is much cheaper than the latter . thi tendenc will be enforc becaus the price of oil is rapidli rise . for exampl , the japanes prime minist abe said that the govern would permit the construct of special express line call shincansen in hokkaido area which is famou as the domest place for vacat . thi conveni shincansen will make japanes not to buy car . the third reason is that depress in rich countri will decreas the motiv to buy car . for exampl , the deep depress in japan limit how much they ca use freeli . so it is more difficult for them to buy car . within 20 year , we do not have the motiv to buy more car becaus of these reason . that is whi there will be ferer car in use than there are today in twenti year .
