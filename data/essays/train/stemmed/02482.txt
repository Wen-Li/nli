i agre thi statement , `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i 've been go to school for 12 year . i am a high school student . i learn mani thing at school . my favorit class is english class which i think is the most import subject we have to learn . in english class , we read some book and discuss what the book tell us . when we discuss about the book , everybodi ha differ opinion and it is stimul to know what other peopl say and figur out what the author is tri to say . there are too mani messag in book for a person to understand by oneself . i think we need to discuss with mani peopl who are smarter and have differ idea . the book do n't tell us fact . they tell us idea and concept . that 's whi we need to get togeth and find those idea and concept . those idea and concept are onli clear to the author who write the book . the author tri to tell other peopl hi idea and concept by write book , but it is imposs for him to perfectli tell them . thi is the reason we keep studi idea and concept , and i think it is import for us to understand them . i think idea and concept are more import than fact . fact are like the thing we learn in physic , chemistri or math . we need to know all those fact to be investor or some scientist , but i do n't think learn fact is the main purpos of educ . i alway have a special feel for be a human , becaus we can not onli know the fact , but also creat idea and concept . other anim can not do that . i think to understand idea and concept make us more cultiv and better in mani way . fact let us know what is go in the world we see , and idea and concept let us know what is go on in our mind . i think it is more import to understand idea and concept becaus they have deeper mean and they will make us better peopl . i believ that 's we have to do throughout
