it is said that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . person , i agre with thi say for two reason . one , young peopl like to explor new stuff , and learn about it . second reason , young peopl have more energi than older peopl . first , young peopl like to eplor new stuff like place . peopl like to explor new stuff , and see new thing . for exapl , when i watch someth that i like , i tell my self , i want to tri that thing , and i do . older peopl on the other hand , like to quistion everi thing befor do it . one time i saw one of my friend ride a four wheel motercycl . i seid to my self `` i want to tri that motercycl '' , so i stope him , a nd told him that i want to ride with him on hi motercycl . if i were an older man , i would n't of done that . second , younger peopl have more energi to do stuff . for exapl an older man or woman would not like to tri skate . howev younger peopl love skate , and they will tri it even if they do n't know how to . as a fact , late i have been travl alot , i travel in economi class , no matter how tire i git , becaus that more fun than first class . in conclus , older peopl , and younger peopl should learn how to enjoy life like it should be . pleasur dose n't know what you are . so enjoy your life , and live it to the fullest , old and young peopl . howev in my countri , an old man or an old woman is veri respict . so , when poepl see an older man have fun in a place where teenag are have fun too , peopl tend to think that that old man is live a teenag life , which is not veri good .
