in gener , it seem that young peopl have mani opportun for einjoy the life becaus they have physic power to play , studi , and so on . howev , in my opinion , older peopl actual enjoy life more than young pepl do . thi is becaus that older peopl have advantag in term of time , money , and experi . first of all , most of young peopl do not have enough time for use their time for enjoy . young peopl need to work to obtain sarali and they have to support their famili . as they are veri busi to work they do not have the time to do someth enjoy . to make matter wors , they need to rest on holiday becaus they are often tire with dali work . on the contrari , older peopl do not have to work becaus they can live with social secur system . they can spend their time for enjoy instead of work . in japan , for instanc , a lot of older peopl go for a trip , concentr on hobbi , excercis in park with thier friend . as a result , i can say that older peopl actual enjoy life more than young peopl . second of all , older peopl gener have the money for enjoy the life . as i mention abov , older peopl can live with social secur sysem . they can obtain money for live from govern ( as least in my countri , japan ) . the money which is offerd by govern so enough that old peopl can use it for enjoy such as trip or shop . final , older older peopl are experienc man who know how to enjoy the life . as they live longer time than younger peopl , they actual know the way to use the time effect . for exampl , older peopl have a lot of memori by which they can enjoy to talk each other . they also have famil includ grandson . it is true that there are some older peopl who do not have enough time , money , and experi for enjoy life . all in all , though , i think that older peopl have advantag for enjoy life . that 's whi i disagre with the statement .
