i disagre with the idea that there will be fewer car in next twenti year in use than there are today . the car is one of the necessari thing for the peopl who live in today 's societi . it make the life of peopl more convini and easi . mani peopl use the car as transport to go to work , shop and anywher they want to go . some of them prefer to use the car as transport rather than use the public transport becaus it is normal more convini , no need to check the bu or train time , and make peopl feel more confort , not give them the time to worri stranger . in some countri , the parent take the children to school for safeti . there are even the peopl who need to have the car in their actual life for the reason of live the place where the public transport are unavai or not realli affect . it is hard to live in today 's societi withought the car for the peopl who have been in the convini life . also , the reason that peopl own the car is not onli for the convini and modern life . some peopl use the car for their leasur such as drive . it can be the time to relax , be away for them . or it is even the time to share with famili . the use of car is not just for transport but for their emot and famili life . there are sever reason that peopl in today 's societi need to own the car and as long as their passion for the car will be alter to the other ,
