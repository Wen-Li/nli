i agre with the statement that now the world is full of car , and probabl in the futur we will have more . so i agre with the statement that in twenti year there will be more car in use than today . i agre with thi statement for two fondament reason . the first is that the tecnolog today is grow up veri quickli , and so it is more easi to built car faster and better than yesterday . in addict to thi fact the fabric of car spend less money to do them , and so they produc a huge number of them . probabl in the futur , by the fact that is so easi and so econom to buy a car , everi peopl will have one . secondli i think that peopl realli like to drive and to have car , and thi is an other reason whi the commerc of them will be increas in the futur . today , in our societi , the car repres one of the statu simbol of the person who own that object . that is a veri big problem becos it could gener differens and gelosi between peopl . in conclus i think that in the futur peopl will buy more car than today , and so in twenti year a person could have more than one car than today .
