thi question is realli import not onli for peopl who are plan and start studi at a colleg or univers but also for peopl alreadi work in a specif area . in my eye you should special in a specif subject as soon as possibl . there are a lot of academ area you can studi so at first you have to identifi that one that fit best to your person interest . when you are interst in math for exampl it doe not make a lot of sens to studi literatur . so at that point you have to make the first special . in my eye that will help you to succeed in your studi becaus you are learn someth about topic you are realli interest in . after finish studi the process of special continu . when you have studi busi for exampl i think it doe not make a lot of sens to search a job where you have to appli the whole knowledg you have collect dure your studi . you will lack the propper knowledg to perform difficult task which will lead to failur and in the worst case you will loos your job . therefor i think after finish busi studi for exampl you have to special again an mayb search for a job in the market or control depart of a compani . even when you now work in a specif area , the process of special should still continu . to becom a success employe for exampl i think you now must becom a specialist in specif task of the area you are work in . when you are work in the market depart of a consult compani for exampl you could special to the market of chemic product . in my eye these step of special in a specif subject are the best way to becom not onli success in your job but also help you to divid the import inform from the unimport one . altough you should not lack a propper knowledg about other academ topic you have to special in order to be not provid with a overload of inform you can not handl with .
