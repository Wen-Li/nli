young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . thi statement accord to me is not appropri as we can observ in our day to day life mani older peopl enjoy their live more than younger peopl . but of cours at an averag we see alot of young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . young peopl enjoy alot becaus they are still at the intial stage of their life and they are not encounterd with ani practic problem of their live . and at the young age peopl have less respons , so , they gener dont encount ani problem in day to day life . peopl at the young age are gener look after by their parent and it is their parent who provid all the facil need by them . so peopl at the young age enjoy life alot . but thi is not the case everi time , if a young person from poor financi background may not be abl to get all the facil and therefor it need for him to work veri hard to surviv i.e he need to spend more time on work hour and so he may miss all the enjoy and fun that hi fellowmen are have . so it depend on variou factor that are surround that particular person . and come to older peopl , as these peopl have gone through variou phase of life they are not easili attract by the pleasur of enjoy . some peopl may have gone through the enjoy phase in their earli stage of life , so , they are not that inetrest in enjoy and rather like to spend their time on the thing that give pleasur to them like help the peopl who have lost their famili in a ntural disast , that is by do social servic . older peopl with good financi condit and peopl who are satisfi with their achiv mat enjoy alot than the averag young peopl . so conclud , i would like to state that the enjoy of peopl whether they are young or older depend on the circumast and condit of their live . therefor it is true in some case but it is bot the case in some other condit . final i would like to state that the statement given is not alway true and so it can not be agre or disagre .
