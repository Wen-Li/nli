i agre with the statement complet . these day , there are variou kind of advertis in the world . it is truth that those advertis make a product seem the best one in the world . there could be sveral method of advertis the product , such as use beuti model and use the time pressur . first of all , in america , there are a ton of advertis on televis . i think amerian are use to watch those advertis without ani opinion ; in other word , even though the product which are show on tv look good for them , peopl who are whatch it do not believ easili . howev , i had experi about that . when i came to amerian . everi advertis were veri attr in my mind , when i saw one scean for advertis pant with a wonder model , i realli want to have the pant becuas i thought i would look like the model when i worn the pant . howev , my thought wa complet wrong . when i tri on it , it look like much fatter than were the other pant . through thi experi , i realiz that most advertis exager their product with particular object . in addit , most advertis show for veri short time on tv . short time make peopl not think care ; in other word , when we watch the advertis , we have to quickli judg whether the product is appropri or not . it also easi to misunderstand about the product , so we could rememb the product would be much better than they realli are . although most advertis exager their product , it is difficult to avoid the situat . i think we have to know how to distinguish between the true and worng aspect when we buy some product by advertis .
