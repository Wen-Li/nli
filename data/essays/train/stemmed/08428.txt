i am agre , becasu when sucess peopl take risk to do someth els , they discov that they are abl to do new thing , and they can help anoth peopl with their problem or with their proyect . if i know that i am sucess in type wihtout see , it doe n't mean that i am go to be onli concentr in thi matter becaus that will not help me to take a risk and tri to do someth different . that mean i would never know that i am abl to do new thing veri well . one exampl is when i wa younger , i want to be a teacher , but a i wa afraid , becaus i did not know what grade level i will be teach , becasu when i wa a colleg student , i use to practic second grade , and it wa the grade level that i like , but i thougth about it , if i wo n't take the risk , i wo n't find out how well i will be as a teacher in a high grade level . so i took the risk and i got a fourth grade level and i had a wounder class . all my student were promot to the next grade level , which mean they were succes at the end of the school year . that show me , that if i would n't take the risk i would'n know i could be a good teacher in a high grade level . i mean , higher than second grade . so i recommen to the peopl to take the risk and tri new thing rather to be there stock in one thing forev . the new thing that you can do well , will help you to be succes in differ field , and that will help you to have a better way to live and enjoy your job or job .
