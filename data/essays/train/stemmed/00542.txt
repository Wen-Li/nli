i think older peopl should enjoy life more than young peopl . old peopl usual reter their job , so they have a lot of time . moreov , when they wa young they were work hardli for mani reason . therefor , i think older peopl can enjoy more than young peopl . peopl usual said young peopl can to everyth but older peopl are diffcult . howev , i do not think so becous my grandmoth is alway enjoy her life , for exampl , she learn song , it call shigin in japan , and tradidion japanes danc . she staret to learn theseth when she wa a 65 year old , but she can learn new thing and enjoy these thing . moreov , other my grandmoth learn to sing a japanes song , for exampl enka song , and plant vegit and flower in her garden . she like to take care plant and eat freash vegit . i think old peopl want to do new thing becous when they were young peopl they usuaslli could not to do anyth to theirself . garbament could not allow free when dure or after war . after war peopl alway to work veri hardli . they did not have a enough money and did not free time . howev , now to chang the enviro , so they can to do anyth if they wont and have a money . when older peopl wa young , they could not to have free time and could not to enjoy their life for work , but now they can have free time and to enjoy their life . therefor , i think older peopl shoul enjoy life more than young peopl do .
