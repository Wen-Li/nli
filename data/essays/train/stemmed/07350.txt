as student i am directli concern with the subject of thi question : idea and concept are they more import to learn than fact ? i think it is interest to see both point of view and to tri to understand whi it could be more import for student to understand idea and concept and then whi fact could be more import to learn . the first reason in favor of idea and concept is that when you understand an idea , a concept you are abl later to find the way to the solut even the problem is not exactli the same . for exampl in biolog you would be abl to find the good way to find the solut even if the problem deal with frog and you have studi rabbit . then the understand of concept and idea help you to build your own opinion becaus there is necesarli a reflexion , a discuss dure the class . that mean that it help build yourself as an adult . the last point is that if you learn the fact without understand the idea there are behind them , you will build your judgement on a small part of the problem and you wo n't be abbl to understand the global of the issu . for exempl if you learn about the problem of israel and palestina without know noth about their religion you wo n't be abl to have a gener view of the problem . now fact also are import to learn . first of all learn fact help student to understand our world . for exempl if you do not know the import date of the evolut of your countri it will be hard to understand your countri today . then , fact are veri import in a discuss . inde in order to convinc somebodi you ca n't present onli idea and concept but also fight . they will proov , explain , give more weight to your idea . as far as i am concern , i realli believ that it is realli import for student to learn both idea and concept , and fact . learn both of them it is the onli way to avoid ignor and to build real adult .
