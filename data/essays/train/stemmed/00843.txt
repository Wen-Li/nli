help in commun help in commun is veri import four young peopl becaus it make them more repons . it also can help them to find their sens in life and to feel use . on the other hand , i agre with the statement that young peopl today do not give enough time to help their commun . they have not enough time to do so , they do not identifi with their commun and the work is not sait to be fun . firstli , there is veri much pressur put on young peopl to be sucess in school . in our societi , it is often more appreci to have good mark than to help other peopl . mostli , colleg do not care about the privat and social life of student but about their mark in school . therefor , it seem to be more import to student to work for school than to help other peopl . due to thi , there is not much time left to spend on help other peopl . secondli , young peopl often do not have a veri close relationship to their commun . on reason for thi is that peopl chang the town thez are live in quit often . for exampl , if parent find an other jod in an other town , they will take thier children with them and the whole familiy will move away . if thi happen often , the children can not devellop a close relationship to their commun . for thi reason young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . thirdli , young peopl want to have fun in their free-tim . if you ask a young boy whether he prefer spend hi time play footbal or to go out with frind or to help an old woman , he will sure answer that he like to play rather than to help . we live in a sociati that suppli have fun . i believ that thi is an other reason whi young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . due to these reason , i believ that young peopl do not spend enough time on help in their commun . i hope that thi fact will chang in futur .
