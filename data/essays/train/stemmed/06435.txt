i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . moreov , i am convinc that thi is the main purpos of a commerci . the grade of attract that can be caus by an advertis is immens and can be state by the exampl of ga water in germanz . a lot of peopl drink it here , while other countri like franc , england or spain do not even offer it in restaur . i am convinc that the reason for that is a seri of veri good commerci we have in germani , switzerland and austria . compani use their financi power to hire a lot of expert and provid the best and newest equip to produc commerci , which content is often not even link to the product itself . the exampl of `` jaegermeist '' , a realli terribl german liquor show , how you can promot a product just by give him a trend imag . oppon might say that a reason consum would n't be mislead after a while by such finesound commerci and advertis , but unfortunalt it is not veri easi to chang a person drink custom . if a certain accept is achiev onc and the product is avail and therefor present in ani place , it will be hard to chang the consum behaviour , who consider convini as a import matter . my opinion is also state by the exampl of cloth bought by youngster . they often spend great amont of money on a t-shirt of a certain brand , although it doe not fit or is of bad qualiti . the last exampl illustr the rude of such compani by produc their advertis . it is even wors , to adress those advertis to children who are often more unsecur and therefor will to spend mani to be `` cool '' . i am veri lucki that certain legal rule to prevent even greater damag are exist . the europian union inclin to sharpen them slowli but determin although their oppon lobbi is power . until standard will have enhanc recogniz we should read everi advertis with suspicion .
