i total disagre with the statement say that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today . i think that there will be even more car in the futur , e.g. becaus of the econom progress and grow wealth in some strongli popul countri like china or india . the more money the peopl in these countri earn , the more comfort they will like to have . and car are one of the most signific symbol of comfort and statu in our life . so the new rich and middl class peopl of china and india will tri to achiev thi certain level of comfort and statu by buy huge amount of car , meanwhil the demand for car in rel wealthi and develop region like europ or northern america will stagnat at it 's current level . as a conclus one can say that it will be the develop countri that will rise the demand and the number of car in the world by their grow wealth and the wish of their inhabit for more comfort . anoth argument to prove my thesi is the global and enlarg infrastructur worldwid . it 's quit common to say that our world becom smaller nowaday . the reason for such thought is the rapidli grow infrastructur , which make it easier for mani peopl to travel around or to send good to foreign countri . in our global world , you need to get from one place to anoth in a short time , e.g. to lead a succes busi . and for move around , you need street and car . therefor , the more our world becom global and connect , the more street and car will be built . one aspect , that can influenc the product and use of car in a neg way , could be the grow price for natur ga and petrol . but i 'm sure that scientist will be success in their aim to creat car which do not depend anymor on ga or petrol suppli . in my opinion , in twenti year there will be much more car that are propel with altern or natur ressourc such as electr or ethanol made out of plant . that 's whi i peron do n't expect the high price for oil and ga to have some seriou effect on the number of car .
