young peopl in these day have enough energi to do anyth they want to , anytim they want it . first of all becaus they are healthi and strong so they have no physic limit . furthermor due to the fact that they have not yet experienc a lot in thi world make them hungri to tast everi area of life . moreov their onli role in societi is to studi and prepar for their futur that is the reason whi they have no econom , social or famili worri yet . in addit , it is impos to them that they are `` at the top of their live '' so it is their chanc to do everyth they want . these are the reason whi it is commonli believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev i do not realli think young peopl of these modern day actual enjoy life , the major is not matur enough so they run through life experienc thing that they should not experi at young age and tast everyth as if the world would be destroy in a few hour . the fact that older peopl do not have the energi or health requir to parti all the time , eat anyth they want , run car , or whatev young peopl do nowaday , doe not mean their life is over and they do not enjoy life anymor . in fact , i think they have a greater opportun to enjoy it . my grandma and my mother are excel exampl of thi . even though they are not abl to do a lot of thing anymor due to their age , both are happi women enjoy everi minut of parenthood and frienship . `` there come a time when you realiz relationship are the most import thing in your life , more import than object such as car , beauti hous , jewleri , and so on '' , say my grandmoth to me all the time . furthermor they are so thank for the wisdom they have acquir through all these year of experi , that for thi reason they enjoy their live even more everi day , as if it where their last one . to sum up , i do not think enjoy life ha anyth to do with your age , but it ha everyth to do with your heart .
