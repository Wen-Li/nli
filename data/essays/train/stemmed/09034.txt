advertis will do anyth to grab your attent . whether it be a commerci on televis , a page in the magazin , or a billboard . make up , food , cloth , or ani other product that seem appeal to peopl these day , are alway advertis much better than they truli are . it 's alway excit for women to see the gorgeou eyelash in the magazin from a certain mascara . it look long and thick in the magazin , but onc you buy it , it look noth like what you saw . be angri and throw the mascara away wo n't help . that 's just the way advertis are . they are made to attract peopl and made for peopl to buy what they are tri to advertis . or els , what 's the point ? whi would an advertis be about someth to make peopl sick to the stomach ? ( unless it wa about not do drug and show a pictur of what it could do to you . ) i rememb when i wa in second grade and i wa walk through a store and i came upon thi barbi convert . the box had a pictur with barbi and ken in it , and i thought wow how great ! a convert with ken and barbi in it for onli 20 dollar ? ! howev , when i got home and open it , i realiz that it wa onli the convert . littl did i know , the advertis on the box had in tini word `` barbi and ken not includ . '' even if it ha the word in tini letter on the side , the advertis is still trick you and have your mind not even think twice about read the box or pay attent and just buy it . if the pictur on the box onli had a convert , it would look dull and unapp to most , and therefor they would n't earn ani money . the commerci industri alway ha to make a product look better than it realli is . even when it come to pen , they have to make it look like the coolest pen in the world . the smallest product in the world are advertis to look better than they realli are , and it 's all for busi , and money .
