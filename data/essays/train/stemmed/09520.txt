i do not agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in my opinion , we should concentr our limit time and energi to one specif field and becom the expert in it . first and formost , it is imposs to learn knowledg of variou subject well at the same time . we human race ha accumul so much knowledg throughout histori that it is even impoos for an individu to know all the name of everi subject , needless to say to master a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . even if the person is realli talent at learn and can achiev thi goal , he will find out that he ha wast a lot of preciou time which he can otherwis spend on entertain or thing which he is interest in . secondli , it is unnecessari to understand the knowledg of some subject which you may never ha the chanc to use in your lifetim . for exampl , if you are an mechan engin who special in auto-mobil design , what is the point of learn how to design a nuclear bomb ? or suppos you are a student major in english literatur , what can you do with the knowledg of oil detect ? the most impor reason is that , in today 's fierc competit , one ha to becom special and indispens in one field order to win the game . thi requir the individu master a skill which he can perform better than anyon els . we are live in a time when the knowledg is increas in an unpreced speed and there are numer academ field . it is well known that modern competit is increasingli base on techonolog and innov . howev , it is imposs to creat new knowledg or devic without master the current exist knowledg well and know the subject perfectli . those who are superfici is like to lose the game , although they might know a lot of knowldg with other subject . i have to admit that it is vital for a person to master the basic knowledg of some disciplin . for instanc , the knowledg of deal with a fire emerg is necessari for everyon . but we have to find the balanc between special and universatilz . base on the former discui strongli agre with the view that it is more import to special in one file rather than get a broad knowledg with irrelev field .
