i agre with thi opinion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . i have some reason for support my idea . nowaday , mani environment problem occur in the world : global warm , air polut , and acid rain . these problem caus the exhaust of car . so , if twenti year pass , mani peopl becom care about these problem . also , they think the exhaust of car are seriou problem . therefor , i think that the number of peopl who avoid use car easili come to increas becaus they come to regard the problem caus by the exhaust of car as seriou problem . also , there are possibl situat that the tax of car will be increas . so , mani peopl come to be worri about and have troubl about the econom problem . howev , these day , the govern tend to rais the tax in order to make the pention systam batter , in fact . consed these modern movement about tax , the tax of car is increas more in twenti year . as a result , peopl who avoid buy and use car increas . at the same time , peopl come to use the public transport . so , the nesses of car is decreas . moreov , if twenti year pass , the societi becom more conveni than today . so , new environmentlli friendli and conveni transport may be invent . peopl come not to use the car . also , in the futur , peopl will come to travel farther than today . so , peopl can not move with use car . consequ , the necess of use car is decreas . for these reason , i think in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the reason is that peopl will come to regard environment problem as seriou one . also , peopl will not pay the tax of car in the futur becaus of higher tax of car . moreov , in the futur , the necess of use car is decreas becaus of invent of new transportaion . thu , i agre with the statememt that the number of car will decreas in twenti year .
