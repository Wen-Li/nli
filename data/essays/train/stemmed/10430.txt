do you think that your young son can handl at least take the trash from the street if he saw it ? our children today do not alot of simpl thing than our father and grandfath use to do it proud . thi is becous mani parant do not let thier children to tri and experinc how it would be for them to help your commun and commun nowaday do not open the chanc for young pepol . first of all man y parent do not let thier children to to experi how it feel good when they help thier commun becous parent think that help commun is a wast of time . even if the children tri to do thi kind of thing thier punsh them and tell them to concer on thier stude and forget about thi kind of thing , therefor even the child ha the intent to help hi commun hi parent may let him down . as a resolt tje child willdo the same thing with hi children when he grow up . in addit commun are not in the same way they use to be . there are some certin custom that recent communityi think that they like a holi thing , no can talk about it and say hi opnion about it . befor commun were use to to live anin a way that everyon ha hi own duti and in sometim when have ve a festiv or someth like that . but nowaday these habbit have dissapear in some way and just egsist in some small comun who stell do as thier father did . so , one of the reson whay young do not help in thier commun . in conclusan , i want to say that young peopl do not do anyth worth in thier commun becous of the parent way to look at thi kind of thing and for the commun way of look to young do jop that they think it is not found for peopl .
