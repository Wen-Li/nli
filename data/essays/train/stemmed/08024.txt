i do not concur with the statement . i believ that the old peopl enjoy life more than the young . the defin of enjoy is import in thi case . enjoy is be stabl , happi , do the right thing , be like and to be in a balanc state of mind . thi qualiti are abund in the old . the young are in the illus that enjoy life is go to parti , bunk class , neglect studi etc . but thi is not enjoy but mere pleasur achevi preceiv to be enjoy . the old have there own way of enjoy life . for them go for a walk in the morn , follow strict diet and have discuss is a form of enjoy life . thi kind of enjoy are good for the person concern in the long run and can be consid as enjoy life . for exampl a young person drive fast and consid to be enjoy himself but there are more chanc of him meet with an accid wherea a old person drive slowli but still enjoy hi drive and reach hi destin safe . now if you think from the teen perspect he is enjoy and also from the old he is enjoy too but the enjoy of life is defin by the old who is safe and good . the conclus of the discuss is that both the young and the old enjoy life . the young might have more fun and enjoy but the young 's idea of enjoy is fals . the old might have less fun and frolic but hi idea of enjoy is true and clearli defin the idea of enjoy life . thi way there is a strong content for old peopl enjoy more life base on the defin of enjoy in life mention abov .
