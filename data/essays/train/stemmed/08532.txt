even bad market is market . in my opinion a success person is someon who take risk and tri new think . i am the best exmpl for thi statement : two week ago , i had an interview at the walt disney compani for an internship . of cours i could have come to thi interview as everi one els : nice dress , conserv and seriou . i would show him my imag of a good teammemb and some other strength . so i would have had a nice interview and mayb a chanc to get the job . but i want to get a better chanc on the job : so i came as the comic figur daisi . i wore a white blous with a daisi pin and a nice skirt , combin with a pink bow in my hair . i knew that my behaviour wa not usual and i wa awar of the risk i wa take with thi strategi . first of all , everybodi look at me when i came in , so i got the full concentr on my person . it wa a littl bit riski , becaus thi attent can be posit or neg , but for sure they will rememb me . furthermor , my interview could see that i am an outspoken person with motiv to get the job . of cours , the imag of daisi match with the job offer i wa appli for . i had to fight for the veri first minut of the interview to give the interview the impress that i am still a seriou , conserv and trust worker but it wa worth it . the interview gave me the job right away and when i ask whi he decid so quick he said : you appli for the job in an unusu way and show me that you are abl to think out of the box . actual , we were look for someon who take risk to achiev hi goal and you are thi person .
