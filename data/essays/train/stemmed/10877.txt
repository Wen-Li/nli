the question at hand is that `` will there be fewer car in use after twenti year than there today '' . the automobil technolog ha been climb accliv of advanc over the past few year . but at the same time the challeng introduc due to the fast deplet petroleum resourc ha imped high hope of the industri . but still i would say that the industri would continu to flourish irrespect of the fore mention challeng due to sever reason . the most press reason would be the earnest research in the field of new and renew sourc of energi to substitut of petroleum . a few compani have alreadi come up with electr car while the research on the hydrogen cell are speed up . these energi sourc not onli answer the challeng of deplet petroleum resourc but also picturis an ecofriendli futur gener car . thi is becaus the expect emiss from electr or hydrogen cell base car are much lower than the car of today . although the initi price rang of the new gener car are rate abov the car of today , the run cost is expect to be consider less . for exampl in the case of an electr car the run cost is all about chargin the cell which would be much cheaper compar to the oil price twenti year later . so in the long run the next gener car would be cheaper than the pesent day car . anoth import factor is that pocess a car ha becom an import part of one social digniti . the purpos of buy a car ha grown much beyond the sole purpos of transport . the hype on the formula1 race and automobil exibit ha ha influenc peopl in all strata of the societi . despit the rise in oil price the number of car buyer ha never look down . the media ha been quit success in transform the onc adom car market into an inelast senario . when all the automobil industri have charg up their research sector and with the exist media hype it is imposs to beliv that the auto industri will collaps .
