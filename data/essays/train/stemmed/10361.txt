peopl can learn through differ method . some have an easi for rememb chart , pictur or other graphic while other learn faster by liter mean . the qualiti of the retent of those fact vari accord to the way they retain them . when a student understand the idea of what he is do , he can implement observ of hi own . when one understand someth , it is much more probabl to impli or discov the rest of the detail . he may even add new idea . onc you get the big pictur of one concept and understand it , your mind can analyz it , judg it and compar it to former experi . understand a concept make it last much longer in the memori . we have a limit memor time and space . for exampl , if you memor your credit card number , you will rememb it for a period of time . onc you stop use that number , the most probabl thing is that you will forget it in a few month . our memori work best when we put to practic concept and understand their function and structur . on the other hand , simpli learn fact lead to be abl to hold back more detail . you may know everyth there is to know about a certain theme , but if you can not understand it , you can not chang it or handl it . think of it thi way . pretend you make a new friend . you may have read about thi person befor . you may know everyth about him , from hi blood type , to hi hobbi , to hi tast , even hi habit . if you do not understand the person , you can not deal with him , or even maintain a last friendship . to truli know that person you must not onli know about him , but also know him . to conclud , my opinion is that it is more import if you can understand rather than just retain fact . when you understand , you have the abil to chang it , experi it and even handl it . if the knowledg of a student is go to last him for a lifetim , the best way of rememb fact is to understand them .
