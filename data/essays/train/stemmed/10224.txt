i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i support my posit on the follow argument : i think that everi stage in life ha a special featur that make it differ . on the one hand , young peopl like to travel , spend time with friend hang out , practic sport and do other activ proper to their age , which is perfectli good . it is the perfect stage of life to learn , experi and recogn the valu that were transmit to us . it is also a period in which young peopl could enjoy the opportun to demonstr their affect and love to older peopl , know that some day they will also get older and in demand of affect and attent . in other word , it is a life period that alway will be rememb , but that also ha to be spent with care and respons . on the other hand , older peopl becom more famili orient , tray to spend more time with their rel and the love one . it is natur , their prioriti in life have chang , but it doe not mean that they do not enjoy life anymor , on the contrari , they enjoy life on their own way . even though it is true that older peopl becom more and more depend from rel and other peopl , it is also true that thi is an effici and human way for us to show them our appreci for what they have done in their life . thi is also a great chanc for them to wit the love that their rel may show and feel . in sum , i believ that young peopl as well as older peopl are total abl to enjoy life in their own way and consid the characterist of both differ human stage . thu , i do not believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
