a lot of young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , becaus thay think that they alway have a full timet . i total disagre with thi statement for two reason . first of all , most young peopl do not help their commun , becaus they want to avoid the dirti tesk . for exampl , there is a park near my hous . when i wa a child , my friend and i alway went to the park to pick up the litter after school . but nowaday most young peopl think that kind of tesk should belong the pedastrian servent . secondli , most young peopl spend a lot of time play the comput game and watch televis , so they say that thay do not have time . but in the past . when young peopl did not have such a varieti of recreat , the young peopl usual did a lot of commun servic . for exampl , my mother ha gone to the hospit near her hous to be a volunt for nearli thirti year . thu , the excus that the young peopl say that they do not have time is just an anoth excus of unwil . some peopl may disagre with my piont , claim that the young peopl inde have other thing to pursu , like the job competit , the pressur of school work . howev , i still consid that the young peopl can squeez a littl time to help their commun .
