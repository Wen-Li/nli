after us high school , today , we can studi all we want like litteratur , biolog , chemist and the a lot of subject . we can special in one specif subject or mani academ one . we will see what is the advantag and problem about these school way . accord to me it 's a veri dificult topic . becaus i have a point of view but it 's mind and it 's depend of the person . howev i will think easier it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . in fact i think we are too young when we finish the high school so it 's veri dificult to choos what we want to studi for the rest of us life . i know we can chang later but it 's normal we want choos the good decis , not chang each year and to be in the univers when we are twenti six with peopl old twenti year . and if you have a mani academ subject , we can special in a specif sector when you find a job moreov you will have knowledg to know exactli what you want . therefor if you are sure about subject you will studi dure few year and have a job in link with thi subject it 's so great . when a talk about it i think about a person who want to work in a sector who is hi hobbi for exampl . i will enjoy to know what i would like to studi and do just that . it 's so good if thi subject do your hapin . how can reproach anyon to studi hi hobbi or passion .
