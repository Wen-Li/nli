it is sometim difficult to discuss peopl 's view on the way of travel becaus it is such a multifacet topic . some tend to think that there are mani merit to travel by their own plan while other say it is better to be led by a tour guid . i have develop my own opinion on the topic . i favor the latter posit over the former for sever reason , and i would like to explor two of the conspicu one in the follow passag . first of all , if we are led by a guid , we do not have to spend a great amount of time consid where to go and how long to stay . the guid ha alreadi arrang the schedul for us . as a result , all we have to do is follow the schdule and have a good time . for instanc , when i wa a junior high student , my parent and i went to singapor led by a tour guid . the tour guid wa so familiar with the countri that she introduc us everyth about singapor . needless to say , we visit the most import spot in the countri . all of us realli appreci the tour guid for such a wonder trip . second thing that must be taken into consider is that we are like to make new friend in the group . it goe without say that it is veri bore when we visit some interest place without friend . in the group , we can make good friend with one anoth and share all the happi on the trip . for exampl , on the travel to singapor , my new friend and i play togeth day and night . they did bring me a lot of fun dure the trip . though the trip is over for a long time , we have still kept in touch close . of cours , i do not suggest that my perspect are unassail . there are still some advantag for us to take a travel on our own plan . nevertheless , i think the opinion i have provid abov are more import and stronger .
