i disagre with the statement becaus man ha alway been on the for method to make hi life more convini , and as far as get from one palc to anoth on a daili basi is concern , four-wheel are what make hi life comfort and so he ha no qualm in procur a car if he can afford one . in twenti year from now , it is unlik that popul of the world would decreas or even remain fairli constant , and with more and more automobil firm introduc cost-effect car it is safe to assum that in the futur more and more peopl will be abl to afford car and henc the number of car on the road will increas . anoth major factor to support my claim is the fact that no concret law exist keep in check the number of vehicl in a particular region . thi allow peopl , especi famili , to purchas as mani number of car they want as per their requir . also the fact that peopl now consid two wheeler to be danger to ride also lend support to my stand . peopl now are well inform of the increas number of two wheeler accid which can be attribut to their rel instabl and insecur ac compar to car . they feel reluct to use a two wheeler when they have the option of use a car and henc as time progess it is safe to say that thi prefer will inde caus an increas in the number of car in the come year . technolog advanc in the automobil industri will also allow peopl to use `` non-pollut '' vehicl in the futur . with the increas number of pollut norm such cheap and `` clean '' vehicl will provid an escap rout for the world 's popul whose rise number will obvious lead to the popular and widespread use of such vehicl in comparis to today i hope that with the argument state abov , it would be easi to forse the increas number of car in the year to come .
