peopl start to learn in school but after sometim book are not enough . especi for histor place you need to go and see thi place to understand and to feel the histori better . the question is to go there and discov thi place by yourself or go and join a tour and let the gude help you . i prefer go without a tour guid . i have some specif reason for thi . first of all if you go to a place with a tour guid you must alway follow him . you can never wait to take some more pictur , look someth from a differ view . even you can not stop when you are hungri thirsti or tire . becaus you are not alon and the guid ha got a program for thi day . it ha to be done . also if you go there alon you can discov some other place that are not famou but interest . at the end of the day you feel veri tire becaus you saw mani place bu you never satisfi . also most of the guid ha got a style depend on wrong but interest stori and stupid joke about everyth you saw . espesi when you get on the bu to go some place they take the microphon and they never stop talk . they want to entertain you but these kind of stuff becom annoy afterten minut . you can never look from a window and enjoy the view becaus you alway hear laugh and song . and at the end when you want to go somewher with a tour guid it is alway two or three time expens than you go alon or with your friend . and after all when you return from vacat you relaiz that you do n't rememb anyth you do n't have enough souveniour and pictur and you have to go there again . becaus of all these reason if you want to see a place think more about thi vacat make a good plan with your friend and never add a stranger especi a guid to your plan .
