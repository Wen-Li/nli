i do n't agre with that statement . it 's better to have a special knowledg about one subject . i think you can be realli good on one or two subject but if you want to have a veri good knowledg for mani subject you have lot of work to do and in my opinion it 's just not possibl to be perfect in mani subject . there are not mani geniu in thi world and if you are not one of them you shoul be satisfi when you know veri much about one subject . i 'm a specialist in histori and german literatur but if you want to know someth about biolog you have to ask someon els . today there are no `` univers geniu '' anymor . hundret of year ago there were some guy who knew veri much about total differ subject . but today it 's too complex , to mani inform to know - that it 's quiet imposs . i want to studi journal and the student counsellor told me that it | s better to special on one subject than just studi gener commun . of cours it | s veri good to have a good knowledg about what \ s go on in thi world but the magazin like it when you are a specialist in polit or mayb histori . i also think that it would be easier to find a job when you are special on one subject . if you are veri good in speech you could becom a teacher or a translat . if you are realli brilliant in math , physic , geographi , histori and religion it would be hard to find a job where you can improv all your knowledg . thi theoret knowledg is worthless if you are not abl to work in the praxi . my mainpoint is that it would be to much work to do when you want to have knowledg in all academ subject , especi for me . ..
