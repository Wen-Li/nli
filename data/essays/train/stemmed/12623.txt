it is often accept that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl but i quit disagre with thi view as it is mere associ with the concept of have no respons . inde , the way young and older peopl enjoy life can be veri differ and it ha noth to do with have respons or not . as a matter of fact , young and older peopl have n't got access to the same activ as they often depend on your physic abil . the fact that younger peopl are , most of the time , healthier than older peopl mean that , for exampl , young peopl could enjoy play a soccer match wherea old peopl could not . moreov , it would be harder for a senior to spend everi night in club without sleep . fortun , enjoy life is not restrict to sport activ and older peopl could enjoy other aspect of life like build a famili , creat busi relationship , take part to the citi or the countri social or polit life . these kind of activ can definit bring a lot of happi and mayb more fulfil than simpli play tenni or spend night in bar . anoth import aspect is that older peopl may valu life more as they might have been in contact with death of rel . therefor , they might even enjoy life more than younger peopl as they know their time is limit . on the contrari , young peopl are not in direct contact with death and just do not realiz what is at stake . they might then just live life as it come and not get the most of it . as a conclus , young peopl and older peopl can both enjoy life in differ manner . happi is not a question of age but of perspect and i am sure that anyon , young or old can enjoy life if they are readi for it .
