i agre with the statement as i believ that a person can be identifi as a success person onli if it is abl to face differ situat and to take it own risk . an exampl that can support what i wrote is the analysi of the attitud of one of the top manag as such peopl , to be identifi as success , have to be abl to deal with everi kind of situat . think about a top manag we can conclud that it ad valu is to solv a problem when it appear by risk it own name . read newspap we know , for exampl , that compani face a difficult period look for peopl that can be abl to find solut . the manag is abl to analysi the problem find a solut by use it own expertis and knowledg . as the prblem is solv and that compani is no more in troubl , the real success person doe not feel ani more confort with a calm realiti and tend to look for someth other . success peopl have the great skill to have someth more that normal peopl and they have the `` moral duti '' to offer such knowledg to other . tri new thing and afford risk is the onli way a person ha to show other the skill it ha and the capabl it ha to express . i conclud by say that if a skill and potenti successful person doe not want to isk and to tri new experi loss a great opportun and can not be identifi as a success person .
