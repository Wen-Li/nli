i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i bought a food with look nice pictur last week . even though , when i cook as exactli what the direct say , it look deffer and it wa not veri nice . those kind of thing should have happed to most peopl . i understand that they are do busi and they are tri to get more custom and sell the product . howev , i do n't thing they should make advertis make product seem better than they realli are for three reason . first , it make peopl who bought the product disapoint . the light use in the pictur on the advertis and angl can make the product look better . in addit , if the custom did not like the real product , they wast their money . it is like cheat and not fair . final , the compani might be complain by the custom . the custom will not buy the same product if they are disapoint by the product which were show nicer than they realli are . the product wil be popular onli the begin and the profit will not get ani better or get wors . peopl are happi and dream when they are look at the advertis . it is true that nice look advertis make peopl feel good . although , peopl get more desapoint and sad if the differ is so big . nice and beauti advertis give peopl dream but if it is not true , it is cheat . it is not good to show not real look .
