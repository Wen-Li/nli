a lot of peopl would like to know about sever subject instead of bee special in one specif subject . but i definit prefer to be special in one veri specif subject . in fact , i 'm studi in civil ingen and environ in a school which is one of the onli one to have that dual degre . and some friend older than me who are alreadi work in some compagni told me that the school is veri like by compagni for bee veri profession and have good student with a veri good knowledg in civil engen . that 's whi we have no difficulti to find a job at the end of school . more over if a person know a lot about one subject , she can becom in expert in that subject . on other exampl : if a person is special in a veri veri specif subject she may earn a lot of money becaus if she is the onli one to have that knowledg , compagni will pay a lot to hire him befor the concurr . on the other hand i admit that i would have like to have a broad knowledg of mani academ becaus some compagni like to have employe who can work at veri differ job . for instanc a lot of compagni like to have peopl with a knowledg in manag becaus that kind of peopl can lead a team and make the work be more effici . so to conclud i will say that both case have their advantag and their drawback , and everyon wo n't have the same opinion about it , but my case is n't bad and thank to that i wo n't have too mani problem to find a job i like . so i prefer to special in one specif subject than have a whole knowledg on sever academ . howerv my sister is the opposit , and she is do veri well too . so you can have a good job and have a good carrer in both case .
