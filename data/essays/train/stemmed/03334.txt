as a student , i agre total to thi statement . it is more import to understand idea rather then memoris the fact becaus the final result of the two method are totaslli differ . when you just memor a text , a formula , or a date , it is veri rare that a few week or month later you will rememb it at all . thi method can be use onli for test or oral exam , but total useless if you want to rememb that inform for a long period of time . instead , when you understand an idea or concept , and then you studi it , the result is total differ , becaus that notion will becom part of you , part of your cultur baggag that will accompani for your entir life . although thi can look obviou for most of the peopl , mani still do n't understand it . thi can be a problem if the person mention is somedi that is in tight contact with a student , like a teacher . i can say thi thank to my person experi : as a student infact , i 'm in contact with a person that is the perfect exampl of what i 'm talk about , my math teacher . although she is an experienc teacher , she still is of the idea that student do n't need to understand total what the exercis is about , and think that it is possibl to do thing just by memoris formula , without know whi those formula are like that and whi we must use them . the result is that dure the year peopl can do thing correctli , but the follow year , nobodi can rememb anyth . so i person think that just memoris someth ca n't help a student , if not for hi or her immidi futur . but the problem arriv when the student need the notion he ha learn dure high school to be abl to get into univers and to understand thing onc he is in . in conclus , if you understand an idea , it is right for you to explain it to somebodi els , especi if it is the teacher that wa n't abl to explain it to you in the first place .
