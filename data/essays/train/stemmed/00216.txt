accord to me young peopl enjoy less than older peopl . in today world we see that compitit is increas day by day . in older day peopl where have less mental burden as compar to know . today we see that educ is more valu as it wa befor . at present peopl pay more attent to give educ to their children . parent are much worri about their chid . thu at earli age children start their educ . from the next day day their life becom busi . after they have reach upto graduat they are frustrat now they are insist by their parent to persu a higher degre in particular field . after they have complet their studi they to search for job . they have to face problem when they get start with job . their daili routen is same except sunday . now at thi stage they dont have ani extra time . they have mani responsibilti to maintain . wherea if we compar thi busi life with older peopl life we come to know that they have enough time . they are think how to utilis their time . older peopl have enough time to have chat with friend whact telivison read book . i have seen variou program been held for senior citizen in our societi . they had a program onc in a week . if we compar thi with young peopl than it is seen that young peopl program are held twice in a year . it not of programm falt but our world is becom too busi . also on anoth aspect older peopl have enough time to medit and do prayer . while young peopl are rather busi in materi life fight for better standard of live , better educ etc.old peopl have done struggl in their life and might get pension through gover or from the compani they have work
