from my point of view , i total agre with the statement that advertis emphas and magnifi some product in a questinn way . for at least three caracterist , which are qualiti , quantiti and effect , advertis often mislead . market make us believ that the product we are buy is the best on the market and that you could not find a better product in the whole world . for exampl , mac donald ' burger are often cite in advertis as the best burger in the world . although i agre that they are pretti good , burger king 's burger are also veri good . other exampl could be find with toy . children often think that that will have a toy bigger than it realli is becaus of the way it is expos in the advertis . you could also manipul peopl with the quantiti you are sell to them . as for instanc , a market campain could make you believ that you are purchas 1000 kilogram of a specif ingredi , when in fact your are purchas onli 1000 pound of it , that is a typic trap . anoth manipul from advertis is to make a product effici when thi product is not work . there are countless version of advertis claim that a product is the one with which you will loos your overweight or with wich you will refind your youth . in fact it never work , but the market doe . as to conclud it must be said that peopl , especi children , should take care about mislead advertis , becaus it could lead to mani disapoint and sometim more than that . market is a scienc with a uniqu goal , which is maximis the profit on the product it sell .
