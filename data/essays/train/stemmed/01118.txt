well accord to me , for student , understand idea and viewpoint is a pre-requisit for ani further studi . while on the other side mug up of fact is a temporari solut . when a student listen to a teacher in a classroom attent then he would definit rememb hi \ her word for much more time than after read the same thing from a book . . it correctli said that a teacher is a student 's best book . if a person impli the situat practic then he will rememb the thing hi whole life . `` idea are understood more effici though ear than through eye '' , with which i agre complet . understand someth give a more perman stabil in mind rather than read it onc and forget it after a few second . take for exampl , if you learn a lesson from your histori book without understand it u would just get yourself into troubl and confus . on the other hand if you yourself or one of friend explain the concept , that whi thi war wa held , or relat the date with someth , then u would rememb thi war your whole life without even look into your book onc . so the gyst of the concept is that mug up fact is no solut to your problem . it intrins to first understand the idea , grab the main point and then paraphras of the fatct that you have studi
