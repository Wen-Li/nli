ok i believ that in the first way is import to know mani kind of subject becaus as much as you know is the way that you will have the opportun to chois the best academ area for you and your skill , after that i believ that the best thing that you should have to do is special in a specif subject becaus when you need to get a job is import to have exper in one topic like comput , chemic thing etc otherwis you will be like a `` semilla de todo lo mole '' that is a mexican express that mean that you know mani thing but at the same time is less or not deep that covertsin a knowless person . for exampl im chemic engen and i want to studi my master here in amsterdam , and in the begin of my carrer i want to studi petroleum process but after a wild my mind start to chang becaus in my studi i had a ecolog class and i did not know which of them i realli want to studi , [ if you dont know about it let me tell your that both are in the same area ( chemic engen ) but they have differ profil , even they have a core programm in the end is not the same ] so , i had had to choic one of them , becaus in a futur when i will start to work again my work will be in one direct and now i do it , i will choic ecolog !! although the reason that i write befor i have a contrast opinion becaus for exampl the peopl that studi arqueolog they have to now mani thing not just the arquitectur of one place i believ that a good arqueolog should have to know about the past of the countri that he or she is studi , ha to know about the cultur , custom , idiom etc , otherwis they will not do a veri good discov in conclut i agre with both statement becaus depend of the topic and the person tast of the person that want to studi someth .
