ye , i agre with the statement that young peopl are not show up intrest in help the commun rather most of them are intrest in other useless activ as far as concern . mani commun need help hand to cover their problem . young peopl should be their icon , but unfortun they are not , ad to that they take up a larg particip in damag those legal commun . for exampl , their are mani commun for old-ag peopl , they are forc to live up in boundag hous wheir they lack their famili sentiment though their children are financi sound . most of them feel it to be a burden to look after them and to get reliev from thi they , forc the age peopl to live apart . young peopl now-a day are more attract toward the extern affair they are not suppos to be . they are not spare up their time to help the commun even in their liesur time rather they are attract toward the entertain section like movi , club etc.they dont even have time to spend on the communiti in which they live , they simpli tri up to escap from it as much as possibl . i think they shoud to be focus to the advantag and satisfact they get when they help the commun . the abas respons to thi , should be shown to them theorit . the matur qualiti in such matter shoud be inherit into them . young peopl , these day are mislead about the import of the commun and their use . commun accumul form the nation . they are a pride factor for resembl . final , i conclud that young peopl should alway approach the commun in a possit way and help the commun as far as they can . help the commun tend to help themselv in all
