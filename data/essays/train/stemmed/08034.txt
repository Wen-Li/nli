i do not agre most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first , tv , newpap , internet and so on , more and more come into our life , so we can get a lot of advertis everyday . in the day life , we have to buy lot thing , the same thing we have so mani chanc , which one is better for use , which one price is better , we can not look for everi store , so the advertis give us the inform . '' oh , thi one is good , ha a lot of function , we shall buy thi one `` we will say that after saw the advertis . but , if the real product is not better as advertis , we spend time and monay , then we buy the product is not we want , what will happend next ? we do not trust advertis anymor . second , sometim , we realli need the product , it is most import to us , we bought the one after studi a lot of advertis , but you got the one wa not you want . if you bought it at store , you can chang or return it at onc , but you bought it via internet , what you can do ? it is mean you lost a chanc . third , that publish or product give peopl advertis are not real product . peopl are not trust you again , you will lose the market . so i do not agre that piont .
