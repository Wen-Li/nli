i disagre with the statement which say , `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . the follow reason will support my opinion . first of all , when you get to travel in a group , you alway have to move with the group , which mean you ca n't schedul your own cours where you want to drop by dure your trip . you might go to onli the place which you did n't expect to go . for exampl , i wa on a trip to japan . me and my friend schedul everyplac we want to visit for 2 week . it take a bit of time to get those imform but it wa worth it . suppos i travel in a group with a tour guid and miss the premier leag , the english soccer leag , eventhough i 'm travel england becuas it 's mot schedul . that will be terribl for me . secondli , if there is a tour guid he might tell you all the imform about all the place and stuff . it could be good for some peopl but i think studi about place you go , cultur neer it , learn histori is all part of the trip . if you do n't studi about the place your visit you might not understand their cultur and old stuff eventhough someon like a tour guid explain you everyth . becaus i think studi about the place is veri excit and essenti for make my schedul and plan for my trip , i wo n't need a tour guid . also , if you are in a group you wo n't even get your enough free time in your trip becaus you 'll have to move on all the time with your group . i think thi problem is one of the most import problem in a trip . i think a travel ha too make your stress dissappear , but when you have to move when you do n't want to , it 'll make you more stress . when i visit india with my friend , we rest and read book in our hotel for a day . somepeopl might think it 's a wast of money and time but i think it 's the best part of travel . howev , these are the reason whi i think travel with a tour guid in a group seem terribl to me . i think studi about our own destin , rest there and schedul the whole travel by myself is the most import thing in my tour .
