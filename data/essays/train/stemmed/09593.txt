i realli agre with thi statement but i agre if we speak about realli success peopl and not onli about peopl that had too much fortun . but concern on special peopl i think that we have to think what there is under success . the most success peopl are talent , open-mind , ambiti and veri self-confid . thi featur can bring you to success easilli but these featur make also peopl never be satisfit . so when they reach an import target immediatli the happin for that becom an aim to reach anoth new and more difficult target . for exampl , speak about job , i think that the most success peopl are not realli interest in money itself but in becom the best one on hi job , without limit . i think also that there is a particolur and exact emot when you see that you are abl to becom alway better and that noth can stop you , and perhap there are person that feel aliv onli when they risk to tri alway someth new . there is a faomou phrase that is : `` risk is my job '' . it 's obviou that when a common person see someon who is rich , power and that got everyth you can dream risk evertyth onli to tri new experi or emot , he colud say : `` he is realli crazi ! '' , but we know that geniou and mad are often join . we can see some exampl in real life . i want to give a real simpl exampl speak about sport . foe exampl the famou valentino rossi , the motorbik , had been three time world champion of the top class with the honda team and he had the best motorbik and if he had stay with that team he wa sure to win again , but afet have won for three time the titl he decid to chang team and go to yhamaha . at that time yamaha had a no-competit motorbik and it wa a veri hard risk for him .
