educ is someth which increas the self-esteem and improv knowledg of the one who tri to pursu that . it also increas statur , which is of primari concern in today 's societi . given the two option , it would not be a good idea to deal these two option in the same way . so , i would like to view thi topic in two differ way : 1.undergradu level 2.graduat level first , dure undergradu studi , a student ha to learn a wide varieti of subject becaus it is the high time for him to learn the basic . if he doe not studi mani subject , there wont be a differ between him and uneduc person . after all , everybodi expect him to be familiar with all the relat subject present in a stream . for exampl , a mechan engin is assum to have knowledg about thermal , product , design , materi scienc and mani more subject relat to hi mechan stream . becaus all these depend upon one anoth , it becom absolut necess to learn the fundament of all these in order to excel in mechan field . and the same is true about all the remain stream too . there is one more disadvantag , if he studi onli one subject at thi part of hi life , he would probabl find it bore and insipid as time pass , and would definit end up becom noth in hi life . secondli , dure graduat level , it would be a better option to select ani one of the subject he is familiar with , and deal with that particular subject in detail . then , he will gain in-depth knowledg about a subject and that can help him in achiev a good job in hi respect domain . later on , even if he find the domain bore , he can drift toward differ subject becaus he ha the fundament knowledg of mani subject . keep these two choic in view , i would suggest to gain basic fundament in your undergradu level and then go on search for a topic which fascin you and then pursu in-depth knowledg of that particular subject in your graduat and doctor level . in thi way , you can becom a jack of all trade , and , inde a master of few too .
