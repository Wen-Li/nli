although there are sever advantag of a broad knowledg , i prefer to be special in one specif subject or area . first of all , i have got the opinion that your chanc concern get a job are better when you are special . if you have studi busi , for instanc , with a special or main topic like chines languag and it global featur , you will becom more interesst for a rang of special compani . you have the advantag to separ you from the mass of other student or applic . therefor zour chanc are better to get a job offer from mayb a chines compani or a compani that ha got close connect to china . howev , if you have just studi busi with a wide rang of differ subject and area , it could becom more difficult to find the right job . there are no specif posit in a compani that would fit to you . there is of cours no doubt , that educ is realli import and broad knowledg is alway be a good basi . but concern the job market it is probabl not enough . especi today , it is pretti hard and exhaust to find a job in germani . you have to offer special skill and educ to get the chanc of a good job . accord to thi , peopl should concentr on subject where they can provid necessari skill and which they like to do . normal , that is onli a small and limit area of a subject , in busi , for exampl manag and not the whole subject which would also includ financ for exampl , a complet differ area . concern the knowledg you are learn or use in privat , i think it is an advantag to have broad knowledg and to be educ . in conclus , i support the point of special in a subject to improv your chanc get a job in be more uniqu .
