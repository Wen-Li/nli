i agre with that peopl had better have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . there are two reason . first , it make peopl who do not have broad knowledg oto have difficulti in the compani or societi . when we get job or enter the school , we have oppotun of talk with mani peopl . at the time , howev , we have onli one spcific knowledg , for exampl the knowledg about mathemat , we can speak onli about mathemat . it ha possibl of give other peopl the impress that you are bore person . it is veri dager and we may be not abl to lead a nice our live in the societi . second , to studi one specif subject make your futur veri narrow one . for exampl , when the person who have been studi the mathemat in order to be a professor chang hi or her mind and the person want to be a anim doctor , what the person should do ? he or she ha the knowledg onli about mathemat so he or she can not chang hi or her futur job now . the person who have studi onli one specif subject can not chang or dicid their futur again onc they decid thier futur in thier childhood . in conclus , to special in one specif subject have dager possibl in decid of the futur . therefor , i agre with the former statement .
