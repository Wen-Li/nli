travel in a group led by a tour guid have mani advantag . first of all , it 's the easiest way to learn about the new countri , and it 's cultur , you are travel in . most of the time , the tour guid ha also mani good advic , like where are the good spot locat and what can be done , or what should n't be . you also probabl feel more secur by travel with a tour guid , than by travel on your own . but despit all those advantag , i got to say that for me , there is noth like travel alon . becaus a trip must have a part of adventur , i mean you do n't realli travel to feel secur , you travel to experi someth new , you travel to discov new peopl , new cultur , new feel , you travel to feel free , wich you realli ca n't do when there is a tour guid tell you what to do and where to go ( eventhough it 's better for you ) . but most of all , what i realli would n't like to do , is travel in a group . i rememb when i wa in africa with my dad , travel on our own , when we met all those group of french tourist with their guid . they were probabl sleep on better hostel than we did , their trip wa probabl way more `` comfort '' than our , but i bet thi wa less interest . and is n't paradox to travel , wich mean to leav your countri , to be surround by peopl from the same countri ? what 's the purpos ? i 'd rather stay in franc to be surround by french peopl . .. final i would say that even if it appear easiest to travel in a group led led by a tuor guid , you will never learn the the same thing than by travel on your own . and to me travel is about learn >
