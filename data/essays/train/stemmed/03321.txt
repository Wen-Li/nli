in my opinion have more broad knowledg of mani acadm subject than to special in one specif subject is much better and comfort . have more knowledg subject can make peopl more intrest to talk about differnt subject in hi life . a peson who is special in one specif subject is stuck in mani thing in hi life . while the person with mani knowledg acadm subject xan access mani differ job and aplic and will have experi than than the person with one specfic subject . have more broad knowledg academ subject make aperson life much easier . in my opnion i agre that have mani knowledg academ subject is more better than have one specif subject . a person with a littl specifi subject will find it veri hard to find job and it will be veri hard for him to mang hi life and to do mani thing in hi life . but have more than one spefi academ subject make your life much easier and it make you experinc your life better and also he can find more than job and applic to work in not onli that but larg compani are go to send him an invit to in the compani itself . and one of the achiv a prson with abroadr knwoledg academ subect can achiv is be experienc in mani thing . so for peopl who ha alittl amount of specif subject i advic them to take more academ subject than the subject he ha . he will be abl to help peopl in mani thing and he can do mani goood thing .
