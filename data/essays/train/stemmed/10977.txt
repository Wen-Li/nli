experienc the convini of the car , we can not keep car away from our societi . most citizen live in advanc societi use car almost everyday . mani parent drive student to school everi morn , and mani wive send her husband to their compani . in thi environ is it true that in twenti tear , there will be fewer car in use than there are todat ? i disagre with the statemet that there will be fewer car in use that there are today becaus there are still lot of peopl who will use car in 20 year . what acceler the nuber of car within 20 year ? now , there are still lot of peopl who do not have the licenc of car , espec in develop countri which ha billion of popul but whose peopl do not affort that now . howev within 20 year , they seem to develop more than now . if chines peopl , more than12 billion , will becom affluent , the number of car is absolut increas . no one can deni thi fact . sinc the area of china is extraordinari larg , the need of car should be high . postul that the one-third of chines will get a car , the number is 4 billion !! ofcous the countri that have possibl to increas the number of car is not onli china . india , kenia , levanon , or cuba have great possibl . therefor , the number of car must be increas with the develop of those countri . have said that there are peopl who insist that the nubmer of car will declin in twenti year . howev they tend to ignor the possibl number of peopl who use car in the futur . therfor their idea should be disimiss an inappropro . i believ that the nubmer of car will radic increas becas there are mani peopl who know the convini of car in the futur especi in develop countri .
