if we had the possibl to go to live for a short period in the past , but not too far , mayb just sixti or seventi year ago , we would have been shock to see how mani thing have chang . if we speak to an elderli person , about 80 year old , sure he/sh will say that he/sh doe n't recognis thi world anymor . the behaviour of the peopl ha chang , the way they consid and judg thing which surround their town , they commun , or their citi is complet and total differ . as far as i am concern , i partial agre with thi statement . it is certainli true that the young gener doe not give the right import to help the commun they live in . infortun , nowaday they are just interest in build up their career , in climb the career ladder , in go to parti , in get drunk , and other million of similar thing . i my opinion , howev , in not good blame just young peopl , and the reason i am say thi is that we must not forget that is the societi or , better said , the entir world which push in thi way . everyon must be rich , must have a fat and expens car , everyon must have a huge and impress hous , etc . .. i am not surpris that young peopl are becomig more and more selfish and money-ori . in these day we do n't have ani more the posit valu and the moral and ethic rule that our grandfath had in the past centuri ! moreov , my person opinion is that thi chang in the behaviour and in the concern in the commun problem is not just relat to the new or young gener . in fact , also adult or `` old and matur '' peopl are affect by thi new diseas : we can call it `` money-desir '' . more and more grandpa or grandma are left alon and without a real love and care by their rel , becaus their children or their grandchildren are too busi too think about their live . in conclus , person , i think that we should chang the mind of the peopl who live in the entir world to assur a littl more help to our commun and to our belov grandfath .
