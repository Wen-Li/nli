the humankind alway need to buy suppli , meteri or food to live . advertis are play a big part in peopl 's chois of buy food , materi or suppli . there is lot of argument about the topic which we are discuss about . some peopl assum that while advertis someth you alway have to describ the qualiti of someth . in that case they think that advertisor is alway tell the truth . but some of us think that advirtisor are not say the truth about someth they advertis . i agre with the second idea . i have veri import reason and exampl to prove it . these are my follow reason . firstli , advirtisor are not tell the truth becaus they want to elemin the prize factor . for exampl , if i were an advertisor and if my product are veri expens , i will describ the qualiti of the product and i will never talk about the prize . and sometim i will not tell the truth about my product . so peopl will think that product is in high qualiti , it is normal that product is expens too . in aditt to thi , advirtisor want to advertis their compani . they show their product much better than they realli are , to advertis their compani . so peopl will believ that the compani is good enough to product thi valu of product . in that case peopl will alway choos thi compani 's product . the last but not the least , sometim advertisor lie about the prize too . they are make complic sale and advantag to sell the product . but usual in thi sale and advantag peopl are buy item or product much more expens . in thi situat , advertisor alway mix our head . all in all , i would like to say that advirtisor are not tell the truth both of elemin the prize factor , advertis their compani as well as to make complic sale and advantag .
