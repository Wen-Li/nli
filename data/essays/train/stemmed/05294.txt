while some peopl may think that young peopl give enough time to help their commun , i choos to differ . i person think that young peopl in today societi are not educ to help their commun in school . most inform they gain is to get better grade . the reason of give no time to help commun are no love and no pathi for the need and error educ . one of my friend serv a good exampl . mani year ago , i ask him about clean our commun and see some older peopl live alon in our commun . hi answer made me supris . he said , '' sorri , newman , i can not go with you becaus of good program . i can not miss ani one of them . '' i cound not say ani more about thi invent for help commun that day so i clean the stree alon and visit some elder peopl live alon . i hold that the excaus which my friend gave wa not realli the need of hi passion for the nice tv program but it realli reflect one problem which young peopl nowaday have : no love . no love for the peopl surround you , no love for your neighborhood , no love for the alon older peopl who need peopl to talk with them . most of young peopl enjoy the happi of amus they famili offer them . they do not want to spend ani time to do other meaning thing such as clean our commun becaus that it occupi thier amus time and their studi time . anoth reason made nowaday young peopl give unsuffici time to help their commun come from error educ . teacher as the educ for young peopl do not instil them correct concept of get along with peopl and viru for thi societi . in today societi , some incorrect valu come from media or newspap replac the correct educ . most teacher onli know to teach their student to get grade in school but not tell them how to gain good grade in the reationship between peopl . it realli caus the young peopl not see the need of their commun . in short , i hold that wrong educ , no love play the role of not give suffici time to commun for young peopl . i think we must help our offspr from these two major caus .
