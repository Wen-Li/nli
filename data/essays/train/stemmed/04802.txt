as far as i am concern , it is better to have broad knoledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . a student , in gener , even if he ha the idea of what to do in hi work futur , not alway hi dream match with the real life . it can happen that the econom situat at the begin of hi studi can be veri differ from the one at th end of hi studi . thi can happen for sever reason , such as polic , econom , and so on . if a student start to concentr onli on a specif subject , that can be for exampl , leteratur , at the end of hi studi i will be veri well educ on that subject , but in a world that is requir peopl that have technolog skill . it is import to say that a student that is involv in mani academ subject will be abl to mang all of it , but he will have alway the possibl to specil in one of them . i want to say that the best chois to do is to studi mani academ subject becaus it is alway possibl to special in one specif subject dure the studi period . on the other hand it is alway more difficult to chang it own studi plan from a specif subject to mani academ subject . onli if a student ha the chang to studi differ academ subject can also have the opportun to discov hi talent in subject that he did not know that he wa abl to do . sometim talent is hidden and onli a good teacher can help student to reveal it . student , if they decid to studi onli a specif academ subject , will not give the chanc to ani professor to discov their talent . the italian univers educ approach is base on mani academ subject that can give student the opportun to learn differ topic also not link from each one . onli after the univers , they can choos to special in one specif subject . i can see that italian student , in the end , are more prepar from usa student , these latter too special in onli one subject and unabl to face the real life so differ and changabl .
