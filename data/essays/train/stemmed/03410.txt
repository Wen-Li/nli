have you ever benefit from the broad knowledg of mani academ subject or from the specif subjeck ? from my point of view , i believ that i would choos to have the specif knowledg of academ subject . the reason as follow . first of all , i believ that choos to gain specif knowledg of academ subject is more effect and more effici of learn . for exampl , if i like foreign languag , and i want to be a person who good at languag . all i need to do is tri my best to acquir the knowledg of languag academ . in that way , i can as quickli as possibl to becom a master of languag . in addit , i believ that choos to gain specif knowledg of academ subject is more easi to make my dream come true . inasmuch as you concentr on the specif knowledg that you like , you would realiz your dream as quick as other , for exampl , i want to be a english teacher , thi is my dream , so i choos the depart of english for my major . someon who can concentr on what he studi is easier as well as faster success than those who choos to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . to sum up , while someon want to have broad knowledg of mani acdem subject , i would choos to the differ . therefor i would gain the knowledg of the specif subject which i like .
