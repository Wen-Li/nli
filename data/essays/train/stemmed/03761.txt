i think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one subject . first of all it is true that you have to have mani academ than one specif subject , becaus if you onli have one specif subject you might get bore and you wo n't get well on it , but if you have mani academ subject if you are bore on that you can go to the next one . so in my point of view it is better to have mani academ subject . if you have mani academ subject you can learn lot of thing that you might not hear of it , and give chanc to peopl that have n't heard or know about it . or one day you can have your own job and you thought of help peopl to learn someht new that they have n't heard about it . i think broad knowledg is what you need in your life without it you wo n't learn someth new . if you learnt one specif subject it wont be fun becaus in the other subject there are someth new that you have n't knew about it . for exampl in your specif subject you choos math but you realli like histori and you realli want to know someth in the past what will you do ? so in my point of view it is better to have mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . broad knowledg can be fun by learn someth new or they might tell you to go abroad and experi someth that they have told you , it will be fun becaus your in abroad and you will learn someth on your own . so in my opinion go for the mani academ subject , believ me you will learn someth new that you have n't learn .
