i disagre with the statement that consid it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one specif subject . in the follow paragraph , i will attempt to explain my posit from differ perspect . in my opinion , someon who know `` littl about a lot '' , will probabl be unfamiliar with the specif in each of the area he or she know `` a littl '' about . the probabl outcom is that thi person wo n't be abl to do anyth hi own and will need specialist in each area to help him or her . instead , if that person were to special in at least one area , then peopl can go to the person for help on a specif matter . the person can , in turn , ask for help or advic in area beyond hi or her expertis . from an econom perspect , i think that thi optim resourc . from a social perspect , i think that thi creat social interact , sinc peopl will continu to need from each other . it also prevent mistak . whi ? becaus mani mistak are made by those who think they know . final , i think that the futur is tend to a world of more specialist . in day to day life , we see that univers offer veri specif cours . on the other hand , we see that compani are demand precis that . it is no longer suffici to be a lawyer , or a tax lawyer - for exampl - sinc some compani are look for a specialist in transfer price , which is a veri specif part of tax law . to summar my opinion , i think that from an econom and social perspect and for other reason describ abov , it is better to be an expert in a field than to know `` a littl about a lot '' .
