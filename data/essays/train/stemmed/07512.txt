i disagre thi statement . the young and the older peopl are both enjoy life . first of all , the young peopl are live . they have a lot of time and energi to sdudi , which is the most excit thing in one 's life . the young peopl will benifit from it . the second , in the spare time , young peopl have plenti of energi and time to play basketbal , to danc , to sing , and also chat on-lin . as a younger , i like to make freind on-lin , you can talk with mani diffrent kind of peopl , and it will be make my life more interst . the young peopl can enjoy a live , busi and excit life . the older peopl can enjoy their own life too . mayb they do not have enough energi to play crazili like the young peopl . but they have more time to do some calm and slow exercis , such as taijiquan . if a older person ha a good healthi , he or she may go to swim , it intrerst and make one 's strong . my grandfath is a happi and health older man . he like do sport , and everi morn he go to swim with hi old freind . the plenti of exercis he take make him live as a young man . hi life is bueatiea , andi want to have thi kind of life when i am old . so the older peopl can enjoy hi love life . that is whi i disagre the statnm
