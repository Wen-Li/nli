through today 's environ situat , i realli hope that there are fewer and fewer car use in twenti year , becaus the car do pollut the air , but i think it may wo n't be true , there will be more car in use in 20 year . the first reason i want to say is , becaus of the econom . we know that in indurstri today , a world facturi ha been built , and as a car , mayb the part of it come from mani countri . in 20 year , some countri may develop it 's econom just by indurstri , and play an import part in the world facturi . of cours car-mak is one of the most import make by the world facturi , so the number of car wo n't decreas . second , as we know that in mani countri , car are vrey popula . in u.s. , for an exampl , even each famili ha a car , but we should know that such as us , or germani , all of these countri are develop countri , and there are mani develop or iess develop countri , the peopl in these countri may do want to have a car . i have a chines friend , he ever told me that , hi parent have save moneni for some year in order to buy a car . so it can easili show that in some courntri , to have a car is still the person ' in those courntri dream . what 's more , as the scienc develop faster and faster , mayb in 20 year , there will be the car that use electr to get power , or other thing , just in order not to pollut the air , and also mayb there will be the car that fli in air , drive in the water , just like the car in mani movi . so in a word , i think in 20 year , there wo n't be fewer car in use . in opposit , mayb even more and more car will be use , of cours the car on that day are clean car . to say someth more , if in 20 year , there are car just like i mention in the articl which can drive both in the air and the water , i will book one .
