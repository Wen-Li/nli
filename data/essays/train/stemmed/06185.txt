car start to appear and rise earli in thi centuri , they were one of the greatest invent ever . they made life much easiar , contribut in the industri revolut and made transport sever time much easiar and much more comfort . car made the world look smaller and made dream come true , i guess it wa the first step in global . but sadli noth is perfect and everyth should have disadvantag . car work on motor which util fuel and give to the atmospher unwant , harm and pollut gase . and when we speak about the ozon layer and the global warrm , we should realli underlin the role those vehicl play in aggrev the siuation . peopl can not give that invent away , no matter what and no matter what consequ we are go to harvest later on , just like smoke and all the other harmful stuff . unless we think of give peopl an altern , for exampl the hydrogen vehicl or the onc that use solar energi .. etc . when car start take a shape in the world in the begin of thi centuri most of the countri start direct most of their sourc and incom to bulid up the street , road , bridg , park and they have depart in each countri just to follow upal matter relat to that . so if we ever decid to give away car and all the other relat structur , we will have to bulid up a whole new major structr for the new mean of transport . although the idea of use the sky or the bottom of earth for exampl : the undergronud and subway seem realli successful , but it doe not seem as practic and avail as car . from my point of view , scintist are done their best to elimin pollut and save the world , and their effort are go to be reward by decreas the sourc of pollut , if they can give altern .
