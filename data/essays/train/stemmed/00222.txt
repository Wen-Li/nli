there are a lot of peopl that think that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject , but in my opinion it is better to special in one . in my opnion , the problem with have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is that the person can not have a strong and deep knowledg of each one of them becaus he or she will have practic unlimit sourc of studi , and thi will deriv in know just a few thing or veri superfici fact of each subject . i realiz , though that there are peopl that studi a lot of academ subject becaus they are trulli interest in them , and onli for their pleasur , in that case i admir them for have so mani differ interest . in my person case i found that special wa a much better thing to do . for exampl , i am a physician and the subject of medicin is absolutli huge , so when i finish the medicin school i decid to be a specialist in neurolog . when i got into my special i realiz again that it wa practic impos to have a veri strong knowledg about all the field of neurolog , first becaus it is a veri vast part of the medicin , and second becaus it is chang practic in a daili basi , and be current with all the inform is a quit difficult task . thu , i decid to sub special in neuro-oncoli in order to be abl to have a veri strong and deep knowledg of the subject , even though it is a veri specif one . in summari , i know that there are peopl that prefer to studi mani differ subject , that could work veri well for them but it doe n't work for me . i think that it is better have a strong knowledg at least in one field and not superfici knowledg in a lot of subject .
