i am strongerli agre with the statement . i face the same problem everyday dure studi . student can be more reli on the idea and the concept of what we are lear . i will develop three import reason whi thi statement is true . first , it is more easier to learn idea and concept . when we tri to learn the fact , it 's more harder to understand and it might confus them more and more . also it can bore out the student when we focu on the fact . it might be interest , and it might help us more . but what is the point if we do n't understand . there is no point to learn about what we need to learn . second , i think that udea and concept seem to stay longer than the fact . when we understand the idea and concept , it stay in our memori longer , becaus it interest peopl more than the fact . i have been take anatomi class . it wa realli hard for me to learn someth that uncommonli use , but if i appli my concept or idea to the definit or the bodi part , it 's certainli help me to understand what i am do and also easi for me to memor . third , it is import to understand what idea , becaus that help me to think more what i am learn and to make me think more and more . thu , lear fact doe n't hurt . but to understand idea and concept can help student more effect . also thi lead them to be more interest what we are learn .
