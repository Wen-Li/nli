most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are now there more and more advertis , we can see them erervi where . everi advertis is interduc the new product of their compani . most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i saw a advetis talk about a mp3 player , the advertis said that the mp3 player can continu play mp3 for 20 hour , but most peopl bought it and found it can onli play for 16 hour or less , so they ask the compani to give a explain on it . the compani 's explain is that when it play song , it have to turn to the lowest voic and can not chang song , so it can play for 20 hour . but it is imposs for user to do like that , when turn to the lowest voic , it almost can not hear it . and chang song is veri common for mp3 player . i had saw a lot so advertis like thi . so the product not that good like the advertis told us . the advertis ' purpos is let us to buy the product , so the advertis tell us all the good thing about the product , but will not tell us what the produt is not good at . so afer we see the advertis and buy the product , the feel is the product is not as good as the advertis say . so i agre with the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . most of the product can not do the advertis said . when we buy some product we should not just onli watch the advertis , we should ask someon who buy the product is it ture like the advertis say . do thi will help alot when we buy product .
