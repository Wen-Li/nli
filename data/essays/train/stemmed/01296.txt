the issu in hand is what the best way to travel in group is , with a guid tour or by their own . i agre that the best way of travel is have a tour guid , especi when it is a group trip . there are mani reason whi i think thi is a better approach , but here i am go to mention three that i consid the most import one . you can save time , money , and have the chanc to visit more place . now , let me tell you more about whi i mention these three reason . the first reason for which i agre that ua the servicc of a tourist guid is a smart thing to do is becaus have a guid would save the group some time . becaus the chanc of get lost in a new place are realli high , but if you do n't need to worri about find direct , then you would be abl to visit more place in the same period of time . second , have a guid tour would save you and the group some money . for exampl , you would save money in gasolin sinc you wo n't have to drive around tri to find the place you want to visit dure your trip , also the car rental fee would be chepaer becaus the whole gruop could ride in onli one car . final , i agre that travel with guidanc is more effect becaus you be abl to see more place , thi for sure . a tourist 's guid is usual a local person , therefor he or she know pretti well the area , and what is most import to me when i visit a new place , to learn about it histori behind . so , in conclus i agre with the idea that travel with a guid is the best way to do it .
