did you understang everytim your learend everyth ? thi subjet is it is more import for student to understang idea and concept than it is for learn fact . in my opnion i prefer import for student to understang idea and concept . first , do n't worri by not your understang fot studi and understand . everi eachoth have each opnion and think so we can not contorl their think and understand , so we need to say our opnion and we need to know whi ? and how ? and understand . second , we are differ , everi pepol is differ , for exampl color , languag , cultur and custom so we ca n't understand , i have experi , wheh i wa came to first visit usa , i do n't know everyth , and than i think if i eat good food and i give some food for my friend . i think he like thi one , but suddenli hi throwout everyth . so i 'm veri surpris . and then he said me our countri can not eat pork , i realli mistak . so i understand everybobi is differ , and everytim nerver forget and think . futhermor , think and behavior , and ue . if you learend someth you can use good work , but you can also ue veri bad work . for emampl , someon theat someth , but you can understand differ or mistak , you can use tealent for your bad way . thi is veri bad and sad . so we need to know good understand . and think about possit way .
