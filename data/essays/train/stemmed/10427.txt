it is often said that knowledg limit you . i could never truli figur out what that meant until i saw it in applic to life . and i agre with the statement that - young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . as one grow up , he undergo mani stage in life . each stage is a learn experi in itself . each stage ha it joy and sorrow . a babi would be consid at it 's first stage in the game of life . hi troubl would be limit to be fed at the appropri time and probabl aquir a new toy . that 's whi you see young kid smile at all time , even in their sleep . as we grow up we realis that life is not all peach and rose as it wa paint for us to see , but in fact each action ha it set of troubl and mayb sometim reward . we are induc with new worri and tension with each pass day . secur a job , support your famili , aquir a suitabl pension plan , and eventu settl down in life is all that one sum up hi entir life as nowaday . thi constant struggl to achiev hi aim , prevent man from stop for a moment and enjoy the celebr call life . young peopl are more bless . they have limit amount of stress as they are not complet awar of the problem that await them in their higher stage . they enjoy each moment as it come . to put it in better word they live life . consid an exampl of a father who slog day and night to earn enough to put hi son through colleg . he doesnt mind put in those extra hour at work as that would secur hi son 's admiss into a good univers later on . the son , on the other hand , would be blind to the hard work and effort that hi father put in for him , and enjoy each even out with friend . mayb a respons son would match hi father 's effort and maintain top grade . but let take a practic view on thi ; that hapen one in a hundr ! it 's not that young peopl shirk off responsibilti but just that they are more smart in shift them to anoth day . older peopl are more seriou in their approach to life . thi is a continu cycl and might never end as young peopl grow up and one day replac the elder . so live each moment as if it is your last .
