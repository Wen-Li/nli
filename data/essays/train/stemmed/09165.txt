i 'm disagre with the statement becaus all of peopl can enjoy their life , young peopl and old peopl . often young peopl are not near old peopl becaus they have a differ outlook of life . young and old peopl can enjoy themselv but in a differ way . if i can do an exampl , i want to mention a differ kind of thing that can enjoy old peopl and young peopl . young peopl are actract often by sport , cinema , crowd , nois think , they want alway smile . young peopl look for a new hard experi , they are dinam and they want to do alway someth new . old peopl in the past like the same thing , but now after twenti year they are tire and now they like the relax thing , like fish , sleep , read , play card and they enjoy themselv also more than younger peopl . thi can be an idea of the differ between the two differ kind of peopl . in a particular case the rule of the peopl can be the opposit . some young peopl can have the same bahaviour as old peopl and old peopl can have the same behaviour of young peopl . if you are seventi year old end you are not unfit , you can do the sameth of a teenag , are n't you ? i saw an old person play footbal veri well for two hour and after go to swim . it is possibl , in a few case but it is possibl . instead recent i met a young person that prefer a sedentari life , i do n't know whi but he stand for a lot of hour sit on hi harchair and he read two book or more in one day . it is possibl ? thi are a particular situat in wich peopl have a strang behaviour but normal if you are a young boy you must do the young boy and if you are an old `` boy '' you must do the hold boy .
