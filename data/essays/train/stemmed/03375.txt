now a day young peopl are affect by mani aspect of the societi , so that they ca n't abl to help their communit . i agre with the statement by the follow reason that , becaus of their educ system , extra curricular activ and affect of media etc . firstli , i could discuss about educ system . in my countri our educ system make all student so busi all the day . they are busi with their tight schedul of class and studi hour . they do n't even have a minut to spend time with their parent . as a graduat student i am also face the same problem . so that they do n't have time to help the commun . secondli , young peopl are use to spend their time by extra caricular activ , for exampl play sport , particip in seminar , give paper present and attend confer that are realt to their educ . all these factor make them so busi . i also use to attend the seminar and confer when i get a free time . final , media ha it great impact on youth . for exampl televis , internet , magazin and tv channel . all these factor are attract the youth . so that they are wast their time by spend their lot of valuabl time to watch tv , use internet etc . one of my friend , who wa also my classmat , addict to internet brows and chat . he spent most of hi time by chat with hi friend . therefor he spoil hi carrier by neglect hi studi . thi incid show how the youth are inclin to unnecessari thing and not show their interest in help commun . all these factor indic that youth are spend their time for their person activ . howev , some of them use to particip in some social welfar activ , such as help poor peopl and orphan . i conclud , that most of the youth use their time for their own purpos rather than help their commun . so that i agre with the statement that , `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' .
