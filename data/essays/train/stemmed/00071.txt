everi person in hi or her life would have a golden period to enjoy hi or her life in more than other period , and in my opinion thi golden period is in the age between 20 - 29 year , acord to that i absolotli agre with the statment thay say `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' and that for mani reaseon . the main reason whi i agre with thi statment is that a person when is young have more energi than older peopl have to do a lot of thing , and thi energi let one enjoy life more than not have it or have it lee , an old man had live more than a young one and saw more thing and had more experi in life so he or she would be tire of life and would not enjoy it as like as a young one do , a young person is still freash mind so he or she would still have alot of idea and a lot of beuti thing in mind want to do to enjoy life and in a young age she or he would like to do everyth he or she could do in acord to enjoy life and would have more pationt to do such thing than the older peopl do , also their are a lot of enjoy thing that older peopl can not do becaus of their age otherwis an young person can do it easili , final i would like to say that even i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , that doesnt mean that older peopl doe not enjoy life , i think that older peopl could enjoy life by other way than young peopl do that could be apropri for them and for there age , in my opinion everi person could enjoy life if he or she want to but in differ way .
