i total disagre with the statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' it wa seen that in last twenti year their wa big chang in the world of automobil and in the manufactur industri of automobil . peopl are got edict to the most suffici and more easi way of transport to reach their respect destin . in today fast track ( move ) life everi one is use of hi own way of transport . peopl want to reach their offic , colleg etc in short period of time . now see thi rapid growth of popul and technolog in everi part of the world everyon is least concernd about money . in today life everyon is fond of the most convieni way of transport to go to their destin and in thi competit world everi one is do their best to get satisfi with what they do and what they get . see to all these option everi one tri to have a vehcil of their own and which can be comfort for one famili . sinc their is huge competit in thi world of bussi everi compani are give their best in their sourc . everyon want to go out and have some fun with hi famili member , so to go out for a picnic with famili the most easi way is to have a car of own so that one can enjoy hi time with hi famili . in thi gener and in thi competit the price of the car ha come down and today an ordinari man can buy a car . by see the competit in the market each compani is give their best in the least price which they can and have much profit also . even some bank are provid 0 % interest on car loan . so by see thi competit and rapid growth of technolog car are becom much afford now . therefor i can say that in the come twenti year there will be more number of car as they are in present but not fewer from today number of car becaus peopl choos the most easi and simpl way of transport for their sake and the number of car will incres in come futur but will not come down .
