i agre with the statement and there are mani exampl to support thi idea . nowaday young peopl do not help their commun at all and insid the chang of societi and cultur can be found the answer of thi behavior . in my person opinion , i think that the reason for which young peopl do not help their commun are three . first of all , it ha becom veri common to live in citi which are not veri small in size . live in a big citi mean that a young boy or girl do not have the usual place that there were in the past . dure the last decad , the church , for exampl , wa the typic place where young peopl could help the other , for instanc , they help old peopl or the littl commun near the church . secondli , in the past it wa usual to live in littl hous and your neighbor becam your friend and all thi friendship form a commun in which everyon gave their help for the other , everyon did someth to the overal benefit . thi wa a great advantag becaus young peopl , live in thi particular atmospher , could see their work appreci in the commun which transform itself in a big famili . today thi kind of situat is not possibl becaus peopl usual live in a block of flat and everyon think onli about hi | her own bussi , nobodi think how can be import to have the possibl to have the help of the commun . thirdli , today societi and cultur ha chang veri much and , of cours , young peopl are chang too . everi young boy or girl live in a world without the other , it mena that young peopl prefer to stay alon . nowaday young peopl think onli about themselv , for exampl , about not intellig thing such as their game , their shoe or bag . they are onli concern on them and not on other peopl and in particular on commun . in conclus , all these three reason can not explain thi phenomenon in all it featur , but can make easier to understand whi young peopl are so far with their heart from one of the most import thing insid the societi : the commun .
