in our societi , where advertis are everywher , one can wonder if compani do not tri to convinc us that some of their product are much better than what they realli are . we will first discuss whi it is sometim true , then whi compani can not realli cheat , and final , we will explain whi it ha no real import in our societi . it is a commonli share idea that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . as a matter of fact , the aim of an advertis is to sell a product . therefor , when a compani want to sell a product , it can be more effici to make potenti custom believ that it is better than what it realli is . in our societi , for exampl , design is wide use to make us buy thing that we do not realli need : the lack of effici of a product can be hidden by it design , or by the pictur and text shown in the advertis . for exampl , compani like appl greatli reli on design to sell them product . one can wonder : `` whi doe thi compani need so to spend so much in advertis ? is the product not worth it cost ? '' . obious , the way some product are present in advertis make them appear better than what they realli are : advertis for pasta alway show them cook with delici sauc ; advertis for burger alway show us big , perfect burger , wherea everyon know they do not look at all like thi when we go to mac donald 's ! but on the other hand , cheat with the actual qualiti of a product is not effect in a long term commerci strategi . obvious , peopl who bought a product becaus they believ it wa much better than what it effect is , will not buy it anoth time . thi is whi compani know that they can not cheat too much . moreov , there are sever law concern advertis : lie in an advertis is forbidden for instanc . for exampl , we can see on old guiness advertis , `` guiness is good for you . give you strength '' . such advertis , which were common in the earli 1900 , ha complet vanish becaus law have been vote to prevent thi . the most import think is , i believ , that as we all perfectli know our societi , we all more or less know when advertis lie to us and when they do not . even we often see monster jump out of cereal on the televis ( like for instanc the tiger from frosti ) , we know that it will not happen for real . in the same way , we do not believ that some product will remov everi kind of dirt on ani cloth .
