i do n't agre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than loder peopl do . '' . as a senior citizen , old peopl have alreadi finish their duti to their famili and the socioal , so they do n't have mani thing to involot them . they can spend much time to travel and to see their old friend who are also senior citizen , sometim they can even walk for a whole day to enjoy the sunlin and flesh air . at home old peopl are alway no.1 . some peopl say that old peopl have not much time to enjoy themselv , but i do n't think so , as they have no work to do , they seem to have more time to enjoy live , on the other hand , how mani young peopl realli have time to realx themselv , as in the school they have countless homework to do , and countless word to hear from teacher and parent . to the young worker , you can never realx yourself as you must work hard as you have to affect your famili and your parent . mani peopl say that old peopl ca n't catch up with the societi , someth like music and game which is so atract to us . but what will i say is that as them are n't interest in these thing they miss noth . they have mani thing to everi day as these thing are what they think are interest . and as a old peopl who have enough experi they alway do mani thing in a more quickli and easier than the young peopl . and old peopl alway have enough thing to think as we need to spend a live to get .
