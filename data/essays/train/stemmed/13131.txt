i agre with the statement for sever reason . mani centuri ago , the total amount of scientif knowledg wa not veri big . one usual think of a man of the 16 centuri , say galileo , as a complet man onli if he or she master all the aspect of scienc . nowaday , everi specif disciplin ha grown to an extend that it is imposs to master it all . for exampl , let concentr on physic . there are lot of veri specif sub-field , like barion particl physic or maser optic . it is imposs to know everyth about all the specif sub-field , even if we concentr onli in physic . sinc it is not possibl to master an entir disciplin like physic , i think the best option is to tri to know a littl bit about everyth . second , peopl special in a specif subject can find veri hard to interact with other scientist . everi disciplin ha it own mathemat tool , it own vocabulari and it own way of think . therefor it is realli difficult to get a good interact between a biologist and a geologist . a person who can handl mani academ subject can interact with a lot of peopl . third , a scientist who ha a broad knowledg can alway get advis from a expert in a specif field when need . it will be much harder for an expert to get an aplic of hi knowledg in other field becaus of the lack of knowledg of the potenti applic . for exampl , it could be realli hard for a matematiscian to get an applic of some probabl theori to sociolog . on the other hand , a sociologist that know a littl of mathemat , could ask an expert all the question he or she ha . in conclus , i think it is a better strategi to tri to manag sever disciplin . one can alway get advis from an expert if need . also it will be easier to interact for a person who know about sever academ subject .
