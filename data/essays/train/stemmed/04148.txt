i complet agre with the statement that it is more import for the student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in today 's world the qualiti of the educ system ha certainli gone down . now a these day more stress is be put on the student to learn fact rather than focus on the understand of idea and concept . eg : a student is stress to learn when the world war ii start or which countri were fight in the war rather than provid an understand to them whether the war wa necessari or not ? what could be the consequ of anoth war of the same sort take place in the futur ? in today 's world one ha to be innov , creativ and origin . the educ system in today 's world doe not input ani of these qualiti in a child . these qualiti can onli be input through proper understand of idea and concept and not by mere fact . the abov mention qualiti contribut greatli in one 's success . fact are also import . a student should definit be familiar with the histor event . eg : the date when his/her countri got independ , how they got it , the name of the freedom fighter etc . but these are just for knowledg . they are not go to contribut in one 's success . if a child learn onli fact at school and doe not understand idea and concept then he might even have a problem find job . he might not do well in hi job interview where they test your understand of thing concern . so i definit think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact . i also hope that the educ system in make the requir chang in their procedur and focus more on the understand of idea and concept rather than fact .
