most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i do not agre oder disagre with thi statement , becaus on one hand there are mani product , which have veri bad advertis but are veri useful and effect . on the other hand , the product with the biggest and greatest advertis can be unus and uneffect product for me . it depen also on the intress of peopl . everybodi in the world ha diffrent subject in which he is intresst . for exampl a man who love car will be abl to decid if the advertis for a new car is much better then the car is in realiti or if the advertis just exactli show the qualiti of the car . a other man , who hate car , who just move by hi feed becaus he think that car are bad for the enviro will say , that the advertis is bad . or that the maker of it just want to make money . an other differ by give the right mark for the advertis is the age . the more year a human ha live , the more thing he know . for a littl boy for exapl impress the new car much more then the man , who love car . becaus the man saw so mani car bevor in hi live and for him it just someth he now in a new way and teh littl boy , for him it is not just a new car , it is someth new in gener , becaus he have not known it bevor . i think that you can not say that a advertis is bad , bacaus the peopl for whom the advertsi wa made mayb think that thi a great advertis . i just can say for the advertis i am intrest in show most of the time a good advertis . when i tri a new product , for exapl a shampoo , what wa advertis as the best shampoo ever on tv , the advertis wa not alway right but some time . all in all you have to be intrest in the prodcut and you need a liitl knowlegd to decid if it is good or not , you have to think about , that other peopl ha not the same opinion as you , and you have to think about if thi product , which ha a good or bad advertis is the onli one between mani , or if there are mani good or bad one .
