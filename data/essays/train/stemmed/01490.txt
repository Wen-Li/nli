nowaday mani person have the impress young peopl do not dedic enough of their time to help their commun . what my person experi provid is that societi ha a strong tendenc to observ onli the neg exampl provid by the young peopl and that it is realli hard to find free time to dedic to other . today societi seem to love to notic onli the bad exampl of young peopl and unfortun thi phenomen usual bring to a strong critic to the young peopl in gener . it is true that there is a quit big amount of young peopl who are pretti selfish and do not care at all about other , but onli about their own good . what is extrem import on the other hand , but that unluckili is notic by the societi just few time , is that there are mani young peopl involv in , for exampl , volunt activ . what is even more import is that thi number would strongli increas if young peopl had more free time . school is realli hard and requir lot of effort , mani young peopl also dedic some of their time to other activ like play a music instrument or learn a new languag , they perhap also need to rest sometim and so it is easi to understand that find a free afternoon to dedic to other is not easi . for thi reason those young peopl who are engag in volunt activ must be admir by the societi becaus they are abl at the same time to care about their own good and that of the other . i , for exampl , dedic my friday afternoon to help young children with their homework . thi activ give me a lot , but often i have to renounc to studi in order to have time to do it . the amount of young peopl not involv in volunt activi is big , but at the same the number of young peopl involv in these activ is big too . these young peopl have to be admir becaus they are abl , within a week full of thing to do , to find time to dedic to other .
