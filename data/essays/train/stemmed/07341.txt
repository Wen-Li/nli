while some think that it is better to learn mani academ subject , other believ that it is better to major in onli one specif subject . i prefer the latter idea , special in one tipic subject , for three reason . at first , i think that peopl who major in one specif subject such as law and medic are abl to earn a lot of money . for exampl , in japan , lawyer and doctor are high-class profession and can earn much money . to the contrari , peopl who do not have deep knowledg of specif subject can not earn a lot of money . to tell the truth , i am a offic of nation tax agenc in japan and possess broad knowledg about tax especi coopor tax , so i can earn 100000 doller per year owe to my knowledg . second , the reason whi i prefer to special in one special subject is that student can enjoy their univers life . if they learn a lot of academ subject such as econom , histori and mathemat , they have littl time to use freeli . on the other hand , student who studi onli one specif subject hard can possess a lot of time , so they can do sport or enjoy their academ life . thirdli , i think that student can be interest in studi if they learn one academ subject hardli . in gener , peopl tend to be interest the subject as they studi more hard and deeper . thu , i think that they will be tast the jo about studi . therefor , for these reason i insist that it is better to studi onli one specif subject than to learn mani academ subject . through my experi , i enjoy my colleg life and am be abl to earn a lot of money becaus i studi onli about tax .
