'' fashion '' ... thi is a key word ! in our world in order to sell someth you must get it becom fashion ! think about the ipod . .. it is the most popular mp3 readr of the world . .. and not for it technolog ; it is famou due to the fact it design is '' cool '' ! so now have an ipod mak you a '' coolo '' person ! for the peopl of the 21st centuri be '' cool '' and fashion is the most import thing [ in particular for young peopl . . in fact for the bee par of a group , and in particular the cool one , it what they aim for ] . count on the fact that most of peopl in the civil world watch a minimum of 2 howr of televis a day . .. the best way to let product be known is through tv ! not onli by spot . .. but also trough '' sublimin '' messagg ! thi consumist societi want to keep us slave of : '' be cool or be noth '' !
