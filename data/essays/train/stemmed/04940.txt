there are a lot of respons on the young peopl shoulder . they are tri to discov themselv , discov their abil , their place in the communuti eventu draw their own path . i believ eventhough i spend most of my time for studi , i give time to help my commun . is it enough ? i think thi statement is both true and not true for differ reason . it is true in a way that we do n't do our best . we can spend a lot more time to make our citi a better place . we can take part activ in regualt . also we can spend more time with the elderli . we can do thi by care planiong our spare time . but usual we choos to relax and be with our friend whan we have time . one of the reason for tghi is that nowaday peopl do not need each other like they did befor . almost everyth in out live can be done with profession . becaus of thi peopl less intefer to eachpoth life . on the other hand it true that we are do what ever we can . even studi not to be a useless person is help to the communuti . i do not have time but when i see my neighbour i ask them if they need someth . i am live in a flat and my neighbour are two old sister . i ask to them if they need anyth when i am go to the market or exampl . if someth is go on in front of my eye i do not close my eye , i interfer and help . if i am not awar what can i do about it ? i think thi sentenc is both tur and not true from differ view . it is true that young peopl might be littl bit isol from commun and becaus of thi they are nto help much . but young , especi student are busi with studi and develop themselv and should not be balm for not give enough time . it is communuti responsibl to creat the occas for share and help .
