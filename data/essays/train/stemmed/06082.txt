nowaday , student are lead to learn more theori , but have a lack of knowledg of the real fact . in my opinion , i do n't think it is more import to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . to prove my opinion , i have three reason . first of all , we all livein the real world , everyday we see grass , flower , tree , bird , etc. they are all the creatur , we can touch , smell , and hear . student should be taught how to admir these real thing ( fact ) in our daili life , the idea and concept can not help student to learn more about the creatur . second of all , most of the idea and concept are in the book , if student are just stude these idea and concept , than they will lose mani chanc to be in touch with natur . in contrast , natur may help children find more idea and concept than in the book throughout the practic in the outsid . last but not the leat , the idea and concept are the result from the scientist or the phylogist , they may get these idea and concept in wrong way . accord to today 's registr , mani new and correct idea and concept are out . but in student ' book , the idea and concept do n't be improv , so student may get the wrong inform about the fact . then , at thi time , experi is much more import , let student get correct idea and concept by themselv . for exampl , physic and chemistri can not lust learn the idea and concept , student must have a object configur of the physic and chemic fact . to sum up , the natur , the practic , and the experi are the better mean for student to get idea and concept of the fact . in these way , they can not onli learn the truth in the book , but also learn more about fact throuth the process of get knowleg .
