i total agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are sever reason to support thi argument . defin fact ? fact is a statment or theori put forth by an individu or group of individu or an organ . a student can memor a lot of fact without understand the purpos behind the fact . a fact can be true or fals but definit can be proven by an individu if the student can understand the idea and concept . for exampl , in the past peopl believ that the world wa a straight line but couldnt be proven sinc the resourc were insuffici or peopl were will to accept the fact rather than spend time , money on it . a greek scholar state the earth wa spheric but wa unabl to support hi statement . student need to spend more time on the idea and concept underli the fact . it improv the student abil to broaden hi idea , infact could possibl lead to rewrit some of the fact which ha been there for centuri . mani fact are interlink with each other . therefor disapprov a fact can lead to revis of other fact that are link to it . understand idea and concept can help the student easili memor the fact . therefor , it is an import factor that student understand the idea and concept .
