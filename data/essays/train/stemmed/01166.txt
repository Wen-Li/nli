i am agre with thi statement . inde , to be success , it is import to be creativ , tri new thing and take risk . i think that it is veri import to do a lot of thing that we do n't alreadi know , becaus if we alreadi do what we hnow , we can not carri on in the life . to illustr my point of view , i would like to use sever exampl . in the profession work , it is import to tri new thing and take risk to be success and not to do onli what we alreadi know . if someon want to creat hi own entrepris or creat a new concept , it is import that he ha qualiti that other peopl doe n't have . whi not open a new compani creat an innov and concequ a new product . at the begin , it is sure it will be hard , but if we never tri new thing we can not know . i think that so mani peopl are scare about new thing and prefer do someth known . for exampl , befor the ipod or mp3 player , everybodi listen music thank to a walkwan . ererybodi wa happi and like it . but one day , a man decid to creat someth new , with anoth concept and it wa a veri good idea . we know that today appl is veri success , mani young use appl 's product and the creator is veri rich . whi ? just becaus he tri someth new and he took risk . i think it is the same thing in all the domain . at work , a director prefer a employe who tri new thing and take risk than an employe who alreadi do the same thing , someth alreadi know how to do well . to my mind , the first one will have more chanc to sucess , and a better evolut carreer . to finish , even in the artist world thi statement is confirm . inde , at the begin , a singer is not known , but taken risk an tri to sing , he can becom success , even if at the base it is not hi job but more a passion , an hobbi .
