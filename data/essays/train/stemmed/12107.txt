not onli korean tourist but also other asian tourist are notori for veri noisi group tour . in fact , mani friend of mine have their summer trip in a group led by a tour guid . howev , i think the real valu of tour can be achiev by individu tour plan . first of all , a tour with person plan give a lot of lesson . i think a singl trip is similar to a path of one 's life . when i wa a colleg student , i use to make a plan by myself . of cours , it wa veri tough for begin . howev , as time went by , i got more use to get use inform and well-design plan . dure survey of tour , i met mani advis from variou field . it also help me to enhanc my interperson skill . i still keep in touch with some of those peopl . as the old say goe , peopl live and learn . secondli , individu trip can be more flexibl . sometim i see peopl who suffer from their tour with a tour guid . that is becaus they had to follow the group 's schedul rather than their own prefer . on the contrari , in my own trip , i could explor more variou site freeli whenev i feel i need to spend more time in a specif place . when i had a two week backpack tour in europ , i stay rome for a week . consid the overal trip period , it wa significantli long period . if i had to follow a group tour 's rule , it would n't be possibl . in conclus , i do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i think it ha more shortcom than gain . for me , i prefer a individu tour with own plan to a bore group tour with typic routin .
