public is everywher in our live ; it spread from the billboard across the street to the 5 minut come right at peak suspens of our favorit tv show . the idea of public is to make custom want to buy one product . there are sever way to achiev thi goal , whether you make your audienc laugh , or you get them excit or thrill . the point is to make them feel good about themselv . for that , as no product itself can do that rightaway , it seem obviou to me that most advertis to make their product look better than they realli are . first , we can see that there is an issu of subject as it come to decid wether or not a product is shown `` better '' than he realli is . there can be differ point of view about the `` good '' of a product . but gener , no product reach in real life the level of great that advertis show . what is interest to notic is that peopl are wholli awar of the exager that advertis provid , but they agre to think that it is part of the game . no one actual believ everyth that is shown on televis . they know they wo n't yum everytim they eat a yoghurt , and they wo n't have an orgasm everytim they drink their coffe . thi system preserv itself . if an advertis ha hard time stick strictli to it product real qualiti , the product will look flat compar to the other product display . it show that an advertis doe have to emphas and improv the qualiti of the product it is advertis for . of cours there are legal limit to the extens advertis can get in make their product look good : thi is import not to get into lie as far as qualiti is concern . to conclud , i think that it is in the essenc of advertis to show peopl an idealist world
