in my opinion ye young peopl enjoy more life than a older peopl becaus young peopl are more enerzis , fun love , enthusiati , out go and more over a passion to do someth new and great which attract other . let take my exampl when i have gone for my holiday with my famili me n my sister both ha done riverraft and dive wherea my parent were there but they had not done anyth like thi they were actual roamimg around in the beach and enjoy the wheather . similarli at night i would love to go night club but if i give chang to my parent they would choos to go for a long drive . the onli reason is i enjoy danc and have fun at disc with friend and they enjoy convers with there age group peopl . anoth good exampl would be u can find a club in a are where colleg and hostel and even place where more young peopl are there , wherea you find a nice beauti park when you visit ani societi of retir person . in my organis peopl who are work in field forc as a sale execut or document pick up are mostli young boy or girl becaus they are more energet wherea if you see in administr and back offic more olderli peopl are work where job profil doe not includ much stamina . accord to me older peopl would to do those kind of job which reqir more mental stamina rather then physic . young peopl ha more stamina then old peopl . but ye there are alway except i have a uncl who is alway into a mood of enjoy or have fun all the time . you find these kind of peopl veri less who ha lot of energi even at older age . so it again depend on the person to person how he take hi life to potenti .
