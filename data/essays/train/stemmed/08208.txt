i am not in complet congruenc with the statement , i believ that in some case it is more import to understand concept and idea rather than to learn fact . becaus the feild of educ is a vastli divers and thu u need to bend yourself as per the reqiur of the subject i opin that in scienc we need to understand the concept grasp the idea and also appli them as per the situat , scienc requir you to not onli memoris the fact but also want you to appli the logic conclus of the fact or concept learnt , so as to arriv at a best solut to a problem . for instanc in subject such as mathemat you need to appli the concept that you have learnt and bring out a solut for the problem , not onli doe math requir thi but also , variou scienc relat to math such as comput scienc which requir you to frame program depend on the the custom problem . if the scientist in olden dya were onli memor the fact but not understand them then the peopl live in thi modern era would be depriv of the knowledg of graviti , electr and mani more essenti concept . thu we need to uderstand the idea and appli them as per the situatuion memor fact on the other hand is use when we studi art and subject like histori , geolog and also the other scienc such as biolog and zoolog , for evid in olden day peopl use to calicul which part of the day is it by look at the sun 's posit , thu to calicul thi we need the knowleged fo from which side thu the sun rise , sinc sun rise in the east , peopl rememb thi fact and make conclus about the part of the day . thu memoiz fo fact help you while innov a new concept that we nwwd to rememb the characterist featur of the thing or object in order to deriv a conclus i would also like to bring otu a point that there is alwasi a case of forget thing while your are memor fact , but there is no case of forgettin concept or idea onc you memor them . thu a bias coin ha two side so doe a the apprach to leaarn thing and concept , in the climax i wolud like to say that learn fact and understnd comncept heve here own imporat in there respect field .
