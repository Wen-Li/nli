in my opnion , there is no doubt that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . howev , some peopl have opposit opinion , so i must explain care . we have those who believ that peopl had better to studi about one specif subject . they think that the way is more effect to produc profession . in addit , they feel that the wide rang of knowledg is not necessari for profession such as engin and artist . forexampl , some pianist who had educ onli play the piano . howev , he becam a veri famou pianist . even though he did not have gener knowledg , he could live himself . over the recent year , the problem ha happen which the young peopl can not find their way . some person feel that the wide rang of knwoledg affct the problem . it is natur that peopl who ha a lot of way make him confus . in contrast , we have those who believ that the peopl , especi student must studi mani accadem subject . becaus , studi onli one subject make narrow student life . to sum up . we must pay attent what student to need . after that , we must give them chanc todecid .
