in my point of view , old peolp are more happi of there life than young peopl . there are three reason to thi opinion . first , young peopl have a lot of problem . then you studi you have all the stress of the examin . furthermor , it 's in thi perdiod of life that you have to decid of your futur and you know it . you are conscient that all your decis will have a veri big effect on your avenir . second , older person are more abl to appreci than the young gener . the oldest genar have experi so they are more abl to take in account what happen . they alreadi achiv someth in there life so thi peopl are more confident . for exempl , when a 18 year old man felt in love we certanli not realis the chanc that he have . on the over hand a 45 year old man realis exactli the chanc that he have when he is in love . finali , although some peopl think that becaus student make more parti they enjoy more there time . it 's well know that alcool , who is to much drunk at thi parti , covert onli the problem of thi person . in conclus , i will said that becaus of the too stress situat that is accept with alcool and the secur and experi of old gener ; young peopl do n't enjoy life more than the older peopl do .
