one must realiz that the statement accord to which there will be fewer car in use in twenti year than there are today can be easili challeng or confirm thi assumpt is obvious inaccur when compar to the variou econom result and financi statement render nowaday by the car compani . except for a few of them , such as gener motor in the usa or peugeot more recent in franc ( both experienc sever financi distress ) , the major compani have increas their financi incom . the continu purchas of car by consum as well as the perpetu will to consum that character modern occident societi explicit prove that the car industri is boom . thi phenomenon is n't like to stop , especi when the wide varieti of price offer by the compani ( from the cheap car to the ultra luxuri one ) satisfi everi consum . the car industri adapt perfectli to the consum , and it seem difficult to imagin that there will be less car in twenti year than there might be today . nevertheless , thi statement could be partial true , for three main reason . first of all , major citi have nowaday develop variou transport servic for their inhabit , which have the doubl advantag of be more use and fast . it is unanim admit that take the metro today is far more conveni than use a car , especi in citi where traffic jam seem to appear as the principl rather than the except . second of all , the price of fuel ha increas in such way that it now constitut an undeni factor to take into consider in the purchas of a car . fuel be so expens , ani consum will not necessarili be abl to afford on a long-term basi the fuel necessari for hi transport . final , the ecolog argument is more and more put forward to demonstr how the use of car can harm our environ . in my opinion , and thi could be a possibl solut , car compani should definit invest in new and proper technolog , if they do n't want to see their product disappear .
