nowaday it is often mention that we are use up our natur resourc and that there will be veri few resourc of fuel in a few decad . as the usabl amount fuel will be get less the the cost will get higher . even today for a few year ga and fuel price have gone veri high . as a result of these it is claim by some of the research that there will be fewer car in twenti year time . though i do not agre with thi idea , i even think that there will be more car in twenti year . there are two reason that i strongli claim . first reason of the fact that there will not be fewer car in use in twenti year is the altern energi sourc . as engin we predict that altern energi sourc will be in use in ten year time like sun and hydrogen energi . there are realli import research on the use of these energi for car . even in turkey there are more than 40 car use sun energi built so far . moreov car use hydrogen energi ha alreadi been built but still be work on . when we come over thi energi problem , in other word make the last car product work with altern energi there will certainli be an incres in the number car in use . the second reason is that in twenti year there will still be plenti of petrol that can be use ( may be more expens ) . and if we consid the populaion growth and the increas of wealth we can conclud that in twenti year there will more peopl use car , even one famili will have four or five car ! as a result the claim that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year is complet wrong from the point of view that i have here . as an engin i can say that car in use will increas day by day
