i strongli agre with the statement which success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do wel . i have three thing to support my opinion . first of all , peopl tend to like new thing veri much . onc peopl get use to with someth , peopl often look foward new thing . for exampl , i pod is one of the new technolog and is veri popular product in the u. today . befor i pod wa produc , peopl satisfi with cd player , but onc i pod ha been on the market , no one would go to buy cd player anymor . moreov , peopl are alreadi look forward new version of i pod even have a newest i pod . therefor , peopl like new thing more than old thing . anoth reason is that we need to creat and tri to make a new thing which did not exist befor becaus life doe not stay and go back to the past . a life is alway go forward . to keep produc the same product which exist alreadi doe not chang ani thing . we have to have new thing to live a life more usu . car is one of the exampl . if we dont have a car in the u. , how can we live in thi countri ? everyon ha to live in the town , and no one want to live countri side becaus of unconvini . peopl are requir to make new thing to satisfi peopl 's want and need . final , to compet with other , i think there would be need to have new thing even if take risk . if everyon ha the same , there is no way to win the competit . to win the competit , have a new thing which doe not have other becom veri strong point . take risk is need to make and tri new thing . in my countri , there is the word that `` high risk , high return '' . what thi mean is that take high risk would lead higher returen later on . from these reason , i strongli agre with the statement . in a everyon 's life , we can not stop there . we have to move onto forward to success life .
