i agre with the statement most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus the princip task of a market and brand execut is to improv new market and to sell hi product to them . one way of sell product is show the benefit it provid ; like textur , tast , color , use , etc . all of thi benefit go directli to the costum 's mind by the advestis , which let the custom enjoy the product for a few second or minut throught the televis , the radio , internet , etc . as an exampl , when ani fast food bussin advertis it 's product ( in thi case a hamburg with fri and dessert ) , they show a realli big hamburg with larg fri with lot of spici sauc and as a dessert , a huge ice cream with two differ top on it . but when one , as a custom go to that fast food restaur , instead of one big meal , one found a medium not tasti hamburg with medium fri without spici sauc ( becaus it is a side , it is not includ in the meal ) and with a one - scoop ice cream . thi is not fair for the costum , but as i said in the introduct , that 's the way market execut creat their advertis , show the custom how good their product are . final , as it occur in food compani , it happen the same in most of the compani around the world ; in the advertis one will alway see a perfect product with extraordinari characterist , but when one buy the product is when one know if the product is as good as it wa suppos to be or all of the advertis wa a fake .
