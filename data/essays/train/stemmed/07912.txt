i concur what the statement say . sinc i went to a lot of countri in mani differ kind of way , the best experienc i had wa to travel as in a group led by a tour guid . when i wa eleven year old , i went to phillippin with my famili and we thought we would have fun not chase by time becuas usual with group we are chase by time . but throughout the trip , sinc it wa our first time visit phillippin , we did n't know ani place so just look for the good place , we spent one day just research for place . the follow day , my parent borrow a car and we bought a map but then it wa hard to get to the place becaus all the poplular place were far away . there were alway full of peopl and there wa traffic jam , when we got to the place , my dad wa all readi tire . but if have gone with a tour guid , sinc guid know where to go and about the place , he will expla to us about that place and give us great inform . those are the reason whi i like to go trip as in a group led by a tour guid . travel do n't have to drive and we can look at the view in relax mood . we go to trip to have comfort and have excit time and we go to travel to get away from our normal same day live . what is the point of go to travel , if we are have tire day like as normal day ? also , if we go as a group , we get to meet a lot of new peopl with diffrent chracterist . i am outgo and social so it wa alway fun to meet new peopl . in conclus , i again agre with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . travel in as a group is a best thing to do !
