i agre success peopl love to tri new thing and take risk rether than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are few reason that i support . first , i think to be a success person whose person must be interest in anyth . they like ti take adventatur and to do a lot of new thing that are gener peopl do n't want to do it . for exampl . my father is a success businessman . he wa born in a veri small town in taiwan . in hi famili , there are no bodi want to go to big citi to find a job . everyon is satisifi with their life , thay do n't want to chang their life style . even thought they know to stay in the countri ca n't be rich , but they still love to stay in the countri . my father is differ with other peopl . he know if he work hard and know more about inform from world , it must be help to hi futur and career . whatev how hard work , he alway want to tri and he never afraid of challang . becaus he know that may be a good chanc to chang hi life . and now he did it . second , i think if you never tri new thing , you wo n't know how will be chang in your world . if you want a success life , you have to tri everyth . to find everi possibl success reason and do n't be afraid of to make mistak . becaus ani mistak can make you find out what 's problem in thi situat and improv your abil . i believ to be a success person need to spend more time to do a lot of thing and it must have a hard time to overcom . but one day when you becom a success person , you will know everyth is worth .
