i do agre with the statement , until unless a person is will the take risk and tri thing differ the posibl of success is less . as do the same thing will produc more of the same result , which he or she alreadi is experianc . if they are not enhanc a person life , no matter how much he do what alreadi he know will not make him successful in anyway , in my own exampl i did by move to unit sate , if i whould have left in my hom countri i would have not been successful as i am right now . by move to thi coutri i took the risk of leav my safe job back in my countri , which i wa do for almost 5 year , i wa well estabilis in job know what i wa do henc i dont have to worri about job , but the pay wa not great . if i would have stay i would make same amount of maney , and my experi in life would have remain the same ever sinc i move to unit state i have make more money , i have bought a home and leav veri happi life . and more imporatanli i have oppertun to meet the new peopl and know about variou cultur , as mani peopl from differ coutri come and settl heit whould have not possibl if i have stay back .
