when one weigh the pro and con of use a car , it will lead to an inevit conclus : in twenti year car will becom a kind of ` endang speci ' in our modern societi . current , thi question is rais a huge controversi becaus , on the one hand , car is wide use as a tradit mean of transport and car are also a part of our cultur [ especi , in the us , where car driver are total enamor with their car ] . but on the other hand , the increasingli price of petroleum and fossil fuel , the environment issu link to the widespr use of car and other drawback make peopl think more deepli about car . as a matter of fact , i maintain that car are go to disappear in a veri close futur , mainli becaus of econom reason and environment issu . first and foremost , peopl are more and more concern about the sharp growth of their expens . use a car involv a lot of shortcom sinc it is veri expens to purchas a car , to buy oil and to ensur your car , for instanc . so it seem that car tend to becom less avail for the middl class famili in develop countri . besid , one should bear in mind that it is not so comfort to use a car becaus you have to endur traffic jam , which may end in traffic accid sometim , you have to commut everi day and i strongli believ that peopl are fed up with such problem . moreov , car will be fewer use in the next year becaus peopl are well awar that it is damag to the environmemt and the natur around them . obvious , one should not expect modern human to renounc technolog progress or to return to the stone age . but , if thing are left as they are , the human speci will finali disappear . thu , i am sure that one should prefer rescu our planet and live of next gener rather than keep hi car . that is all the more crucial that the situat is obvious get wors , so i can not help think that men are abl to make sacrifici if it is worth it . similari , we can see the harmful impact of car in our daili life . in big citi there a lot of exhaust fume , a lot of nois , smog and pollut and , to my mind citizen will not stand it ani longer . final , the developp of altern way of transport will also lead to a fewer use of car . for instanc , a mayor in a big town can decid to incres the public transport network , to make it more conveni and avail in order to replac car . that is what happen in pari recent . to conclud , eventhough a lot of peopl are still addict to their car , they will soon chang their mind . econom reason and ecolog issu are coupl of reason which let us think that there will be fewer car in use in your citi . there is no doubt that it will enhanc our qualiti life for both gener , present gener and futur gener .
