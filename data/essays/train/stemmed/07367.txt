do young peopl just worri about their life and academ cours , and not worri about the societi ? are young peopl so selfish that they can not contribut just a littl bit of their time to the societi they live in ? how about all the homeless peopl who have nowher to go ? what about the old beggar who do not have money to support their famili ? even as young peopl , we do help our commun by creat club such as unicef , and clean up place for a better environ . in my school just a year ago , a teacher , ms. levin , start an organ call unicef . it is an organ where we help the children that need help . mostli , the children who need help are the one who have no place to stay , no money to support medic , or no proper educ . when thi club wa introduc , a lot of young peopl join , not becaus they could get commun servic credit , but becaus they could actual help by devot their time to it . just by dedic time to provid servic , we could rais money to save a child from neumonia or starvat , and that 's what 's most import . the environ , a place where we 're all affect , is gradual pollut the place . everi year , the school decid to take student to the beach to clear up glass piec , plastic bag that are pollut the environ . the student who join thi event everi year did not join becaus they could ditch one day of class , becaus the event is on a saturday . the young student are will to give up their weekend to stay under the boil sun and clean up in the beach and make the world a better place . time is unlimit . young peopl have time for themselv , but they would also find time to help the commun . if not , they would n't be will to go to the beach on a saturday morn to clean up , nor would they join unicef to help children who have no affili with them . most young peopl would actual enjoy help the commun rather than take it as a threat .
