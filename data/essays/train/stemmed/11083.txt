i think it 's more import for student to understand idea and concept instead of learn fact . first of all if you want to understand idea and concept you have to do a lot of research . for exampl galileo galilei had do a lot of research befor he understood that the earth is not flat and is instead a ball . it took him about twenti year . for normal student to understand some physic problem , we have to do also a lot of research in our book or on the internet . if you start do research it give you the opportun do think about the idea and learn someth about it . anoth reason whi i think it 's more import to understand idea then fact is , that fact sometim sem realli clear . we know for a fact that adolf hitler kill himself . if you would studi the fact you woul studi onli hi dead . instead if you are studyieng idea and concept , you will learn whi he kill himself and whi he all did thi . for me a fact is someth short wich we do n't have to studi , but an idea or a concept is someth big you need to do some research on . final , if you are learn to understand the idea and concept you can use your studi in live . if you studi the idea how a car is work you can work at a carshop and repair car , but if you onli learnend the fact that car have a motor you will be not abl to build a car . when you studi to understand idea and concept you learn way more about life , then if you just studi fact . fact do n't give the background were you can ask `` whi '' . a fact is a fact and noth chang about that , but you can discuss about an idea or concept .
