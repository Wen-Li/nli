in my opinion it is better to have a broader knowledg of mani academ subject . in today 's world , no subject can be studi in isol . subject are link to each other . for a good understand of one subject , some amount of knowledg of a relat subject is essenti . for exampl , for studi complex genet engin , a knowledg of comput is requir for studi model . similarli , while studi histori of a particular region at a certain time , it is benefici to know the econom of that area at that time . it would help us better understand the event occur at that time and the reason behind them . thu , as subject are inter-rel we need to have knowledg of mani subject . we also need to understand thing happen around us . thing happen around us are also relat . to understand issu like whi did the iraq war occur , we need to understand polit and histori . to be awar of whi and when tsunami or hurrican occur , we need to know geographi . if we catch cold , then we need to know whi it happen and how we can prevent it . so we need to expand our horizon of knowledg to includ mani subject to increas our awar . doe thi mean that we dont need specialist ? specialist are requir as there are mani area which requir a detail and thorough studi which specialist have done . for research in particular field specialist are requir . in my opinion , the number of subject to be studi should vari accord to the level of educ . primari and secondari educ should focu on a varieti of subject as they are the build block of a student 's knowledg base . higher educ can be focuss at a specif subject . thu , a broad knowledg of numer academ subject is essenti at the primari and secondari level of educ .
