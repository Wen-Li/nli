it is a contradictori statement . first i agre becaus if a student learn idea and concept can take decis . with an idea or concept a student can think about use , aplic or simpli exampl of the topic from where it came . p.e. if you think on a differ equip that you can do with someth cilind ( the idea is the cilind ) , you get aplic of it like you can do a drum , a tunnel , etc . idea and concept can be use to prioriz differ subject and to focu on a princip goal to be sucess , p.e. if you get differ idea of an electr problem that you have on class , like motor no run you can think about solut to solv it and be sucess like check the breaker , test the current befor the motor or some other . sometim is mix the idea and concept get student to fact , and otherwis some fact , let student to get idea and concept . but second i have to disagre becaus when a student get fact and learn from it , thi knowledg let undertand what happen and can chang the behavior of certainli act or activ , p.e. if you know that when you laugh in class disturb the class and the teacher is not feel good with that behavior , and you are go to get your score base on knowledg but also on certain appreci of the teacher , you can modifi it and do not laugh in so the teacher will be feel better with your presenc and will be take it in consider befor put your score . so thi is a contradictori statement becaus for student both thing are import to understand idea and concept in one hand but in the other to learn fact , and apli all of thi can get sucess .
