i dont agre at all that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun . of cours , technolog may distract young peopl and may let them veri occupi , but it is not necessari that they do not give enough time to help their commun . if you look around you and you see the develop project , it is becaus of young peopl and i consid these develop as a help to commun . i think that help is not onli substanci or tactil thing , i mean that you can also help your commun by love them and give them a lot of passion . i am a big exampl to prove that young peopl are help to commun . i am eighteen year old and i am in a medicin colleg . i have alot of subject to studi and a lot of work to do but i work as a volent in an orpahang in my countri everi weekend and everi summer holiday . in addit , i think it is a big help if young poepl help their commun but they do not give enough time for thi help , i mean that ther are at least help . for exampl , my cousin is fond of internet , she is alway set 24 hour on the comput and search on the internet and chat and have a lot of fun , although , she rare do a benefit web site which help peopl in differ field , and becaus she seldom help peopl , i think she is a veri help person . in conclus , the more young peopl give enough time to help commun , the more develop we will reach and in my opinion , everi young person is well to help hi or her commun as much as he or she can .
