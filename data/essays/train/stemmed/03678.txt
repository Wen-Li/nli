i agre with hte statement becaus undrstand idea and concept is alot better and easier than learn fact . becaus of mani reason . first understand the idea make easier to rememb and make memor in their brain . for exampl , when i understand an idea about the `` earth movement '' ican easi rememb it later and explain it to anoth person . the second reason is if someon understand about a subject it will help him later in the futur at work . for exampl , when we were children they tought u at school the basic of math then we understood it then know hoe to deal with big math problem nowaday . the third reason is a lot of subject need to concentr with it and understand it such as chimstri becaus with thi subject you nede to understand the number the word so you ca n't just lesrn the `` fact '' and if you did you make a mess . the fourth reason is , when you have an exam you will write the answer easili becaus you know it and biswad with it and it 's store in your head . on the other hand `` learn fact '' is not to bad becaus some peopl are work with it work with them . but there is alot of problem with it but it can be a temprari situat then you can proceed to the better level wich it `` understand '' . and on of the problem with learn fact that it 's not easi with math , chimstri and physic . so it wo n't help you with these subject , but also work with histori a lot . so there advanteg and disadvanteg with the both . bit if we put them in a scale we will see that the `` understand idea and concept '' is the winner style .
