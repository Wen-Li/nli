i do n't agre with thi statement about the decreas in the use of car in a twenti year period . mayb a differ concept in hi use would be possibl due to new energet sourc or chang in peopl 's way of life , but i 'm sure that car are go to be as need as today . it is true that town hall in big citi are tri to convinc their citizen about how harm to the enviro is everyday massiv traffic . their polit are now tri to be more awar of thi problem , but i do n't think they realli know how to solv it . they have built lane for cyclist but , at least in madrid , use them is realli danger due to the urbanist structur . anoth reason whi i think that car 's user wo n't be reduc in the futur is the way that big citi expand . peopl normal live in the outskirt of the citi and they need to go downtown to work . how can they go to their job ? they can use public transport but that 's not a comfort solut for them . they could spend doubl of the time go that way than go by car . even if peopl concern about the pollut problem and they start use public trasnport or their bike , they will alway need a car in case they want to travel to other citi or visit a rel live in the other side of the town . i 'm talk about what is more comfort and use for them . thi is whi i think that reduc the number of car wo n't be possibl in such a short period . altern energi like hydrogen or solar , should be more investig in order to use them in car engin . thi car would n't harm the atmospher and peopl could use their car without feel guilti .
