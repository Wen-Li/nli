thi statement elucid ani sapient persin who is an avid reader into the nitti gritti of thi topic . i do agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . to buttresss my support i like to quot that young peopl enjoy most of there time by parti and go to beach and so , but when it come to the case of older peopl they ca n't do it they will not be enjoy in beach and also they will not be parti . to further wox on my stand i like to give a pragmat experi from my grandfath . on the other day my grand father told me that he use to enjoy a lot when he wa in hi younger age than he wa now . he use to tell me to enjoy a lot and he told me that the younger age is the age that will not return again enjoy as much as it is possibl . the other experi that my pedagogu told me when he encount dure hi studi is that , he ha done a research work on the style and pattern of the live of old peopl and the young peopl and he told that compar to the old peopl from hi result the young peopl tend to enjoy a lot . on the other side i think it not onli the enjoy that come by parti or so is the onli enjoy , we should also consid the enjoy from the side of a older peopl , they also ha their own enjoy , the older person possibl after their retir they use to sit and they enjoy by listen to the song and also read some book mainli some devot book , which the young peopl most of them are not interest . they also enjoy by have a tour to all the religi place and also they will be satisfi when their children becom a good individu . final i like to conclud , without ani degress from the topic that definit older peopl enjoy but not to the extent that the younger peopl enjoy .
