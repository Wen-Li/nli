some peopl believ that to disminish air pollut there will be some effort to reduc the use of car . so that in twenti year fewer car will be seen in road and citi . as far as i am concern i desagre with them for sever reason . the first reason i do not believ that in the futur there will be less car than today is that in our world and way of life , car are use everyday and have becom necessari object for year , like comput are today . it is true that if you live in a big citi you can avoid to take your car to go to work , becaus there is enough common transport , like subway or buss , but how mani worker use it ? i think that if everybodi take the subway or bu there will be no place at all to breath . in addit it will be not enough buss to transport all the peopl . and then if you live in countrysid there is not often good common transport so you must take your car to go to work or even go to the supermarket . the second one is that today gover all around the world are not agre on thi subject . in fact there is a strongh differ between devolop countri and those who are in develop . the latest need more and more car becaus their economi is increas so there are more and more peopl who come in citi to find job . in contrari , in the usa or in franc for exampl car firm are look for new energi in order to avoid the global warn to increas , but noon seem to think about reduc the number of car . the latest reason but not the least i thing there will not fewer car is to do thi , gover and polit have to make agrrement for that . i mean give more money to citi in order to allow them to built more line of subway , more road specif for bu and built more car park around the citi so that peopl who do not live in the citi can park their car an then take the suibway . to conclud i thing that to decreas the number of car in the world , we have to improv common transport and their access becaus today too much peopl do not have the possibl to take it .
