i defenitli agre that it is more import for student to unterstand the idea and concept they have to learn than just to learn fact . there are differ reason for my opinion and i will point out 3 of them . the first point , i want to mention is that it is easier to learn and rememb thing , when you understand what you learn . for exampl if you studi without understand the idea there is the probabl to fail in an exam becaus you are not abl to reproduc the problem correctli and you can not be good in test about transfer differ inform to a new point of view . so it is not veri use to learn fact by heart , it is more import to get the whole situat . anoth point is that you should be abl to connect difffer inform to understand the whole problem and i think thi abil is not improv by learn singl aspect of a problem . fact can chang but the main idea , for exampl the theori of milton friedman will be true even in ten year . and you will need these theari to understand differ process . my last and most import point is that you learn for life and not for school or univers . that mean that the lectur and text in univers are import and the knowledg which you should aquir are necessari to suc later in your job . univers educ prepar you for your task later in your work life , but if you just learn stupid fact and do not use the offer knowledg , there is a high probabl that you will fail . you must be abl to solv a problem and i do not think that fact and figur will help you at your job . if you need fact in your job , you can use primari and secondari data , for exampl to launch a research , which will get you the fact you need . so all in all i prefer that student should learn complet thori and no singl aspect . on the one hand that is more difficult but on the other hand you will aquir much more timeless knowledg
