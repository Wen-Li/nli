i agre with thi statement becaus i beleiv that tri new thing and take risk are more interest than know how to do well . in my case , sinec i wa ten year old , i have been play tenni , so i practic tenni everi day and sometim compet on the tenni . when i play on the match , i tri to play new thing which is so fantast for me , and usual , when i tri newth , i can win the tounament . in similar to succesu peopl , tri new thing and task risk are connect to success thing : sport player and success businessmem . success sport player are alway tri new thing and take risk . for exampl , roger feder , who is tenni champion in the champion . he alway enjoy the mathc as well as tri new thing , which have high risk . howev , he is not afraid of taki risk , and he hit the ball to the oppon '' weak point . he take energey from tri new newth and take risk , so he would be tenni champion in th world . therfor , i believ that similar to him , sport palyer show that take risk and tri new thing is neccessari key . in addit to success sport player , success businessmen or women are apt to tri new thing and take risk , but sometim , they think that take risk and tri new thing have danger , but we can make a lot of money and fame . also , in today 's societi , which is democraci as well as competiot societi , so they alway demand win . i beleiv that tri new thing and take risk is concern with success peopl . in fact , sport player and businessmen or women show that .
