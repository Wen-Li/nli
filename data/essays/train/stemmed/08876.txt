in my point of view , it is allway good to have knowledg of mani academ subject . when you are base onli in one specif subject you will never be readi to do ani other project that come up . you will onli be readi for thing you know . mani exampl exist on the world of today , peopl onli studi what they want to do in life . so all they are base on is on that materi , but what happen when their futur doesnt turn to be what they had plane ? colleg is the opportun to choos what you realli want to be in the futur . you must know that what you studi is what you are go to have to spend the rest of your life do . sometim thing dont go the way you plan . it is whi we should have knowledg in all academ subject . bee special in one subject ha it advanteg and disadvanteg . bee special on what you think you are go to be good at , it sometim a risk . we are not sure of what is wait for us out there . for exampl : if i choos to studi law , and im good at it but everyth i know is law . so in my futur i dont get a good job , but compani offer me a better job but not as a lawyer as a busi man. i cant take it becaus im not good at it . the advanteg of bee special in one subject is that if im realli good at it i have 90 % of bee the best a t it . that will bring you opportun to have the best job and be well paid . for exampl when you studi medicin . if you are onli base on those subject and graduat with honor . you know for sure you are go to be the best doctor becaus of you knowledg . it it allway good to know mani academ subject but at the same time to be base on what you like to do . that way you are sure that no matter what happen with what you are base on , you will allway have differ choic for the futur .
