i strongli disagre with the idea that it is more import for student to underst idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . there are three below mention reason for the same . first , if a student ha a vagu idea of a contruct plan thi can not be put to action without take fact into consider . for exampl , if a student want to invent a chemic formula or want to experi with chemic to deriv some solut but the fact is that the provid chemistri lab is not have enough facil to do it then it a clear wast of time and hi contruct thought is in vain . secondli , idea are hypothet and fact are real . for exampl , mani year ago peopl use to think that sun revolv round the earth but it just not the fact it vice-versa . if thi wa taught to everyon of us till date then it would have been like beleiv on a concept or an idea but the fact were reavel later . henc , hypothet thing may be total wrong and can not be taught to student but fact are real and should be taught . lastli , import of learn the fact make a student more knowledg and lead him to better acedem perform . for exampl , if one dose n't know whi doe the earth rotat round the sun or whi day-night occur ? he would be consid a dumb and illeter and would not be given ani valu in thi industrialis and compet world . to be a strong competitor we should be strive for knowledg which is base on fact and not idea . understa the fact and bring them into practic with all the knowledg is the key to a bright futur . idea and concept understad is secondari to learn the fact .
