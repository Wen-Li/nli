i disagre with thi topic simpli . becaus i see the young peopl who help their comun veri often . in the cours of develop about human live , mani young peopl do not have enough time to help their commun . actual , compar with the past , it is true mani peopl do n't help other peopl even if they have enough time . but i think that can not be seriou problem of ethic in commun . first , almost all school ha volunt club for commun . and student can learn easili that 's the right way and that 's the good for everyon . for exampl , to help somebodi who is difficult to do someth or clean street . moreov , there are subject for help commun in some special school ( but not realli common anyway ) . that 's whi we can see young peopl who learn about ethic and volunt . even though they not do it too much , i believ that peopl in commun are satisfi with young peopl 's littl help . second , if student will help their commun dure vacat , some school give point for score of semest . unfortun that 's not veri good situat , anyway young peopl should give enough time to help their commun . but in my experi . thi behavior is not realli use . mani student are good volunt but some bad young peopl doe not help their commun realli . becaus they onli want to get the point for semest . besid school can not observ them complet , they do n't do their best . fortun that bad young peopl are not mani so we can see the young peopl who help their commun by thi second way . as a result , there are mani young peopl who learn what is realli good and what is realli bad . and they do their best to help their commun by mani way . that 's whi i 'm sure our societi is happi becaus of young peopl .
