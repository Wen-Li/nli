idea , concept and fact are relat , in a way but differ in mani thing that we must consid . well if we look at idea and concept it need alot of effort for the student to learn them across the academ year it nead frome the student to understand the idea and creat a creativ one . concept somtim need to be expain , anal , use and memor . what i am tri to reach is that it need alot of effort , help and time . lean fact can be fun and interest . for inctas we can know also fact from our experi in life , infact they are easi to know and learn , becous there are mani sourc that we can learn fact from not onli frombook but also from program in tv , internet , and also comic . what i think is that it is import for the student to understand idea and concept becous they are difficalt to lean by them selv while fact are easier to find , explor and understand . anoth thing is that the school will make it easier to learn idea and concept , becous they are provid with capabl teacher and compet student to learn whith . fact also must be understood by the student , but it is veri easi to learn , so thi is my opinion and my idea about it but at the end there must be fact iclud in the criculam , but not as much as the idea and concept .
