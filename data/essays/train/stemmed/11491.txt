some peopl may think that the older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do . howev in my opinion , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus most of young peopl have a motiv to live and meet variou peopl and hang out with them make life more pleasant . young peopl have a dream . i believ that it is realli great to have a goal in our life . young peopl 's dream are all differ becaus of their fasin desir such as ideal entertain , parent , sportsmen , doctor , and artist . without thi dream , young peopl may live like a ` dead collaps ' . for exampl , my friend long to be a famou singer . therefor she practic her sing for more than 7 hour per day . she doe not want to give up her dream becaus she love to spend her time to sing . she said when she practic the sing she feel like she is heaven . i do not think that older peopl do not have a goal ani more becaus they alreadi achiev it and their rapid life will make them to live in boredom . by meet new peopl give young peopl an enjoy life . everyday we approach new peopl . it is realli fun to meet them who have all differ characterist , and appear . when we meet someon who can reliabl and want to be a companion to our live then we call it `` pursuit of happi '' . for instantc , when i hang out with all my friend , i forget depress and lost stress . some time we spent our time to watch movi , and chill about our daili live . even though we feel irrit becaus of our consist bore life , it will be fine if we have a true friend . at thi time , i think i am not afraid of anyth becaus alway my friend be on my side . in my conclus , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus we have a dream where we can motiv ourselv , and hang out with friend more often without ani worri . i am realli happi to be part of young peopl ! .
