i do n't complet agre with the statement for differ reason . of cours it is import for student to understand concept , and not onli to understand them , but also to keep them clearli in mind and make them be a huge part of their knowledg . but on the other hand , i also think that learn fact ha it import : in fact , most of the time a student is not even abl to understand a concept through if he doesn ' t know anyth real relat to that idea . i mean , it is import to have a knowledg of what had happen in histori , it is part of one 's cultur and will be use in one 's privat and work life , i think . know idea and concept in astract ha it relev , of cours , but is not enough : usual you ca n't understand the think of import peopl and philosoph of the past , if you do n't have ani idea about the period they live in or the fact that occur in their live . i reckon that student have to learn fact , even if it is bore : most of the time teacher are awar that student are not realli interest in them , and that they would rather be thaught someth more excit . nevertheless , student understand how import it is for them to learn fact when they grow up , becaus they will know what to say in everi situat and to everi kind of peopl they will speak to . with my statement , i 'm not tri to say that understand idea and concept is n't import : not at all ! i am onli say that both way should be use with student becaus they have quit the same import , in differ way . it also depend on the kind of student a teacher is teach to : mayb someon prefer one way while anoth prefer the other one : they are both good way of learn , i guess , and should both be use to build one 's mind .
