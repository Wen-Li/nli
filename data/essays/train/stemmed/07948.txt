are young peopl happier than older one ? i think that thi statement is the sad realiti . we 'll quickli see the argument on the paper firstli , young peopl have much more occas to make new friend than old peopl . if you go out everi week , if you 're invit at your friend ' place twice a week , your chanc to meet new peopl are amazingli high . the truth is that you onli can and want to have thi kind of life when you 're rel young besid as a young personn you are not as involv in your famili life as your parent might be . you can spend the time you want with the peopl you realli care about without think about the duti you need to do back home . studi abroad is an opportun you ca n't miss . with the increas of link between the earth nation it ha becam easier to studi abroad than befor . as a result , today student have much more chanc to go in a foreign countri than their parent had . proof of thi point the increas student demand for the erasmu program and the strong relationship that univers maintain togeth . last but not least , old peopl have to work and secur an incom to make sure that their famili could live safe . it 's not the case when deal with young peopl that can do whatev they want as long as they are good at school at the end . a young guy can relax as much as he want . he even can leav school if he doe n't like it . an adult can not afford it . he can not chill out becaus someon is count on him : the young personn . to conclud , i would like to say that we mu n't be blind , there are too mani argument in favour of the point support in the paper and so few for the opposit point that the answer should be obviou . life is better when you are young .
