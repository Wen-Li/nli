in my person opinion it veri import to understand idea and concept . nevertheless fact are the basi to realli understand idea and concept . so learn fact and understand is close connect to each other . you ca n't understand for exampl polit system in countri , without know some of their histori . whi the british have an constituit monarchi and german have a feder democrazi . the reason for thi lie in their histori , and you can learn histori onli through record from the past , which would be fact ( if the sourc is reliabl of cours ) . thi is also true for mani other area from sport to scienc . if you do n't know the rule ( which are fact ) of footbal you will never be abl to get the concept of the sport . if you do n't know number it will be difficult to becom a math genius and so on . .. of cours there are some area where not mani fact or knowledg exist or still mani thing are unknown . in thi area like for exampl in biolog and astrolog you have to formul and develop fact through observ and experi . thi is natur way harder than the normal approach to understand idea and concept with the help of knowledg ( fact ) . but thi peopl also had to start with fact until they come to the point where there are no real fact are left , so that they can go on from there . so my statement is that in gener you just can not say that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact , becaus thi are intertwin . besid some few except in area where you have still to explor a lot of fact . by the way . a special except is of cours religion . sinc fact are often threaten religion . that 's whi from a religi point of view it would better not to spend too much time on fact and just go with the concept and idea of the religion , be it christian or someth els .
