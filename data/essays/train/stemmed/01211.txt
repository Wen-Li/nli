i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . they want to live life fulli to the end and enjoy it . i have good reason to support thi idea . first of all , young peopl have more enthusiasm to tri new thing and enjoy them . for exampl , if you have ask a 20 year old colleg kid if he want to do raft , he would go for it . howev , if you have ask the same question to a 50 year old man , he would probabl say that he is too old to tri it . so , thi is the first reason whi i believ that younger peopl enjoy life more . secondli , young peopl are more spontena . for exampl , if a friend have call and ask to go out for dinner in half an hour , a young person would say `` ok , i 'll see you there in half an hour '' , but an older person would stay home with the famili becaus they have respons . thu , young person would have fun and enjoy the dinner . also , i believ that as peopl get older , they becom less energet which keep them away from enjoy life . for exampl , my grandmoth is 75 year old and i can never take her out to do shop which i enjoy a lot . she find it veri exhaust and prefer to stay home by herself . then , she think about my grandfath who pass away 10 year ago and get depress . thi is anoth reason whi older peopl can not enjoy life as much as young peopl . final , the friend have great impact . when you are 20 year old , you would have friend around your age , almost the same matur . even if you were a bore person , they would push you to enjoy the life and have fun . howev , when you get older , you can not have the same realtionship with the friend . in conclus , i believ that younger peopl enjoy life more than the older one . i believ that everyth is possibl and easier to do when you are young . so , we should not postpon anyth for later .
