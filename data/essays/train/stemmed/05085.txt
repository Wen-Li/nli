on one hand , mani peopl feel that the advertis creat an awar about the product and product 's featur , while on the other hand mani peopl feel that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i also agre that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . due to increas compet in thi world , all the produc of a particular product want to make a claim that their product is the best . for exampl , in the cola market , both pepsi and coke claim that their product is the best and contain all the featur to make a person happi . while advertis their own product they also go ahead to criticis the other product . but the choic of each person vari for a particular kind of product , so i feel that the claim that their product is the best , is over advertis . anoth exampl i would like to mention here is about the soap product . mani soap produc show in their advertis that due to the usag of their product , a person is look veri young and it is veri difficult to guess that person 's age etc . while make thi claim they total ignor other factor that contribut to thi appear . a person can not look young by just use a particular soap . to look young , the person ha to eat nutriti food , should exercis regularli and should not have much tension . it may depend on lot of other factor too . but these advertis total ignor all these factor . so i feel that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are due to increas competiton and desir to succeed in the market . due to thi compet , while advertis the advertis ignor lot of other factor which contribut to the desir result in the audienc .
