i have a opposit opinion to the idea that after twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i have three main reason for my opinion . first , car are convini than other vehicl such as airplan and bike . it is true that airplan could travel faster than car but it is not a vehicl that everyon could easili oper . in addit , i think more peopl are go to use car replac bike . for exampl , when i wa in hurri to school , i had to ride my bike sinc i did not have a car . it took me long time and i wa late , so i have alway hope to have a car sinc then . other exampl is that when i took a train to go to the concert hall in suburb area , becaus it wa rush hour , i had to be in overcrowd train . i did not feel good be smash with lot of peopl . furthermo , i had to walk to that concert from the train station becaus there were not ani public transport near that concert hall . thi experi made me think that car are more confort and conveni than ani other transport . second , new technolog have made car improv . some peopl argu that car pollut air . howev , sinc the technolog have developl electron car , it will not be bad for the environ . for exampl . i went to one town in switzerland , where onli electron car were allow . not onli car but public buse and train were run by electr . not until i found the electron car did i think that car are not go to give bad effect in environ . final , the price of the car will certainli go done . it is much cheaper to buy a car than in the past . thi mean that it would be easier for peopl to purchas a car . for exampl , if the car price goe down , peopl in develop countri would be abl to buy car . becaus the climat is bad in most of those countri , peopl would be happi to ride on a car rather than to walk on hot dessert . for the reason abov , i am convinc that more peopl are go to use car in twenti year .
