i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid becaus group tour impos a lot limit that one may not like . first , if i travel on my own , i can set my travel durat accord to my schedul and conveni . when i travel with a group , i can onli spend a certain amount of time in certain locat . if i travel on alon , i can choos to stay longer at some of my favorit spot . also , i can enjoy my own daili schedul instead of compli with a group tour schedul . in most group tour , you will have to get up earli and stay up late so that you can get to as mani place as possibl . second , i will do more research to learn about the place which i will visit . thi will help me to learn the geograph locat , climat , histori , and cultur of thi place . when i just listen to the tour guid , i tend to forget most of the inform but if i do research on my own , i will retain and rememb them in the futur . the place that i visit will be more memor . thirdli , econom , i will be abl to find econom transport option , accommod and even in din choic . nowaday , mani can use airlin reward to fli free or use hotel accumul point to stay free or stay for a discount . thi will sure help to save a larg sum of money . also , if i travel alon , i have the freedom to choos the hotel set and locat that suit my need . in term of din , i can enjoy eat at my time and at place that i prefer . food choic is a person one . i can sure be more adventur if i can have my own choic . all in all , i think that travel on my own will give me more freedom to explor in mani aspect than when i travel with a group . afteral when i travel , i want to be in a relax mode and be of myself instead of be in a crowd most of the day .
