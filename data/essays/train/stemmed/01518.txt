i think the most advertis are made to look the product much better than they realli are . they make the ad or tv commerci intension attract the custom by emphas a certain po of product . typic exampl is , i think , an advertis of car . one commerci that i felt like i miss the po wa the one ; a man at the groccari casher look at what he wa go to buy and what the other man is go to . he got vegit and a pack of big in tofu in hi cart and the other man ha huge bulk of beef . after that he rush into a car dealer and buy a big car . an impress that i had from thi tv commerci is , `` get a big car , get your digniti . '' but the car eat ga like a monster . in these day , especial after the midle-east crisi , the ga effici is one of the most import element when you choos which car you perchas . more peopl concern about effici much more they use to befor . i believ that the car compani ought to forcu on what the era requir them to make and respond what poepl need . the ad doe n't show anyth like that but encourag peopl to revers the flow of the current . we , comsum need to be smart enough to read what they show and what they hide behind the advertis .
