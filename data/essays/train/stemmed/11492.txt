in gener , to be success , mani peopl take risk . but in my point of veiw , it is better to do what one realli know to becom success for two main reason . low percentag of fail , and a better chanc of develop the thing that one realli know well about . first of all , if one take a risk on do someth , there is a high percentag of fail it . by contrast , if you know what you are do and work on it by research and get new imform about it , although you might fail , it is more like to succeed than do what you do n't know by take risk . second , if you do someth that you have no idea what it is about , there is a low chanc of be success . but a person who know the subject that he or she is deal with could use the knowledg they have to develop the old one they alreadi know about to a better one . for exampl , when i was11 , my scienc teacher at school told me to do an experi about electr . at that time , i had know idea what it wa about and had a lot of difficulti even choos a topic for my experi . i eventu did poorli on the experi . but in the experi i did next year wa success becaus i knew about the subject that i had to do a project with . in conclus , rather than take risk , it is better to do thing that you know about to increas the percentag of be success and have a better chanc to develop a new thing and becom success in life .
