in gener , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . howev , i am not convinc that it is not neccessari to learn fact also . on one hand , it is veri import for student to understand the basic idea of differ phenomenon . with thi it will be much easier to learn new thing and solv problem much more effect . the need fact one can review later in a lot of book . on the other hand , for solv a problem one will need alway a lot of fact and while work in a compani , one will be alway under time pressur . therefor an employe with a lack of alreadi known solut , will need much more time for solv a given problem , while spend time in read book . moreov it is possibl that he will find an alreadi known answer for the task . for exampl , when one have to invent someth new , the first point is alway a patent research . mostli one will find a alreadi known proper solut . as a scientif assist at the faculti of mechan engin i met mani time problem while research on a specif topic . my experi are , that in 98 percent i can solv these problem onli with the actual state of the art and onli in 2 percent i need to invent someth new . moreov i wrote a lot of exam in which i had known all basic , but , i wa not abl to calcul a give machin , as i had not known specif fact . accord to thi , i am advis the student in my class of thermodynam to have an care look to the differ process given as an exampl in the book . when they will write the examen at the end of the semest , it is possibl that one of thi process have to been calcul .
