in my countri , the educ system both teach you to understand idea and concept and to learn fact . these two concept have their own advantag . howev , i believ it is more import to understand idea and concept . that is whi i agre with the statement . first , l think that learn fact is not a clever method to follow becaus it doe not lead to creat intelectu stimul . inde , even if i agre to say that it could be a nice way to strike student by give funni or odd exampl , the thing is that you can not simpli rememb all the fact you are suppos to learn . for exampl , dure my histori class in colleg , i had to rememb long list of event and fact without connect between them . thi wa so dens and unclev that i did not rememb half of them ! on the contrari , understand idea and concept is more use . first , by understand them you will be abl to implement them in the futur , contrari to the fact or event which you can not obvious re creat . second , school is suppos to prepar you for your profession life . so if you understand the idea and concept , you will understand how doe it work and will be abl to deal effici with challeng . for instanc , i attend some econom cours . thank to my understnad of some key concept , i now better understand how doe the world work , and especi the polit system . thu , becaus student are suppos to face the profession life with the most numer key possibl in order to deal with it success , i strongli think that understand idea and concept is more import than simpli learn by heart fact and event .
