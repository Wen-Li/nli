when the condit of the today 's academ and busi environ are consid , it is a better idea to special in one specif subject than tri to get piec of knowledg in mani subject . in the veri begin of the evolut of scienc , mani scientist use to deal with a varieti of area . for exampl , the ancient greek scientist were both mathmetician and philosoph at the same time . it wa true at that time when the condit of the agricultur societi wa taken into account . there were veri few peopl interest in scienc and they use to deal with mani subject at the same time . howev , mani sever branch of scienc are form in histori with an effort to special in differ topic . the today 's world necessis thi progress . for exampl , as the comput tecnholog improv , differ sort of specialist began to emerg in thi area . in my opinion , special in one subject give you the chanc to focu on thi topic . for instanc , you may have some knowledg about the hardwar of comput , some about program but you can not deal with a problem which envolv a huge knowledg and experi about a specif situat in one subject . if it wa possibl to learn all the thing about mani differ subject , peopl would do that . howev , a life of a human be is not enough for thi . favor of studi in mani differ academ subject argu that it may give you the possibl conduct a research with differ aspect of it . although these statement is partial correct , my suggest would be conduct the same research with mani specialist in differ subject . i believ that the second way would give better result take the each individu own special into account .
