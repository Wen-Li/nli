although some peopl said that success peopl are creativ and more challegebl than other , i disagre with thi view point . i believ that success peopl do thing what they alreadi know how to do well . first , most success peopl do one thing that they can do well . for exampl , well-known pianist practic so mani time that they can carri out well . eventu , they becom more skill and it make them famou and success in their field . second , when peopl concentr one field which they have alreadi known , they can keep think about a specif subject or think about new idea , which is challgebl to common belief . for instanc , psycholog professor , alex sandra , challg to common belief which drug lead to addict itself . he kept focus on hi research in psycholog field . final , do one thing can make peopl to save their time ; therefor , it make a high possibilti to becom well-known person in their field . on the other hand , a person who chang their field often to do new thing might wast their time . they do not have enough time to studi or concentr their subeject well . in short , do one thing which they alreadi know how to do well make peopl sucess than a person who tri to do new thing .
