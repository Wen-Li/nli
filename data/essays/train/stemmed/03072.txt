in my life i met a differ peopl . some of these have a variuo knowledg about mani mani topic and they have their opinion on someth . other of these know veri well a subject onli . in my opinion is veri import have a knowledg on mani topic and is not good know a topic onli and can talk about the same topic onli . i would be like a first type of peopl , becaus know everyth make a gener view of the world and of what happen in the world . then knowledg open your mind and take to be a more pleasur person . one time i met a man who know everyth . he is a veri like person , becaus with him can speak on all and can argu on all . he ha a hi opinion alway and on everith . then i learn someth by him , he know more then other alway , and he have an explan on all what you ask him alway . he is a veri interest person thank for hi huge knowledg . on thi exampl my opinion is better on peopl who have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than peopl to special in one specif subject . for thi i would be like man who i had a descript befor . in final , there are mani differ peopl , these can be put in two categori . in the first one there are a peopl that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . instead , in the second one there are a peopl that special in one specif subject . in base on the exampl that i report and in base on my experi i agre with the statement , or rather i have mani consider on the peopl that know mani thing and for thi they have a their opinion on everyth . it is a veri good thing . i hope that i will learn mani thing to know someth on
