the issu in hand is that , whether the number of car in use will reduc in twenti year . thi issu is import becaus a mean of transport is veri crucial in thi busi world . the believ that , the use of car will not reduc in the next twenti year becaus car is the best way of commun in the present centuri . i think thi opinion of mine is better becaus travel from certain distanc in car is veri comfort . thi is becaus mani peopl travel in bu as they feel it is more cheaper . but the buse now-a-day are so crowd that it is veri difficult for a person to even stand in the bu properli . their transport becom veri tire and thi is the one best reason i feel car should increas in number in the near futur . addit , i feel that travel in car reach us to the destin on time . for exampl , there wa one of my friend who would travel in train from hi part-tim job to hi campu . dure winter , due to some problem , the train have been stop and later resum their journey after an hour which made him go late to hi colleg where he had to miss hi one hour exam . base on thi , i feel that if that person woud have travel in car , he would have atleast taken a differ rout which would have made him reach hi destin on time . thirdli , i strongli feel that the price of the car now-a-day are get cheaper than they were earlier . thi will certainli make most of the peopl to have a car of their own . moreov , mani peopl are prefer to travel in car to ani place within their countri as they feel it is much more safer and conveni for them . so , these are all the reason that make me feel that my opinion is the right one . in conclus , i would final like to say that the number of car in use will not reduc in twenti year , but rather they would increas in number . i believ thi becaus car are the most effect way of transport in thi present world and it is veri much import for everi famili to own an individu car .
