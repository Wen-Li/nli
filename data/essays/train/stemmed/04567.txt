i could imagin that thi statement might becom true . sever reason lead me to thi conclus . first , in the futur job in agricultur will be replac by more technolog . as a consequ the peopl will move into town . there are tram , subway and buse , so a car is no longer need . second , in futur time will be ( hope ) more conserv . peopl will tri to reduc emiss , so they will share buse and will use train . i could imagin that global will contribut to a reduct of car , too . a better connect of citi , countri and contin will be neccessari . more flight , for exampl , will exist . becaus i live in germani , let 's look at my countri . if i live in berlin and have to work in munich , i have the choic to go by train , plane or car . the advantag of the car is that there is no specif time when i have to start from berlin , i can decid on my own . today , the plane and the train have fix time of departur . the disadvantag of the car is the long travel time . but imagin , in the futur more and more peopl have to travel between berlin and munich becaus of the global . much more train and plane will be . then there will no longer be the question `` will i go by plane/train or by car ? '' becaus it simpli take too long . as you can see , here the car is replac , too . anoth reason for fewer car might be a rais of work time . in the futur peopl propabl have to work more than today , so they will have less leisur time . a a result they will have less time to drive out of the citi to see the natur , for exampl . a car is not neccessari ani more , becaus in town they will , as alreadi mention , have train and buse . in conclus i can say that i can imagin veri well that there will be fewer car in use in futur and i realli do hope so becaus then there would be less emiss which contibut to the deplet of the ozon layer .
