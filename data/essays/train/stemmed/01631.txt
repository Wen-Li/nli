some of the peopl prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , and some not . i think it is better to get broad knowledg from mani academ subject . if my countri allow thi way , i believ i use to select thi method but unfortun i could n't . one of the adventag of thi way is that it is not easi to forecat the abil of the student in the begin of the univers . i think in my countri most of the univers student do not like their subject . becaus our univers select system doe not reflect the student abil . all peopl who graduat from colleg should attend to an exam . after get the score from thi exam they should fill a form about the section and univers and they should sequenc these choic from the highest score of preview year to lower . at the end they start one of them or tri to get enough score in the follow year . if these student get ani chanc to select more than one univers or section i think it will increas the rate of pleasur of student about their section . the other reason for my choic about after graduat . dure univers year , student can not imagin their rest of life certainli . becaus in my countri the relat between univers and industri is veri weak . so student can not get inform about their job dure lesson . after graduat most of the student could n't make their dream work . thi caus unsatisfi peopl and unhappi famili . but if they could get ani second subject they can select one of them after start to work and get real inform about their bussi life . i am an engin and i do not like make engin . fortunetli after start to job i promot to manag and i find out my dream work . i believ i creat by god for manag and i like veri much to manag the peopl . final i can say that to creat more happi public ' gover should chang the rule and allow to peopl have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
