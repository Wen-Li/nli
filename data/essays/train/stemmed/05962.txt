commun is where the peopl thrive and learn the lesson of social life . serv the commun is one of the way you can pay back . we live in a global villag which ha no boundari and it would be short sight of us to just consid our own commun . to start with i would like to disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are quit a number of reason for the same . when a commun face a problem then all peopl associ come forward to solv the problem . young peopl are as much a part of the commun as anyon els . and if they do n't help their commun then it them who will have to suffer along . for an instanc the student at iit powai , mumbai clean the powai lake which is a fresh water bodi and one of the major sourc of drink water in mumbai . no one forc them to do thi but they made wave when they undertook thi task and mani organ came forward to help with equip and fund . then again there are other way in which one can help . like for an instanc blood donat campaign and donat of cloth and necessari item for the needi . we at our compani have regular blood donat campaign and help age group activ . donat are never monitori but still they help . sometim we just give our time , time for the peopl who crave attent like the gener of grandpar . and thi also give a sort of self satisfact and self revel as well . there are also peopl who are join red-cross and other organ to help the needi . the doctor in these mission are also young . i know a famili person who renounc everyth for the good of the down-trodden , and they are not just ani graduat but engin work for mnc . in the end i would like to say that help can be of differ kind , if we are help the world as a whole then we should not be self center to just consid our own place onli . so it is not correct to say that young are not help the commun when they are help the world as a whole .
