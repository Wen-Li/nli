person i am convinc that peopl have to tri new thing and take big risk if they want to be success in our day . i am studi econom and from my lectur and from observ of today \ s economi i know that you can not make much money with someth that alreadi exist . of cours you could just buy someth and resel it for a slightli higher price but the big money can onli be earnt with someth that is brand-new and everybodi want to have . a good exampl that prove thi thesi is bill gate . he invent a complet new program for comput call window and earnt sever billion dollar with it becaus everybodi want to use hi new program and there wa no other program of a similar kind avail . becaus he wa the onli one offer such a program he could sell it for a veri high price and he and hi compani microsoft becam extrem success , admir and wealthi . but in order to find or invent new thing peopl have alway to take risk becaus at the time someon invent a new product there is uncertainti about whether peopl will buy it or not . if the new product doe not sell well , all the time and money the inventor ha spent with think about and produc hi product is lost . if the windows-programm would not have sold well , bill gate would have lost a lot of money instead of earn it . it is easi to see that big opportun are alway connect with big risk and danger . reason for that lie in the fact that in our day the peopl in the western countri almost have everyth they need and alway expect new thing . thi impli that onli these peopl can be success who can offer them new thing .
