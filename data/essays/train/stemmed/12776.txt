in my opinion , and experi , old peopl can enjoy life as much as the younger . i beliv that peopl can be of an old age , but still be ` young of hearth ' as far as i have seen is mostli relat to how the person live hi life and how he think on himself . mani peopl beliv that to enjoy life one ha to be young , the truth is that mani of the peopl that think that way will not enjoy life when they get older becaus of the way they think . as exanpl of thi i could relat about my grandmoth : from what my mother ha told me of her i know she alway fear to be old and tri alway to hide her age and she did all thi becaus in ther mind she wa get too old to and wa afraid of be useless . i have met other peopl like her , and age is not good with them . in the other hand i have my grandfath : he never care much for hi age and alway said he wa as the wine : ` get better with each year ' and is truth , is a sens , sinc even tought he is 5 year older than my grandmoth he is in much more activ and seem younger than her . constantli we have exampl of thi kind of person , peopl that doe amaz thing even at their advanc age amaz all of us , younger peopl , that cant do those thing . i think that also the charact of a person is veri import , some peopl are jovial and carefre and if they keep those trait as they get older they will be abl to enjoy life as much as they did when they were younger . for exampl some peopl say : ` im 55 year old . im too old for those thing ' other will say ` im onli 55 year old . whi ca n't i do that ? ' and if they dont see ani obstacl in their age then it will not be ani obstacl for them and they will enjoy life at it fullest not matter the age they reach .
