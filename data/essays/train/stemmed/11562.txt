nowaday , life is much more fast-pac than in the past : with the long work hour and the mani activ that one singl person carri out , take some time to help out in one 's commun doe seem a rather difficult task . these factor , howev , tend to be overlook when analys whi peopl , in gener , are much less devot to their commun : thi debat usual singl out young peopl as be the most selfish group . one that doe not get involv and where each individu fend for hi own . in my opinion , thi statement is too simplist and i do not agre with it . first of all , although we can not deni that life is now much center around individu goal than on commun valu , volunt in third world countri ha becom a standard way for student to spend their gap year , help out while at the same time gain knowledg of anoth cultur and possibl anoth languag . in a natur catastroph , such as an oil spill that ocur a few year back , i wa a wit to how hundr of univers student willingli took time to make the trip to the site and clean up for a few day , sleep on the floor and with no retribut whatsoev . some of them even gave up their final exam just to be there . further on , in a world where consumist valu are the prime sourc of ident , mani transnat social movement are make the differ , and these are mainli led by young adult who truli feel they should make a differ : we could argu that , therefor , the focu is not ani more on the immedi commun , the one we live in , but a grow concern for the global commun . if we are quick to judg the young 's appar apathi , we can miss out on the mani activ that are carri out all in the name of solidar : we have to look close and see that all the polit , econom and social chang have inde affect the way peopl relat to their commun , but not to it detriment , just to the adapt of thi realtionship in a more complex world .
