i disagre with thi statement that nowaday young propl do not give enough time to help their commun . although there are a lot of news about how redicul young peopl thought like in tv media and newspap , we still can see some warm event arroud our live . in my own countri , taiwan , it is veri hard to see what young propl do nowaday , becaus the polit news and intern relationship with china are fill all of our news program . but in recent event of depos our presid chen , mani univers student use their idea to support thi demonstr instead og use violenc to insist the goveron . some young peopl made confer to discuss the solut of taiwan in the futur , some young peopl made some file to express their think , and some young peopl just becam member of thi event . i rememb see the rescu the peopl in destruct by tunami in the east-south asia in 2004 , there are mani scene that young peopl from variou countri went to refug to help them for live . there is still `` love '' in peopl , especi among young peopl . and we also see a lot of young peopl still concern mani issu of our globe , like pollut , recycl , and anim protect , etc . i think that there are still a amont of young peopl give enough time to realli help their commun , and we do not know thi inform just becaus our media in mani countri doe not care about thi issu . we can say that media are almost hold capit for their onli principl to earn money , so the most attract news almost about sex , violenc , and muder . so we can not just conclud the young peopl nowaday do n't give enough time to help their commun . that is i want to say .
