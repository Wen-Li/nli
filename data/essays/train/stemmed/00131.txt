the issu over have broad knowledg over the specif knowleadg accord to me would depend on the level of educ and gener to specif is the right hierrarchi . if the person is at the undergradul level , it would be wiser and more benefici for hi rest of the life to take a broder knowledg than just in specif feild . for insatnc if s/he ha taken admiss into gener medic scienc then person will get to learn all possibl subject such as paediatr , or neurolog or say ent , then onc he get exposur , he can actual decid in which area he more inclin to , then accordingli s/he can major into ani of the subject . but if he doesnt get exposur to all these how wil s/he decid which is hi aea of interest . person can keep studi or do research in hi rest of life if he is realli make decis of hi area of interest , which is possibl onli after take gener knowleg then specififi to a certain knowledg . just impos studi will never make the person reach the the higest goel . in addit to that if everyon for that matter get chanc to know their area of interest in other word get specif knowledg their feild will be of great help to societi sinc they will be contribut lot in invent thing therebi help to solv the problem which are yeat be dig . follow gener o specif pattern would also mean take or share knowledg from one feild to anoth feild . for exampl if somebodi ha taken few subject in electron and few in audiolog , and later they find that audiolog is thier area in which they want the have indepth knowlwdg . but in that felid implemen principl of electron may lead some new discoveri , which in ani case woul be imposs if person ha knowleadg in onw area onli . bring one field knowlwdg to other feild can make the person more thouht , imagin , and more invent . there are other adavantag too for a person from gener to specif knowleadg , such as he can upgrad hi knowlwdg as and when he feel if he ha gener orient to it . also gener to specif will lead to attend differ class , interact with differ special of professor and make frind with differ area of interest , who may be help in futur if you need ani assisatnc when you are tri to get combin two or more feild and get rid of mani social problem . one exapmpl of thi kind is twchnolog of cochlear implant for hear disabl peopl , it took year for deaf person to speak , socilais like anyoth talk child . thi wa possibl due to implant , which not a just contribut of one feild but knowlwdg shard from eletron , computron , audiologist , surgeon , speech pathologist . if you want to have help from all these differ faculti and realli creat wonder like cochlear implant you must have gener to specif approach in studi .
