there is a well known idea state that young peopl enjoy life better than older peopl do . we are go to show that , in a sens , it is true sinc one can not deni that the craziest thing and most thrill decis we make happen when we are young . then we will proov that older peopl enjoy life as much as younger peopl do , but simpli in a differ way . when we are young , we think about our live as exit , or at least as more attract as the one of older peopl . we travel more ( it is easier for us to travel ) , and experi lot of thing . for instanc , i spent last year in wale , and i think that it would not have been possibl if i had been thirti or forti year old , with a husband , children , and a hous . thi wa a uniqu experi , and i realli enjoy it . my young age enabl me to live it . howev , my firm belief is that older peopl enjoy life as much as we do , but in a differ way . of cours , when peopl get older , they have more and more respons , and it becom harder for them to free themselv , to spare time for their leisur if they are work , and , if they are retir , they probabl do not wish to enjoy life in the same way as young peopl do . they may appreci a great deal to play with their grand children , or enjoy to play card , for instanc . moreov , and in my opimion , old peopl can actual have a definit exit life , and enjoy it entir . by the same token , i know older peopl who travel , cross contin , and appear to lead a life even happier and fuller than young peopl are suppos to do . to conclud , we may say that the statement consid that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do can not be taken for grant . as far as i know , one can be young and lead a rather bore life , as well as one can be retir and lead an exit life . it all depend on each individu 's charact and state of mind . stereotyp rare happen to be true . .. !
