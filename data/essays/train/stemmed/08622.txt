i am agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour gui . well , at my point of view and experi i have had , the cost-benefit of these kind of travel are a 100 % peopl satisfi in all sens , economi , save time , enjoy as much time as they can , etc . the guid plan everi singl detail in order to satisfi custom need and tri alway to prepar inform regard the place where peopl are go , even if is a long or short trip , a guid with hi or her skill will provid with a good plan to cover the most interest thing and place to see dure these day hi best effort will be reflect in tip from peopl . also , veri often a guid provid knowlegd , import date , cer tain histor enrich in detail regard the place you are visit and all of them can complet or expand the travel itself . sometim travel is hard , heavi bore , we do n't have time to go all ther place we want to , a guid can enphat you to realli enjoy what are you see . they plan the whole trip sinc the arriv at the place until come back , they worri for keep you busi and interest in the trip , sinc the morn until night , the disadvantag i can see in these kind of trip , you can not handl your time as you wish , you have to be abl to respond to the schedul and the group need in order to complet with the program , you have to wake up and go to bed on an schedul basi , no matter how tire or bore you are . you have to take breakfast lunch and dinner when schedul tell , and break also . but at the end sure you will enjoy your trip with the group and the guid .
