mani peopl these day have differ way of studi idea or understand them and thi ha becom a great issu in our commun and ha had great argument on thi subject . i person believ that understand the whole idea or the concept is much easier and faster for teh student than tri to learn the fact of the subject for mani reason 's it is easier to gener rather than specifi , student will have easier understand to the subject and will requir less time to understand them , and when a subject is gener it is actual more understand by the student . for exampl let say a class of student are in a histori class wich is talk about the second world war instead of the teacher specifi on on the detail and teh fact of what ha happen and how the war start he basic gener the whole idea and make it easier for the student to understand and they will basic have less time studi the subject caus of the idea given by the teacher instead of the long and complic fact . but even though understand the idea is easier and faster way some time know the fact of a subject can be veri import as well so it is not alway just understand the idea it also know fact about the idea . take the same exampl use abov about world war it easier to just gener and get the idea of how it start but it import to know the fact of whi it start as well . well you see now that there is an advantag in just understand the idea and a disadvantag as well . basic it is much easier for student to gener and understand the idea rather than know the fact , but the fact of that idea might be veri import and useful to them .
