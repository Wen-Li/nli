i agre with thi statement , becaus the main point of a student perspect is to get the princip how thing work , so that the student is abl to understand the idea behind the concept , and can explan whi . that will encourag them to continu develop on that matter . to understand the concept also play an particular role . if you want to analys somethink you need a concept , a kind of roadmap to do it , if you want to creat or develop innov product you also have to follow a determin concept . from my point of view , thi are the keyfactor in get better and creat safeti and better product and that is exactli what you futur imploy requir afterward from you . in comparison with the thesi that it is more import to learn fact , if you learn fact , you can mention think relat to a specif topic , but you are not abl to explain them . in differ case it can be helpful to know fact , but the more impot is to know how you can find the inform , we have a veri good posibl to do that about the greatest inform sourc , the internet . so i come to the conclus that the more import tool is to understand idea and concept , thi can be a great help for further investig and the first step to be innov to creat someth new , if you need fact to that issu , you will be abl to read it in a book
