advertis advertis are veri import field . i agre with the statement said that most advertis make product seem much better than realli are for alot of reason like the advertis is commerci aspect , second reason becaus of money & lastli they want to widespread the product that they advertis . the advertis is a commerci aspect they want more person to buy their product inspit of the qualiti of thi product if it is good or not so sometim u see the advertis in televis or read it in newspap u feel it is so good but when u buy it it appear that it ha n't the same qualiti that u read or see it . morov the compani want to earn as much money as possibl from their product so they advertis it and put alot of budget for it 's advertis becaus they know that if the advertis contain more pictur , color so the peopl will buy it more . final when we use the advertis we expect to spread of it to wide rang area so that all over the countri will see it & hear about it so the product in the advertis appear better than it 's origin wa . but not all the advertis make product appear better than they realli are some of the advertis are true about their product & their product are realli as one day i see an advertis in televis about one type of shampoo i think that it is not realli good but when i bought it and use it i found it much better than the advertis mention . in conclus i think that now aday that the product of advertis is much better than it is realli are not onli becaus the advertis recent becom commerci aspect but also becaus of the money & they want to spread their product but there is some except becaus there is some product appear to be the same as in the advertis wirhout exagur .
