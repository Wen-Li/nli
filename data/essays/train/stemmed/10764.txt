befor i begin to write about my opinion i would like to axplain the statement within help of some exampl . to me idea are the basic structur of behaviour . befor you act you alway have an idea . for exampl if you want to becom a succesful lawyer , you have to have the idea to attend to a law school and graduat with good grade and also you have to be social aliv . i believ that understand ; even know the idea and the concept do n't help us to reach to the fact all the time . sometim whatev we do , wo n't be enough for live the fact . fact are learn by live , not by idea or concept . for exampl imagin that you know what an orang is made of . or let 's say that the thing that we know about orang is - it 's colour , that it 's juici - is it enough for us to tell about it 's tast ? of cours not . our idea about orang ca n't make us think about the orang 's tast . in the end tast is the fact here and the onli way we can reach to that fact is by tast it . i believ that not onli student , but also all peopl can learn the fact by live , not onli know the idea and concept . in the world we are live now , all that matter in the end , is the fact . we need money to surviv = that is a fact . i can earn money by work as a barmaid = that is an idea but what if the idea do n't work ? there are some thing in the world that we ca n't learn them onli by idea and concept . what we need is the one hundr percent fact . fact hurt peopl , fact make peopl happi , fact even kill peopl . anoth exampl , when we steal , the place we belong is jail . that is anoth fact . it ha noth to do with idea and concept . peopl learn from fact and fact make peopl avoid from make mistak again . as i briefli state abov , to me learn fact are more import than understand idea and concept .
