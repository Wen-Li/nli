the abov statement mention that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . in my opinion thi statement is true and valid reason can be given for the same . advertis ha been a mode of commun to the peopl worldwid . these day there are variou way in which a product can be advertis . it can be print , televis , radio station or even websit . print media includ newspap , flier , leaflt , hoard on the road etc . firstli , consid the product wherein there is a huge competet market , for instanc beer . when there are so mani brand avail and when a person is alreadi use to a certain brand what would make him chang that brand ? noth but the way it is advertis . these day we see larg hoard which say that the beer name budlight ha `` no carb and no calori '' . so thi direct the peopl who are calori consciou to drink that beer . we just believ in the advertis and go ahead to buy the product . but doe anyon realli know if thi is true and the other thing even if the beer is not good at tast peopl will drink onli becaus of the way it ha been advertis . secondli , in india there wa a product call `` fair n love '' which is a fair cream and when appli on the skin make a person fair in 21 day . how far can we agre to thi ? even if thi doe not actual happen to all peopl they still want to tri . all the peopl want to appli and see the result and psycolog they feel that there is a chang in them . thirdli , there are certain product which have establish a brand name in the market , so these seller dont need to make their product look more better . to illustr the food chain name `` subway '' ha alreadi creat their brand name so they dont need to advertis thier product in a way which seem to be good wherea the food chain like jack in the box , dairi queen who are make a stand in the market have to advertis in such a way that their product look tempt and can be sold easili . thu , it can be said that advertis is the reason to make a product seem much better . no doubt some product are good in realiti but the other product which can not surviv in competit make their product look like the best one . therefor without advertis no product can be sold or made noticebl to the peopl local or global . advertis form a part or a necces of everi organis but the method use for advertis should be straight and not mislead to the consum .
