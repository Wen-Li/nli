it is my belief that in twenti year there will not be fewer car than there are today . i feel thi way becaus car are too use for us , in fact they support a lot of exig , and i do not think that they will be easili sostitut . one reason i believ thi is becaus , nowaday , public transport can not realiz the need of peopl . moreov the ticket for use public transport are still expens , and thi fact doe not permit to use them all time . for exampl , last week-end i wa in forli , a small town near bolonia . my train arriv at 8 p.m. but i had to wait an hour for the bu that could bring me in the town 's centr . and the bu ticket i paid wa 13 euro ! that is a lot of money for a student like me . anoth reason i think that car will not decreas in the next twenti year , is becaus car are often consid a preciou thing . in fact they not onli give the possibl to move in short time but sometim they are also preciou good . for exampl , i can not avoid to use my car to go to the train station , becaus i would not have the possibl to go there in time . in fact the train station is at 40 minut on foot from my hous , and i would never be in time for the train . in fact i can not get up at 6 o'clock in the morn for catch the train ! instead , one exampl about the fact that sometim car are consid preciou thing could be thi one . two year ago my father bought a blue porsch carrera , and for him thi wa the fullfil of a dream . he realli love it ! everi sunday he drive it , and show it to the rel that have not seen it yet . for all these reason i don ' think that peopl who own thi kind of car will replac them easili , becaus they are consid like jewel . final , as thi essay ha demonstr , car are still too much import for us for be replac , in fact even if oil 's price is higher and higher today , we can not think to sobstitut them with other mean , probabl becaus other mean are not abl to realiz our need .
