`` young peopl nowaday '' , thi is a danger express to start a thesi . it carri a neg tone , a musti `` in my day peopl knew how to behav ... '' flavour , older than ancient greec . it is hard not to disagre with anyth start that way . refer to the statement as such , one ha to differenci . there are a lot of young peopl engag in activ dentriment to societi . thi certainli should chang . and there is never enough time spent in help the commun , most social organis are work at the veri limit of their resourc and bare scratch the surfac of the problem they tri to remedi . but that is true for all age group . furthermor social engag is not consid veri `` cool '' by most young peopl . but there are notabl exept and a lot of sport group , boy scout or christian ( or ani other religion ) youth organis wo n't work without the time and effort devot by teenag and peopl in their earli twenti . so i think the main problem is to recruit more peopl into social engag , regardless of their age . societi ha to chang it 's attitud toward help the commun to achiev thi , not just the young gener . therefor i do not agre with the statement as state abov .
