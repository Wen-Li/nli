i partli agre and disagre with the statement . i agre with it becaus , a student need to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . and i disagre with the statement becaus all the student may not be have same intrest in all the academ subject . a student who ha broad knowledg in the academ subject can perform well in the furtur studi . it is neccesari that upto certain educ period a student must have good knowledg in academ becaus in that way a he/sh can learn more number of subject . . and find hi own interest subject that are essenti for human day to day life . and the disadvantag of make cumpulsori studi of the academ subject are list as follow , in the first case all the student may not cope up with the number of subject in a short period . some of them may be intrest onli in a particular subject , . becaus of thi a student may find an altern for studi all the academ subject and he may also quit from the educ field . and while studi these academ subject he will sure undergo some strain . . becaus of which there will be lot of health problem . so , i disagre with the statement i conclud say that it is no doubt essenti to have a broad knowledg on academ subject but that should be restrict to certain educ period . i.e until a student can decid where hi intrest lie . also special in a particular subject may not be use in all the case . i think both are necessari for a good academ profil . until graduat he/sh must need to have an broad knowledg on academ subject and later in their post graduat he/sh can special in the subject they are intrest in . .
