i am disagre with the statement which it is more imoport for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . first of all , peopl are live in a realist life suround by realist peopl , anim and environ . all the thing happen everyday which we can see and feel are fact but not idea or concept . so if we onli know the the idea about the thing but do not know the fact which actual happen in thi world , it will be difficult for us to live and well understand the world . secondli , to understand the idea and concept is the basic of our life . that 's whi all of us have to go to school in the yung age an d learn all the idea on the textbook . howev , when we learn at the school , we can usual find that sometim the thoeri or law about the thing is not exactli ture in the real life . for exampl , the hook 's law of the object and the consev of the energi theori in the motion of a ball are all correct onli if we condier in an ideal situat , which is no friction and no air resisit . howev these are not ture in the real life . we live in a world which ha friction almost everywher . so when the scientisit build up the airplan or other machin , they have to obey the fact which occur in the realist situat but not the idea in the book . if they do not consid about the friction and air resist , the result will come out badli . anoth reason whi i think to learn fact is more import becaus learn is more use and effeci than just understand the concept . to learn the fact is take a deeper step to better understand everyth around us . whi it happen ? how it happen ? by learnig a fact , we can discov mani other interest and use imform and fact which we do not know befor to improv our knowledg level about the world and becom more confid and satisfi with peopl .
