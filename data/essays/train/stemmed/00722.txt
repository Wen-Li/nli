some peopl think that the way to travel in a group led by a tour guid is not good . howev , i fulli agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid for the follow reason . first , travel in a group led by a tour guid is safer than travel alon or without tour guid . for exampl , when i wa a junior at waseda univers , a famou privat univers in tokyo , japan , i join the tour to french for ten day with tanada kota , my best friend at the same class , in 1990 . it wa the first time for me to go to abroad and i could not speak french languag . dure the stay in pari , i caught a bad cold and fever . mr. suzuki , a tour gide , wa a kind man , had a heart of gold , and spoke french nice . mr. suzuki took me to the hospit . thank to mr. suzuki , i could cure my diseas and came back to japan . as the abov experi show that travel in a group led by a tour guid is safer than travel alon or without tour guid . second , travel in a group led by a tour guid is more fun than travel alon or without tour guid . for exampl , when i wa a junior at chuo high school , locat north of tokyo , i join the tour to kyoto , a tradit area in japan , with my friend of the swim club . the tour guid name hitomi wa so humora and beauti ladi . so , we took mani pictur with hitomi . that wa a nice memori for us even today . last sunday , i ran into tomohisa kamimura , a member of that kyoto tour , at the tokyo station . we went to a bar and talk about our memori about ms. hitomi for three hour with a lot of whiski . it wa great night for me . as the abov exampl demonstr , travel in a group led by a tour guid is more conveni than travel alon or without tour guid . in conculus , i definit agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
