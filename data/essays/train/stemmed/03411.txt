car an effic and comfort mode of transport avail to peopl today . i do not believ that in twenti year time , the number of car will reduc . their use is immens and thu it is improb that they will be replac by altern mode of transport . howev , it is quit like that car as we know them today may not be quit so popular twenti year from now . thi could be on account of sever reason . of cours , human need for better and better product will drive invent and car will becom smaller , faster and more effici . howev , the fuel price might also have a major role to play in determin the type of car in exist . with petroleum price go through the roof , it is quit like that the major fuel would shift from be petroleum to electr or some other renew resourc . it may be argu that public transport be cheaper , would becom the prefer mode of transport on account of rise run cost of car . howev , it would not do to underestim human ingenu . i believ that we are innov enough to find new and better way of run our car so that they still remain an attract proposit . also , the popul of the world is increas . also , it is increas most rapidli in develop countri like china and india where the buy power is also simulan increas . with increas popul and buy power , the demand for the number of car would rise . therefor , i think it is veri unlik that the number of car twenti year from now would be fewer than today . there is also the issu of infrastructur requir to run car . mani peopl might argu that with increas number of car , the exist infrastructur of road , highway etc. would becom overload and thu dissuad peopl from buy car . howev , i believ that with the develop world , the issu of infrastrucutr is not major and in the develop world , infrastructur project are just take off . therefor , twenti year from now , the develop countri are go to be much better equip to handl the increas number of car . henc , thi would not be a major issu to car buyer . thu , i believ that all factor indic that the number of car is go to see a steadi increas . therefor , i think that it is quit unlik that the number of car in twenti yera will be fewer than there are today .
