i disagre that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i realli think that the way of energi for car and other characterist will be differ but still there will be car . follow some explan : nowawday , the petrolum is becom more and more expens . the way to obtain petrolum are more costli and sophist to reach certain area in the deep of the ocean or earth . in additon , petrolum can be found in ocean that are lead by extremist countri , which is a caus of conflict or even war in extrem situat . the ga for the car is becom unafford to mani peopl that use the car as a mean of tranport . the research of altern way of energi to substitut the gast is a real need . thi research ha been alreadi start in mani countri and by mani compani , therefor car that use solar energi or other type of energi alreadi exist . today , the cost of these innov car is higher than current car . on the other hand , i beliv that the sooner the ga is not ani more avail or onli avail to veri small part of the popul , the demand of these new innov car will be increas and price will be down make the innov car afford . peopl that ha a car today is use to have one . they use it for real need like go to work , shop , transportat or move from one citi to anoth if there is no other mean of transport . some peopl is so depend to the car that they use a car for ocas where it could be more effect to walk , take the train or the bu . in 20 year time the need will still be there and the car way of energi could be differ . i think that the appear of the car would be also differ accord to the new time : shape , size , materi , safeti complement insid the car .
