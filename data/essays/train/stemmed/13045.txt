while dure primari and secondari school time it is essenti to gain a broad knowledg about mani differ scientif subject , i think after aquir thi basic knowledg on variou subject it is equal vital to concentr further on one specif subject for your further career . i therefor gener disagre with the statement and will explain my opinion in the follow . we live in a world that reflect high level of special in everi work branch you look upon . even a comput expert today for exampl can be classifi in variou way , accord to the branch he work in . he could be a softwar design or a hardwar engin for exampl . so even within an alreadi veri special branch , there are still more subdivis . to keep up with those gener movement of special in the work world , you just have to adapt and special on one subject or you will get left behind . anoth exampl relat to thi i can draw from my own experi - out of my own develop within my academ career . i start studi forest scienc , then after four semest i concentr on zoolog , and after anoth two semest i focus further on entomolog . i think thi wa a natur develop and most student make thi kind of progress . on the contrari , if you do not special in ani kind of area within your studi , it might appear as if you are not interest enough in ani subject . it then seem as if you are not go through ani posit person develop . in my opinion therefor , someon who fail to special himself dure hi studi ha miss an import chanc alreadi to shape hi futur and career . conclud , out of the reason express abov , i disagre with the statement . altough i have to admit that in earli educ a bia should lie on build up a broad knowledg on variou subject , in the major part of the rest of one 's life it is more import to special on one specif area of interest and to increas knowledg on that subject . thi import of special is heavili determin through the fast and innov time we live in , which explor it subject in ever greater detail and is in need of expert for that .
