` everyth that glitter is not gold. ' summar my feel on the subject veri well . thi statement can not be more true in today 's world where advertis make everi thing look so good and glamoru to intic peopl to go and buy them onli to realiz latter that they have been trick and fool . advertis is an art of sell thing or rather present thing to the custom , that is us the poor gullibl peopl , in a way that make them irresist and desirbl , larger than life , so that we will be compel to buy them . they , the advertis stop or rather stoop at noth to do so , at time even reli on littl white lie , it onli after you get the product and tri it that you realiz that it is not all ` gold ' . the best exampl of it is the weight loss product that are there in the market which claim to make you lose weight in matter of day , they also have celebr peopl vouch for the product , it onli after you get them that you realiz how dificult it is to lose weight as those product do not do the wonder trick they claim on you . at time you would realiz after buy those that they contain substanc which are infact harm for your bodi . the other one which particularli infuri me are the clean suppli product which claim that they can remov ani stain from ani surfac without ani effort `` just spray and wipe '' , you buy them get home hope to see all the stain dissappear from your carpet but lo and behold even after half an hour of intens scrub post spray those stain are still mock at you . the other are the product which make you look younger more beauti , restor your hair , teach you new skill in no time . the list of such advertis can just go on and on but i guess they have their reason for do that but wish it wa not at poor custom expens and that they could present thing in their true form . but then would n't the world be perfect hmm . ...
