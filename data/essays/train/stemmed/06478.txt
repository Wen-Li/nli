it is a common prejudic that youth is a prerequisit for joy . even if thi believ is usual not conscious articul by the peopl hold it . as a matter of fact , onli the old can actual answer thi question becaus they have been both - young and old . from an analyt point of view i see no logic reason whi youth should go along with happi . obvious , most of the young peopl are still struggl to get what the elderli have alreadi achiev : a good job , a hous , a wife and so forth . therefor older peopl have a good reason for be more calm and patient . thi could enabl them to see life from a relax point of view . do thi is sure of great help for anyon who want to enjoy life . on the other hand , in case an old person ha not succed in life , thi might make him pessimist . wherea for young peopl there is alway a good chanc that great chang take place in the futur . as they can not reli on thi feel that everyth might improv in the near futur old peopl need to come to term with what they have . so in the end it boil down to the art of be content . ani man or woman who master thi task ( regardless of their age ) is in my opinion abl to truli enjoy life . old peopl have more time to practic and a bigger need to suce . that is way i think that they have an advantag in thi context .
