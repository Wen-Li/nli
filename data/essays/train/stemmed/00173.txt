a major featur in which we , the youth , differ from our predecessor , is in the amount of time we use in order to help our commun , which in some case is none . multipl reason are alleg , some say they lack of time wherea other accept they are to selfish to help other without a vest interest . it is true that nowaday young peopl are alway rush to and fro , sinc due to the competit world we live in , we have realli tight schedul . in addit to thi , if you bear in mind a youth can not afford most of the time to live close to our workplac , you have to count with the commut time . for exampl i leav home at eight o'clock each morn and do n't come back until eleven in the night . sometim it is not onli a matter of time but of upbring . if a person ha n't been taught to be gener , you ca n't expect from him or her to share hi or her time for a certain task , eventhough when he or she understand it would benefit hi or her commun . it is a fact that moral valu are decreas and that a solut ha to be found . i am perfectli awar of how difficult is to handl thi problem , sinc my 15-year-old brother ha plenti of time and although both me and my parent keep constantli encourag him to do someth for other , it ha realli no effect . fortun , there is peopl whose work is mainli focus on provid those type of servic to the commun , but thi should n't deter us from tri to improv ourselv , that 's it , to reschedul or find a bit of time dure the weekend and to bear in mind that the next gener will behav accordingli to what we teach them .
