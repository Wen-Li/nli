some peopl think that lessand less car will be use in the futur , while other beliv that traffic is onli go to get wors with time . even if i would like the first thing to happen , i am not veri optimist about it , and i will now explain the main point that support my answer . first of all , i am afraid that if we take into account the entir world and not onli the develop countri , we can see that in mani region have a car is still a luxuri that not everybodi can afford . but as these place get more and more advanc , car will be introduc as they were in europ and america a long time ago . as an exampl , when i wa travel throgh south america last year , i came across someth that suroris me . even in remot spot along the amazon river , peopl manag to get car or motorcycl , and thi not onli wa a sign of their wealth , but also a mean of live . but the main idea here is that onli five year befor that , there wa not a singl car in that area , and they said that each month the number of car wa increas realli quickli . on the other hand , we could think that in twenti year there will not be enough petrol reserv in the world to keep up with the fast grow in the number of car . nevertheless , i am sure that altern way of power will be develop as soon as the act of obtain and trade with petrol is no longer profit enough . in a word , although i dream with a world with less pollut and traffic jam , i can not deni the fact that , as it wa said in a veri famou movi or play , `` money make the world go round '' . therefor , i am afraid that while have a vehicl help a person to have a better life , no-on will exchang that for a better place to live in .
