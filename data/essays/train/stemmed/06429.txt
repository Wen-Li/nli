i think an old say of `` jack of all and master of none '' , in my opinion doesnot have much stand as time are chang fast and your consid fit in the circl you move when you can comprehend and also contribut . therefor , i agre with the concept of be awar of a lot of disciplin than master either a few or onli one of them . the requir of thi fast pace societi , requir you to be in touch with the latest develop in variou field . the reason that i would like to report relat to my field of work , commun of agricultur innov to the peasant commun . firstli , the situat under which the farmer till their land in the develop countri are full of challeng both natur and man-mad . a knowledg of the latest technolog in remot sens is an essenti pre-requisit if i have to give weather base advisori on the kind of crop to grow and the appropri sow time . thi expertis could also be use in map those area for the farmer which have great potenti for growth . anoth of an import learn area could be the crop survelli techniqu which could be utilis to fore-warn the farmer about the outbreak of crop epidem so that prevent measur are taken and farmer donot lose their hard rais crop and avoid huge annual loss to pest attack . market intellig , is one such field which ha a direct relev to what everi one of us desir for , higher profit . if iam awar of the nation and intern market trend , the same kind of commod may be recommend to the farmer to make avail of the grow market . consum prefer and standard for organ food are to be one of the knowledg area . to summaris and conclud a vari knowledg is alway better than a limit or restricr one . therefor , keep abreast of mani field is highli benifici in my opinion .
