i have travel in mani countri with my friend , and my answer for thi statement is that it is depend on where we travel , and what purpos we travel . almost all of the countri that i have travel is develop europian countri , like franc , england , germani , and itali . becaus there are so mani travel there , it is not big deal to travel there without guid . we can find mani guid book in bookstor , and we also can find mani inform about the place we would go on the internet . about commun problem , i onli could speak japanes and english , but i did not have big problem travel there . there are some merit to have tour guid . they must be the specialist of that place , so that all the place they led us to must be someth import or great . howev , person i prefer to travel onli with my friend becaus i like to go with flow , in differ word , go wherev i want with my feel . i also like to find nice place where that nobodi would come . my main purpos is sightse , neither shop , eat , nor girls-hunt . therefor , for me , it is better not to have guid with me . the problem is when we go to some undevelop countri or danger place , like easten europ , middl east , or south east asia . i have seen one horror movi `` hostl '' , which stori is like three travel came to one old easten europ countri and kidnap , got kill by crimin group . i know the movi is fiction , but it escal my fear of travel those undevelop countri . when we go to undevelop countri , there is a big problem . we can not get a lot of inform about that place . therefor we might step into danger area and be harm without know whi . also , we might caus problem becaus of the countri 's tradit . in that case , i think it is better to ask someon who know about the place a lot to guid us to avoid danger situat .
