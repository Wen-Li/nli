`` each finger is diffrent from the other '' , a say by a well known peot . i would n't disagre and give u a fact that i 'm sure is not right , and defend peopl from my own age by say that they do help their commun . but though , they 're alot of childeren that are particip and help communti , eventhough lot are not but those kid that are should be hounr becaus what they 're do is not a small thin g at all . help other in their age , with lot of pressur is not an easi thing that they can handl , that whi lot of parent do not allow their children in appli for activti or commun . parent are consier about the level of they 're children in studi , and that one of the main reason , whi kid do not cosid peopl problem and tri to help , it becaus they are not thought to love each other at home , they are not tought to love do nice thin for other and help the needi although most od the religon around ofth world consist on help the person that doe not have enough to care of him self , whether it wa someth in the person or it is a need of money , . help commun start with small thing around us , and i'mn that they are alot of kid that are help by small thing that they dont even bother to count vecaus they might think it silli . in conclus i don n't fulli agre with the statment but wish from parent and peopl whom call their self adult to make our younger children and next gener of kid to be cosid and love to other and to know that there no diifer between a wealthi and a poor or a white or black except by heart becaus as we grow our heart split aound our beauti in our face and move .
