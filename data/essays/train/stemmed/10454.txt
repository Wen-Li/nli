with the statement of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , diferenr peopl have defier idea depend on their own person and person experi . and in my view , i most like to agre with the statement . i know it is irrat to assert an point without anlyz , so i 'll get a help of my own experi . last summer holiday , some friend with me have a travel to the beauti coast citi dalian , which locat in the nothereast of china . the reput of dalian is veri good in china , and sure we are all delitli for the chanc of travel to the beauti citi . but thing not alway go on as we wish . as the stranger , we are excit for it fatast landscap while arriv in dalian . for the sake of save money , we have n't hire a guid , and we thought a map could handl . the come thing prove that we are wrong absolut . soon after the excit , the sunset s come , we face the problem of accomod . the summer is the best season for tour in dalian , thu all the room are reserv . at last we onli ask for help from taxi driver , and eventu he sent us to a hotel in suburan , which locat far from the citi center . in the follow day , we are all depress , as a result of without a tour guid , we just paid most of our time from one place to anoth one though the transport in dalian is not terribl . we just search our routin all the time . henc , it is realli a low quantiti travel . in otherwis , if we have the travel with a guid , the situat will be better . first of all , we can easi cope with the accomod and routin . what 's more , onc we have a tour a famou place , we just know it is famou but have no sens of whi it is so prestig . therefor , if i will travel to anoth citi or place i 'm not familar with , i 'll set up accompani with a guid for certain . travel is just like the studi , and the guid is like the teacher , when we have problem we well ask help from teacher , and role of the guid is the same in travel .
