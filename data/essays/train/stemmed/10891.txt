nowaday , some peopl argu that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . for some peopl , we are live in a veri competit world and thi is a natur concequ . in my opinion , thi is done on purpos . first of all , there are lot of type of product on the market and consum have sometim difficulti in find the right one . in these kind of situat advertis play an import role . peopl tend to buy the product which they have seen on televis commerci or print advertis . howev , when peopl buy the product , sometim they see that it is differ from the advertis or it is not as good as the one on televis . inde , compani tri to show their product better than they are , secondli , there is a great competit between compani . some compani know that their product are realli good and they state it on their advertis . on the other hand , some compani are awar of the qualiti of their product and they know that they can onli compet with the good one if they use advertis effici . in other word , if they do not claim that their product are good on an advertis peopl will buy other product . thi mean loos profit for them . furthermor , peopl tend to buy the product which they see on televis . owner of the compani know thi fact and behav accordingli . they tri to use their advertis to make peopl learn their product and buy them . besid , they tri to influenc them by make their product seem much better . in my conclus , most advertis make product seem much better than they are and peopl do it on purpos to sell more product and to gain more profit . i think these are normal result of such a consum base and competit market .
