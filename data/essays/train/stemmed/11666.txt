throughtout my life i have alway tri to do the most to have great mark on all the cours i have ever took and all my experi have show me how import is to underst idea and concept while i am stude . that is whi i agre with the statement . obvious , in an exam you are requir to have some specif knowlegd about the topic , but to have good score and to realli understand the materi it is more import to know how to connect the concept and the idea . the most import is to understand the main point , the main idea . sinc i began my polit scienc univers life i realis that it wa not enough to memor all the polit concep the teacher explain to me . it wa not enough to memor all the intern regim or all the intern agreement the countri had sign . i wa requir to say what the countri gain or lose in sign them and thi agrrement affect them . furthermor , normali those thing that you are just memor after you forget it so memor concept is just a lose of time . onc upon a time , nearli four or five year ago a took an exam on the histori cours . the exam wa about the second war . i alway have been problem with the second war , the border chang appear me so confus so i wa the whole week stude for thi exam . in consequ i took great mark on that cours . but two year after , i took a intern european relat cours and in the final exam i wa requir to explain the second war . what happen then ? i felt the exam becaus i had no dea about that conclict . that happen becaus four year ago i just had memor the concept and the fact without understand them . in conclus , through my experi i have realis that it is more import for student and special for me to understand idea and concept .
