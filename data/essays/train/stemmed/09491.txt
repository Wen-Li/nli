i agre that peopl should have knowledg of mani academ subject , rather than special in one subject . have knowledg of a lot of subject help a person be readi for anyth that come up in hi life . whether it a problem in math , scienc , etc. it help a person over come them with eas . if u special in one subject , for e.g. english , it is hard to solv a solut in math , therefor find it veri hard to co-op with math . while as have a rang of subject , it will be easi to solv . anoth thing is that have a wider knowledg on more subject , open a lot of opertun door for a person . if someon want to be a pilot , he need to know math , physich , and english , but if you are just special in english , well math , and physich will be hard subject to work with . i am not say that special in a subject is a bad thing , but it doe n't give you a lot of oppertun . also have more knowledg on differ subject help a student in colleg co-op with all the subjet that he/sh is do . while as a person special in one subject will find it hard to co-op with the other subject that he/sh are take . special is good when a person ha a vast knowledg on the subject that , he/sh want to special in . in conclus i find that have more knowledg on a verieti of differ subject help the person in real life , and academ purposess . it will reflect on that person as be smart , and be to co-op with mani thing in life .
