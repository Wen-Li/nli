i think that success peopl are often peopl tri a new thing . becaus i think success peopl are peopl who are in action , who are do a lot of thing . and so more you are do , so more you can chang . on the other hand , successful peopl are most intellig , so that they are abl to have good idea and so they tri new thing . so i still agre with the appoint that success peopl tri new thing but i think that success peopl do n't tri everyth . they compar the risk of the new thing with the chanc of it and then they decid if they want to do it . i 'm not sure , if success peopl take more risk than other peopl . of cours , some do . but there are peopl that have take more risk than other and they are veri unsuccess , like hannib with hi eleph . a man who tri a new thing wa henri ford , he start up a busi and paid hi employe 5 dollar a day , that wa a reali high sold . but it work . he wa veri successful . other veri successful men tri someth new and take risk are bill gate or gandhi . i think if you want to be successful you have to tri new thing and to take risk as well . but risk is n't risk . to buy stock at the stock exchang and have n't money on the bank is not the same risk as if i have it . it 's import to make it clear what 's risk and what is realli stupid . i 'm not the person who agre or disagre with such a statement , becaus it 's too unspecif and too common .
