i complet agre with what the statement assert . i believ that nowaday student are more and more concern with their own interest and less preoccupi for their nearbi peopl 's need . student onli want to go out with their friend , amus themselv and have a life without preoccup and respos . on my opinion thi is caus by a societi that is get more and more selfish and becaus parent and gover are permit it . we live in world where peopl want to get their necess fulfil and these one are relat more with person and individu interest than with social interact . person , i think that peopl were more unit befor . they use to help when it wa necessari and they were taught to be attent and co-oper with everybodi . at the present time , student do n't have these moral or ideal and they do not feel that they must help their commun necess . that student nowaday do n't have enough time to carri out thi kind of social labour it is not a reason , becaus student have never had so much time than ever . the problem is that tudent are get more and more interest in play videogam and other activ than help their commun . it also depend on the countri you live . what i mean is that for instanc , student do n't have the same respons and duti in germani than in spain . spaniard do n't have to accomplish ani social labour like help handicap , invalid or aid in govern job like german do . i think everi govern should entic hi student to carri out miscellan labor by make up to them in ani aspect . what i mean is that if student do n't feel the necess or they just do n't feel attract to help their commun the gover should impos them a minimum social work requir .
