let start with the statement `` success peopl are not those whoe differ thing in the same way , but who beliv in do the same thing but in a differ way '' . i strongli feel and support that without take ani risk in life one can not expand hi horizon . he will continu think and plan thing in the same way which make hi task less interest and less challeng and at a point of time it might lead to frustrat , for exampl when someon constantli keep on type the same format 100 time a day it becom bore for him too continu it , instead if he tri out a better font style new colour combin or mayb a better matter to fill up the letter sheet then he is defin tri out someth that make a dull job as writ responc letter , interest . the point is that it ha taken a lot of risk and experiment for mani success peopl to be where they are today . for exampl mr.donald trump whom i idealis myself ha gone through so much and the peopl at the wall street who handl share they have gone through major heartstop risk . one ha to make a geniun bold attempt with hi idea if he think they are worth and put them to a test , you can not learn how to swim without get wet , you have to dive in ! so in conclus i ll like to add that it take a lot of heart and courag to tri out someth new , and noth can be more depress than a failur but it is truli said that failur are the step stone to success so atleast tri it better to learn and gain use knowledg becaus that is the true ident of a success person .
