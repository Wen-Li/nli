which way is better to travel , in a group led by a tour guid or travel without a guid ? i think it depand on where you are travel to . if i will take a trip in a famou citi with sever wel-known garden and lot of special product , i will choos a group led by tour guid . it 's conveni to visit the citi and travel around from garden to garden on the tour bu and the guid will give mani detail on the histori of the garden . and the ticket will be cheaper than if i buy them seper caus those tour guid alway have group discount . i might have to buy some product in some perticular tourist store that the tour guid leed me into , but i might also get into those store and get fool even without a tour guid . do n't laugh at me as that is the reali experi myself in hangzhou . i visit hangzhou 2 month ago all alon . but i took a taxi to longj moutain where the famou villig product green tea locat and bought some tea in high price just like all tourist did in group . as i would did so anyway , whi should n't i join a tour group and travel easili there ? if take trovel to some place like tibet , i will go without a tour guid . the purpos to such place is to experi how is the life of peopl there . you will not realli experi it if you are in a group . the onli way you can get into the local life is to travel with your bag on foot . to live as you are one of the local peopl . how can you realli know the live there when a tour bu is wait for you out of the gate and bunch of your group mate are talk about eveyth the see around you ? there is no a best way to travel , but plan what knid of travel you are make and then you can choos if you need to be in a group led by a tour guid . you can alway travel in a better way .
