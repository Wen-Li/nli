it is difficult to say that whether to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or not . if you ask to me , i prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject for sever reason . accord to me , have wide broad knowledg about sever topic help you to be more social , to compet in bussi environ and to awar yourself in your field of studi . first of all , in my opinion , if you have more knowledg on mani subject then you could easili get friend . you would not have difficulti to talk with a new person . consid that you meet someon who is comput scienc student in a parti and you know someth about satellit . all right ! thi is a great chang to start a convers if you like to talk him or her . secondli , bussi life becom more and more competit today . how much topic do you know is more import than how detail in one topic dou you know nowaday . boss prefer to hire a person who have sever experi on mani topic . if you look at job offer today , you will see a long list of expect knowledg . it depart are exampl to thi situat . although a person is hire to develop depart of it , it is expect from him to know about secur , databas sytem or someth els . in addit to the second reason , i think that if you have broader knowledg , you could easi chang your field of studi . if you dont want to work on databas system , you could work on secur system . thirdli , i you have broad knowledg , you will know where you are and you can test yourself that you exactli want thi field of studi . do you exactli want to studi in art or studi in geolog ? if you know a littl bit knowledg about other file then you feel comfort with your choic . in conclus , my choic about thi topic is to have broad knowledg on mani academ topic .
