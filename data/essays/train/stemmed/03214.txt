my first respons to thi question would be '' ye , i do agre with thi statement . '' and the first explan that come to my mind is that young are less involv in the common problem than befor . the young of today are more selfish , they tri to resolv their problem befor resolv the other ' problem . mayb we can blame educ : parent do not show them the right exampl and they do not know what a real chariti is . more and more , young are onli interest in their pleasur like see their friend , play video game . .. the notion of altruism ha been lost trought gener and the chariti 's action are less and less done . for exampl , they are onli old peopl who are go to the neighboor ' meet to discuss about the problem in the commun . young peopl are not interest in that , and if you ask them whi , they said that they alway have someth better to do . but we can not gener thi fact , becaus some young are still devot to help their commun . some of them spend their free time to help other , by distribu food for exampl , or by clean the beach . .. and some of these young do that becaus they want to feel better , to feel like they are nice and helpful . but i think that the major of the young peopl have too mani thing to do to think of help the commun . nowday , studi are long and complic , and do ask a lot of homework . thi may be whi young do not spend the littl free time they have think of their commun , but think of them and take a break . defend of the commun will say that it is not a reason , and mayb there are right , but i realli think that the preoccup for the commun come when you are older , becaus you must enjoy your yough to feel readi to help other after .
