student need to learn someth that are worth to understand thoroughli base on concept while some other thing are learn base on the experi . so i feel both are import tecniqu to make the student thorough with the subject . the student can learn the topic of their studi by understand the concept complet . for instanc , take the case of a professor teach state that they are 108 element exist in the natur and probabl they are some more unidentifi yet are true . here the student duti is to understand about the natur and charact of the element instead of rais the question about their practic exist . although thi way of learn the thing make the student far from understand but the professor cant help but to teach in hi own style . but in some case the student are made to better understand by draw the pictur . that way the professor can help the student to memor the subject . on the other hand some topic are better understand when they are shown experimentali . for instanc that the case of professor explain the fact of water exist in three form . it is known fact that water exist in ice , water and vapor form . thi can be explain easili . water can be convert into ice below zero degre temperatur that explain the concept of melt point of water . in the same way water heat to 100 degre temperatur so that the phenomenon of evapor is observ . thi explain the boil point of the water . thi form of teach is best for the student to grasp the subject easili . thi visual way of teach make the student to rememb the topic for a long time . to sum up , some topic like explain the unobserv fact need the student to understand the concept thoroughli . while other topic explain base on experi can be thought easili . eventhough the experiment techniqu offer more advantag to student but not alway applic way to teach . so i feel both techniqu should be use to make the student to comprehend better in the subject .
