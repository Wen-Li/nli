when i think of tv commerci , catalog , and advertis in a town , i certain agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . the purpos of advertis is promot the product ' sale . therefor , i think it is a natur sequenc that advertis tri to make prtoduct seem better as much as possibl . therefor , custom should be awar of the natur of advertis and should care examin the product befor purchas . howev , thi natur of advertis ha becom a grow concern today . it ha been for a while sinc catalog shop start , and onlin shop have been significantli increas late . custom can not look close at or touch product befor perchas on catalog and onlin shop . if advertis make product look too much better than they are realli are , custom may regret the purchas when they have the product in their hand . i often see thi situat happen around me . i think it reli on the market strategi and also moral of seller how much better advertis are allow to make product seem . seller definet should provid as detail written inform as possibl other than `` a nice pictur . '' seller also may need to provid the inform that custom often misunderstand about the product . seller who are sincer about their product eventu attain custom ' trust , and becom a winner in the field of product , hope .
