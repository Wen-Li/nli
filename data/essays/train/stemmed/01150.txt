studant must understand idea and concept , on the other hand they must learn fact also . but the question is : what is better for them ??? well as i see , learn fact is more import , becsaus idea and concept depend on the person who give it to us , in anoth word , it may differ from one person to other , so what the reason of understand thi ? on other hand fact , are as it is , in all the world , everytim and everywher . for exampl , '' wome must work in order to help her husband '' somebodi agre , other do n't . well , sombodi say she ha to work becaus she is a human as her husband , so she must work outsid home , not onli her husband . other say , she is a woman if she work outsid mayb somebodi will hit her or even do n't be fair with her becaus she is a ladi . here is an idea the first reason is more powrful than the other , so what we will gain if we studi idea ??? but if we studi fact , such as theori of graviti . in thi case we will improv our knowledg , know what happen in the world and mayb we will take it for a research in order to get a depluma on physic or ani other higher level . if we look everywher in colleg we will notic that almost of the studi is studi fact . also , what is a student ?? student is a person who studi to graduat from a recogn colleg , recogn from all over the world , so how can he studi idea or concept and be recogn ? recogn mean that there is no doubt that he is right , so if he studi a concept , what will happen if he is not on right way ?? he will lose everyth he did for noth . and everybodi ha hi own opinion .
