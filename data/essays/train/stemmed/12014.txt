nowaday we see mani advertis everywher , on televis or in newspap , on radio or in all street of our citi ; furthermor the advertis busi is alway bigger and thi is the reason for the import of spot . i think that a lot of product shown in advertis are wors than they appear . in my opinion there is one mainli reason for thi situat . first of all the purpos of advertis is to get peopl to buy the product , so product tri to show us that their thing are the better on trade . there are mani way to make product much better than they realli are . thank to tecnholog we can make mani chang on a photo or on a imagin in order to show it better , and all of advertis are made in thi way . in addict we see mani advertis in which the product are n't in their natual `` habitat '' ; we must think about water spot : the bottl is alway near a river or at the top of an high mountain to make water seem pure and genuin . i rememb a motorcycl spot in which a man with hi scooter follow a militar airplan in order to convey much power to the motorcycl . .. have you never seen a scooter that can follow an airplan ? in our societi we give much import to movement ; accord to thi situat mani advertis are much moviment ; i think about a machin that trasform himself in a monster and danc exactli like human . in conclus i think that most advertis are wors than they appear becaus of busi scope .
