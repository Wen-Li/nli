in the first place i am the kind of person who like to know about differ theme and academ subject , but i think that is better to concentr in one specif subject becaus you are not go to be abl to have a deep knowledg in mani subject . i believ that is better to concentr your knowledg . some peopl may think that is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject . thi idea could be true but i am sure that less is more . for exampl if you are studi someth realat with the art like graphic design or filmmak . in thous field of studi you have a wide varaieti of subject to studi and learn , but then you have to choos and concentr in one subject or theme . for exampl in filmmak you can choos between differ field of studi like producct design , direct of photographi , edit , screenwrit or direct . even if you have a lot of subject in common then you need to special in one subject . for exampl if you want to be a film director you need to cover and know about differ theme and subject like paint , art , literatur , light . but thi doe n't mean that you need to have a deep knowledg in all those thing . those thing are go to help you to understand about how thing work but i believ that you do n't need to be abl to handl the light for exampl . final i think that life is to short to have broad knowledg in mani thing . i prefer to concentr in the thing i enjoy and know about them
