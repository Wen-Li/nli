in gener , i agre with the statement that understand idea and concept is more import for student than learn fact . to my mind , the idea of school is that student learn for their live . they should not onli learn fact by heart , sinc it is more import that they understand the idea of what they learn . if they can reproduc a whole text with mani fact , but do not realli understand the mean of thi text , what did they learn ? i would say , noth . becaus then the student doe not profit from it . mayb he doe , in an exam for exampl , becaus he can answer the question correctli , when they are superfici . but for hi further life and understand of the world he could not learn anyth . i think , it prepar them for their futur live , when student are taught in a specif way that they understand differ idea and concept . thi should be the object of a school or a similar institut . still , it seem clear to me that the two aspect have to be balanc . fact can also play an import role for understand idea and concept . sometim it might be just unevit for understand a special idea to learn fact about it . the thing is that thi should not be the onli aspect . while lear them , one ha to go beyond the fact . that lead to the better understand . in conclus , i think one ha to do both , learn fact and understand idea and concept , but learnig fact should alway have the final goal , understand someth better by do thi . from my point of view as a student , i can also say that it is not enough to learn fact without get the real mean of it . i think thi is good like that . those guy who onli tri lear by heart fail in school .
