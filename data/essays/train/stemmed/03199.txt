thi statement doe not offer a definit of `` success '' - unless success consist sole of do new thing and take risk regardless of wether or not one succe in these new thing and risk . thi is to be doubt . tri to find out if i can fli make me dare , and probabl a hopit inmat at the least , but not success . therefor , i would have to disgre on a formal level . more importantli though , i would like to challeng thi statement in regard to it mean as well . by not offer a definit of what `` success '' mean , the sentenc is not onli malform , but furthermor appeal to a kind of common sens univers . immanu kant prove that the onli maxim that may be univers imper or truth must be ration applic to ani think be . if we now tri to formul thi statement as a maxim - that is : if you want to be success , you have to tri new thing and take risk - and see if it hold true for ani given ration be - let us say immanu kant - we find that it is fals : immanu kant live in the same citi hi whole life , never chang ani of hi habit ; he posit did not take ani risk regard hi work either : he work an entir decad on hi major book befor publish it , just to be on the safe side . but immanu kant is undoubtedli one , if not the most success philosoph in histori . hi specul on maxim can help us further along in solv the question of success : if a maxim can not be prove univers , it scope need to be smaller . thu , if we enhanc the statement by say that peopl who tri new thing are success if tri new thing is import to them , we end up with an applic maxim . as a conclus , i would like to suggest that a more appropri statement on success peopl would be the follow : success peopl do what is import to them , rather than do what they think they are suppos to do .
