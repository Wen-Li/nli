i agre with quot becaus that they ca n't just onli stay in what they alreadi know they have to tri new stuff just like what alreadi , they should get more experi . anoth reason that i agre with the passag becaus tri new stuff never make you hurt your self but it make you learn lot of thing from these new thing , and mayb . if you success you can tri to conect on your work , it probabl will get you better . thing is for you to find out but is not for them to fid you thi is a veri simpl thing to understand . but some of them think that if they tri new stuff mayb they will probabl lose lot of stuff from what they usual have . thi is whi they dont tri new stuff , becaus they are afraid and they think they will lose everi thing . whi lot of rich peopl are success , becaus they take a chanc to tri what they got and what is new for them , and they are not afraid of it . it realli depend on if you want to give a chanc or not , howev if you doe not tri you still can be success , take a chanc is realli a good optun for you to get new stuff . thi make me think alot on how peopl use what kind of point of view to make what kind of diction . everi one ha a differ point of view and they all think it in a differ , some of them think it in a nagtiv way but some of them dont . thi is realli import point about how they think about tri new thing . when ever the chanc come , you should take a shot to tri , becaus it never hurt you it onli be a better person . chanc is not alway stay besid you , so doe tri new styff . so i think everi one sould at least tri onc .
