there is a common say in the present societi that the modern world is the world belong to the young and as a result young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it is just partli right . when it come to think about the statment deepli , i consid the life of older peol much better , for the simpl reason that onli the life they are lead live up to the discript as peac , joy and hamoni . initi , they are realli live a peac life . in their late period of life , the old no longer shoulder the burden of earn money and fight for surviv . they can choos to get far away from the center of the citi where they have spent most of their life and turn to the contrysid , where air is more fresher , water is much cleaner and sky is blue instead of gray . and they can live with a lot of pet with just a littl invest and be complet fuse into the natur , becaus their life is total without disturb . for exampl , an old man can have a pet like a bird , go to the park for a walk everi morn and spend most of the day with hsi peer friend . anoth equal import point is that their life is quit joy . they use to be prison of work and life , but now they are free and becom the master of life . they can do everyth they wish . therefor , a mass of hobbi devlop and a lot dream creat when they are young can be downright enjoy and fullfil now . take travl all around the world as an exampl , a young man may found time , money and energi -- a mass of problem ---- to do so , while all that will be neglect by an older and just with an reason plan , the dream is that easi to be realiz . what is more , they live in complet happi and harmoni . old peopl get the most profit and enjoy from a big famili becaus the young can not experi the feel of look at their offspr ' growth and share their offsp ' success . if you are still a youth , you will not now how happi an older peopl when he or she receiv a care or bless from hi or her children ---- someth that noth can compar . admittedli , the young do have their advantag . they may have passion , enthusiasim and a mass of energi that the old do not poccess . howev , in view with all the merit of the older peopl 's life , i realli have my envi for their life which is that peac , joy and full of happi and harmoni and as a result , i will no longer be afraid of grow old .
