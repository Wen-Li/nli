i do not agre with thi opinion becaus of these three reason ; expens to have a tour guid , not be abl to commun with local resid , and not be abl to learn take resposobl and the real side of the place . first , it is expens to have a tour guid compar to take a trip on your own or in a group . it is not nessesari to worri about the cost if the person is rich , howev not veri mani peopl would like to speand too much money just on travel becaus it is also import to spend money on souveniour or on the food . therefor it is not nessesari to have a tour guid . second , it is hard to commun with local resid with a tour guid . when take a trip , it is a great opportun to talk to the local resid becaus they may be abl to tell you where good restaur are or nice place where local peopl onli know . also , when travel a foreign countri , it is fun use a foreign languag . if you are travel with a tour guid and he or she alway doe thing for you , you might lose these opportun . third , the tour with a tour gude in a group can be fun with no learn and respons . take trip can be a learn place . you can learn about the peopl , cultur , atomospher , and the languag where you visit . when you are with a tour guid , you will onli listen to the tour guid and your friend in the group , therefor these learn opportun decreas compar to take trip without a tour guid . also you will be depend on the tour gide so that you will not be abl to learn as much as travek alon . let 's travel alon ! you may be scare to travel alon , howev there are so mani thing you can learn by take trip on your own . it is cheap to take trip without a tour guid and fun to get to know the local resid . you will also be abl to learn mani thing by travel alon . again , i do not agre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
