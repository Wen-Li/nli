in my univers student can special or not in one specif subject and i agre with thi freedom which we have . person i think is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . we are live in the era of comput in which everi day we can resolv mani problem whith a `` click '' on our desktop and in which we can find mani specif inform in the world wide web . therfor the knowledg is more next to the peopl than in the last histor period . if a person special in one specif subject , he will to know onli the argument of thi specif subject . therfor thi person ha a limit knowledg respect all argument which occur in the our arena of life . thu i agre with the statement and against a special knowledg . there are also an other reason becaus i agre a wide knowledg and it is that a person with broad knowledg can find work more easi than a person with a specif knowledg beacaus he have much possilib have more field of knowledg . in may opinion is right which peopl do that they wont but is better for all to have a broad knowledg .
