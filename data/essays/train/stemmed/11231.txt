in my opinion , i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . i agre that it is import to learn fact , but if a student end onli learn fact without understand the idea or concept thi will be a mess . firstli , i agre complet with the statement becaus sinc i wa a child i wa educ : first to understand the idea and concept and after learn the fact . howev , although it is import to learn some key fact it is not as import as it is to learn the mean or understand the idea . secondli , i also agre with the statement becaus it remind me while i wa studi medicin and a classmat of mine learn with hi father how to make a `` heart oper '' but without even know the risk involv in the oper . imagin how danger could be for a person to be oper by a student who doe n't understand what he is do . it would be better if he studi , understand the concept/idea and after that he learn how to do it . by contrast , it is also true that some person start learn the fact and after that they manag to understand the idea and the concept . but thi is not the common way , neither the best nor the ideal . i also agre with the statement becaus it is proov that thi is the correct way how to proceed . if they want to know and learn the fact they need first to understand the idea and concept . to conclud , if i wa a teacher and i am in front of the follow statement or with the doubt of how to teach to my student , i would make them first to understand the idea and concept and afterward to learn the fact .
