fact are the core of life . with out fact you can not draw conclus , build a hypothesi , or even dream of a differ cours . you can say that a fact is the basi where idea and concept emerg . let take organ chemistri for exampl . a mighti complex subject that mani student , the one who are dream of medic school , pharmaci school and the like stand hand tie to understand what is a realli easi subejct in it core . onli if you know the fact . to undrestand what that mean you have to know few basic fact about the carbon , the hydrogen , the nitrogen , and the oxygen atom . for exampl the number of bond each must poss in order to be stabl . carbon need four bond , hydrogen need one , nitrogen three , and oxygen two . anoth fact is that each atom will alway search for it stabl state , and chemist call that , the less energi state . know what we know about bond and atom we can explain organ chemistri in a new light . it the strive for the atom that make the molecul we have arround us in the air , the ground the sea and so forth to stay stabl with the least energi possibl . and from that we can introduc the idea of atom orbit and the concept that ha been use by scientist to show how these orbit strive to make the atom stabl and function , in other word surviv . and use the concept of atom orbit we can draw an extend concept for the molecular orbitalsfrom the concept of the molecular orbit we can take it further to understand the way the molecul react with each other to form new molecul and so forth . from the fact you can project hypothes and idea that can be proven right or wrong as time goe on . but there is one thing that you can not chang and that the fact . the water color will stay colorless , the fish will still swim in the sea not the land , and the carbon atom will have four bond till the end of time , and that is a fact .
