doe have knowledg in all type of academ subject is better than be an expert on onli one singl subject ? actual i both agre and disagre about it . becaus both of them ha advantag in some sort of area . a person must alway tri to learn more and more in my opinion . becaus it is a key to success . a person who is abl to speak about everi subject get respect from peopl . becaus by thi he/sh can prove himself to everyon in everi field . for exampl in social life or in bussin . if a person ha an idea and thought about everi argument or debat he is in , he will just keep get respect from peopl . i am not say that a person must be a geniu in everi field . he onli ha to gain some inform to prove that he ha thought to be consid by peopl . if you want to be taken seriou by them you must gain respect and thi is a way for it . but a person who is an expert on what he doe as a job , get respect in onli hi field . but thi is not a disadvantag for the person becaus it is an aim which he should have . for exampl , a plactic surgeon who ha master in hi field , get more patient . the patient who are satisfi by hi work tell hi name to their friend and thi chain will go on and on . by thi , the surgeon will have a good reput . and thi reput he ha will return him by more patient . and the surgeon will be success in hi main aim by work as a surgeon : make money for a live . in my opinion a person must have knowledg in everi area of work , art , academ subject etc. to gain respect in social life . but he/sh must ha to be a master in hi area which he doe as a job if he want to gain respect from commun .
