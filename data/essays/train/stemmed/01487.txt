in recent year , the knowledg of idea and concept have becom increasingli import in school curricula wherea the learn of fact ha decreas in import . at first sight , thi make a lot of sens : the knowledg of idea and concept give peopl the abil to deal with new situat and new fact . with the fast chang in modern life that stem from technic develop but also from econom influenc and chang within a societi or cultur as such , deal with and adjust to new situat and develop becom an import skill to have . especi when fact becom out-dat veri fast . nevertheless , the natur scienc as well as histori depend on the knowledg of fact and so do , mayb to a lesser extent , cultur studi and human in gener . of cours , it can easili be argu that fact can be look up today without ani major difficulti . especi with the increas use of the internet , to actual know fact might seem less and less import . but then again , peopl need fact in their daili work : doctor need to know human anatomi , or the featur of ill to work success . but fact onli make sens when they are embed in a greater context that is provid by the knowledg of concept and idea . a fact is `` useless '' in a sens when it can not be judg adequ in light of an idea . there is no real need for a person to know when a writer wa born or die when he or she can not place the writer `` s work in a greater cultur context or concept . at the same time , there is not much use in know literari concept and idea without know when a certain writer live to connect him or her to those concept . in the end , concept and idea are not everyth , but neither are fact . both depend on each other in mani way . realli , the discuss should not be about rate these two thing in import but find a good way of combin both when teach becaus both skill - the knowledg of fact as well as the knowledg of idea and concept - are close interconnect .
