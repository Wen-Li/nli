i do not agre with the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' while have a knowledg of mani disciplin may increas a person 's know how a great deal , it doe not make him an expert in ani of these field . one might spend so much time learn and yet be abl to acquir limit inform in each of the subject that he studi . for exampl , if i studi zoolog dure my graduat , and then go for a doubl major in intern busi and geolog . i would know a littl about each subject but not enough for me to becom an expert . i would be confus in select a subject for further studi as i would wonder if i know more about intern busi or about geolog . the proverb `` jack of all trade but master of none '' summaris thi situat veri aptli . on the other hand devot all of one 's time to studi one subject will give a person enough knowledg to make him an expert . one will thu understand the subject better and be in a better posit to appli hi knowledg practic . give a similar exampl , if i choos zoolog dure both my graduat and post graduat , i will have learnt more about the subject as well it variou branch like fisheri and etholog that may not be not cover in the graduat cours . after know so much i can do a phd in the same field and that might give me a chanc in the futur to becom a subject expert in the form of either a research scholar or lectur whose opinion is held highli and who know a great deal about hi subject . therefor , i prefer studi one disciplin in order for me to have more knowledg and insight into my subect of choic , better opportun for further studi such as phd and eventu better career option . after all , an institut would prefer an expert to be a part of their team rather than someon who knew a littl bit .
