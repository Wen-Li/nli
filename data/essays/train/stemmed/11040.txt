i believ that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their communit . thi , i believ is caus by the environ we live in . howev , thi is not a problem that is onli limit to the young develop gener . i think that the adult that are live right now are also guilti of thi problem . it is our whole popul that is caus thi problem . by `` our '' i mean to refer to the peopl who live in develop countri and have a high standard of live compar to the develop nation . in war time , we did not have enough food suppli , not enough hous , not enough water , not anyth od ani abundac then the surround fear and death . peopl need to share each other good and had to help each other just to live on . thi what built the sens of commun and whi peopl help each other out . howev , the war time ha pass and there is less who rememb or have live through those condit and the hardship of life . now with some peopl have more money than they actual need there is no strong need of help each other out . most of us also live in small apart , where onli the father , mother and the childrent live . in old time , peopl use to live in big hous that wa occupi by a whole famili , includ the grandmoth , the grand father and even close rel . howev , now we express and treasur and privaci , even to our own rel , just greet them with a christma card . there is no sens of uniti becaus there are no central goal to a nation . we now induc individu and capit where each person protect and flourish in each own way . also becaus of the global age we have now , we are abl to travel , live in wherev we want . so in countri there are mix , race , cultur , and even languag . that disrupt the sens of uniti . so although i fell that young peopl nowday do not give enought time to help other communit , thi is not limit to yoiung peopl and it is not sole their fault . thi is becaus none of us have ani sens of a strong commun in the first place . t
