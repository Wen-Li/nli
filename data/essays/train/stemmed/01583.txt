i feel certain that it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . first of all , i consid have knowledg of variou subject could be a valuabl advantag for gener cultur . i realli think that is import to be polyval and to be interest in differ subject . howev , you should be awar that all inform are not right . consequ you should n't be lost in a ' `` vast ocean of inform '' . furthermor , you are not limit , that mean you are abl to talk with differ person about variou subject wherea a person who is special in one specif subject are not . when you are speak with friend for insanc , you can take part at the convers and express your opinion about the topic sinc you have studi sever point about it . in a nutshel , although be special in one particular subject do seem to offer certain advantag like depthi knowleg , they are outweigh by the advantag of acquir knowleg of sever topic .
