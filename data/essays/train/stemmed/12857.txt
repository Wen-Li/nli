the concept of gain knowledg is an age old process date back to centuri . in those time especi in ancient india , the teacher taught not onli in a particular subject but want the student to have a broader knowledg in more than one subject . thi as those peopl believ to be mainli becaus knowledg is deriv onli to make a better person altogeth . thi is attain by improv the wisdom that a person hold afteer gain the over all broader knowledg . thi wisdom help the person to be a good human be . thi kind of concept is still the main thing that is follow through out the world . in my view i can say that gain a broad knowledg on mani subject is far more import than gain the special knowledg on one particular subject . if ani person ha a broader concept on mani academ subject , then he is sure of appli . for instanc if a person ha master in comput and doesnt know where to use it and what kind of program to be made , then all hi special would be a mere wast of time . quot anoth exampl when a person who is say engin by occup , see a person who is collaps on the road with a breath problem , all that he can do is to call an ambul but if he ha ani kind of knowledg on how to do a first aid to that kind of a person , then nay be he can realli save the life of that die person . thi is the way the knowledg come in handi . you never know when youm need them . anoth illustr that can be given in thi context is that when a person is jobless for quit a long time , then he can go and do a job if he ha a knowledg on other subject too . if a doctor is jobless say after he finish hi internship , then if he ha a knowledg in comput he can find a job in that field . thu have greater knowledg on subject sometim save live or some time earn you money and make your live . so it is alway best to have it fir a better life and a good settlement .
