i agre that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . now aday advertis and media is everi thing to consum . compani pay million in ad . everi year to surviv in the market and competit . it all goe back to the consum , not everi thing u see in the advertis could exactli be the same as u see . or exampl the soup u see boilng in the tv look alway as if it tast good , but u might tri it onc and it might not suit u.thi whi i say it all goe back to the consum . anoth exampl is a laptop which look veri nice in a newspap advertis , but onc see it with ur eye it look smaller than the pictur and not the right qualiti . there are lot of type of advertis . one type is acompani whose look for long term bussi not will to get out of the market easili , so they tri to keep there advertis the closest to realiti as much as possibl . anoth type is a compani that want to sell the product a coupl of time and build the compani on the support they will offer with the product , and these compani need to have nice advertis a littl bit , than realiti so the consum can buy from the first pass . they compani are mainli found in the market and they are meduim run compani . anoth type of compani is a compani who want to sell it product for 1 time and leav with the profit , so thi type of compani ha to pay alot in a veri fansi way of advertis method so the consum can buy onc onli . final what i can say is peopl now a day are more and more educ than old day , so most of the advertis should match up peopl think and they should be the closest to realiti and the best look to consum .
