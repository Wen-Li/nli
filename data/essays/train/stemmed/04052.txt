a lot of peopl will undoubtedli disput thi . in fact , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid . all you have got to do to prove it to yourself is to think for a while about how much excit and interest to travel alon than to travel with a gruop of peopl you that do n't know . it is often suggest that when you travel in a gruop led by a tour guid is easier and cheaper than when you travel by yourself . i do agre upto a certain point with thi , but at the same time money is not the most import issu in thi situat . for me , i alway think about how much fun i 'm go to have , and i believ that money is ment to be spent not to be save . furthermor , when you travel with a group led by a tuor guid you will have to follow a fix schedul . as a result , you will not have a free time to explor thing by yourself , which is the most excit and interest experi that ani one will have when he/sh travel alon . forexampl , last time when i went to itali i had too much fun , and it wa realli good experi when i found my way home after i got lost in rome . i had a nice opportun to know the citi well . final , i would have to say that , if i had anoth chanc to travel , i would travel alon becaus that i will have a good experi and im sure that i will have more fun too .
