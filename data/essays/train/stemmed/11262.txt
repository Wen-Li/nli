if you open a textbook , for exampl a math one use in the past at school , it 's quit easi to notic that each theori and concept is follow by a practic exampl that explain and allow the student to get a better understand of the cite rule . in fact i person think that thi is the way student learn better and easier . a concept on itself without an exampl sometim doe n't have much sens and it can be difficult to memor it . for istanc , there are some subject that have no mean without fact and i believ histori is one of these one . a student ca n't just have the idea of what is `` the second world war '' without know the real histor event concern to it . it would be an empti inform . in my opinion histori can be defin as a fact base subject where the idea or concept are almost irrelev . although what i 've just said it depend much on the kind of subject you are go to studi . some of them strictli requir someth more than the idea , meanwhil for other can be useless becaus it 's alreadi clear by itself . fact such as date , exampl , refer give probabl a hand to the student at first when he approach to studi someth new , onc the student ha understood well i agre with the gener opinion which is that fact are secondari to the idea and they may lose their import and can be forgotten . as a result learn fact is help but it 's not all . even a singl fact doe n't have sens if we do n't understand the reason we are studi it . in summari it 's import to have a balanc between these two kind of learn becaus onli do thi a student can realli reach a high level of knowledg .
