thi question is realli hard to answer , becaus both aspect are importend , a broad knowledg of mani academ subject as well as a deeper understand in one specif subject . howev , in my opinion special is necessari to succeed in your futur carreer . i mean , that is whi we are go to univers ; becom a well educ person in our field of studi . student are attend most cours , that are necessari for their major . is thi not special ? i think it is . furthermor , if we had not such a thing like special , everybodi would be abl to becom a politician or a lawyer or even a doctor . can you imagin that ? i believ that thi would be an awe situat . i want a surgeri to be done by a profession and not somebodi who is also my lawyer or a carpent . i think i made it clear , whi special is necessari for an intact economi . howev , a broad academ knowledg is not necessarili requir , but it would defin be someth one person can take advantag of . for exampl , an engin would be unsuccess to becom self employ , if he ha not attend a certain number of busi or economi class dure hi time at colleg . these class would provid him with the knowledg about econom relat and approach in busi life . fortun , the school system in germani requir that student have to attend a certain number of cours that do not belang to their major . through thi approach , graduat are go to be more flexibl , which would probabl be someth busi are look for , when you tri appli for an occup . in conclus , both aspect are import . but peopl have to be some sort of special to be fulli integr into societi and economi and to find a job . as i point out , who want to have a surgeri done by a non-profession ?
