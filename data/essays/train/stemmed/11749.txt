i agre thi statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . our common sens is not to tri towad risk area . howev , no tri new thing mean no new happen in our live . as i read thi statement , i remind the pastor cho ' stori who establish the full gospel church in seoul . he start samll church in countri side which live mani poor peopl . as hi ministri grew , he move a littl bigger church . hi church number wa around 1000 number . god gave the vision to build a huge church which wa avail to particip in over 20,000 number . he did n't have money as well as huge space to build it at that time . he could n't see ani reason thing to start it . it wa big risk . it might be wors if it influec toward hi church number becaus all elder of church number were not agre with hi opinion . howev , he began it against all environ and condit . so some of church number left from hi church due to risk and the expect of harship for new church . but hi church number becam over 700,000 number becuas the locat the church wa bulit , becam the core of citi of seoul . all so import build such as the build the nation broad cast and goven , were establish there . the other reason is that all most peopl tri to do what he or she knew well . that mean that there are so competit in that area . if he or she is not outstand in that area compar with other , it is rare to get success . let 's think about one exampl . there are a lot of pizzah store in our area . mani of us know how to make it . it is also not much risk for manag compnay becaus it is famillar for each of us . howev , it is easi to make it as well as to be known how to do it .
