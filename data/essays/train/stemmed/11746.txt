car in these day are seen as an almost indispens part of life in alomost all the countri . with the expans of citi around the globe and with the depend of life on comfort and luxuri , the car product rate as well as their buy rate have increas . and i think that thi trend is go to continu . so i disagre with the statement that in twenti year from now there will be fewer car than today . next twenti year are destin to see a sudden and great increas in industril and a massiv and rapid expans of world in term of popul , incom etc . with a increas in net world incom the standard of life of peopl is go to come up which in turn will help boost the car industri as peopl would rather prefer expend on car rather than have discomfort . with the industril growth the avail of time to perform a certain action or say for exampl deliveri of good from one place to anoth or for exampl reach the offic on time and in less time , is gonna decreas so the depend of peopl on faster and more reliabl of mode of transport ( within a citi or countri ) is go to increas which is again go to help give car industri a stimulu . one more reason which can be cite in thi regard is the peopl 's love for high speed and scientif style and desgn car . thi trend will also see an upsurg in the next twenti year with more of the world popul enter the youth age . thi trend will be most common in highli develop coutri where peopl will be abl to afford and maintain these kind of car . also in countri like us where the public mode of transport is not that common and where peopl prefer travel by rather than by train or bu , with the increas in popul the number of car are go to increas . though one of the neg impact of an increas in the number of car would be the effect on enviorn . an increas in the number of car would result in a more pollut enviorn which would further see a rise in enviorn relat diseas such as asthma , cancer etc . it is also probabl go to creat park problem with the explos of world popul and the world space be limt and finit . anoth problem associ with an increas in the number or car is the fuel shortag problem . with the global oil crisi it ha becom constantli difficult to meet the increas in oil demand . but again i dont think that ani of thi is gonna hinder with the use of car in the next twenti year .
