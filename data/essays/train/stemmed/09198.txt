it is difficult to becom an expert in one specif subject without a good knowledg in other differ subject , but it is unproduct and unus toward societi to have a gener knowledg but not the possibl to get a specif role . attend the architectur univers i have realis how mani other disciplin thi subject can refer to , histori , geographi , medicin , astronomi , math , physic , chemistri . .. and mani more . so my profess will be one and well defin , but it will be the result of differ studi . in conlus i disagre with the statement propos , but i disagre even with it opposit , i think the truth is to be found into the middl .
