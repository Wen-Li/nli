i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing instead of do what they alreadi know how to do well . in today 's chang and competit world , peopl who are not will to tri new innov thing will get left behind . i cite the exampl of microsoft corpor as a compani that ha thrive becaus they were will to take risk . they took a contract to develop an oper system for ibm even when they had no product in hand . after sign the contract , they found the appropri piec of softwar call do , and develop it suffici to meet all the contract requr of ibm . if they had not taken that risk , who know where that compani would have been today . they contrinu to take enorm monetari and other risk to develop all their subsequ product , especi ms word , even when other word process product like word perfect were more popular at the time . by show a desir to chang and tri new method , microsoft ha reach the pinnacl of it glori in the pc busi . my person experi in the field of engin ha led me to similar conclus . our compani stay around 60 employe and grew at a 2-3 % growth rate for the 1st 35 year of exist . howev , the advent of anoth ceo chang the fortun of the compani . after about 10 year sinc he took over , we now have about 400 employe and have more than quadrupl our revenu . thi happen becaus the new ceo expand the busi into other area deem riski like telecommun , water resourc and control solut . he even open a `` build '' compon to the origin `` design '' organ , which wa veri riski becaus of mani unknown . the `` build '' compon of the compani prove to be the biggest revenu grosser at the compani . henc , becaus of the two exampl provid abov , i am convinc that most success peopl tri new thing instead of just do thing they alreadi know . they may not alway succeed , but as the say goe , bigger the risk , bigger the benefit .
