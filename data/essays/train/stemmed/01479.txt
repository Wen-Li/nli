i disagre with the statement , `` in twenti year there would be fewer car in use than there are today '' . nowaday , almost all famili in the develop countri have at least one car . they use it for variou reason , such as travel , commut , and they use it even if they are go to near place . car ha been the most popular way for transport . on the other hand , the develop countri are still struggl to get their way of live more comfort . they are tri to develop their techniqu for industri . it is obviou that those peopl live in develop countri desir to get their countri more develop . and when they manag to develop , what would they want to possess ? if i were the poor live in develop countri , i am sure that i would desir to have a nice car , or may be a televis . even if i got rich , and bought a televis for my famili , i would still desir to have a car . on our earth , there are still mani develop countri . the number of car we can count know is still a tip of the iceberg . twenti year later , we would have more develop countri than now . if thi realli happen , the noumber of car would increas . how am i to forse that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year ? howev , there may be an develop in car industri . that may result in a new type of car , but it is onli that . even if car ha develop , i think there would be no chang in our express . we would call our new type of car as usual ; car . there have been mani develop in thing around us , such as televis , mobil phone , and comput . if we think about our earli develop in those thing , we would be abl to imagin that there would be no chang in how we call it . for exampl , comput ha chang alot . first , it wa onli an big box that can calcul the number quickli . we had to have a big space to have one . although , look at our modern comput . our technolog ha enabl us to have own conput for each of us . we could not have imagin it when we first saw the big box that can onli calcul . now , we can even commun with peopl all over the world . even if there are big differ between the first comput and the comput now , we call it in same way . for these reason , i disagre with the opinion .
