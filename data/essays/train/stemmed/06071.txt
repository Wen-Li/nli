as we are today live in a more and more individualist societi , we may wonder whether young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun . on my opinion , young peopl tri to help their commun sinc i still see a lot of exampl who are part of my rel and friend , but also thank to the differ travel i have had the opportun to do . first , the fact that we live today in an individualist societi realli matter . young peopl are look for exampl and they reproduc what they see close to them . although they use to be veri help and loyal to their commun befor , a lot of my friend and i still give time to help our , by help our famili or work in differ kind of associ . we can not gener but my differ trip allow me to see that young peopl from other place in the world do help their commun . howev , i think that the most import question is not whether young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun but do those commun give time to help young peopl ? young peopl are often lost in our modern world . moreov , they are look for exampl and hero but also for valu and educ . commun have chang and do no alway perpetu their valu to young peopl . i have some famili in vietnam ; they explain me that parent take care of their children when they are young but when the parent get old it is the children 's turn to take care of their parent . in conclus , if we want young peopl nowaday to give more time to their commun , we have to make them understand the import of help their commun , but commun also have to give time to help youmg peopl .
