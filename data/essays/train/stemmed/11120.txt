come to the end of my undergradu educ in the area of molecular biolog and genet , know is the time for me to select a specif subject from my area to begin graduat studi . in four year , we have cover a broad rang of topic from cancer to pathogen bacteria . definet , know a bit from all topic in thi scope will be a hard and unproduct task . thi idea appli to interdisciplin studi in academ subject . firstli , a short glanc to the academ program of ani univers would reveal the broad of program . tri to obtain knowledg in all or at least in sever of these area will push the limit of a normal human be . secondli , it is a fact that the more subject you learn about , the less specif inform you will have on each of them . i alway thought that have a shallow knowledg on mani thing is not a veri desir thing . i am a person who would like to be focus on one thing and dive into deep of that thing . anoth thing is that , a person excel on one particular subject is given supplementari inform from other area . in other word , you do not see the life of cell for four full year in molecular biolog , it is blend with mathemat , physic and chemistri . a last reason for whi i am oppos the idea of have a broad knowledg of mani subject is becaus i believ that everyon should be contain in their own subject and should not jump to the other ' . if i knew statist as good as i knew microbiolog ; whi would there be a need for a statistician ? to conclud my discuss , i would again like to emphas the import of co-work of expert from differ area in harmoni to achiev the big thing , rather than one person tri to know and achiev everyth just by himself .
