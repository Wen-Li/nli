i had just read a say `` knowledg is the art of know thing organisedli '' i strongli agre with thi statement . a person may have a knowledg of mani thing , but onli to a certain extent . but what is the use if he intend to special in a particular field . ??? in thi case he will just struggl in all the field . he will not have ani thorough knowledg in a field . he will have a mi - match option as to what to chose as hi main stream . consid a person who is well qualifi for a particular train . similarli also consid a person who is just a person with wide knowledg with everi field but no special . suppos if both attend a job interview , it would be a cake-walk decis to chose the peron with the right qualifi for the right job . if a person in hi childhood is question what hi plan to do in the futur wa , hi spontan answer would be a doctor , engin so forth . but no one respond that they have plan to have wide knowledg in everyth . i prefer that learn a subject which interest us most is definit increas our goal . specialis in a particular subject ha it own advantag . we get to have a thorough knowledg and further work on the subject more keenli . but my idea is not to be a book worm !!!!! we should explor the world as if it is our own . but specialis is also neccessari ! though a wide knowledg in all field is also essenti , specif goal also ought to be present within everyon .
