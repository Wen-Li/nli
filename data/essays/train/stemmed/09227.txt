the question about whether it is better to have a broad knowledg or to be special is veri controversi . one may argu that it is prefer to be familiar with as mani subject as possibl , sinc thi will lead to be better suit to differ situat . on the other hand , there is the claim that sinc human knowledg is so broad that it is not onli imposs but unprat to avoid special . as a final posit , i 'll argu whi nowday it better to special . in paticular , i will illustr thi by explain the situat of nowday mathematician . first i would like to explain whi to have a meanin broad knowledg is almost imposs . by meanin knowledg , i understand an amount suit to do reasearch on a specif subject or make contribut to it . just consid the especif case of mathemat , nowday it ha becom so broad that even a master thesi may be hardli understood by peopl not special in the subject . so if someon is not special in ani field , there are chanc that he will not understand the state of the art of the mathemat scienc . even , there is peopl who tri to special in everi possibl field , and what gener happend is that the person becom a veri good lectur but a poor research . my point is that mathemat is too broad to avoid special . so the aim of obtain a broad mathemat knowledg will lead to someon that would hardli be abl to excel as a research . thi lead to my second argument . nowday an academ person is mani time measur base on the amount of origin result he produc . that mean that not onli the person is requir to be on the edg of our knowledg , but aquaint enough with it so that to understand how to and be abl to expand it . so in order to obtain a possit as a research is better for him to be special . and as a matter of fact , onli a research can aim for a trulli broad knowledg in a particular scienc . as a conclus , given the fact that it is imposs to have and unpract to aim for a broad knowledg in mathemat , it is even less desir in gener .
