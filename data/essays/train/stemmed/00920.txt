i disagre with the statement . i think it 's so hard to decreas the number of car and it take more than twenti year . i will describ my main idea . first , it is true that there are mani peopl who go to their offic or school by car . they use car becaus they do n't have ani other way such as train or buse . the solut for thi problem is to construct them more . if the goven doe it , car will be fewer , but it take a lot of time and cost . in addit to it , i do n't think that the govern take an immedi action for that . second , actual car are conveni , especi if you live in a rural area . peopl who live in a rural area , for exampl , ca n't go to the supermarket by their foot , becaus it is too far . that 's whi these peopl have to use car even if they do n't to want to . the solut for thi problem is to built mani store in a rural area , but it is not easi and realist . as long as there are rural countri , car will not be decreas . third , there are mani work which need car . for exampl , car good from manufactur compani to store . they are forc to use car , becaus they have a lot of thing to carri . for these reason , i disagre with the statement .
