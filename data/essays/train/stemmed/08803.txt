dure the ` 70 vanc packard sustain that advertis is fake , is someth that persuad everi singl custom and make him/her buy a product even if he/sh doe n't need it or is not interest in . anyway we have to highlight the date written abov : we are talk about the 70 , far and far away and moreov we have to consid the critic econom situat of that time . that 's way i firmli disagre with the one who think like packard did . just few peopl studi advertis and it world and that 's the reason whi they do n't know how advertis work in realiti . it work just becaus mani studi have been done from differ disciplin like pscicholog or sociolog to understand the custom deeper . the custom knowledg help peopl , who have to commun a product or an idea , to reach the target need and desir . noth more . there is a new custom in the societi , someon who just buy what he/sh need or realli want , is an activ person who doesn ' let the advertis decid for him/her . the buyier ha becom more critic to thi kind of commun and more to the one broadcast through televis . it ' s also import to keep in mind that thi job ha strict rule and a deontolog ethic like other profess . sublimin advertis is not allow at all , it 's consid illeg in most of the countri . even if i appreci advertis , i have to say that sometim some compani tri to make the product more interest to us but than ialso have to remind that we still have a great power of decis make . if onli peopl known how advertis realli work , i 'm sure they will appreci as i do . it 's not as danger as is thought . everyth still depend on us . you can buy someth onli if you want to .
