i would disagre with the follow statement for sever reason . first of all , it is import to have an understand on a varieti of subject beacus special in one thing onli can limit your perspect in life , and it can caus you to view the world around you with a narrow mind . howev it is import to acknowledg and recogn that in order for you to fulli appreci someth you must special in it and understand it in it depth and profound . for exampl , if you take a look at an ordinari school , you have differ teacher for everi subject . your calculu teacher is differ than your literatur teacher . each teacher must special in a specif subject in order to convey suffieci and proper inform to the student . howev , that doe n't mean that the teacher is narrow-mind and ha a limit perspect in life becaus to special in one subject doe n't hinder you or stop you from explor other subject . i plan to continu my studi in the area of engin which specif special in math and scienc , thi doe n't mean that i will stop read novel , histori text book , and write . in fact i will have more time to explor these thing and enjoy them becaus i am no longer oblig to do them . in order for a person to be success in life they must be well-round . howev if someon had mere a broad knowledg of all subject and not special in ani , then that person can not do extrem well in one area . what good will it do if the engin build your hous is not special in math but ha a broad knowledg of it ? thi will definit caus some promblem . in order for societi to function peopl have to special in differ thing . if we take a look at the ancient civil of rome and greec , we find that even then there wa the merchant , the priest , the philosoph , and the gener in the armi . what made those civil distinct from their contemporari wa a result of their varieti . in those empir not everyon wa a farmer or a nomad but differ peopl had differ specialit . becaus of the engin build such as the colloseum were built and becaus of the philosoph such as aristotl and plato , new philosoph theori were explor . thi led to the success of these two empir and their abil to surpass thier neighbor empir and becom world power . if everyon mere had a broad knowledg of thing , then what would differenti the engin from the philosoph . how will peopl be uniqu ? how will they pursu what they are good at ? thi is whi it is better to have peopl special in one subject becaus it will make them understand it better and it will also add to the divers of our world .
