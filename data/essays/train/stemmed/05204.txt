it is an import decis , how to plan your syllabu . some student prefer to take a lot of cours and expand their knowledg , wherea some other prefer to special in one specif subject . in thi essay i will dwell on the advantag of special in one subject and argu in it favor . there are at least three reason whi choos one subject is better than tri to keep balanc between mani subject . the first and most import reason for me is that thi way peopl concentr on one thing and do not feel anxieti about time-manag and deadlin . in contrast , student who take three or four subject are veri busi and stress , becaus they have to prepar for mani exam and see differ lectur , which is confus and the result are not as good as those of the one from the one subject plan . in addit , when one special in one subject then thi person ha more chanc to be well-inform about it and do hi best , be sure he reciev the best knowledg and invest in someth substanti and prosperi . the second reason is that thi kind of studi give the opportun to work and gain your own money . usual student depend on their parent and have to explain whi they need money , which is not veri pleasant . for instanc , i use to work when i did not have mani lesson and i wa happi that i wa abl to succeed in work and do someth import as an adult doe , reli on my own experi . the third reason is that the student can pay more attent to their rel , friend and even their hobbi . moreov , life is not onli studi and if we can not enjoy it , we should rethink our point of view . for exampl , student , who do not have fun and onli studi , get sick and miss the both chanc . the psycholog have prove that work hard is not the best for our health and we should take rest from time to time . in my opinion , it is better to special in one subject , becaus thi choic make us have more healthi life , which ha is success too .
