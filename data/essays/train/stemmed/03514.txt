it ha been well-establish that success peopl want to push their limit to the maximum and feel more and more sensat . i will develop and explain whi i believ in thi statement by use two main reason illustr by exampl . the first reason is the money and the second one is the popular . it is widespread that success goe with money . success peopl evid are one of the part of the societi where there is the less problem with money . inde , some of them ( without think ` most of them ' ) becom disgust to have what they want , to do everyth they want , to own , to buy , to offer , to live what they want to . that is the first reason whi thi peopl tri new thing and take risk . they own lot of thing so they want alway more and the onli way for them to feel aliv is to push their limit . it is to be out of bound , to show to everybodi that they can easili do what they want , more than buy what they want . by know and understand thi way of think , it permit me to go on the second reason whi they are act as extrem as a profession skateboard , surfer , snowboard or other extrem sport . it is due to their popular . besid be abl to buy anyth they want , they are proud of their ego and of the fact that unknown peopl love them . even though they are success , they are also consciou on the effect they have on other who do not succeed . and they use it to prove to everyon that they can be more than someon who succeed . so they tri new thing and take unconsci risk to confirm that anyway they are a part of peopl they definet succeed . i would like to conclud that i understand them . i do not mean i feel success but except money and popular i love feel me aliv by look for new sensat , take risk ( alway under law and rule , of cours ) and prove to myself that i can do ` extra-th ' like no one els .
