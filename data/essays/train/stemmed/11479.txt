i agre with thi statement . as improv or develop of technolog , everi hous ha their own televis and radio . and also internet use as a good way of advertis some product . but sinc the purpos of advertis is sell the product what the compani made , when they advertis one product , they overli exagger that product . when i wa in elementari school , i wa walk on the road . i saw one person advertis a fan . what i heard wa they are sell fan onli that day with 50 percent discount . and he kept say that it never break and he use that fan for last few year . but when i bought that fan it broke in a week . and one anoth day i way watch televis . and when i watch one commerci which wa advertis diet food . and they were say that , `` if you eat thi diet food for a month you will be like one of the hollywood stars. '' and after few week i saw one articl in the internet which wa talk about that diet food doe n't work well . peopl do n't buy product which doe n't look or seem good . everi day peopl want better and better product . so the compani automat tri to show their product is better than other compani 's product . in the advertis they alway talk about the good thing of their product they never say that the bad thing of their product . so peopl might think that the product is realli good so they should buy it . advertis is a import bussi . it 's a onli way to compani introduc it 's good to everybodi . but sinc there are so mani compani are in thi world . they state compet each other and tri to exagger their product than the other compani 's product . so i think the product seem much better than they realli are is becaus of that 's the way to surviv in thi world .
