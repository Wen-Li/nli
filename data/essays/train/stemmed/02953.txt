i total agre with thi statement , i think it is much more import to understand an idea than to learn fact . when a student understand a concept , it mean that is veri clear in hi mind and that he could explain it in a differ way or relat it with anoth subject . moreov , when someon understand an idea , he learn the fact much easier becaus they are logic relat to thi idea . for exampl , in a histori class , if i tri to learn some inport date without understand the cours , i will have difficulti and i will forget them a coupl of day later . if i understand the cours , i will learn those same fact easier becaus they are all logic connect so i will be abl to rememb those date a long time after . it is more import for student to understand the idea of a particular topic than to learn specif date becaus onc you understand a cours , you do not forget it easili . that is whi student should tri to understand what the cours is about befor learn fact . there is no use to learn fact without be abl to explain it . when i wa in highschool , i use to hate mathemat becaus it wa for me just learn formula and writ them downon the exam day . so when i had a test , i could give the formula but i did not know when , where and how to use it . my teacher notic that i wa learn my formula in a `` silli '' way , like a machin as he said , and he told me to spend much more time at home tri to find out how doe that work . that is what i did and from that day , i stop to learn fact that i could n't understand in all the other cours . now i alway tri to understand first which is much more excit and it take less time and less pain .
