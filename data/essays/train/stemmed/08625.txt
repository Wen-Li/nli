there are sever thing that make our life easier such as comput , plane , car and cellphon . there is a statement about car : `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i can not agre with thi idea at all . first of all i do not believ that there is go to be an invent that would take car ' place . the car are the easiest way of transport in daili life . as long as someon do not invent a machin that can fli between short distanc and is cheaper than a car i will not sell my car ! addit to that we use car for public transport too . i would n't be abl to go somewher i do not know if there were no taxi . what is more twenti year is too short to make an invent that can beat car . although i realli wish the number of car to decreas in twenti year . car are good for transport but what about the environ ? they caus air pollut and the ga poison peopl . everi pass day the situat is get wors . peopl die from lung cancer . there is also a big problem call ` traffic jam ' . i think all of the big citi suffer from traffic jam at the rush hour . thi caus citi peopl to be more stress and depress , than the countri peopl . the car have a lot of advantag but i think disadvantag are more . i use my car not becaus it is fun , becaus it is a necess . unfortun i can not agre with the idea that say `` the number of car will decreas in twenti year . '' . by think of the sentenc `` necess is the mother of invent '' i hope there will be a better way of transport in the futur but i do not think there will be an import invent in twenti year . therefor i do not believ there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year .
