if i wa ask some detail on the exam , i wrote last week , i probabl could n't rememb a lot , although i spend quit an amount of time on prepar . is n't that a hint for the necessar of chang learn requir and student educ - in my opinion , the teach of basic qualif concern the achiev and comprehens of knowledg and think is the more effect way to a fluent , highli adapt intellectu abil . be abl to understand idea and concept is a capabl which is requir in nearli ani kind of intellectu situat . to be capabl of the most import tool in deal with academ materi which mayb catch the main idea of a text , summar basic point , understand the intent of an author or speaker , etc. is the basi for ani kind of apprenticeship . unfortun , thi qualif play a subordin role compar to the learn of fact . of cours , fact are also of import to be abl to treat a certain topic , but without the abil to integr singl fact into one 's fluent knowledg , they wo n't last in mind for long time . be abl to use the basic tool for deal with ani kind of knowledg present will strongli improv the abil to find out import fact if need . like one of my teacher told me `` you do n't need to keep ani fact in mind , but you need to know where to find it if necessari '' , it is import to konow about sourc and connect between them - which mean their basic idea - while deal with ani context of apprenticeship . as describ abov , i think , student should get familiar to understand idea and concept , and even to develop their own one , becaus thi will allow them to deal with unknown inform und context . as especi at an earli age , the human brain is abl to develop , it is veri import to implement basic compet of learn and think at that time . the fact will be learn , when the basic concept are clear .
