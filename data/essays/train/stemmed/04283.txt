do you agre or disagre that success peopl tri new thing and thak risk rather than onli do what they alreadi how to do well . as far as i am concern , i agre that success peopl onli tri new thing and tak risk . in my opinion that success peopl must have some kind of the special capac that normal peopl do n't have . these are my opinion in the follow reason . first of all , i wander that what kind of peopl will have a lot of gut to becom success ? they must obtain a great dream to stimul them keep move on . for exampl , if they want to finish thi hard work that boss ask for them to do , they must work on harder and harder , even no time to eat . thi target is one they want to achiev and want to get the boss 's prais , so they take the risk may becom unhealth to conqur the goal . secondli , no pain , no gain . i indic the peopl who are will to take the risk must have the scene of confid . for stanc , there ca n't be complet the whole thing without confid . howev , the success peopl show their confid in when they are find the way to deal with the problem and figur out the tough issu . moreov , the hard-wrok peopl repres the most confid when they have no way to do , they can util their individu abil to overcom the problem . to sum up , i utter that the success peopol that tri new thing and take risk make them becom success . in the end , i will conclud my opinion by emphas . peopl need to have the creatibl to think the new method to deal with problem , espesi when they get stuck in the aw way .
