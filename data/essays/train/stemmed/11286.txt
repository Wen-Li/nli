first , i think that ye they are right to have a broad knowledg of mani acadim subject is better than specif subject . becaus you will have a lot of inform in a lot of thing that you alreadi knew about them and you will be abl to do averi thing you want it becaus i said befor you alredi have a lot of inform about thi thing you need to do . also you will have a problem of noth at all and noth will cross you while you are work on it becaus you do not need to know about it at all . second , or in other hand if you think that to be special in one specif subject is much and more better you will be right too . becaus i think or in my openion if you choos one subject and had focuc on you will be profesion on it becaus you have known everi singl thing and detail about it and i think that the second openion is much and more better than the first . although the first statement is good but when you have you'r knowledg about everyth you wont be abl to know everi detail about it becaus it is go to be too much on you to know and you will say then that there is no need to know it and you will get boar from it and you will never know what is your work in a specif way becaus from the begin you wasnt sure enough about what you reali want or need to know . while , in other side to be special in one and specif subject no doubt you will be abl to do and work and studi and do what ever you want becaus from the beginig you knew what you want and need to do and sure you will be specialis in it and everyon around you will certanli trust you becaus as i mention befor that you are alreadi know what you want , love and need to do and if you ask me that question anoth million time i will choos the second statement everytim you ask me .
