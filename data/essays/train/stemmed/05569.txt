some peopl think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . on one hand i agre with thi idea but on yhe other hand i think it is not true . of cours young peopl have usual no respons and seriou problem to be sad . they play game and they live without think to their futur . young peopl are veri innoc and they ignor all the tragic event of the life . thi time is the best period for dream , and young peopl think that they have all their life to do what they want . when we becom older , we loos thi part of dream which caracter young peopl . death and illus have destroy our part of innoc . but i can bare believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . happy depend on lot of factor . even if old peopl have alreadi live a big part of their life , i think thi experi is the best way to appreci the event . i mean that happy depend on the valu we give to an event . old peopl usual know what is the most import in the life . there is a kind of wisedom which help old peopl to be happi and to enjoy life . moreov mani young peopl have a lot of problem . they are not protect against the event of the life like ill . so i think that those two period offer differ way to enjoy life . we do n't enjoy the same thing on the same age . each life 's period is like a season which give a lot of fruit . i think the real difficulti is to pick up the fruit . ..
