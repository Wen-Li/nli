the question here is that is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or to specilaz in one subject . in my view it is better to special in one subject onli . i have suffici reason and exampl to support my claim . firsltli , although it is better to have a broad knowledg about mani academ subject , but thi is onli use upto a certain extent onli . it is alway better to special in one specif subject becaus it give you right confid and knowledg to make a substanti contribut to your field . consid a nuclear scientist work on a project , although it is necessari for him to have knowledg of thermodynam , fluid scienc etc. but it is hi special in the field of nuclear engin that make him suitabl for the job . moreov the reasearch project are carri out in team where peopl who special in differ field come togeth and execut the project , so there is no need to have deep knowledg of all the field . secondli , in some case have a broad knowledg of mani subject doe not serv the purpos . for instanc in medic field , we have doctor who special in everyth from toe to ear . thi is realli necessari as onli a cardiologist can do justic to a heart patient rather than a physician , who onli know a bit of everyth but is incap of provid do proper prognosi and diagnosi . so thi show it make sens to special onli in one field . final , almost everi individu from hi childhood ha a field of interest , one subject which he like the most . it is a known fact peopl perform the best when they work on the field which interest them . there is veri high probabilti that individu will contribut favor to the societi . as the say goe jack of all trade , master of none , thi era demand specialist and not jack . so in my view it make complet sens to special in the area of your interest and make a substanti contribut to that field so that futur gener rememb you .
