in my opinion it is more import to understand idea about a lesson . i believ that student ha to focu on main concept of issu . by learn fact , student can gain onli the inform . as for me , first reason for it that when student focu on the main idea of ani lesson , they might improv the idea , and they can add differ type of idea to it . becaus i think that younger brain usual open for creativ . so if a teacher depend on teach fact , he/sh may caus lost of creativ in class . my second reason is , if student think about concept and tri to understand the idea , they can produc question to teacher . so when they are ask these question , they may understand and learn all the fact of lesson . in the class , if teacher pay attent on give the main idea , they can help to rais in number of innov individu . becaus i believ that ani student who ask question by use `` how '' and `` whi '' can learn all structur . when i wa in high school we had two chemistri teacher in one year . our first chemistri teacher alway ask element properti whose student ha to know from period tabl . so we should know all element from that tabl . otherwis we sure that we ca n't pass the lesson . after hi retir , we had a new teacher for chemistri . she wa alway give research homework in the class . also we had to prepar project with our classmat . after that we got start to understand that how chemistri and it 's theori work . we were stay in librari for hour . we were read articl about our homework . in the end of the year we gain a scientif point of view . and now , it 's realli hard to rememb of ani element from period tabl .
