there are mani way that the topic of the better way to gain knowledg can be approach . some peopl think that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better , while other do not . i have my point of view as well . there are two reason whi i am in favor of have broad knowledg . a key reason underli my choic is that if we studi broadli , we can be more competit in the futur . take my brother , for exampl . while he wa studi dure univers , he decid to have english teach for hi minor . although he lost a lot of time hang out with friend , he got more choic when he graduat from the univers . moreov , becaus of hi abil of english speak and hi major , market , he got promot quickli . such an exampl show that studi broadli can help us becom more competit . anoth import reason whi i choos studi broadli is that sometim , we wo n't be so sure about what we are go to do in the futur . if we studi broadli , we can find out our real interest from all these subject and choos the one we want . take my father , for exampl . when he wa in colleg , he major in histori . as a matter of fact , it would be hard to find a job except be a teacher . unfortun , my father doe n't like to teach at all . howev , he took more class in other depart , and tri to choos one subject that he realli like . final , he choos chines and he becam an editor in a big newspap compani in my countri . without broad knowledg , my father may not be such success today . of cours , there is an argument to be made for other posot . nevertheless , i think the reason that i have present are stronger .
