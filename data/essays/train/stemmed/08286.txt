i disagre with the statement `` young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun '' . you can find youngster do commuti servic at colleg , at the welfar club and anywher they find themselv need . colleg is main area of such servic centr . they have their own group there that doe work like collect fund from student for a worthi caus , or conduct ani event , may it be cultur or academ to rais the money for a need . i would like to quot someth relat to the recent `` tsunami '' attack that kill live of mani . there were casualti and loss of properti and the poor peopl who live in coastal region were badli affect . our colleg group , who want to help the victim , rais a `` contribut some and save them '' event to rais money , and it collecet a gross amount near eighti thousand . it would be small , when onli one colleg is consid , but when all the colleg in that area are consid it a substanti sum . it even amaz how much such event in colleg throughout the countri would have acquir . anoth instanc to quot is the recent `` blood donat '' camp that wa organis by the youth club in my local . the event wa done with guidanc and it wa a huge success . peopl , mainli youngster - both boy and girl particip whole heartedli . and it sure would save live . not onli at colleg or residenti area , even at our workplac such servic occur frequent - may be blood donat camp , may be rais money for a caus , or mayb visit a hospit or an orphanag . these visit includ spend time the children in orphanag and make them smile and do cultur perfom to give them a good time . or hospit visit - majorli to help in sooth the patient and hear their problem . both visit end up in donat be made to them . these show that youngster are do commun servic veri good .
