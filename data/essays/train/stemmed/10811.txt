time is the key point that is to be consid in one life the young peopl focu there time most on the educ and other physic activit but they rare focu on the develop of the commun . i agre with the statement becaus when we consid the exampl of the colleg student he spend most of hi time on study rather then on the welfar or develop of the commun . main the reason lie in hi think of what the commun ha done to him , that is if there is a favour that ha been done to him by the commun then he would probab think of return it back . at the young age the peopl focu or think on make a live or explor the resourc that give them oppurtini to make money and settel in life , but they forget to think that by develop the commun in which he live he can gain more bussi and develop at a faster rate becaus the dvelop or sucess of a individu not onli depend on the effort that are be made by him but also on the surround , that is hi commun and hi surround . at the young age the way of think is far differ as the peopl think more practic and the way of apporach to a ploblem is far more differ . when we consid polit young peopl refus to join activ in the polit becaus they think that it requir more experi and at there age might not be the proper time to join polit . but they forget to that the comminti they live in need the help of young individu but not that of one who is 45 year old as hi way of think may be quit differ from the younger one . a clariti of mind is present in young peopl , so i feel that they should focu there attent on the commun and help in the develop of the nation , which in turn help in gain person develop also .
