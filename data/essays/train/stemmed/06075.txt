the car is most prefer motion media in the world . in western countri , almost each famili ha one or more car . in develop countri , peopl aim at have a car . thi is usual a proof of success . and these countri are still grow , produc and come to a mass market economi . therefor it seem difficult to see fewer car in the next twenti year . yet thi statement could turn out to be true . for other reason which are not directli link to the comfort of peopl . nowaday , we can notic that an alway greater part of the popul feel concern with environnememt issu . the use of car is directli link to thi new awar of the popul . peopl becam awar of the influenc of car gase through climat evolut ( temperatur increas , unpredict storm ... ) , through medic survey ( number of child concern with asthma , increas of lung ill in the popul ) . at least in western countri , thi awar could lead to a reduct in the number of car sold . anoth point is that in big citi , peopl are fed up with the nois gener by the car . an other argument is link to the increas oil barrel price . over the past month , the oil barrel ha risen to incred price . reach almost 80 $ . even if the price have felt recent to a more accept 60 $ a barrel , the car ha becom a well in which famili throw their money . furthermor , the organ of oil produc said that the price would n't fall under 60 $ a barrel . thi situat ha two possibl solut . either the scientist develop new fuel for car . thi could allow peopl to use their car or at least to buy new car which meet new environment requir and which are then less expens as they do n't need fuel produc from crude oil . or the car will be outnumb , especi in big citi , by public transport , as it is the trend today . but they will remain numer on the countrysid where public transport are less develop . as a conclus , i will say that i do n't foretel the disappear of car until quit a long time .
