in my view young peopl are enjoy life more than the old peopl . a perfect exampl to support my view would be me [ young ] when compar to my father [ old ] . i have no respons to take care of . so i have more time to fish out , hang out with friend and particip in social activ . on the other hand , my father ha lot of respons . he ha hi time devot to certain activ . he is so occupi with thi that he doe not get ani time to enjoy hi life . i also believ that attitud is anoth factor which can support my view . young peopl have possit or open kind of attitud . while the old peopl have reserv kind of attitud . yound peopl think that here is lot to enjoy in life . old peopl just think opposit to thi . anoth reason to support my view would be spend factor . i normal spend more than my father . my father prefer to save instead . by spend i am abl to tri our new thing , parti , go place etc and enjoy life . technolog advanc is also one of the reason . today technolog ha lot to offer . it make life interest . i watch movi , take joy ride , play comput game . thi facil were not avail in the earlier day . the veri mean of life ha chang with the gener .
