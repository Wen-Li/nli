i complet agre with the statement that `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . now-a-day the compitit is so high that the peopl realli pay a good amount of money to these advertis compani in order to sell their product . for exampl in tele shop advertis , they give all the benifici detail but never tell about the illeffect they have on us . as these day unit state is face `` obeas and stress '' as major problem , the focu of the pharmacut compani is to develop the slime pill as well as the stress reliev pill which act instantli after egest . and later on these drug are commercialis in order to make larg group of popul awar of them . and it then when the advertis compani come into pictur . the advertis compani provid evid of all most all the possiabl benifit which the popul will have after consum these drug . now-a-day even they provid the popul with the evid of the medic profession who clame that use these will realli benifit the peopl . but these compani never bring into pictur the long term ill effect which these drug have on human . and thu we , the gener popul , get the impress of the product as the best product which is certainli not if long term effect are taken into concider . on ethic ground , i do not support thi becaus i believ that no bodi ha right to play with the health and money of the popul and if the product is to be sold to the popul , probabl the popul should be told all the possiabl effect that product will have , whether posit or neg . thi way atleast the advertis compani will not be do injustic to the popul in order to be competit or make more money . let the peopl decid whether the product is benifici for them or not . everi bodi know that nothin is 100 % pure n correct so whi to hide the neg . thu ll these advertis compani should focu on is keep all the aspect of the product in front of the popul which actual they are suppos to do and let the peopl make the final decis .
