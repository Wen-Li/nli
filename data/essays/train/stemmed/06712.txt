is it right that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl ? is it right that old peol hate life ? some idea come to my mind when i thing about thi question . hate life , bore from life difficulti , and stupid . in my view i thing that it 's true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . first of all we know that life fill with problem and difficulti thi is a fact and we ca n't say it 's not true at all , so from thi point i think that old peopl have got bor from the life and it 's difficulti , they have saw too mani peopl and too mani place and the joyful thing for the young will ahv no test to them . scond i thing that old peopl have hate life becaus of kind of routin they alway get to do the same thing and go same place , in better view let us thing that we have bought a new car first we will be veri happi gain it and day by day when time move thi happpi will disapear so also old pepol life for them is like our car day by day it will looos it shini appear . frome a diffrent view , everi time the human get older hi think of hi life end increas so he begin to take less care of hi self so he will not be intrest in hi life . final but not the least i think that there are exept for my view becaus there are old peopl enjoy life much more than young and young peol hate life more than old peopl so i onli want to ask them , whi ?
