well i 'm not sure about thi . i think i agre becaus it look obviou that nowaday , young peopl normal think more about theirselv , and do not realli care about their commun , at least most of them . they think it 's more interest to do someth that will give them a benefit at the moment , or soon , and for sure , than expend time in someth that will give a small benefit to other peopl , and just mayb . but i also think that thi is chang . each day i can see more young peopl who care more about their commun , and help , probabl becaus their parent have a differ mind than the parent of the young peopl befor , and teach them in a differ way that they have to help . everyday i can see , for exampl , that they recicl , they dont throw trash to the floor , they care about polit and discuss them , etc . but i also think they are just habit , they dont realli do it with the intent of help the commun . so , it 's a good chang becaus they help , but they still prefer to think more about theirselv . i think that to make them realli chang and want to help their commun , they have to be interest in it , so they take it as a person benefit . to make thi , the commun should organ interest excurs for young peopl who help the commun , or some kind of grant . thi way i 'm sure that they will spend much more time in help the commun , while get also benefit . so my conclus is that i agre and also that if we want to chang thi , the commun should chang in some way too .
