the issu of the `` quantiti '' of the knowledg is a controversi one due to the fact that knowledg is unlimit ! mani peopl think that have a broad knowledg is a good way of be abl to speak with everybodi about everi topic . howev it is also wide believ that you can special yourself in just one specif subject that you will deeper studi . take all these aspect into account , i strongli feel that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ topic , in order to be open with other peopl . one reason for my belief is that have a great and broad knowledg is a veri good way of creat relationship with other . for instanc , dure a privat lunch with new peopl or friend or dure a busi lunch , it is easier to enhanc the relationship with the peopl if you know what they talk about , which citi or countri they have visit or which cultur refer they are speak about ! howev if you are special in just one subject , you will not have be abl to understand what is told and you can feel veri frustrat . .. anoth reason to justifi my point of view is that it is veri difficult not to annoy peopl , if you are passion just by one subject ! peopl can find it is veri borri to speak alway about the same topic and it is sometim too much , even if you know all detail and featur of the topic ! that is whi , know sever academ subject enabl you to be open and to adapt yourself to the other peopl , to what they like . .. moreov , you will be abl to understand them better and to accept or critic their convict . .. furthermor , it is often believ that be special in one specif subjet can be a good way of make an impress reaction to other peopl . .. but i am convinc that the contrari is impress , too ! for instanc i enjoy speak with a friend of mine which ha a real broad knowledg , i can speak about everyth with him , he alway make comparaison or connect with other topic that he know and it enabl me to discov new sublect , to extend my own knowledg and on top of that to creat a real debat with him , by confront our opinion on sever subject ! in a nutshel , i would say that i agre with the statement , becaus have a broad knowledg is a way of be open on the other peopl , on the world and to develop one 's own concern .
