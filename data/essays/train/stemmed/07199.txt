think of it if we would have had no internet facil and we would have send thi respons through a letter . what would have been the turn around time ? it even hard to think of it . it becaus of few success peopl that we are savor all these facil . human be is bless with a mind power not to use it for thing he is alreadi awar of , but to tri out differ thing so that he can help other with it . peopl who tri out new and differ thing are better known in thi world compar to the one who have been amongst the common one . success peopl differ from other in differ perspect like courag , approach and mani more . first let take an exampl of sachin tendulkar , the youngest player in the histori of intern cricket . if he would have assum that a person can onli be a part of countri team onli at adult age . then hi name would not have been written in histori . with hi courag and strength he gain the major place in world . it hi differ style of bat that make him stand differ from other . otherwis he would have been like other common player . there are mani other and few of them are abraham lincoln , mahatma gandhi who were known for their courag and stood against the govern bodi to bring in the chang for all . second , think if einstein would not have come up with those innov . had it been easi for men now to relat differ thing which are made easi now , with those law . if he would have stop becaus of hi continu failur and would not have taken anoth risk then peopl would have been depriv of anoth innov . it the approach and abilti to take risk that count the most in thi world and make one success and distinguish person . how mani know us ? well veri few until and unless we come up with few distinguish idea or achiev that make us stand differ from other . thi is the reason whi the research or specialist are given high posit in the societi . it not becuas they have differ degre attach to their name , it becaus of the innov and their capabl to tri out new and differ thing .
