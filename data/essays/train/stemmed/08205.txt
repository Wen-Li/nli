when we are at school most of the knowledg we absorv is from idea and concept , thing that we commonli learn from our book , that are taught in class but can not be understood from ourselv becaus we 've never experienc . that 's whi sometim idea and concept can be consid unrealist , becaus they onli work with and ideal background or envior . on the other hand fact are real , fact are thing that use to happen and the differ with idea is that sometim the aplic them can not be easili put on practic . for exampl , at school , we all learn about theori and formula that were invent to use to resolv problem , and that 's what we do at school , we make a simul of some problem that can be resolv with those tool . but the the thing is that not everyth in our life can be resolv by a formula , we wish it could happen that way as easi as it sound but it 's not . the truth is that peopl sometim learn from their mistak from person or profession experi and those are exampl of fact . the real knowledg you get , you learn it within the past of the time and that make you wiser than other peopl . you get the respect from other peopl by what you know , and some of these thing , are thing you get by the experi or fact . i do n't think that idea or concept are unnecessari for the student , thi is also an import issu , but thi es onli the start . the learn experienc by idea and concept can not be veri clear for the student becaus it someth they have not live with their own skin . onc student have the abil to get recogn all these a put it in practic as a fact , they have a clear imag of what thi is talk about . final i would n't take the credit of ani of both choic , becaus certainli concept and fact go togeth , but for me i think that fact are what we are maid of , is what we see , what we touch or what had happen to us that make us stronger peopl , and make us take right decit of a person or profesion situat .
