i wa allway think about what will happen in the next year , but everi day i have adefer ideai , and there are some of them . some time i agre with thi statement becuas in the next twenti year mabey the human will invent anelectrit door that we an pass throw it and suddenli we find our selv in anoth place . or human can invent a fli car that we can transport inth sky for ashort space , and ithink thi what will happend and we will say good bay to car and trian . but what i 'm think now is : thi oil who long it will stell with us ? and when it will be runout ? if thi happend so we will not see car or plane or train even ship , all of these thing will go away and thi time will be the camel and hors time . but mabey we will aten to the natur sours for the energi and get and improv our life . and these natur sourc are : first the energi of wind . as we know the wind ha strong energi , and if we know how to use it by pute big fan on the huge mountain , also the sun can give us alarg amount of energi , and we can get thi energi by the sun cell , the same cell that artif moon have in the space , and thi way were use by some peopl and they said it a use way for get energi , becuas we can use for car , plan , or train and save the oil for anoth thing . in aconclus i think car will be kick out inth next twenti year , but not all the car becuas the car which move with the sun cell will still in our life .
