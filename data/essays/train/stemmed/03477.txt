i total disagre with thi opinion . to me , the best way to travel is to visit a countri alon , or in a reason small group of friend . when i travel around , i want to discov the real natur of the countri i visit and i want to decid alon the thing i want to see , and these thing are not possibl in a guid tour . guid tour are mayb an optim solut for old peopl who are not total independ , for peopl who are afraid of the fenc that foreign languag can creat , or for peopl who do n't want to spend much time abroad . but thi option is definet not an option for me . guid tour sell you organis , prepar , `` pre-chew '' travel . they make you run from one hotel to a point of interest , from one restaur to a pseudo `` tradit '' show . you can visit franc in 2 day , europ in a week , and have a pictur of you in front of all the must you `` have to see '' . i want to have time to feel the atmospher of a countri i visit . i want to explor the hidden region , to go out of the the beaten track . when you travel in a group , it is imposs to meet local peopl . you stay with your conspecif becaus it is easier , certainli more confort . travel alon forc you to exchang with the local popul , to speak the local languag , to share the local cultur . and to me , thi is the most interest part of the travel . guid in a guid tou are gener professionn multilingu guid who are hire by the travel agenc . they come from the same countri and have onli a specif knowledg of the countri you visit . best guid are local peopl who can present you the realli tradit aspect of their region .
