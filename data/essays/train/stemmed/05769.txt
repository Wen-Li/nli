in my opinion it is better to studi all subject regard hi academ then onli in one subject , which offer better career . even though ther is chanc that mani thing will be confus and the less thing will be much effect and also we will have good job if we are good at the subject . unless we will be effect in all the subject ani bodi will not get good job . have broad knowledg it will also use full in daili purpos for exampl if he doesnot know ani thing about scienc that regard to the medicen then for everi small sake he should go the hospit for regular checkup . but if have some what knowledg about the scienc we can abl to solv the simpl problem . if we have knowledg in mani subject it will have it own adventag we wil get good job and also we will have good career and will be well settl . but unless we will have prefect knowledg in al lthe subject we will not settl for exampl if a person whoe specilis is commun he should have softwar knowledg also whi bacaus it will provid much job and we will be verri use full inord to well settl . and also if the person is well in onli one subject if ther areless job then how can he get good job ha there are no job regard that subject , so it is better to have knowledg in all academ subject then in onli one subject so it is better to have broad subject knowledg then onli in one suject .
