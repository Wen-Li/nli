it is sometim in peopl mind that young peopl are more like to enjoy the life more than older peopl . everybodi ha alreadi heard a fifti years-old person say : '' oh , if onli i wa twenti , i would do these thing ! '' or '' what can i do to go back when i wa young ! '' . but it is too easi to believ that older peopl or senior doe n't enjoy their life like young peopl . morov , it will be easi to show that their life can be even greater than the one of a twenti years-old person . we will give some exampl and headlin the fact that enjoy life is just a question of point of view . for a young person , enjoy life can be simplier becaus he is often healthier than an older person . so a young one can more easili practis sport , go out late , etc . .. for a student , life can be veri nice , becaus of all the opportun he is given to him , to do a lot of differ and meet new peopl . but as he ha onli a few experi of life , he ca n't appreci well enough thing he doe . in contrari , for an older person who have experi the world , peopl and life im gener , it is easier to take more benefit and appreci even more thing he doe . but young peopl are just begin their life , so that will of say `` i 'm enjoy life '' could be seen as a way of do n't think to the futur becaus he fear it . for a senior who have just finish their work life , it is easier to appreci now a differ way of live , without stress , and enjoy hi famili . in conclus , be a young peopl doe n't automat impli to enjoy more the life than older peopl .
