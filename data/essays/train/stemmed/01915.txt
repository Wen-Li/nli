i think that to learn idea and concept it is ok but until some point becaus what would happend if i have a lot of knowledg and i dont know when or how to use it , in the other hand we just cant onli know fact becaus if we just know fact but if we dont have ani idea or concept of how to use it , we have noth . for exampl if a doctor know all the concept and the idea you have to know about medicin and human bodi but never work with a person or doe a surgeri on hi own when he final have a person in front of him wait for a surgeri he probabl be nervou becaus he have never done a surgeri befor , but if the same doctor inst of all the knowledg have been in surgeri room all the time probabl when he have to do a surgeri on hi own he would know what to do but dont know whi he is do it becaus he doesnt have the idea or concept . but if the same doctor have a previou expiri with peopl and some idea and concept he can do a surgeri complet sure of what he is do without the fear if he is do someth wrong . person i disagre with he preview statement that idea and concept are more import that fact for the exampl i given .
