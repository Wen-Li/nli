i disagre with thi question . i think older peopl could enjoy life more than young peopl . old peopl can feel variou thing deepli beaus of their experi . the thing they do not feel interest in youg age will chang enjoy . older peopl know thing more than young peopl . that knowledg make their width of joy expand . for exampl , i think watch pictur is typic . the young peopl who can be interest in watch pictur would be less than old peopl . watch the audienc in musium proof it . young peopl are difficult to find out the atomosph , senc , deepth from just watch pictur becaus of their short of life . but old peopl will be abl to feel life of writer just watch pictur with hink of own life . thi kind of enjoy is calm but veri deepli , and thi can not do young peopl . and old peopl , in main case , have grandson or granddaught . i do not have children . but when i wa in childhood , i often play with my grandfath . he love me so much as if there are no other treasur for him . visit hi hous , he alway wellcom to me with veri nice smile . think of thi , have grandson and meet , play with them is not onli fun but also joy of life . thi enjoy is onli feel old man . young peopl never feel thi . young peopl actual enjoy life . play sport , drink with friend , etc . but i think the real enjoy for life would be for old peopl .
