it ha alway been in debat whether have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than be special in one specif subject . there have been mani good reason for both side and in conclus it is a onli a matter of opinion . in my opinion , i believ that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani thing than be special in one subject firstli , if one ha a broad knowledg of mani thing becaus one is more awar of hi surround . know a littl about a lot make you more cultur sinc you can discuss and convers on differ topic even if you are not special in one . you also are not puzzl by simpl question that mani special peopl would n't be abl to answer outsid their subject of knowledg . if you are with a person that onli know about one subject , hi field of convers is much smaller than one that ha some knowledg about mani topic . secondli , be special in one subject never mean that you know everyth there is to know about the topic becaus there will alway be question . socrat said , `` i know that i know noth '' . einstein also said that the more one know , the more he understand the littl knowledg he ha . these two great peopl in histori are comment on what is problemet of special knowledg . onc you dig deeper in a subject more problem will alway apear . onc you know one more fact in the sobject , two more question will aris . final , to have success in the futur , at work or in life , one will eventu use more that the knowledg of one subject . one will impliment the vast knowledg he ha to solv the obstacl ahead of him . mayb you are a great mathematician but know noth of psycholog , you will have a hard time go through life with just be an expert in that subject . math will not help you when you are tri to rais a famili or look after children . there must be a balanc of esenci knowledg that peopl must have in my opinion , to be succes in life and be abl to handl the obstacl in it one must have an all-around knowledg of mani esenci instrument that will be use later on . you will sacrific deep knowledg about subject but gain much more in life . life doe n't come in subject , in come in a whole . be prepar for the whole is the key .
