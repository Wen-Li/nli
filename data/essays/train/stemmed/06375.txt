i think that it will effect have fewer car in use in the futur than we can meet today . i feel thi way becaus i believ that mani factor will make us to let our car at home . from ourselv , from the natur , but also from the state . first , i consid that an auto pollut a lot and if we continu to pollut our world , like we have alreadi done through the ozon hole for exempl , we wo n't be abl tu live on earth without bad changement . that 's whi i think that peopl will do someth from themselv in order to help the natur stay good for us . they will for exempl prefer to walk becaus they will understand that if everyon make someth , it wo n't have littl signal . anoth reason i believ that thre will be fewer car in twenti year it that the state of al countri will do someth against car like they begin to do nowaday . for exempl the day without car . furthermor , we are see that more and more way to drive bike or to take buse an underground are built in order to make peopl let their car at home . and i think that if the state do someth , the popul will have to use tese way . and then , the reason i would like to emphas is the fact that it will have a lack of petrol on the earth and the humankind will have to find anoth type of thing to move such as we have alreadi show ( underground for exempl ) . so , if even the natur doe n't give much power for the car anymor we will have to reduc our use of car . as i have state , i believ that mani way from ourselv , from the state and most import from the natur make us to use not so often . it will continu in the futur that 's whi i tink there will be fewer car in use in 20 year
