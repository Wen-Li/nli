i think that the stament present two veri differ point of view and both of them have advantag and drawback . if you have a broad knowledg in mani area you can make a lot of connect from a topic to anoth and you can speak with a lot of peopl about a lot of subject . you can have a gener vision of the world and of the life but on the other hand you do n't have special in one of thi topic . you onli know the first floor of the thing not other floor . in some case you should request an help from an expert in order to resolv a problem in the best way . if you special in one specif subject you can know all about thi in other word you are an `` expert '' in your field . i think that in thi special there are two drawback : the first should be that you can not see the relathionship between thi object and the rest of the world and the second that you know anyth about the other academ subject . i think that it is veri difficult say what it is right and what it is wrong , everi peopl should understand what is better for him and for hi specif case . i think that it depend also from the job of anyon . i make an exampl in order to clarifi my statement : a scientist that work in a laboratori must have a specif prepar on hi work and on the other hand a polit or a gener manag should have a gener vision of the world or the compani . so i know that in my essay i do n't answer to the question if i agre or not with the statement but for me it is veri hard make a conclus and say what it is the best one .
