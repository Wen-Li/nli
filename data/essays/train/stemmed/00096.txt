i disagre with the statement that travel in a group led by a tour guid is better than travel individu without ani form of guidenc . my opinion is base on my past vacat experi and my person prefer in regard to organ my vacat time . travel in a group ha the advantag that the travel is instantli surround either by peopl he or she know or by other travel with the same time schedul and intent . thi elimin the pressur to meet peopl for the purpos of social dure vacat . furthermor , hire or elect a tour guid waiv the respons to plan and organ time schedul , sleep arrang and sight see trip to a third person . thi reduc the stress and organiz effort prior to and dure vacat . on the other hand , it limit the individu possibl to plan the vacat time accord to my own and my fellow travel 's prefer . group trip are rather advantag for shorter trip . wherea over the period of sever day , individu person tend to creat minor or major conflict within the group . thi is especi true for pretti heterogen group , rang in age , profess , person background , etc . wherea the excit at the begin of trip caus most peopl to subordin their own prefer to the group 's interest , thi is like to chang over the cours of a vacat . frustrat , argument , and annoy are onli some exampl of neg person conflict that i saw occur dure group trip in the past . and these can sever ruin the enjoy of a vacat . base on my experi , tour guid have to the potenti to limit the person freedom to visit attract that i want to see and group dynam can have a neg impact on all member of the travel group . therefor , i prefer to travel individu . the freedom to creat a schedul accord to my prefer and to choos who to interact and social with dure my vacat offset the extra organiz effort prior to the trip . by travel individu , the success and enjoy of my vacat is in my own hand .
