the statement if success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well , is veri difficult to evalu , becaus it depend on how well someon doe on a special topic . thu , it is veri difficult for me to agre or disagre with the abov mention statement . in my opinion a person can also be success in do thing which he or her know in detail . when i think of a professor of mathemat for instanc who is teach at a univers , it is even necessari for him to know hi subject veri well . he is also success , although he doe not tri new thing , becaus there are no real discoveri in math which can be made . everyth is alreadi fulli discov . nevertheless , there are peopl who need to tri new thing in order to be success , scientist for exampl . if you do not take risk , you will not have ani success in your field of studi . a veri controversi topic at the moment is clone . everyday , gene are get reproduc by sever scientist . all thi start some time ago when `` dolli '' the first sheep wa clone . the world at that time wa shock . these scientist who were respons for dolli 's exist took the risk of mayb creat a monster , becaus no one ha ever had ani experi with thi technolog . mani peopl , especi those with religi background , rais mani concern . but despit these critic , the scientist move on deal with human embryo . in the usa , voic have alreadi announc that a human ha been clone . to my mind , thi is defint a success , whether or not you agre with the ethic background . scientist have taken the risk and they have tri new thing . consequ , they have been success . the point i am tri to make is that the statement i had to discuss is bia . on the one hand , it is necessari for be success to discov new area , but on the other hand peopl can also be good in onli one thing . it just depend on the kind of person you are . all in all , i can not disagre or agre with thi statement , becaus for me both are veri import fact for be success !
