will there be fewer car in use in twenti year than there is today ? thi is an import question to which mani peopl would like to answer . we will see that some argument support thi idea and other doe not . the price of ga ha incread rais dure the last few year . thi made the fact of have a car not afford to mani peopl . if the price continu to increas ga will becom a veri luxuou product and it is not the car that will be expens , but the ga you use to make it work ! then there will be fewer car in use . thi tendanc is alreadi there , becaus some peopl have a car but do not use them as often as they did becaus they can not buy the ga . a big problem that we have nowaday is pollut . becaus of that mani decis have to be taken in order to prevent the planet from die . one sourc of pollut is the ga that get out of the car . some citi alreadi took mesur in order to protect their area and their environ , such as london . now you have to pay to get into the citi . then mani peopl let their car outsid of the citi and take the bu , which pollut less becaus more peopl use it at onc . anoth exampl is what you can find in the unit state . on the motorway some line are onli for car with at least two peopl insid . and most of the time these line are the fastest ! it then encourag peopl to share their car . then we can see that have less car in use will probabl becom necessari if we want our planet to surviv . on the other hand peopl need to use their car more and more . the main explan is that nowaday you chang job veri often and peopl travel more . if someon ha a job , buy a hous and a car , what should he do if he chang job ? should he buy a new hous each time ? it is not a realist solut . he will have to use hi car to go to work . there is not onli for the job that you need your car . peopl like to do mani cultur activ or they like to travel . for all of that most of the time you need a car . for all thi reason of freedom and independ , it is not sure that there will be fewer car in the next twenti year . i think that it is possibl that there will be fewer car in twenti year becaus of the price of the ga and the pollut problem . it will becom a necess for the planet . on the other hand as peopl realli need their car , noth will chang unless some measur are taken such as better public transport , but not onli in one citi but within them , without forget land and veri small town .
