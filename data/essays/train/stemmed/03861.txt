i disagre with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . in fact i think it is much more better to be special in one subject , in order to plan a better carreer and be realli good at it . first of all , when a student appli to an univers , he should have alreadi thought care on which is the subject he like most . at the high school he had time to studi sever subject and evalu which is the right one to choos at the univers . consequ , in my opinion an accadem student would not need to spend more time on studi mani subject and focu on a specif one . the second reason whi it is better to focu on one subject is that in thi way the student will not get confus among a lot of differ data to rememb : if you studi just one subject , it is easier to collect and organ all the notion you get and like that you will know better and deepli the subject . last , but not least , i think that if you know exactli which carreer you want to tri and put all yourself in thi purpos , you will not get distract by anyth els and you will reach your goal , the degre , much more faster . your passion for that specif subject will lead you to the success if you are realli concentr in what you are studi . in conclus , i support the idea that it better tho choos one academ subject than to studi mani of them , becaus an academ student ha to be sure about what he want to be in the futur . if he focus himself on just one subject , he can studi it better and faster and becom a better member of the societi .
