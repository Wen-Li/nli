there is some student who prefer to studi without understand the princip idea and concept of what he is studi , becaus he think that it is unhelpful or also a waist of time ; other student , in the opposit way , prefer to pay more attent on the concept rather than on the mere fact . i am in thi second group for mani reason , whose the princip one are three . the first reason is that i am not so abl to studi by heart , becaus of my often fail memori . therefor i prefer to studi the logic process , the reason and the link of differ event , rather than the mere fact and inform about them . for exampl , studi histori , i prefer to learn about the caus of a fact , while it is more difficult to me to studi date or event . the second reason , that can be link with the previous one , is that , when a student understand the logic base and the reason of variou fact , it will becom easier to him to learn the fact that deriv from that becaus he make on hi brain a logic map of all the argument he is studi . in histori , for exampl , it is help to understand what event caus anoth one , and whi ; in thi way , it is easier to learn that the first one occur befor the second one , and thu it is easier to learn date . the last princip reason that make me sure about my agreement with the statement is that to understand what a student is studi is more helpful for him , not onli for the graduat , but also and mostli for hi life . in fact to understand someth that also is not interest improv peopl 's mind , and we can becom smarter . to sum up , though somebodi think that we can learn onli the fact from what we are studi , i am sure that it is more import and product to understand idea and concept , and sometim it is also necessari to me !
