in these day , the number of advertis are increas becaus of technolog develop . i believ most of these advertis make product seem better becaus they onli talk about good thing about their product and also they use attract thing , such as peopl , to fascin peopl . sinc advertis onli show benefit of that product , it seem much attract to peopl . for exampl , my mother want to by a new vaccum . when she wa wathch tv show , there wa a commerci about new vaccum . it said '' thi is realli power and use ! you should buy one !! '' or that sort of thing . my mother wa fascin by that and next day , she went to the store and bought one . when she use it , she wa realli shock . although it wa realli power , it made realli loud nois and exhal stinct air . she wa realli mad that the advertis did not say anyth about the nois . also sinc advertis are to attract peopl , they tri to make those nicer , which result to make product seem much better than they realli are . for exampl , there wa a new kind of cd player when i wa 12 year old . i did not want to buy it sinc i had one alreadi . howev , i saw a commerci about it on tv and my favor actoress wa advertis it ! and it seem for me it is realli cool to have it and i if i had it , it would make me prettier . next day , i run to the store and boughr it . howev , it wa realli useless and it look more plastic than the one that actress had . therefor i have never use it befor . in conclus , i believ most advertis make good to seem nicer than they realli are becaus advertis onli provid good inform about product and also these tri to make peopl to buy their product by use attract peopl .
