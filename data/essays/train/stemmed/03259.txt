the topic at hand is whether it is better , have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject or detail and special knowledg of one particular subject . i feel that depend upon the scope of applic of the knowledg of a person , the requir can be broad or specif . the reason are as follow : certain profess for exampl that of a medic practition , requir him to have a broad base knowledg of the human bodi , the interlik between variou part and what effect a medicin for a particular diseas could have on ani otherbodi part . softwar profession on the other hand donot necessarili need to have broad base knowledg of the function of the comput or it part . for them a special in program languag , web page design etc is what is requir . basic it is the applic of the knowledg and use innov that is import . for the case of a doctor , the more he know the better he appli the overal knowledg . then teacher of physic scienc for exampl need to have proper knowledg of subject like physic , chemistri , mathemat , so that they are abl to impart knowledg in a comprehens way to the student and not poder over the doubt of the student . a chemist or a molecular bilogist need to have special knowledg on the specif field , but less of other academ disciplin . student on the other hand need to have broad base knowledg upto a certain level of educaton wherein all those subject are address to which may find applic , though not in great detail ahead in hi proffession career or practic life . after a certain level it depend upon the career path of the student , whether he choos to special on a subject or increas hi rang of broad base knowledg . due to the endless ken of knowledg that could be accumul , the natur of knowledg that could be possess realli depend upon the task at hand , the purpos for which it is requir .
