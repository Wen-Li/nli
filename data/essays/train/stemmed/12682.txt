some peopl may say that they need to broaden their knowledg in mani differ subject to get more chanc . but i believ that it is more import to be special in one specif subject than know littl about everyt becaus of two reason . which is that it is a wast of time and effort and that the compani want a specialist in certain field . first of all , stude all the subject that you do n't need is a wast of time and effort . peopl are live in a busi life and i think that they should put these effort and time to their major . for exampl , in korean high school we have a lot of subject that you do n't realli need . student do n't understand whi they are learn thi but they are studi for these subject just becaus of the exam . i think that student should instead put their time and effort in the fun activ or hobbi that they like to do . secondli , theseday the compani need specialist who are good at one specif field . thi is becom popular becaus most of the colleg have mani program that the student can just get into colleg with one subject that they are realli good at . these subject can be such as comput skill , launguag abil , art and ect . thu , if you are way better at english than most of your friend , you can develop on your languag skill to be better at it and you will becom a specialist that mani compani want to hire . becaus of these reason i think that have a subject which you are extrem good at is better than be just good at mani subject . i believ that each everi one ha differ interest and talent which should be encourag to be develop .
