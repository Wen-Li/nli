in modern world , we learn almost everi subject until univers . and mani student who graduat univers are complain about thi educ system . becaus when they get a job , they do n't use mani knowledg they learn in school . i can understand their opinion . in some part i agre with that . howev , it ca n't be a reason that we just have to learn one specif subject . learn varieti of knowledg is veri help for the peopl to be a specialist in some area . if someon want to be a biologist , he need to experi other subject . mathemat , literatur , athlet . . etc . .. after he experi these area he can be found hi special gift in biolog . unless he did n't experi these area he could n't overcom hi barrier that will face some day . he can think that he may can do other work even though he is not sure about hi gift in that area . especi in law , if you imagin about lack of knowledg about other subject , it can be uneffect . law is the subject to constitut the social system . it is relat with all part of the world . it affect the peopl 's life . judg 's narrow mind can be bias in one side . and there will be a lot of chao in public . i think balanc is the most import element for the well-organ societi . for the balanc onli one subject kowledg doe n't work well
