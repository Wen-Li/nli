i desagre with that statement . i have some reason . first , if we travel in a group with tour guid , we can not go where we want to . i want to visit some place ani parson ha not visit or there are few peopl . i have been to philippin as a volunt . when i wa there i could not go where i want to , becaus i must have work . i think it is similar to group travel . also , i prefer to talk with a person who ha differ cultur and opinion . if i travel in a group , there is no chanc i talk some foreign peopl . i want to spread my view about everyth . i think that travel by mysefl is good chanc for talk with mani differ peopl in the world . of cours , there are mani kind of peopl in my countri . but i want to see someon who can not come to my countri . third , i think it is good for us to think about place where we will visit . by think of unknown countri or citi , i think we can learn the counrti or citi narurali . so i like travel
