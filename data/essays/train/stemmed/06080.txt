first of all , have broad knowledg in mani academ subject is necessari to be abl to understand the world we live in , particularli the econom , polit and social issu . inde , broad knowledg of mani academ subject , which are espaci tought at school and at the univers , allow you to get a gener and person cultur of almost everi subject , like histori , geographi or literratur . of cours , in that way you can not be a specialist of all those subject , but at least you can discuss with peopl and have your own opinion about thing . on top of that , broad knowledg of mani academ subject make you more matur and confid to start learn additionn specif subject . it is , then , necesari to have thi gener knowledg to be abl to go on . howev , special in on specif subject make you more perform on a specif topic you are interest in , and allow you to enhanc your own skill by make research or read magazin about it . thu , you becom a specialist of the subject and may be the best in that subject . besid , when you are special and mayb passionn about someth , you can tri to find a job relat to your special and be good at it . as for me , the both statement express in that sentenc are both correct and necessari . inde , as we wo n't never be awar of all the subject , it is the best to have broad knowledg about the most possibl thing , to be abl to understand the issu , the problem and more gener the world . but then , we should special in a subject we realli like , in order to concentr on a personn interest and to improv our knowledg about a specif topic . that is whi , the best for me would be to combin both of those aspect that is to say first learn the most academ subject we can to be abl , then , to special and be good in a specif subject .
