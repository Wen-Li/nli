i do agre with that statment becaus an advertis is all about bay a product what ever it is , so the advertis ha to show the positv aspect about the product and hide the neg aspect of it end with an advertis about a product that is much better than the product it self , not to mention that the advertis is get hi pay check when the advertis is realli good and help a lot sell that product . first , the advertisor 's job is to help the murchent who is sell that product to enhanc hi sell rate and one of the method to do that is to show the peopl all the posit and hide all the neg of that product for exampl , when advertis for a car , the advertisor show the peopl who is that car beauti and smooth look and on the other hand she/h would hide a fact such as that car is a high ga consum one . anoth thing is that the advertisor ha the motiv to cheat and tri to make a great advertis out of ani product even if it wa not , becaus when the process of advertis function veri well the advertis bussi will flourish and the advertis will be abl to ask for higher price . as a result of what ha been said i think that the whole idea of advertis plu all the element that interfear with the advertis busi end up have an advertis of a product that is realli more than fair for that product .
