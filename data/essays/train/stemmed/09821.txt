nowaday the speed of develop is becom faster and faster , so mani think that no more car are use in the futur that are substitut to other vehecl . i somewhat agre that the new devic will be develop for transport but doubt on fewer car in twenti year . first of all , 20 year is not so far from now . 20 year are not enough to invent a new vehecl and replac car . air plane that are alreadi develop long time ago but can not replac car effect . even thought they are faster that car , peopl do not own plane becaus they are expens and huge to keep . in addit current suveri show that the number of manufact car is increas more than 15 percent each year due to develop countri . it indic that the number of car doe not seem to be decreas in the near futur . on top of that , new way of car are research and develop in order to overcom the drawback of car , in particular air pollut . variou method of power are implemet such as hydrogen , water , and electron power that are not harm to environ . actual environ argu that use of car is restrict . therefor if non-pollut car is develop , peopl would not restrict the increas in car . therefor i disagre that car are diminish in twenti year becaus the period is too short to chang the role of car and replac to other . in addit the new method of preserv air pollut will be develop so peopl do not need to worri about the use of car in the futur .
