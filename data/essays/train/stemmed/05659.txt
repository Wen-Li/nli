i think that most advertismrnt do make a product seem batter then what they realli are . for exampel , we see some product that will make you storng or even make you slim without ani affort , and then affter use it , we onli find out that it wa not true what ever the advrtis say about that product . anoth exmapel is in the advertis that show us how simpl it is to use a product and then , we find out affter get it how complex it is to use , or even the thing we discov that they did not mantion in there advertis it is like a fine print in a contract , you will onli see it when it is too late thi prblem had happend to most of us , one may alway recal see someth on televisson and then rune to the nearset shop to buy it , and then be suppris on how difrrent the product is from what he thught it will be . in thi way more pepol will lose there trust and interest in advrtis and the real good compani that put good product in the market will lose alot of mony as pepol do n't trust advetis ani more but on the other hand some advetis are not misslead and what thay show are ture , so it is realli hard for us to tell the good and true advertis form the bad . so i think that what shloud be done is some orgniz that have to examen the product and see the advertis for that product and comper if what thay see is the same of what thay have , in thi way the consum is protect as will as the good compani that realli give what they show . now a day the best way to do thing is to be true to other and not lie it is the best way to live whith each other .
