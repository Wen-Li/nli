in my opinion , is more import for student , to understand idea and concept than learn or memor concept . when i wa a kid , my sort of educ wa in a clasroom with my teacher and everyday memor and memor topic in spanish , mathemat and scienc topic . thi kind of educ is a tradit method becaus you go to the school to get knowledg through the experi and to understand whi the thing happen ? and not onli to memor 3 or 2 book and date , for exampl in the histori class is too common to memor all the date that happen in the second world war , and now tell if you rememb some of them ? , sincerli i think your respons will be : no . thi is the problem , if in the school and mayb our parent had taught us , the import to undertand whi the thing happen ? mayb , the young peopl at thi moment would't have a lot of problem and would n't be upset for the school . if we know utopi about the educ system and theori for exampl for montessori or freinet , we can check that they taugh us that the educ of a child ( in thi case ) begin in the hous and the school is a complement of the educ and it is a place where the child develop her or hi motric and intelectu form base in understand idea and not onli in learn fact . other exampl is the piaget theori who told us , that the educ is base in the experi that you are get along your life . now a day , the educ system alreadi have chang in our countri for exampl the use of internet , in order to make easier to undertand the knowledg and an opportun for young gener to be succes in ani area . my conclus is the follow : you have to learn everyth that you need but is better to undertand , everyth that you want .
