travel with a guid as a good influenc for tourism is one of the major way peopl use to enjoy their trip . my agreement is account to the best way to travel in group led by a tour guid . travel to a foriegn countri or a well known countri is complet the same . in both case enjoy is sought . whi we need a guid in our trip ? in my opinion the guid is more elig to know the most rare and magnificint place which not well know even by local resid in that countri . howev , other may prefer tourism with out a guid for financi purps . a lot of tourism seeker discov laterli after their trip that they have spent more than they hould just becaus they did not hire an erudit guid to give them the pleasur they want along with a cheap price . guider mostli never fruad on tourist unless unknown guid from unknown compani wa use . all the guider are respect and have a special care about their reput . although , some of my friend said the guider are lazi in some place , they are veri energet in other place . some place need a special skill to go their . otherwis , life risk shell be consid . thu , guider usual are well train face a posibl danger and show the tourist the best way to see the place with a minimum risk . in addit , out side trip the one like in suburban or out side the citi may expos the touror to a risk of be rob . in thi case guider usual have wireless devic to report the accid and have the robber caought with out ani danger or risk deal with the situat . at last the pragmaticali step peopl should do is to use assist from tour guid when they need to make a trip . all the reason i have mention are convini to peopl use the tour guid befor at most . few unsatisfi peopl are present , but that doe not meat we should travel alon with out ani experi or knowledg about the place we intend to visit , the guid do .
