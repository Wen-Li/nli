in my opinion there will be fewer car than today within twenti year of time . the reason for thi shall either be with restrict of govern or with peopl own choic . first of all the earth , which is the onli proof place that we can provid our live , have been and continu to be pollut a lot start from the industri develop day . car , which look like a must for most peopl , are result of those developmet . increas of car usag shall increas pollut of ga and sound which i believ human be shall not stand ani more . to solv that there shall be some restrict on usag of car , on kind of the ga they will use or sound remov etc . secondli the natur sourc of the earth are decreas with the effect of popul incres . which mean that more peopl shall need more natur resourc to cook their food or to be heat instead of go to their work by their own car . i do n't think that there will be direct limit depend on thi topic but the ga price shall increas day by day on such level that peopl shall be forc to make such a decis . addit again with some depend to the abov mention popul increas reason space on earth for each peopl is also get decreas day by day . peopl need home to leav and peopl need offic to work . as long as they use their own car they will also need place to park their car . increas of all need with same degre shall again forc peopl to make a decis which shall support my opinion . final and most imporantli , i believ that peopl shall prefer not to have their own car for their mental health . spend most of their time sit in a car and go no where in the traffic jam or again spend lot of time for tri to find a place for park , are alreadi make them unhappi and aggress in today world i believ increas of these spend time in each day shall make them worser and forc them to decid not to have their own car or even sell the one they have .
