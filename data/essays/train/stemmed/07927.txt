i agre thi satement . peopl alway tri to do the thing they alredi know how to do well . but that can not make peopl more creativ or be more success . if peopl do not tri the new thing how can they know their `` true '' abil . we can see lot of success peopl talk about their experi . if they alway do the the thing they know they can be the present them . just as an actor , he can not alway preform the same style of movi . therefor he can be style by the auddienc . the auddienc will know that `` that is the limit of hi prefrom . if the person alway do the same thing that he alreadi can do well , he wo n't get ani growth of himself . becaus he wo n't know what 's wrong or where he shall chang . or what can make himself better . sometim , i would limit by thi thought . i just want to do what i can do well . i have no confid to do the other thing that i do not famliar with . by that way , i can not learn other knowledg that i do not know . i think japanes is the good exampl for the success peopl or the race alway tri new thing . they make lot of new product that can connect with life . and the compani like `` 3m '' , the compani make the product like `` post-it '' . they tri new thing that the common peopl wo n't even think about . they make money by they can take risk . befor make the product , they wo n't know if everyon can adapt those product . but they want to tri about it . they want to make new thing that everybodi do not see or hear befor . that is way i agre about that success peopl alway tri new thing and take risk . just becaus they can see the profit or commerci in it . if peopl not tri new thing , they will be limit by themselv . they can not know where is their extrem .
