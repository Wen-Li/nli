today , it is enough for a lot of student to learn fact about certain issu and topic onli . in my opinion it is not enough to learn fact onli . a student ha to focu on how to understand an idea and a concept . first of all , a student should understand an idea to build up hi own opinion . he gather idea of sever peopl and tri to make up hi own mind . understand the idea give the student oppurtun like duscuss about it and creat other idea . anoth import point is the understand of a concept . when a student understand a concept he can transfer thi pattern to other issu and compar and contrast them or add inform . also , he can modifi differ thing which he doe n't like about it . learn fact doe n't give student the possibl to consid whether a fact is good or not . he just learn it and doesnt even think about it . in contrast , understand idea and concept allow a student to discuss and talk about it becaus he ha enough inform about a topic . besid thi , a fact is not modify that mean that a student might talk about it but he ca n't add inform . a fact repres statist or particular issu which ca n't help student to transfer idea or concept on other thing . understand idea and concept make it possibl to spread out your knowledg on other field . for exampl , a student should be abl to use the idea and concept , which he learn dure the lesson , to creat other sentecn in a exam .
