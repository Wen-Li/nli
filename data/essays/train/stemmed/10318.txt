nowday the labour market is caracteris by an increas of specialis . with the ost , the organis of the product chang . everyon ha hi own task . accord to thi we could imagin that the specialis in one specif subject should be better . howev it is easi to see that you find a job more easili with mani academ grade than with a singl specialis as electron or mechan . in my opinion , to be effect you have to specialis , but you have to do it after have broad knowledg of ani academ subject . both are compat . first you have to know a lot about mani subject to act or to help at ani level of the product . you may be abl to check the viabil of what the other do . if you want to be recogn as a leader , a singl specilis is no sufici . i know my mind is so frenchi becaus peopl in usa for exampl don t think the same way . in franc we ve got an histor past . we live in a system base on the merit . napoleon is the symbol of thi system with the creation of the < class preparatoir > which are french specif . opposit to thi , usa is a land when you can start from stracth . you can have just a specialis in one specif subject if you are good a it . nobodi is go to blame you if don t know much about other subject . in my opinion we should make a balanc betzeen thi two way of think . i agre for the meritocrat system but if somebodi is good is on domain , we have to give him a chanc . to conclud we can argu that the specilis in one specif subject is in gener the vector of the developp of our world and by the evolut of evolut of the industri and technolog it is imposs to stop thi process .
