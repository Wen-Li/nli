' also , young peopl do not have to give time to help their commun . nowaday , peopl are busi to live . they have to work for their famili and themselv . it is hard to earn a live . peopl do not have enough time for themselv . how can they help other ? if they have enough time and money for their commun , it is okay to help other . howev , if they do not have time and money for their commun , there is no way to help other . human be are born selfish . they first think about themselv , their famili and their friend , not the peopl who are not relat to them . when there is enough time and money for them and for other , they may help other . but help thier commun is their choic . it is not peopl 's duti . howev , some peopl think it is our duti to help other and help our commun . it sound good , but it is hard to do . for exampl , a person who ha littl incom which bare afford hi or her famili take time to help the communitiy . it would be good for the commun , but the person 's famili will not eat their meal . help their commun can be possibl by the peopl who can afford their famili first . help their commun is not bad . it is good behavior , and also it is for all peopl , not onli for one or two . but to help their commun , the first thing to do is help themselv and their famili . help their commun from the heart can be done just when thier famili is happi . to help from the heart ,, peopl should take care of themselv and their famili first .
