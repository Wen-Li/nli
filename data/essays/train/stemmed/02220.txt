the question if it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ha been discuss alreadi quit often . in my opinion it is of greater import for student to understand idea and concept . the main reason for studi , espaci if seen from a humanist perspect , is to learn how to think freeli , put question and understand the concept of a subject . although fact might be crucial in profession life , everi singl job will probabl requir the knowledg of special differ fact . for exampl a businesswoman will work in a consult compani while the her former studi collegu will work in a bank . it is just imposs to includ all fact which are need in a curriculum of a career . therefor it is unavoid that everi newcom ha to get into the demand of a job individu and often start learn from scratch . as i have seen e.g. in my histori class you will veri like forget some fact but you will never forget the broad idea , for exampl the reason for a war or for the rise of the nazi . thi is much more import to know than to rememb everi date or the exact sequenc of some engish king . thi lead me to my next point . when you studi the idea of a subject you also learn the abil of how to do research and where to find fact . therefor i think it is not fundament to know everi fact but rather to know where you can find the fact . sever peopl go as far as state that it is actual not import at all what kind of content you learn at univers , but that you learn how to do research , how to write paper , how to solv academ problem and how to work without be told everi singl step like in school . but thi is definitli onli true for the human and not for profess like doctor or physician . to summar , i prefer studi concept and idea becaus i think it will help me to develop more import and sustain skill than just fact .
