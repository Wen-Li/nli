i agre that most of the time advertis make product seem better than they are and i guess there are sever reason for thi . one of the main reason is that in most case , there are a number of similar product manifactur by differ compani that are in competit for be bought by costum . usual costum will want to choos the best product among the sever similar one , that is whi each brand will tri to convinc potenti buyer that hi product is better than the other . for exampl , soap and deterg to use in a wash machin . everi advertis will show extrem dirti cloth becom spotless and the more incred the result is , the better the product is suppos to be . the point here is `` incred '' : no product can actual do what is show , but if compani a did a sincer advertis , nobodi would buy a 's product becaus `` it doe not clean cloth as good as the other do '' . that all come down to a sort of `` prison 's dilemma '' from game theori . it is a bit like dope in some sport : if nobodi use it , there would be a fair competit , but a singl person who choos not to use it put itself at a great disadvantag toward the other . one other big reason for make product seem better than they are , is the need to creat a desir in the potenti costum . the advertis 's goal is to make peopl feel that a certain item is so good and use that it is not possibl to live without it . so , even if at first peopl would think of that object as unnecessari , after some time they will feel the need to buy it . an exampl might be cell phone : until ten or fifteen year ago veri few peopl had a cell phone and the one who did not , did not even think about buy one becaus it would have been useless . now almost everybodi ha a cell phone , or even more than one , and they wonder how they did manag to live their live without it .
