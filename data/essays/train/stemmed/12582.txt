nowaday we can find lot of product in the market . in order to sell these product , there are also mani advertis . i do agre thi thi statement which say that most of advertis make product seem much beter than they realli are . first , for exampl when you see in televis some product , it attract you . then when you go shop and you bring thi product at home . but , when you tast it you are veri disapoint becaus you do not feel like the person on the advertis . you feel unhappi . it is true that sometim i buy product that i have seen in advertis . for exampl , last time i bought some yoghurt i saw in advertis , and it wa said that it is not too sweet . i do not tell you my dissatisfact when i put one spoon fo thi in my mouth . but it wa too sweet ! thu , the advertis lie . secondli , some advertis draw you attent becaus the pictur you see is veri pretti and attract . so you decid to find thi good you see and o the market where you can bring it . sometim what you see do not correspond to what you have seen in the advertis . i would like to state you one of my experi . i am not one of those who like to watch televis but when i put it on and decid to see some program i look even advertis . anyway , i saw a vaccum in advertis and decid to go and see it . of cours i intend to buy it . but i do not becaus it doe not look like what i saw , howev it wa exactli the same product . to conclud , i would just want to you awar of the fact that often advertis are not true . their aim is to make you buy thier product and to show attract thing . consequ , most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
