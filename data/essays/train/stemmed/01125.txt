i am total agre . in elementari school teacher show an old way to learn about everyth , special area of studi like histori , literatur , geographi , philosophi or civism ha taken by student like a bunch of name , date and fact that they have to memor . nowday i figur out that memor fact is not the best way to understand . in graduat school i had the oportuniti of take a lot of understand class that i can still rememb . the best way to learn and understand at the same time is do more than one read , consult more than one book or one opinion about someth so you can have more than one point of view . for exampl , if i have to investig about modern architectur may be i can talk about la vill savoy of le corbusi in poissi , franc , 1929 . but the onli thing i am do there is take some inform that alreadi exist and write it down in my paper . that is just a transcript . but in stead of that if i tri to understand the philosoph fundament of the modern movement , the reason of le corbusi that made him design a difer kind of build ( never seem until that year ) and explain the origin and reason of thi architectur i will sure explain to everybodi , includ mysefl the result of my investig make not just rememb it but know the who , when , and most import of al , the whi . so i definitli think it is more import for student ( and for life if you think a littl more about it ) to understand idea and concept . it is known that a good student is the one who can explain himself all kind of concept that the one who just ha memor a lot of inform that ast least it worthless .
