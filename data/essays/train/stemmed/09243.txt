car are veri import for our societi . it ensur our mobil which becom more and more import in these day . so car becam an import part of our world . but how will the situat be in twenti year ? in mani countri in africa or south america , often call the third world , car are not as import as in europ or as in the unit state . but in the last year more and more peopl get car becuas they becom more import . the number of car increas everi year and even the increas rate becom higher . so there is no end in sight . it is certain that in the third world will be much more car than today . but what is the situat in the so call `` western world '' ? fifti year ago car were luxu . but today a car bellong to life standard . onli few famili have no car and the product of cheap small car like the smart enforc the develop to have more than one car . so also in the western world the number of car increas . but it is on a high level , so perhap the growth will stop in a few year . but there are no sign that the situat will turn to fewer car . less visibl , but nonetheless import is the situat of the street . all over the world street becom better and better . thi lead to a more comfort feel in your car what final lead to more car . but i think the crucial question is not how mani car we can count per person . the question is how mani peopl will live on the world in twenti year . at the moment the popul grow veri fast . dure the last twenti year the popul increas of about 70 % . it is not certain if the growth remain as high but sure is : popul will grow ! and more peopl buy more car . as a result i ca n't agre with the statement . i think there are no doubt that the number of car will becom much higher .
