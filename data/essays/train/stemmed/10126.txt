success peopl alway challeg new thing rather than do what they alreadi know how to do . in other word , those who do not take risk will never succeed . first of all , peopl can get use to a varieti of thing if they alway tri new thing . it would be help to commun with a person whom they do not know at all becaus it is much easier for them to choos a common topic between them than for those who do not tri new thing at all . as commun is absolut requir to succeed in societi , where peop live togeth , thi is one of the reason whi peopl ought to tri variou thing to succeed . in addit to that , peopl who alway tri out for a lot of thing are abl to deal with unexpect situat . sinc they tri new thing and have much more knowlegd than other peopl , it is more like for them to be abl to solv unexpect problem than other . secondli , as a proverb say , failur is mother of success . even success peopl are just human be . thu , they do make mistak and failur some time . by learn how to fail , howev , they can make use of the experi for their next challeng so that they will not fail next time . therefor , success peopl need to be intelleg enough to convert their failur to success . lastli , tri out for new thing can bring opportun to find a person 's possibl . it is not rare at all that a person find what he is good at at age of thirti when he tri out for a new thing . my experi would support thi idea . current , i am senior at high school . at the begin year of the high school , i wa so good at math that i reciev math award from math teacher . thu , i wa plan to major in math at univers and colleg . next year , howev , i took the `` concert band '' class , which is a music class for brass and woodwind instrument . sinc the begin of the class , i have been veri much into it , and i am right now well enough to be chosen for the top eight musician of my school . thi ha total chang my mind for futur , and i am plan to major in music at an american univers right now . what i mention here is that if i had not tri out for the music , i would not have found the possibl of my music talent . in a way , i am now a success person becaus i know what i can do well by learn from the challeng to the new thing . i am not go to stop tri out for new thing , and i am now plan to do a lot of music thing , such as mix , record and composit . in conclus , success peopl alway take risk and tri new thing to seek for their possibl .
