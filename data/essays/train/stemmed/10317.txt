the issu at hand is if young peopl nowaday particip enough in help their commun . thi issu is import becaus it is directli relat to our daili habit . in my view young peopl do not take the time to help their commun becaus they have other responsabilti to take care of first . first , young peopl first think to their oblig . school ha taken an import part in our student life which can not be neglict . the work requir from school is so abond that it make more difficult for student to bring their help for their commun . i think that can be consid as an eventu explan of whi young peopl do not give enough time for support their commun . secondli , we are live in a societi where appear more and more distract . young peopl prefer get some relax after school rather than get involv to anoth thing . help commun requir involv and concentr which can be consid as similar as school so it is not realli restful . thi point show anoth aternalt to explain thi fact . additionn , as it ha been mention previous commun requir involv from us which mean that we also have to be interest in what they are goin to undertak . the subject or the action might just interest young peopl . for exampl , if our commun want to prevent from steal or breakinf hous they will need volunt . if nobodi ha encount that kind of problem , they might not be interesst in get involv to thi . therefor not a lot of peopl will be in . thi can be anoth aspect of the lack of yound peopl in help their commun . to sum it up , their involv at school , the fact that there are more and more distract and final that the action made by the commun may not interest young peopl can affect their involv . howev , they should have a look at it when live in commun .
