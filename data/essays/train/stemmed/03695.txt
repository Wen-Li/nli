gener speak , i agre with the statement . in my opinion it ha gotten harder for young peopl to get involv in commun activ . it is true that less an less young peopl particip in activ of their commun , but there are reason to do so . first of all , i think that the expect of a young person 's environ , especi parent and teacher , are veri high nowaday . it is expect from a young person to earn good grade at school or at colleg , to particip in extra curricular activ to show a wide rang of interest and mani young peopl have to work after school to earn their spend money . there is not much time left to engag social . besid , in our societi young peopl are told everywher to have fun rather than be social engag . thi rais young peopl 's expect as well . but i believ , that most young peopl can not be held respons for want to live like they are told to by the media and their environ . in other cultur young peopl do not experi the same kind of freedom young peopl in the usa have . often they are told to take care of famili member or friend , which is a social engag as well . in the western civilis the famili structur and social connect have been weaken over the last decad , which might also be a reason for decreas interest in social work . so the problem of the declin number of young peopl who give time to help their commun is overal a societ problem , that ha to be dealt with , becaus there is still a necess to encourag young peopl to engag social . communit often depend on peopl , especi young one , who are not paid for the work they do . moreov , it can be a lot of fun , be an activ part of a commun . it is alway a way to meet a lot of peopl who share your interest and it can be veri inspir to work with elderli peopl , for exampl . young peopl can lern a lot from them .
