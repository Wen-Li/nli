when we talk about success peopl the first thing come into my mind are scientist , inventor , person who is a pioneer in hi special , and mani other exampl , and as we can see the common factor between all of them is that they all start new thing and ofcours took great risk to do them . so i total agre that success peopl do tri new thing rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well , although some may be success by do thi but in my opinion they are not as success as the pioneer one or even close to them . there are mani factor that i thing result in make those peopl more success than other , for exampl , when they start someth new , they have veri minim or almost no competitor in the feild they are tri to do somth in , even if there are competitor they still tri as they do . anoth issu is that when somebodi is invent someth new for exampl he will have the opportun to be a legend for the whole world becaus simpli if he succeed everybodi after will follow , use or adapt hi invent and he may be rememb for thi for centuri even after he die and thi is a great success . anoth issu is that make me feel that they are more success is the amount of work they do , they tri harder and harder to come up eith new idea and thi requir great effort and caus high appreci of there work un like the lower amount of work need by alreadi known thing even though there are risk for them not to succeed , becaus it is not someth anybodi have ever tri to do or even thought about , i thinkl that you will do noth new if you did not do risk . so with all appreci to those who are do alreadi known thing i do think that those who tri new intrest thing and take that risk are the real successful peopl .
