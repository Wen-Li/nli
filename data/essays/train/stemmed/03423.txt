when face the question of whether to grasp more than one specif subject , peopl alway are divid into two group , one of which agre to learn broad knowledg of mani academ subject , howev , the other of which beliv that we should concentr on one specif subject . in my opinion , master broad knowledg is the better choic . my reason are present as follow . first , learn variou knowledg is benefici to an individu in modern societi . now we live in a changeabl world , in which technolog rapidli is develop . thi chang gener the chang of our life style . for exampl , comput ha enter our normal life and we hardli work without it . but some year ago , peopl did not know what it wa . if we just stay on one specif subject and fail to learn knowledg about comput , how can we live normal in thi societi . so , the current societi situat requir us to grasp mani use knowleg of differ subject and keep to refresh them . second , peopl that own broad knowledg alway look smart becaus they may be enlighten by anoth subject knowledg . hold differ knowledg can enhanc the think abil and rais the way in which peopl think and act . when a person encout a big difficulti on a subject , he may obtain some inspir one day through focus on anoth subject that he/sh conduct . admittedli , focus on one specif subject may caus someon to research more deepli than dispers one 's concentr on variou subject . of cours , research should pay their attent on the specif subject . but , rearcher still learn other subject that are use in their live . in all , compar the advantag and disadvantag between have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and just have one specif academ one , i support my idea that peopl should learn variou subject knowledg rather than own one .
