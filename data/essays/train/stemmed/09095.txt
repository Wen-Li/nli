idea over fact the concept and idea that are essenti in the learn proce of ani academ proffes have to understand , and not memor . the learn process impli a thought , ration , and analysi ; all of them essenti in the absorpt of inform into our brain . i agre with thi statement becaus the understand of all those concept will beter prepar me in my proffes . i believ that the fact come as a direct result of the concept and idea that are learn in the academ prepat for a career . we would not have fact if it wa not for especif scienc like mathemat , chemistri , and physic . a fact is onli a seri of number of a certain event or peopl . that are thrown by the person that doe the recolect process of inform to do statist . with out the process of understand the concept and idea of a scienc we would not be abl to creat fact . for exampl we could be abl to count or do statist without mathemat . anoth perspect of fact is that we do not know if the fact are true or not ; the fact can be manipul by person or monetari interest . for exampl a pharmaceut compani may manipul fact of a certain diseas - to increas sale of the medicin that cure that particular diseas - to creat a higher revenu on the financi statement . i am not say that fact are not import . i use fact all the time in my profess and job . but , we do not have to make fact the foundat of our knowledg in thi world . a fact when it is given as an honestli , errorless , and doubtless sourc , it wil automat becom a most use tool in our day-to-day life . the better understand of idea and concept will make better fact and staticst in the near futur .
