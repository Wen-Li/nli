i agre with the statement `` most advertis make product seem mush better than they realli are . '' the first reason is that they are use the light and mani staff to make the product more color , freash , and tasti and show to costmor the photo . i had mani expriences about food . when i wa live in the domn , i wa hungri and lazi to cook by myself then i went market and bought some instant food . on the box , the pictur wa look like so nice , but after i went back home and ate . it wa so nasti . i just throw it in to trushcan . the second reason is that nowday everi compani want to sell their product to costmor to get more money , so no one want to say our product are n't veri good . it is mean they can be honest to costmo . they onli think about how to sell even they will cheat on costmor . overal , that is whi i beliv most advertis make product seem much better
