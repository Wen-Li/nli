car are the most convini way to travel . unlik public transport , you can go exectli where you want - without wait , without detour . if zou have a lot to transport , like a peac of furnatur you can just put it in the trunk - given that zour car is big enough . ride by bu would be veri impract , get through the door , find enough space . you might thing that the bu is ceaper , and mayb sometim it is , but as soon as you are n't travel alon the expens for the fuel can be share . time is also of import , even train bee veri fast travel from one citz to anoth , you normali need a lot of time until you reach your final destin . you will have to get a bu or subway , which may be late , and in the end you would have been quicker use a car . besid of be more practic , there is also a psycholog aspect to it . your car is someth you have earn , somth you can be proud of . and most import , it belong to you . so you are not quit in public when you drive your car . it 's like you are still on your own teritorri . and it is also a common symbol of statu , and who want to give that up ? i shure do not . of caus there are problem , like rise fuel price . but i think that way will be found to solv them . even today there are car which dont need fuel base on oil . so when the last oilwel dri out , the car wo n't lack of fuel - becaus when it happen car wo n't need fuel anymor . i think the car is so convini , and like by so mani of us , that we will find a solut to ani problem that might endang our belov automobil .
