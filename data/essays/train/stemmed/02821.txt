in my opinion it is right that not all but a lot of advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it often happen that you see a product for exampl in a televis ad or in a newspap and that you are disappoint when you have final bought it . sometim the advertis promis more than the product can fulfil . some year ago , in germani for exampl there have been a lot of advertis campain for cigarette-brand like `` marlboro '' . the advertis agenc tri to creat an imag of cool and an easi lifestyl by use cowboy smoke cigarett as presentor of thi imag . but everybodi know that smoke tobacco doe n't help to get an easier lifestyl . it caus diseas like cancer . therefor there are government restrict that secur the custom from be betray by compani . as a consequ televis spot of the cigarett industri are forbidden in europ . it depend on the industri how much exagger of the qualiti of a product is possibl . in the car industri for exampl where a lot of competit exist it is almost imposs to lie about a product . sell car ha a lot to do with trust to the peopl who sell the car . when a custom feel betray he wo n't return to buy anoth car . the fact to tri to make sure that a product seem better than it realli is is just natur . you ca n't critic advertis agenc when they tri to creat a veri posit imag of the product of their custom becaus that 's just what they are suppos to do . but sometim it happen that some peopl just do n't understand the messag of a advertis campaign becaus sometim they are too creativ and the advertis agenc are misunderstood by the custom . but in my opinion thi `` creativ '' advertis should onli be allow to the point when it doe n't mean betray or li to a custom .
