i disagre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . first of all it indic that young peopl in gener are indiffer to their commun . thi is not true . there is a huge amount of peopl who are engag in social work and the number is not decreas at all . quit the revers is happen . perhap due to the increas anonym in urban life and the declin of social secur in germani there are mani peopl who do not want to watch thi situat without do someth about it . addit young peopl might consid social engag as a good opportun to find new contact , make friend and acquir a sensibl task in their life , which especi young peopl often are still in search of . in spite of the gener made in the statement , i do agre that there is inde a larg amount of young peopl who do not care about help their commun . thi ha to my mind sever reason . first of all , grow up nowaday of dure the past 20 year , the role of the commun in everyday life ha decreas more and more . mani young peopl do not see the import or necess of commun . their aim in societi is obtain a good educ and achiev a success career . make thi possibl requir a lot of work and studi , which inevit lead to the neclect of such thing as voluntari work for the commun . howev , appli to a prestigiuo univers or a well paid job requir more than have good grade . it is also extrem import to have an impress cv , which prove that the person appli ha also spend hi or her spare time on help other peopl or the commun . therefor i think that even the young peopl who care more about their own benefit and career join in help their commun . to sum up the argument it can be state that although young peopl nowaday have an increas pressur concern their career , mani still take their time to help in ther commun . howev it can not be deni , that there are some black sheep be indiffer to these kind of social event .
