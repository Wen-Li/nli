teach ha arisen debat that are still today difficult to avoid when one ha to deal with educ , learn or train . one of these debat could be summar by the follow statement : ` it is more import for student to undertand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ' . somehow , thi debat recal the fight which oppos montesquieu and montaign dure the french renaiss on educ : the first one will a ` full brain ' for student while for the latter prevail a ` well made and shape brain ' for them . it is , i think , of a high import for student to understand and to have a veri clear and precis concept of idea or concept they deal with at school . the more you understand , the more you will be like to explain to other peopl the subject you are current work on . consequ , the basi of ani learn should lean on a good and clear understand of idea and concept . inde , fact are just a matter of memor , which is not a proof of a good understand , henc , it is possibl to know by heart the import date of the wwii without be abl to seiz the mean of thi particular strategi nor the consequ of that battl . fact must then be secondari for student . fact , which doe not mean that they are unnecessari or useless . as i said abov , fact are secondari which mean that they have their import in the learn process . student must reli on fact to better understand idea or concept they are deal with . for instanc , it is imposs to have a good comprehens of marxism or african decolonis in onli bear on idea or concept . fact are here to confirm or infirm theori . fact are help in the sens that they provid a pragmat approach to someth which ha so far onli be taken into a theoret way . a good combin between concept and fact must thu help student to have a global understand in what they deal with .
