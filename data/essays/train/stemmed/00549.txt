everyday we are forc to see all kind of advertis , from televis , from radio and even from our post letter . it give us million of inform , and defin we are influenc by the advertis more or less . howev , i have to say that most advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are . from advertis , peopl alway see the good look of the product . for exampl , the advertis of the famou brand shampoo , let 's just call it p. we can see the beauti long hair of mani ladi , shine and fall , it is easier for peopl believ that if we use the same product , we will have the same kind of hair . as a result , most of us can not have the same beauti hair as the model . advertis make the product seem much better than they realli are , anoth reason is that the advertis onli show the good point of the product , they never let you know the bad side of it . for exampl , there is a advertis about a vacum cleaner , in the advertis , you are told that it is power , easi to handl , and you are even show that how clean the room is after it is use , howev , after you buy it at home , after you actual tri it , you may find that it is too big to handl , and it take a larg space to store . i have a similar experi last winter . after the first month of the winter season , i wa unhappi to find the the ga charg wa extram higher than i expect , i notic from the televison advertis that there wa some kind of heater seemd veri good , it wa power , good look , and i went to the store and bought it at onc . after one day of use , i had to return it to the store becaus it made a lot of nois . i wa not told about the nois peoblem from the advertis . most advertis defin make peoduct seem much better than they realli are . that is the use of the advertis . so better check care befor you purchas someth .
