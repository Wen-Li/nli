ye . i think so it is not fine that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in on specif subject . becaus peopl have differ idea of their subject . some peopl go for differ subject like social and some peopl go for scienc . it depend apon how they studi . some peopl have broad knowledg of their academi subject . and other dont . their should be inform abot the academ what is the matter and what it matter . it all depend upon them . i prefer to go with broad knowledg of mani academ subject . becaus iy help us to have more knowledg about the subject and we can easili understand the subject . broad knowledg help us to discuss and share our opinion about a particular subject which mainli we choos . it is easi to specifi the subject with a broad knowled help to get good score in particular subject . so broad knowledg special and specifi the subject easili . so gain extra knowledg of subject is good . we know about the topic correctli and perfectli they we can futher proceed to next subject . thi is what advantag to us that we have mani inform about the subject and how it help us in studt . ex ; a person who ha a littl knowledg of subject get less mark . where as the other student have a good or broad knowledg about the subject will get more marek becaus it is better for the student to have broad think . so thi is onli whi the broad help us to allow us to collect more inform u can knowledg help us ti have broad knowledg of mani subject . it ok to choos a subject . i prefer it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject than one specif subject .
