advertis or brand is an import key in today world of busi , in fact , it becom veri essenti in sell ani product or item . most market organ or compani relay on brand or advertis to introduc their product to the market . most peopl are look for brand through advertis . most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my opinion i think that thi statement is complet true . although advertis gave the custom veri valuabl inform about the product he or she intend to buy , but that is not neccessari to give him the full inform he need and not to be nessessari ture 100 percent for mani reason : firstli , the advertis will be prepar by a specila staff or expert who is profession prepar to attact custom to buy their product . in other word it is matter of money first of all , but not nessessari qualiti . there is no gaurantte about effecineci or qualiti of the product unless it is veri big compani where brand name mean a lot to that specef compani . secondli , by use new advanc techolog method avail today for photographi , digit imag and print high technolog , the market compani can send strong messeg to custom , but that not nessessaryili will give them full detail about the brand or product . from my peron experi , i think it is matter of trust and loyalti to a specif compani . long time ago , i have receiv some advertis by mail about new type of shoe . the compani pretend in their advertisemnet that their shoe will be practic at all season and it will stay for long time and the photo includ in that advertis wa veri ipres . i wa convenc at that time and i have decid to buy that shoe . it come to my surpris when i have receiv my order , that type of shoe which i wa wait for is not what i am look for . it wa just nomal rubber shoe and it die not stay for long as they have said . of cousrs i get dissoponit in conclus , i would like to declar that brand or advertisemnt is as nesessarri tool in market but also make product much better than they realli are , especi by use high advanc technolog avail today .
