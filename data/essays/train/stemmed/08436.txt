nowaday , peopl tri to be success in everi way . for exampl big busi compani alway tri to open a new compani . i think thi lower the qualiti becaus you ca n't be concentr on a specif product , and you can use your whole effort on that subject . first , be concentr on a specif topic is veri import for a success life . thi specif topic could be everyth in our live . it could be in busi life , in academ life . for exampl , you will becom a boss of the biggest compani on your countri with mechan product for long vehicl . also you want show yourself to the other countri . you start to sell the farm product for gain more money but you could becom unsuccess becaus you do not know anyth about a farm product you do not have ani experinc abot farm product so how you could be success without these import fact . if you concentr on your major job mayb you could be the biggest in the world with your experinc . we could say also in academ world also you ca n't be a mechan engin teacher and a english literatur teacher in same time . after these specif exampl , we can make a result that you should focu on a specif subject . second , your effort is veri import in success . you alway make one job in a day than two job in a day for a defin success . for instanc , i never make good two thing in a day but i make a wonder one thing in that day becaus i use my all effort on one specif job . at the end , in my opinion , for be success in life you should be concentr on a specif subject and use your whole effort on that subject . there is a turkish speech like that : be an appl but best appl .
