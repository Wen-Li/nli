when you ask me , if i agre or disagre thi statement my answer would be : both . on the one hand are mani young peopl activ community-memb . they help for an exampl in sportclub , take care of older peopl or are in a polit parti . all these activ support the commun . on the other hand mani young peopl don `` t care about the commun . they are a kind of egoist and the reason vari . often you hear from young peopl that they don `` t have enough time to help their commun , becaus they have a lot of work to do . but i think thi is not the entir truth . some peopl are afraid of take responsibilti for someth or can `` t act in team . moreov they are think onli of time or money and forget that it can be a great feel to help other . mostli these peopl are great critic but they don `` t tri to improv thing by help . my guess is they are lazi too . advantag of help in your commun are that you meet interest peopl and learn some skill , like speak in front of a group or teamwork , that no teacher can teach you . although it cost you some leisur it can be fun . in summari i think it `` s good for your commun as well as for your charact to say ye to a task and help in a commun .
