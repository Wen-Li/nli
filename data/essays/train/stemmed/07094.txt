i disagre with the statement that say `` most advertis make there product seem much better than they realli are. '' for mani reason . one of the most simplest reason but most effect reson is that fals advertis is illeg in most countrey 's , if not in all countri 's . so it 's not veri intelig for someon to lie about the qualiti of a product . anoth veri logic reason is that all product compani ( no matter what the product is ) doesnt want the consum to dislik the product , or be surpris to what the product turn out to be after have high aspact to what it would be like , becaus the goal of an advertis is to make peopl want ot buy the product , and be happi with have it . if product arent as good as the advertis say the are , the reaction of the buyer would be not to buy . which is the exact opposit of the goal of an advertiv , and that will caus the product to fail in the market . if you ask peopl if they everi had bought someth that didnt meet the qualiti of it product , you will probibl find that most of the product accual meet to what wa said in the advertis . and the key word in the statement is `` most '' . so do most advertis make product seem much better that what they realli are ? ! i think not given the reason abov .
