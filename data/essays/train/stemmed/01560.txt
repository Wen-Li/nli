i agre with the statement for the follow three reason : first : be young impli still long time to live . young peopl are alway full of expect and hope becaus they know there is a lot to live for them , so they can make plan for the futur and hope these plan will come true . older peopl have shorter expect of life and for thi reason they are not as hope as young peopl . second : young peopl have alway more energi and a better healt . when peopl are young they can do a lot of thing , for exampl play sport , go to see new place , live far from home , go on long holiday , stay up all the night . they can do all of that becaus they never get tire and their healt help them to recoveri fast . when someon is old , for exampl , ca n't play sport becaus of hi bad health and would be riski for him to go on holiday in certain place such as desert or high mountain . the fear of die caus by their bad healt and their age make them act with more care and enjoy less the life . third : young peopl ha n't seen mani thing yet . thi give them the joy to live and to make new experi . if they are veri young they still have to fall in love and make a famili . thi two task make a young person more happi and full of hope . the idea of a famili is veri strong for young peopl and make them appreci the life . an old person have alreadi exerienc these thing and ca n't enjoy life as a younger person would . furthermor it is not the same if they fall in love again , as it wa the first time they did . for the previou three reason i think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
