the statement about most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i agre about thi point , i agre becaus thi is from my experi in my life , when i saw some new product advertis from the televioson , it alway attract me , and i felt a urag from myself , i want to own that product . i want to bacom the same as they show it on the televison , but when i saw them from the shop or when i purcheas them , i found not veri effect or same as they advertis . for exampl . the shampoo , we alway see the model show their hair in the advertis , it look like a fall . beauti , shin , but when you buy and use it , no doubt , toalli differ hair from the advertisemenrt , i think the same or similar exampl are not difficult to find in your life . so most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . so some peopl will say , it is fake , it destori the right of custom , but thi is a strateg of busi . when they use some comput techniqu to chang amd make much better than origin product , it will encourag their product an oppertun , peopl see their new product 's advertis and it appeal peopl , then thay will go to the shop , that is an oppertun to let the peopl `` feel '' their product and that can see what it is look like , they can touch that product and thay will considear about thay will to buy it or not . advertis is not a directli way to show the quanti of that product is good or not . it just want make interest of peopl and appeal tham , and let them know that product , and give an oppertun to touch and get close to their product . thi is an strateg of busniess .
