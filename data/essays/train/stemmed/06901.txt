the educ system should provid the student with the abil to assimil new idea and concept and comprehend their implic , rather than onli state the fact about a particular subject . the major reason for thi is the veri natur of the memori and the learn process . furthermor , in order to use the school knowledg in real life , student must have the capabl to analyz the concept . firstli , human be tend to forget the fact ; howev , if they analyz them and deriv their own conclus and idea , they rememb them for a long time . for exampl , in the histori class dure my high school educ , we were overexpos to a vast amount of histor fact and data , like the date and place of war , among which i rememb onli a few . in contrast , in my univers educ , i had the opportun to take histori class in which the student had to read a lot of articl about a certain topic . the read materi consist of divers opinion about a histor fact or argument . in the exam , the student were ask to present their own opinion by refer to the inform in the text , analyz them , and explain in detail whi they agre or disagre with certain part of them . i still rememb the argument and the reason behind them , which have been veri use not onli in my academ studi , but also daili life . secondli , mere memor the fact is insuffici to implement the school knowledg in real life , sinc it doe not entail origin and creativ . after the student graduat and start work in the industri or in their daili live , they are requir to come up with new idea and present solut to the problem . in order to accomplish thi , they have to have origin and creativ . the histori class in my univers educ have also provid me with thi abil . for instanc , while read the articl in the newspap , i can not onli understand , but also critic the writer 's argument in it histor and polit perspect . to conclud , i think that understand idea and concept is much more benefici for student than mere lean the fact . thi is both becaus they can rememb the inform much more easili and becaus they can implement their knowledg in real life situat through their origin and creativ .
