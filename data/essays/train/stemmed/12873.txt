in my opinion , accord to the statist in the past decad imigr to the big citi from suburban area is rapidli grow . i think that car becom more popular rela with thi citi lifestyl . meanwhil number of big metropolitian are increas year by year . i would like to draw an attent the reason of imigr such as huge potenti of unemploy , not enough support for agricultur and farmer , a huge gap between urban and suburban area educ system across the countri . so in big citi personel car becom a requir for those peopl . as i mention befor live in a big citi forc you to have a car to do everyth you want in thi lifestyl . besid it also account for traffic jam and big mass cao in citi that make peopl unabl to live in . on the other hand there are differ kind of public transport . in develop countri we can perceiv widespread usag of public transport . but if we look at the develop countri personel car usag is hiher rate becuas of insuffic public transport system . for exampl , istanbul is the biggest citi of turkey ; sinc last year i can not drive to work becaus there is alway an enorm traffic on highway do you think it would probabl chang ? no i do not think so . wherea technolog develop also provid a appropri platform for peopl to attract and make them to buy a new car . to sum up , in our rapidli chang and develop world to live witout a car would a utopia . the more money you earn , the more luxuri you need .
