i think it is import for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact . there are sever reason whi i think that way . the first reason is that in our current classroom we mostli emphazis lectur and forc to memor certain fact rather than to understand them . when we ask student if they learn someth their respons will be ye howev , they can not appli their kowledg to a new situat . they can not transfer their lnowedg , when they face with a differ problem they can not use their knowedg , the reason is that they just memor those isol fact . they can onli use in the same format they can not make connect . differ situat are challang for them and if the format have chnage everth seem differ to them . eventhogh they have lot of inform they can not use them . highli educ peopl becom illitur . the second reason whi i think we should emphas to understand is that you can learn someth but doe it mean that you understand it . for exampl you you can teach a kid how to tie but can you not teach them to understand someth . the onli think that you can do is that gener an environ where they can learn and understand someth . in an environ like that they can experi the richn of use their knowledg and earn satisfact with compet a task the last reason i want to mention is that the direct of educ is emphazis understand rather learn fact . of cours we should also use fact but not as we use now . what we did right now is give ton of inform . we see student as comput or store place and store all the inform in their brain . most of the student dislik physic algebra and core scienc class becaus they do not understand it . if we want scientif liter citizen , who can judeg the situat and can make plausibl chose we need chnage our educ system and have student understand idea and concept . otherwis we might have student with full of inform who can not use them . i do not think that is waht we want from them .
