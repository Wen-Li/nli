as far as i can see , thi statement is absoluti correct . learn or even memor fact might be useful and effect right in front of an examin if you just want to pass it . but if you want to obtain good result , memor will not help you win the day at all . let me clarifi thi . as soon as it come to similar topic which are onli associ with the content that you are familiar with , the one who onli learn fact will not be abl to answer the question as appropri as if he had learn the concept and idea behind the fact . but as far as you are familiar with the main idea , you will definet be abl to give brilliant answer as you onli need to transfer them onto the new topic . let me point thi out on an exampl . i work as an assist at the faculti of law at my univers . my job is to correct term paper on sever subject associ with labour law . within these paper student have to proof that they on the one hand have understood what wa lectur dure the semest and on the other hand that they are abl to transport thi knowledg onto new subject . in gener , i call a student `` smart and clever '' when he is capabl of transport knowledg to differ subject and develop hi own posit . unfortun i came recent to know that obvious pile of student have not realli understood what the profess tri to convey . reproduct of fact is quit bore to a teacher after have read them sever time . but transport of knowledg and use thi knowledg to evalu new problem is excit . therefor i would say , that memor fact is definet less import than understand the main concept and idea of the subject .
