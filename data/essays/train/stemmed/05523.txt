in my opinion , i do not agre with the assert becasu there are more opportun nowaday for young peopl to help their commun . with the advent of internet or other media , peopl have becom easil to get inform that their commun need them to help . for exampl , in my apart , the memeb of commite announc the advertis on our commun websit when they need peopl to help set up certain event . and they often receiv a lot of respons that say they would like to help . compar to the past , there are few peopl inform that they are need to help someth . thu , i contrarili think more and more yound peol involv in commun activi becasu they are more famili with the internet than the peopl befor , and understand they are in demand . in addit , in my shcool , univers alway encourag student to do someth that can benefit our commun or societi . for exampl , they are encourag to clean the street and help teach older peopl who are illiter to read . univers do not pay the student that do servic for commun . nevertheless , mani student often come to sign up for do thi kind of servic . perhap they will receiv award , such as a certif or a mendal instead of money . but after all , they do involv in and understandour societi and commun . when you broaden the scale to our societi , you can also see that there are more and more institut which encourag young pepl to help disabl peopl . for exampl , in my countri , we have `` sun shine '' ga station , which onli hire disabl peopl and young peol who are will to help those disabl . inconclus , i think that we have more chanc for young peopl to hlep our commun becasu there are more way they can choos to serv their own commun . thi can be seen whether at shcool or our societi or even in an apart comun .
