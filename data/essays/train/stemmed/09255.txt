i agre with the statement that it is more import to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my reason for thi are three fold . firstli , in my opinion , idea and fact are broder termsthan fact . therefor , when a student learn about idea and concept she \ he may also have the chanc to see the fact behind them . howev , if a student onli learn about a fact , he \ she would not be abl use thi fact when necessari . thi would be mainli becaus of the inabl of the student to make thi fact concret in her \ hi mind becaus of lack of idea and concept relat with thi fact . secondli , learn a fact alon would not probabl take the attent of the student veri much . howev , in oder to motiv student to learn more about their field of studi , the topic of their studi should be interest . most probabl an interest lesson would help student to be more will and more motiv to make further research and investig about that topic . in that way , understand idea and concept rather than mere learn fact would help student to develop themselv as well . thirdli , to my point of view , understand idea and concept make student more creativ . if they undertand idea and concept about a topic \ then they can appli them into their live . for exampl , they can develop new theori . which can also make contribut to their field of studi . be creativ is a veri import aspect and of an educ system . due to that reason , understand idea and concept would be critiic in the person develop of a student . ultim , for all of the reason i have mention abov , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
