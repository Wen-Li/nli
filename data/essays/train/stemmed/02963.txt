i think it is a veri positiv point of view and i complitli support it . onli lazi poepl sit on what they have , and look where they are at . .. i think that you do not lose ani thing except a littl bit of money by tri new thing . what i mean is that you actuali have a lot of chanc to fail but if you success you can make a lot of money and that is how poepl see you . i would have to take for exampl for thi point mr. bill gate who ha tri to revolution comput and as result he is the wealthyest person on the planet . i could also take my mother as an exampl , everytim she tri a new recepi , it is not alway good but thi way she get better . becaus i can tell her what went wrong or what should she add . could you imagin a world where no one would neither invent nor chang anyth ? that world would be the lazi 's world . i would get bore after one second . one day someon told me : '' it is by make mistak that you will get better '' and until now noth ha prove him wrong ! he also sed : '' you can never fail , the onli thing you can do wrong is not to tri ! '' i ' actuali glad i met that person becaus sinc then , i have just been go forward in life and in sport . after that i think it is also a way of life and i think some poepl or born with desir and some are not . i have rarelli seen poepl learn that kind of thing . i am go to have to take my brother as exampl : my parent and i think he is talent in a lot of thing but he just doe not expend hi knowledg .
