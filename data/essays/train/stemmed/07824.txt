`` human mind ha alway had the unsatisfi hunger for knowledg '' . we alway tri to grasp the thing go around him us the natur . we tri to better understand our environ or surround by observ and learn from it . it is thi compuls to learn everyth that lead us to the stage we are now . without the spirit of the man to studi everyth he see we would not have made the advanc in our social life . have the broader knowledg about mani academ is better in some way becaus knowledg about one subject lead to the better understand about other subject . as in the case of physic and math . the subject of physic would look like a japanes to an amatu if he doe not have the background of math becaus everi calcul done in physic involv math . as goe for some other subject too . special in one subject involv intens train in specif area of field . peopl take up special onli on a particular subject would have limit knowledg about other subject . the would be do research onli on the given field and there would be no scope to further increas hi knowldg about other field . but have the knowledg about other subject would be quit useless too sometim . such as in the case of student do their colleg . if a histori student is ask to gain hi knowledg in physic it would be quit useless , becaus he would be confus about hi futur , whether he would end up work as a physicist or a historian . it would rather deviat the mind of the student from hi main ambit . take for instanc mani great scientist and research who have contribut immens in their respect field becaus of the like they had for they subject . therefor it is better to have a special in onli one academ subject becaus it help determin the futur of the student take it . as to what they would realli becom in the futur . it also gener the interest in the student so as to expand hi knowledg to the core of the subject .
