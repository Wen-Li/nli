the youth of today 's gener is much more involv and busi with hi individu life that sometim he fall short of the day . thi chang is preval in thi gener . but one should serv the commun as he is also the part of the same commun . i am in agreement with statement . the busi schedul of day to day life and their hectic time tabl hardli leav the peopl today to think of ani other activ rather than manag themselv . besid thi peopl are veri selfish nowaday and are onli concern about their own comfort and hardli concern to help the commun . commun are also imporatnat part of societi . but the peopl will not realis thi fact until it is made appar to them . some are busi in build their career , some are busi in the studi and some in thier profession life and they hardli give import to the commun servic . though these commun are establish to help them they hardli care about it . but when it come to benifit from these commun there are first in the que . they are also wealthi peopl in the societi who are onli busi in enjoy their life 's and spend money lavishli rather then spend a littl for a good caus . lack of time is not onli the reason whi peopl do not pay attent to extend help to the commun but also lack of interest . it time now that young peopl should understand the import of help these commun as they are part of it and help the commun will also get them good popular and success . help the commun is a feel good factor still for mani peopl as they activ particip in help the commun by do what all they can do . serv the commun is like serv to god . the need of the hour is young peopl apart from do their regular work should also feel that serv the commun is also part of their schedul and then onli they can prosper .
