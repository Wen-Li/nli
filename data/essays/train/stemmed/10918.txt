in the case of latin america i think that is better to have a broad knowled of differ subjet becaus you can manag more activ and realiz multi-task job . in my own experi , to find a job the recluit ask you not for specif knowledg in a specif field . they ask you more about the knowledg in differ area that can help you to solv problem . in addit , when i wa work i learn about diffrer subject becaus my job demand it . for exampl , i am electr engin so i have a background in electron and technic aspect , my last work wa project manag so i learn about risk of the project , financi stuff , logist , manag of human resourc . i have friend , he 's profess is architect and he read a lot about differ subject becaus he is tri to appli the mathemat , the psicolog , and the maket to the decor of a room . he anal the psicolog profil of hi client and tri to design accord with their interest and hobbi . the peopl who have broader knowled can manag more task and can make the job that other dont know . it easier to explain how to make someth to a person who ha knowledg in more field . on the other hand , some activ requir special resourc for exampl peopl who repair , and build airplan . those work need special knowledg , but need more year of specializacion in a field . in conclus , i 'm agre with the statement becaus for the societi it better to have peopl with knowledg of differ branch . in the case of latin america the peopl can make multi task job .
