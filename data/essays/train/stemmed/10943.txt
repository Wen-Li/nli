the question about broad oder special educ is rather difficult to solv . in my opinion there is no clear answer or solut to thi problem . i think that a broad knowledg of mani subject is essenti to succeed in work . for exampl in econom , is is veri import to have certain knowledg of law , mathemat or inform system to onli mention a few connect field of studi . without background knowledg in these field you will not be abl to get a good degre in your studi . also it is import to have knowledg of cultur and societi , especi when you want to work and live in other countri . here it is extrem neccessari that you learn someth about the cultur of the foreign countri , so that you can live there as a part of the commun . also everybodi should have a basic knowledg about the histori of hi countri or geograph circumst of the region he live in . thi knowledg can be seen of a basi that everi person succeed univers should achiev . but beneath thi broad knowledg it also is quit use to have a highli specialis knowledg in one certain field . in thi special subject , you then can enjoy be a expert . thi can not onli be good for your person career . if nobodi want a highli special train , there would be no progress in scienc . here we have good exampl in natur scienc , for exampl physic . everi student of physic need a basic educ that also includ mathemat and chemistri . but to research in problem , that matter at present time , you need to highli special , becaus there is so much inform , that a singl human be would never be abl to gain it all . therefor i would say that you both need a broad knowledg of mani subject that are connect , but also must special in one field of studi . a reason combin of thi two aspect of train can give you an educ , that will open you all door for a futur career .
