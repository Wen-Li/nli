from my point of view , it is not advis to think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my argument for thi point are list as follow . the main reason for propens for fact is more import is that idea and concept are just a part of one thing , but the fact are the whole part of one thing . for exampl , i am major in japanes languag , the languag itself is just a kind of idea and concept , so i need to learn it fact and insid , japanes cultur . from i learn a lot of knowleg about the cultur , then i can learn lauguag more quickli and unstand , and i am interest in it a lot . there is anoth reason that deserv some word here . idea and concept are not relat to the realiti , but the fact is relat to the realiti of one thing , it help us get more experic from everyday . to illustr it , let us consid that when peopl graduat for school , they need to learn a lot of thing not onli from the idea and concept , but also the student need to know the fact of job and sociati . they also use their idea to do somet good , somet help , someth import for thi sociati , so they must know the fact . otherwis , they will do noth use . third , if you want to the fact of one thing , you must experi a lot of thing , that mean you need to do experi to get it for you . so the fact are veri import for everyon . if you do not the fact of one thing , that mean you can not get one experi or a aspect of knowledg . for exampl , i want to get my drive licens , that mean i need to know the knowleg about drive . on the other hand , i need to learn how to drive on the road , and keep everyon in the car safeti . so idea and concept is not enough for me , i need to know the fact . take into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclus that to learn fact is more import than to learn the idea and concept .
