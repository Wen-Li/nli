nowaday in our societi , most of the peopl want to be on the `` safe side of life '' . if it is not 100 percent sure they do n't do it , becaus there could be a risk which they do n't want to take . but is that realli the best way , onli do what you alreadi know how to do well ? in my opinion , the answer is no ! you have to do riski thing to be succes . for exampl , if you want to improv in your work life , you have to do task which you have n't done alreadi . so , you can show that you do n't want to stay at the same level , but increas your knowledg . thi show your boss that you are commit and have a great loyal . for the student life , in particular , it ha to be absolut normal to tri new thing or meet some new peopl . it 's not possibl to earn a great vage after univers , if a student ha n't show great flexibl . a student who get 's alway great grade can maintain with onli studi in hi common environ . but when he is readi to take risk and want 's to succeed in life he could also go abroad . in an other countri he learn 's a new languag , get in touch with a new cultur and meet some new friend . so he can build a network which could be veri use in hi life . in my opinion , it is like at the stock market . you can onli earn a great benefit , if you are readi to take a risk . if you onli invest in blue chip , your chanc to obtain a great benefit is much lower as if you put your money in more riski asset . final , i think all success peopl who are work in the busi had to do a riski decis in their carreer ( e.g. bill gate , donald trump , josef ackermann , ... )
