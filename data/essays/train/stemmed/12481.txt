it is often said that know a varieti of subject is better than concentr onli one subject . some peopl might disagre with thi statement becaus they believ that special one major can help them to be more success . howev , i strongli support the idea in the statement sinc have a lot of knowledg is veri use in one 's life as well as help student to studi better . to begin with , studi mani subject is veri use . it is no secret that we live in a complex societi that is consist of mani aspect . therefor , you can use your broad knowledg dure your life . a shine exampl of thi is one 's hobbi ; even though your major is busi , for instanc , you would probabl enjoy your hobbi such as listen to music , go to the gallari , etc . if you have a broaden knowledg about these thing by take a music or art class , it will be help to you when you enjoy them . therefor , it is obviou that variou subject can be use mani time . it is also true that mani subject have someth to do with each other . it is especi true becaus there is no independ subject in the world . in other word , all subject are link togeth . here is what i have seen myself . my major is langug . howev , i am take not onli class that are my major but also one physiolog class . in my major class , i studi about human 's brain that is relat to abil to speak . also , in the physiolog class , i learn about haman 's brain , too . thi is an evid that languag and physiolog are relat subject . given thi , a lot of subject can help one to studi one 's major better . in conclus , i firmli believ that it is more import to have a varieti of inform in mani subject than onli one major . that is becaus it is use as well as improv your studi . therefor , if i can , i want to studi more kind of subject in the futur .
