i do not agre that in twenti year the number of car in use would declin . the usag of car is directli propot to the demand of car , which i believ will increas significantli as we move on . here are some of the reason to support my point . first of all , the popul of the world is grow for past sever year and thi trend is expect to continu . for thi simpl reason onli the demand for car and their usag is bound to increas . secondli , as we are make more and more progress in technolog , the price of the car would come down . also the economi of peopl is grownig and peopl will have more money to buy car at low price therebi increas the usag . also with the advanc in technolog , the time seem to be fli more quickli and everyon tri to achiev the maximum in as littl time as possibl . therefor peopl would like to switch to faster travel option such as car to spend time spent in travel . also , given the alarm increas in polut due to industrialz , the polut after twenti year is expect to be unbear . it would also lead to harsher climat condit and henc pedestrian and two wheeler driver would have no other option then to move to much safer option such as car where util such as aircondition would be abl to keep the air healthier and maintain a proper temperatur . current some of the peopl , special in develop countri do not prefer car becaus of problem such as traffic . but as the countri develop over the next few year their infrastructur would improv substanti and traffic condit would improv consider , again favor car usag . to conclud , i strongli believ that as we make more and more progress in technolog over the next few year the usag of the car would increas significantli .
