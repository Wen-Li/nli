some peopl say that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun , becaus their time to help their commun . but i do not think so . i have some reason about it . firstli , young peopl are too busi and selfish . their time is occupi by their schedul . for exampl , in japan , my countri , the number of peopl go to sram school have been increas with high speed , becaus the quantiti of thing for teach public school of japan wa cut . in their school , they can not learn enough knowledg . moreov , mani young peopl is alway playng with their friend or is alway stay at home despit of no someth to should be done . becaus of those reason , i think , they do not want/can not help . secoundli , recent , the oppotun for have relationship in their commun is decreas . especi , in urban area , connect between peopl is veri weak . for instanc , my friend have never particip event of her communit , such as japanes festiv , instead of onli see it . my home town is suburban . so i often take part in japanes festiv . of cours , all menber of my familiy do , also , at the least the half of popul of my town do , too . so i disagre the idea that young peopl nowaday do not give enogh time to help their commun .
