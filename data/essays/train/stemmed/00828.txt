i would like to think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . howev as far as i am concern , thi is veri unlik to happen . the onli solid argument that i can find to defend the reduct in the number of car is that due to the lack of ga and consequ the increas in it cost , peopl will buy less car . nevertheless , peopl are so use to have a car that in my opinion it is more probabl that we will move to electr car . furthermor , what would happen with the big car manufactur ? i think that they would find way to keep peopl buy car . anoth fact that we have to take into account , is the growth of citi . thing are further and further nowaday and there are few polici tri to increas the use of public transport . therefor the use of car becom veri import . it is also relev to measur what car impli . they are an evid of econom power and they provid independ , a feel of freedom . are peopl go to renounc to those feel ? honestli , i do not think that teenag are go to reject their onli sourc of independ . the same way peopl in their fifti will keep buy sport car . those are tradit that have becom too relev in our societi to be chang in onli twenti year . what about the new power countri like china ? as the salari increas peopl tend to consum more . china is a new market will to buy more and more car as it citizen can afford them . for all the reason sate abov such as , the power of big manufactur , the new demand in countri like china , and the role that car current play in our societi , i do no think that thing will chang in twenti year .
