the best way of travel is in a group led by a tour guid . some poepl think like that , and other onc think that is better travel with a group of poepl but without a tour guid . i am agre with the first statement by some reason . first , you may have a good schedul of fun activ . if you like to travel and if you are an organ person , you will like to have an schedul with all your activ , and also someon who show you the best part of the citi , explain their histori , the good and bad thing , the mean of the place , etc . by follow a schedul you may have all your time plan , and you can have the opportun of visit a lot of part . in a second point , travel in a group is veri fun . if you do not know ani poepl , is a good opportun to meet some friend , share experi , know poepl of differ part of the world , understand differ cultur and also you can practic a foreign languag . final , and no less import , you can save a lot of money by travel in a group led by a tour guid . all poepl know that travel on thi time is veri expens , and if you travel in group , you will have some veri good advantag like save money in the hotel , or in your transport . so if you save money , you have the possibl of travel two or three time in a year , and that is realli fantast . like a conslus , i can say that all poepl or the most of the poepl love to travel around the world . is veri excit to think on have the opportun of visit a lot of citi , meet poepl of differ cultur , even learn about histori , and of cours save money . that is whi i think that the best way of travel is in group led by a tour guid .
