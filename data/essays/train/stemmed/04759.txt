i am not sure about thi statement . i would say it depend on the focu you put on your life . i will start with the busi part and illustr that with a few exampl of my life . i am studi english and polit at the univers of wuerzburg . in the english subject it is veri import to know all the specif term for word of the subject . you have to be veri into literatur , cultur and histori of the countri where english is spoken . mainli of cours such countri as the unit state and great britain . in my other subject , polit , i have to read a daili newspap and to know what is go on in the world . thu , you see i need a broad knowledg of daili life . but i also have to be special in my subject , i have to know variou polit system for exampl and i need to have inform about polit regim and histori of countri other sure do not know . . for my career i need to be special in mz subject , but also have to have some broad knowledg of other academ subject . for exampl if i talk in a present about the polit situat in iraq i should also know at least where iraq is geograph . wherea in social life it is better to have a broad knowledg than to have the focu onli on your specif subjetc . i give you an exampl : as a student you sometim get an invit to a parti . it can easili happen that you get in contact with unknown person . in order to get a convers start you should have a topic you can talk about . thi topic should be someth your partner can easili get into . if you want to avoid a bore converstaion about the weather it is better to have some knowledg about someth els . nowaday manz peopl go to televis game show , there it is also import to have a broad knowledg , if you want to win a lot of money . in the end i think i can say , that it is import to to have both if you want to be sucsess in life , wether it in the privat sector or in the busi one .
