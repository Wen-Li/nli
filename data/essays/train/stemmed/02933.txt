some peopl might say that young peopl spend their time enough help their commuc indic the larg number of chariti club or volunt commun . howev , i think that , actual , young peopl do not concern about their commun . there are two major reason : they are busi concern about their own way and they spend their time for their self-real more and more . first of all , current societi is so much competit that young peopl should concern about their cours or way shch as get job or their studi . to young peopl , what matter is not the help activ for their commun , but to find their way in such a complex and competit societi . as modern societi is get more complex , the role of young peopl ha been chang . it might have been to help their commun befor , but now it is to surviv in the competit societi . therefor , young peopl can not afford to give their time to help their commun . rather , they are busi tri to get a job or studi hard on their way . moreov , even if young peopl have enough time , they spend their extra time for their own purpos . from leisur activ with their friend to self-real , there are so mani thing that young peopl feel attract to spend their time for . even though some mignt think that thi is undesir , young peopl consid spend their time help their commun out-of-d . for exampl , when i wa young , my uncl usual who were young at that time were engag in some volunt activ help our commun , and spend their time much in do those . howev , now , i find my fiend are usual seek to use their time on their own purpos such as hang out with friend , practic their foreign languag skill , etc . thu i think that , as time goe by , thi current will be spread out more and more . in summari , i agre with the statement that young peopl do not spend their time help their commun . nowaday , young peopl concentr on their own live so much that they do not spend their time for their commun .
