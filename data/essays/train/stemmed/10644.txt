first of all i have to mention , that the statement doe not give ani detail about the age or profess of a person . i think that the advantag and disadvantag of a broad knowledg just appli regard to the state of social of an individu . a broad knowledg ha a lot of advantag in today world . i would even say , that a broad knowledg is nessecari in our world of globalis . we live in a multiculturel and globalis world . that caus a damag to the individu of a countri . kultur , religion and knowledg get mix up . sinc the globalis support commun the broad knowledg is increas rapid . globalis caus fusion of firm . combin firm need peopl with a broad knowledg and the abil to combin differ subject rather than know everyth about a specif topic . on the other hand it is nessecari for everi compani to have specialist in each field . for exampl : the it section in germani doe not have a lot of good qualifi specialist . so the german gouver appli for it specialist from india and pakistan . germani wou't be abl to meet the world-wid averag knowlegd in inform technic without the help of those specialist . my opinion is , that it is nessecari to have a wide spread knowledg as a young person to be abl to be flexibl in a multiculturel civil . on the other hand i have to admit that everi succes compani need peopl with special knowledg to creat knew knowledg . i come to the final decis neither to agre nor to disagre with the statement , sinc i believ that it isdepend on the age and spacif field of an individu whether the knowledg ha to be more broad or no
