in my opinion , the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' is absolut true . it may depend on the product , how much influenc the advertis campaign have - but for most product in consum market it is true . let 's have a look at an exampl : there 's a commerci for chocol on german televis . that chocol is deliv in golden paper and is a litt bit more expens than all the other avail product . now what would be an appropri commerci for that product ? right - a man look like jame bond , have a parti in the back garden of hi huge expens hous and bee accompani by beauti young girl . and that 's exactli what that whole advertis campaign is like . but whi doe it have to be like that ? no one would want to buy that product if they saw ordinari peopl - for instanc an elderli coupl sit on their couch - on televis , eat that chocol . as state abov , it 's nearli the same with all kind of consum product : comput , car , beer , even razor blade or tooth past . to be honest - nearli all kind of razor blade are the same , there is no uniqu sell proposit . so the compani use the advertis to make the differ . you can see a well shape guy shave hi mustach and hi young girl friend watch him . or they tell you that the new wilkinson shaver ha now four razor blade instead of three . the commerci on tv tell you , that you must have that shaver becaus it ha four razor - no need to prove that it 's realli an advantag to have four razor instead of three . what 's use to make those product much better than they actual are are emot . that specif beer shown on tv must tast better than the other - you are like those wild guy who are have fun in the commerci . sinc that new suv is stand on the top of a big hill in that advert , it must be better than the old model that you 're drive at the moment . may be - may be not ! but the fact that you see that certain pictur produc desir for that product . even when the suv shown on the pictur is n't ani better at all - it look much better than all the other do . and that 's exactli whi most compani make their product appear much better in advertis than they are in realiti : it 's work !
