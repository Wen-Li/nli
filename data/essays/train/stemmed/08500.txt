i think that i am the kind of person who is will to give a lot of time to help my commun , but when i get right down to it i can not find so much time . probabl , like me , a huge amount of person experi the same problem . i absolut agre with the statement but , at the same time , i can understand whi differ categori of peopl do not spend time help other . first of all , young peopl are extrem busi with their class and sport activ . write paper , prepar seminar and do homework requir quit half of the day of each student . in addit , they are usual ask to be part of a sport team and so they spend sever hour a week train and improv their perform . as a consequ , they are unabl to help other , but i think that they do not feel happi about it . normal student are altruist and they feel like they are wast time when they can not improv the life of the commun they belong to . secondli , peopl , who have a famili and children , are complet full of stress . sometim , they have their own work in the morn and then onc at home they have to take care about children . i think that the real problem is that the life is too fast for them . all day long , famili are plan someth or improv someth differ . in thi way , they can not understand the import of take their own time and dedic some of it to the commun . poor and alon peopl , for instanc , would be enthusiast spend a weekend with a famili , but , anyway it doe not happen so frequent . conclud , i want to say that even if i can understand differ and valid reason that lead peopl live apart from their commun , i hope that , tip by tip , everyon will recogn the import of spend time within a commun . it can add valu to the routin everyon experi dure the week . perhap , i will start do someth for my hometown littl commun from tomorrow .
