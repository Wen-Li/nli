there are mani opinion occur about whether young peopl or old peopl enjoy life more . i actual do not agre with the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' at all . i do n't think that old peopl have more fun in life than their younger companion either . but i am not say that not anyon on earth enjoy hi or her life . i am just tri to say that it depend on the person himself regardless of hi age . a man , 80 year of age could be the richest man on earth but may still not be satisfi with hi life becaus he want to be young again . therefor he doe not enjoy life . and on the other side a teenag is unhappi about hi life becaus he doe n't have the money and right to do whatev he wish to do becaus he still live in hi parent hous . all the teenag want is to get older , so that he can do all the thing that he alway want to do ( and of cours the money to do it ) . and the funni thing is that both illustr could be the exact same person , onli in differ life stage . but it can be differ , too . as a young person you can enjoy life by go to school , meet friend , do sport , etc . and just becaus of the fact that you are old doe not mean that you can not have the same fulfil in life as a younger peopl do . you onli do differ thing which you could have never thought of when you were younger . so what doe that mean ? you could have all the thing you 've alway want and still be unhappi . it doe n't matter if someon is young or someon is old . if that particular person doe not have the right attitud to make the most out of the situat he will never be happi and final enjoy life . a young person can enjoy life as well as an old person doe . it is onli import how he think of himself . i believ it is your attitud that determin what kind of a life you can have . you can enjoy life or make it a terrifi time while be on thi earth . nobodi can make you feel happi , but you .
