i would agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first of all if you learn to understand concept it help you to draw your own conclus from it . which mean that by understand a concept the student are encourag to think for themselv and mayb even question the concept . thi is veri import to keep the student interest in the subject they are studi . anoth thing that is posit about understand idea or concept is that you get a gener idea about it wherea fact most of the time give you a specif inform about someth which doe not let ani room for imagin or own thought . in my opinion it is also easier to rememb concept onc you understood them than it is to rememb fact . fact are someth that student keep in mind while they are talk about the relat topic at school or univers . when they are finish talk about the topic they also forget most of the fact but somehow the idea and concept of it remain and student will rememb them for a longer period of time . moreov it is the case that you can use most of the concept that you manag to understand in real life , which mean that they remain import even when you are not at school or univers anymor . thi is not the case with fact . as i alreadi said they are link to one specif topic and you can tell them to someon but they will not be of further use . the most persuad fact though is that if you forget some fact about someth you can find them in text book or in the internet and you can read them again . it is differ with concept or idea . it is veri help to have someon to explain a concept or an idea so that you can fulli understand it and onc someon ha explain it to you you can be sure that you understood it . wherea if you read a concept or and idea in the textbook most of the time it is not as easi to understand . as you can see i am realli convinc that understand idea or concept is much more import than learn fact . you could simpli say that it is more of a long-term use and therefor more practic .
