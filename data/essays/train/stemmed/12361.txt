the question say that `` it is more impot for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . i agre with statement becaus , `` in thi comput world student are becom machinari day by day . they are not get the idea and concept behind the subject . they are simpli remembr the thing to produc in the futur . but i am sure that thi will not improv the student 's knowledg and hi skill in futur and also the student will not be known how to surviv in thi world after hi educ '' . and it is the responsibilti of the parent and teacher to move the student in correct path . they should encourag the student to studi in hi interest field . and if the student is not listen to the parent , then they should give the clear idea to the student what will be the situat if you do a small mistakeand how it will help you in the futur . if possibl they should show him the consequens practic . so that the student can understand what is the situat and where he is stand in thi compet world . and more over the student futur total depend on the the idea and concept that he ha in hi mind from hi child hood . the student must be clear with hi everi doubt which he ha . becaus when he is clear with the doubt ( what ever he ha in mind ) he can understand the situat veri clearli and the parent should give more exampl to explain hi doubt clearli so that he can move in a correct path . so final it is more import for the student to undersatnd the idea and concept than to learn fact . when the student get the idea and concept for the subject with mani exampl then he can get the new idea of the same topic in an effici way and is veri easi to rememb also .
