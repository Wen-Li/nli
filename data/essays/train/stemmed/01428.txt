we live in a world which is perman chang for new technolog is increas everyday as the progre of industri . but i will explain whi i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are today despit that . i take an exampl ; if you look at the mobil phone ten year ago the first mobil wa veri big , nowaday they tend to be smaller and smaller with much more option than befor , but in ten year i think there wo n't be ani mobil left for we will have tini mobil stick in our jaw like it exist alreadi in japan . on the contrari car exist sinc much long time than mobil phone and they are still here . the onli which chang is that tey can go faster , that they have much more option like gp or ab and we feel more secur in it , itwenti year ther will be more car than now mayb becaus new one are go to be construct . it is the type of car which chang not the exist of the car itself contrari to the mobil moreov the presenc of car doe not depend on time but more on the cultur of each countri . in london for exampl everybodi is travel by bu and there is nearli no car in the center of the town except taxi . and in holland everybodi is bike wherea in the center of pari the street are crowd with car . in twenti year i think that noth will have chang . to conclud the onli reason which could provok a reduct of the number of car would be that the govern prohibit it use becaus of the pollut for exampl .
