i guess it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . my opinion is base of my expier of sixteen year of school learn . if a student understand the idea or the concept behind a thing he can more effect do it by himself . if he just learn fact mostli he can just give back the fact of the experi but if he understand the idea he can use the knowledg for other experi . for exampl the student learn on theori the fact how to drive a car . they know how to use the acceler , the brake , the clutch and the gear . they learn at 10 km per hour that they have to shift the gear up to the second gear and at 30 km per hour that they have to shift the gear up again . that not bad becaus they know how to drive now but if they dont understand the idea of thi they just can drive the exampl car and if they have after they drive licens anoth car with more hors power they do not have to shift the second gear up at 30 km per hour becaus if the car have more hors power you have to shift the gear up later . but if you understand the idea or the concept of drive that you have to shift up the gear if the motor begin to cri than you can drive everi car that you want . of cours the student that learnt the fact can learn it everytim again in each car without much advis but it is definitli more effect if the student understand the concept of drive . in thi exampl i hope to get underlin my opninion whi i think it is better to understand the idea .
