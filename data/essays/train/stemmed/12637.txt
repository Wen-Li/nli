in my opinion , i do not believ that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . first of all , younger peopl have to work hard to get to the stage , so they can have the experi of an older man or older woman . second , as a young person , you are restrict to do mani thing an adult can do , and final , as an older man/woman life is open to you , you are free to do what you want . first of all , teenag have to work their way up to be success in their live , thi mean carri mani respons . i will use myself for an exampl ; i am 16 and a half and im a senior at woburn high school , recentley i have been hit with mani responsibilit such as colleg . i appli to 6 colleg , and have work mani day complet the applic . i could have decid to not do all thi work , but i want to advanc . when i grow old i want the chanc to have a good futur and enjoy it . young peopl do not enjoy life more than older peopl do . second , as a young person , you are restrict to do mani thing an adult can do . for exampl , buy a car . as a minor , a person under 18 can not purchas an automot vehicl without parent consent . i am a big fan of car , howev , i ca n't purchas one until i turn 18 . older peopl do not have to deal with thi . older peopl can go and buy whatev they want , whenev they want , but that cant be neccessarili a good thing . final , as a man or a woman get old , they find out that life is open to them . they have finish pay the morgag for their hous , and they have a good amount of money in their bank . what is there for them to do ? they can do anyth . they could go to florida and live the rest of their live on a beach , or they can even stay at their hous , and relax for the rest of their live . younger peopl can not do that . in conclus , younger peopl dont alway have it harder than older peopl . older peopl alreadi went through the stage of their life where they work hard to reach their goal . for younger peopl that stage ha just open up .
