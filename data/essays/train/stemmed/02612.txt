i disagre with the given statement . in my opinion , young peopl do their best to help their commun and societi . i can say thi with convict becaus i myself have done my best to help societi . my grandmoth run a primari school for children with limit mean . sinc i wa about ten year old , i have been go to thi school everi summer to do volut work . i have interact with the children , play game like soccer and cricket with them , taught them extra-curricular activ like danc and paint and even taught the children younger to me academ subject like math sometim . it is a great feel to be abl to give to somon someth so import - educ . some of the children there becam my friend and i still do talk to them . some of them are in high school now . my brother too ha been do hi bit for the societi . he goe to old age home . he interact with the old peopl there and read stori to them . they are lone and need someon to talk to . they feel extrem touch when young children like my brother take out time to come and meet them . my brother too love to go and spend time with them . mani of my friend are into commun servic as well . a veri good friend of mine , julia , work close with mental challeng patient . she is also an activ volunt for a school with mental challeng student . so , in my opinion , it will not be entir correct to say that young peopl do not take out enough time to help their commun . i do agre that there are except thi , that there are peopl who do not wish to indulg in commun servic . howev , they are mere except .
