i think that the answer to thi import and debat question depend on which level of stude one is pursu . if a student is at an undergradu level , he should tri to wide , as much as possibl , hi area of interest and compet , while , if he is alreadi at a graduat level , he should concentr himself on a more restict area of studi . i think that a broader knowledg of differ topic and problem relat to differ subject should be achiev dure the year spent in the high school , so that one ha the possibl to gain more conscious of what hi interest and prefer are . at a certain point in life , one must ask himself the tediou question : `` what would i like to do in my life ? '' that is : `` what kind of job do i want to occupi my day up to the end of my life ? '' face thi question , one must necessar restrict hi area of interest and studi by focus on a singl area . i say `` area '' and not `` disciplin '' becaus an area of studi like , for exampl , philosophi , can involv much more than one would expect at the begin . it is now a day wide recogn how philosophi can be relat to mathemat or to econom or to other veri differ subject like psycolog . anyway , in my opion , someon realli know the area of interest when he ha a broader knowledg of the differ topic and subject relat to it . one should alway have a wide open eye on everyth that 's happen in the accadem world . special is nevertheless an oblig choic today , if one is will to reach excel in a specif area . that is true in sport and music at a veri earli age of life ( about seven year old ) , but it 's a problem also for student at an univers level . few are the peopl who can get excel in more than one area , and most of them , i think , die mani centuri ago , like leonardo da vinci and michelangelo . i think that in our centuri sometim we should be will to accept to be mere technician and not intellectu in a broad sens , which is someth that today onli veri rich peopl can afford to be .
