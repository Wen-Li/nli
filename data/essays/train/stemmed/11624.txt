mani compani spend a lot of money for their advertis . becaus advertis are closest us who buy mani kind of product . but i think advertis are sometim too much and too attract for us . becaus they ca n't give real visual and textur for us . i agre with the follow statement . fist of all , we can see a nice product advertis , but it 's not real , and real color . in my experi , i got a wrong color dress which i did n't expect after i order a brillilant dress on the internet . i wa sure the dress color , becaus i cheke it mani time . but i got not my favar . i wa so shock . but it wa my fail . becaus they said sometim color is differ your expect on the screen ! second , when i saw a tv shop , they sell a confort sofe . on the tv , a coupl were sit comfort , and rede book . it wa a my drem sofe . and i bought it and i cri . becaus the sofe wa uncomfort and unfit for me . in my opinion , we shold n't beliv ani advertis . mani compani spend a lot of money and attract us a lot . but we ca n't see real and touch , smell , and feel . we should buy a product after you know realli one .
