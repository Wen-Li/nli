well i certainli agre with the follow statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' well , i feel that it is alway import to have a good knowledg about all differ subject . well for exampl taken in the medic histori , say a doctor from a medicin field , is onli specilaz in onli one subject or say onli one field . and for suppos he is a speacilist in heart diseas , and if a patient come in for a treatment in differ part of the bodi he will not be or he is not in a posit to give him the medicin for that diseas . and the patient might think that he ha got no knowledg and moreov he might not turn to him again . and if he ha a knowledg about mani academ subject he will be abl to give a medicin for that . well what i feel is that a person is said to be complet person if he ha a good knowledg about all the thing . so i feel that it is better to have the broad knowledg of mani academ subject . well , if we are into onli one specif subject i say we will endup nowher , wherein we donot have the knowledg about other thing . and thi might propabl mean that our knowledg in limit . well for exampl in the softwar field if we are good in onli one basic softwar and now a day our inform and technolog is chang day by day , so here we need to have some knowledg about other software'stooor we will be in a situat where we will end up nowher , not know what to do next . so here we can say that if we have some knowledg about mani academ subject we can surviv .
