i disagre with thi statement , although i wa think the same way when i wa a teenag . when i wa about sixteen , i regard my grandmoth sit in her littl kitchen and thought that she wa not admir becaus of her old age and health problem . in my opinion in these time , onli young peopl were abl to have fun , becaus they got the bodi fit which allow them to swim in lake , ride a bike and danc dure the whole night at a parti . but today , i oppos thi opinion veri harshli . now i know , that everi step in the human life ha it advantag . when you are young , without doubt the abil in enjoy life is base on sport and fun , as i just mention . you do not care about ani sorrow or ani sever plan for futur . so thi seem to be the onli time in life , where you are abl to live without fear . but when you grow older , you are abl to regard problem in life from a more abstract or distinct point of view , you are wiser and abl to differ between sever and unimport problem . when i talk to my grandmoth today , i learn that the joy in her life is link to the joy of her famliy , especi with her children she rais . instead of take care of her children , she now is abl to see her effort and ha more time for herself . now she travel to her sister sever time a year , which she could not afford in time when she wa rais her children . it is true that the respons for one action grow parallel to the grow of the age , but also the joy in take thi respons grow . as an adult one is abl to deal with respons , which offer lot of new challeng . these challeng not onli are import mileston in develop , but they can also be a huge joy . for exampl , to found a famili , marri a wife and rais children with her , without doubt is a huge respons , but it can also be the greatest fun in one life . to draw a conclus , young peopl do not enjoy life more than older peopl do , the onli enjoy life in a differ way .
