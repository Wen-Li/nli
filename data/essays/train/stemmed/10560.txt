in the present day societi , young peopl have becom busi , want to achiev good grade in their univers , advanc in their career , have good entertain etc . i agre with the statement that young citizen nowaday are not spend enough time in help their commun . even the tough competit the young peopl are face doesnt allow them to spend their free time in commun work . the amount of stress they have at their colleg and workplac leav them with no interest in care about other . to site an exampl , a young profession work at a softwar compani work pretti hard the whole week which can extend till late night and would alway want to chill out dure the weekend not want to know what happen around him . the amount of stress he face at the workplac doesnt allow him to . time ha alway been an import factor . sinc the amount of free time an individu get these day is less , the chanc for him to think about the societi is also becom lesser . the young peopl alway tend to inclin to ani activ veri easili , and special when it come to entertain , mani of them love to spend their free time in parti , play and travel . even the peopl around them also have lot of influenc on their mind . for instanc , there wa a program which wa conduct by my colleg , which wa to volunt in help the orphan by teach them some basic thing . thi requir us to spend two weekend at an orphanag . when the student were ask to volunt , hardli no one wa will to sacrific their weekend for help someon els . but fortun when one student wa readi , few other follow him . that particular student influenc some peopl around him . but still it wa not the respons expect . young peopl do have the sensibl to think about their commun , but they need to be encourag by the parent , govern , educ intstitut , social organ etc . with a good inspir and support , they can make the world a better place to live in .
