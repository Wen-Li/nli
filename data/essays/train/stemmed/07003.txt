i disagre with the thi statement that there will be fewer car in use in next 20year . i think peopl drive more car than nowday . in the futur , peopl will have more money than now , and there will be mani place to go to enjoy life . also peopl will think privaci so import . so they would not share the car . mani kind of car also effect that there would be more car than today . as time goe by , world is becom so convini place to live in , and technolog improv fast . peopl will have more money than now , for exampl my father bought first car when he wa 30 , but nowday mani univers student have car includ me. mani young peopl prefer to buy car when they grduat highschool , becaus they have enough money to pay the car . also there are lot of place that peopl can play . as economi is develop peopl prefer to go to outsid in the leisur time . becaus of young peopl ha mani chanc to earn money , they go to lot of place with famili , girl friend , and friend . so they want to have their own car . becaus it is easier to go there when they have their own . in the futur , worth of privaci would becom more import . the socil life would be veri complex and stress , peopl want to go somewher alon in their free time . as for me , when i have so much stress i drive alon to beach . also peopl doe n't want to somebodi interrupt when they want to rest . for exampl when i wa date with my girl friend i hate to somebodi is wath me or talk to me . if they have their own car they do n't worri about somebodi disturb them . last of all there would be variou car to drive . there would be variou dese of car . so if soomon who ha lot of money , they world tri to mani car , such as sport car . in futur , peopl would have more money , and have mani chanc to spend thier money . they will buy their own car to go to mani place easili and doe n't want to share the car . also variou type of car would make rich peopl want to drive that car . for these reason , i think there would be more car than nowday .
