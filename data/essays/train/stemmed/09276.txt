use a formula such as ` it is better to ' is alway a danger thing when we are not provid with more precis context . in thi case , whether one should favor a broad knowledg of vari subject or focu on one specif topic is all a matter of what one is tri to achiev and in what field . take the exampl of medicin : some doctor opt for the broadest instruct possibl so as to be abl to deal with most common diseas affect all part of the bodi while other decid to becom special in a particular organ , or type of ailment . which one is ` better ' ? the onli possibl answer to thi question is that one need both at differ time and that both are import . as a german and english undergradu , i will deal with the issu in the domain i know best : the academ field of literatur as it is taught in belgian univers . it is strike to watch the evolut in the academ program from the 1st year to the final one : quit clearli we start by learn the overal framework . let 's take an exampl from my second colleg year : one of my favorit class ever wa call survey of english poetri which veri much cover everyth from the prehistori to the 1950 . now let 's take an exampl from my final year : ` shakespear and the cross of gener boundari ' . not onli did thi class focu on one particular author , it focuss on one particular aspect of thi particular author 's work . the move from broad topic to specif subject is self-explanatori . so much for fact . i would argu that the best way of approach the issu at hand here is to think chronolog . in a first phase , i would definit promot the acquisit of a fairli broad knowledg of a high number of subject . have access to the widest possibl varieti of topic is one of the best way to learn what curios is all about - and i mean curios in the good sens of the word ( not nosi ) . i strongli believ that curios is one of the qualiti requir if one is to live life to the full . also , get a sens of the big pictur first is a good way to discern in a second phase what specif subject appeal to us most . i believ you need to learn the base of art histori befor you can realiz at all that you like impression and pre-raphaelit best . after thi first phase , then , i do n't see what is wrong with concentr on and dig deeper into a patricular topic . at colleg , we are ask on sever occas to make such narrow choic : i wrote research paper on georg giss 's novel ` new grub street ' , uwe timm 's latest novel , a poem by john updik ( a poem by one particular author ) . and i think thi is a veri good thing too . my undergradu thesi , in particular , help me identifi a pretti specif topic which i would like to research further and possibl turn into a ph.d. : the impact of indutri on artist product in the second half of the 19th centuri in england . i do not regard thi process as restrict . thi kind of specif research is extrem reward . in conclus , i would say that both approach can be support and that they should not be mutual exclus . a broad approach is a necessari gfirst step befor one can narrow down one 's interest further . and sinc we got eh bigger pictur too , notyh stop us from develop mani differ specif interest overtim . ..
