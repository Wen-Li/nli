i think understand idea and concept is more import for student than simpli learn fact . howev , sometim learn fact is necessari . in the follow paragraph i will state my reason whi i do agre with the statement . first of all i think in today 's societi and busi it is import to commun . discuss and talk about problem and idea in a classroom give you the abil to talk to peopl more easili even if you are not the same opinion . you learn to understand their idea and whi they might think thi specif way . anoth import thing is anoth benefit for your futur job . today you might be sit in a classroom with a teacher help you with everi question you ask him or her but sooner or later you probabl will be sit in a busi meet , in a offic or even be teach a class full of student yourself . if you have learn to understand the idea and concept of thing you also learn to solv problem . if you did n't understand it at first , you look for answer and way that you might be abl to understand it . the third thing is that it is probabl easier to learn for a test when you get the main idea or the whole concept . when you prepar for a test and just learn fact the whole time but do n't know how they fit togeth or what their connect is , it is pointless . you might know it until the next day but you will forget it in about a month . howev , if you learn the whole concept and understood it , you are familiar with it and it is easier for you to recal thing . i would like to support my statement with an exampl : in math it is veri easi to solv problem after you have understood the main idea and the concept of the solut . some task might be harder but you alway know at least the way to solv them . if someon would just learn the formular but doe n't know how to use them or how to combin them he wo n't do good on ani test . even so i support the statement i have to say that there are some major where learn fact is partli necessari . for exampl if you learn a new languag you first just studi the vocabulari . when you do histori you have to learn date and `` timet '' . in the end , howev , it alway matter that someon understand the whole idea .
