travel can be a good or a bad experi . some peopl rather travel in group with a guid led them through attract becaus it give them more out of their trip . howev , i am part of those who prefer to travel on their own . first of all , travel with a tour guid do not give you the control of your trip . when you regist for thi type of trip , you have to agre that you do not have the choic to go or not at one site or to wake up earli or not , becaus you have to follow the group . but if you plan your own trip you can decid which activ you will do or if at one point you are tire , you can relax and chang your plan becaus you are the one in control of your schedul . secondli , guid doe not necessarli like the same thing then you , so you might not enjoy some part of your trip becaus you have visit place that you did not like or did activ that you did not enjoy . travel by your own , give you the chanc to visit onli thing that you like or want to see , mayb you will end out not see as mani site or attract as with the tour guid , but you might injoy more your trip . finnali , if you are travel with a guid you can not go as deep as you would have like in the explor of a site or a citi . the guid ha to follow a schedul , so he or she can not spend too much time on one particular attract . if you are in a group tour and you visit a museum , you might onli have one or two hour to complet the tour . but what if you are a person who like to spend full day in the museum , you might be dessapoint , rather than on your own , you can decid how long you want to stay at the museum . travel with a tour guid can give a good opportun to discov multipl place , but it would not be the type of trip i would enjoy due to the fact that i would not be in control of my personn schedul dure the trip .
