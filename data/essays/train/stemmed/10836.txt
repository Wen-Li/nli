it is a fact that if the student do not understand a concept and do not understand the idea , the thing surround by them would not make ani sens and there wouldl be a confus . at the same time , it is also import to learn fact whihch make the thing real to the student and student can easili visual the thing and can develop their own thought and idea . i had an exper relat to how import it is learn the fact than understand idea and concept ; therefor i disagre with the statement . when the student can see the fact , they can accept a realiti they face , develop their idea and think deeli and as the result , they will be more independ . befor i had a situat to do a lab expermin in my chemistri class , my teacher taught us what the purpos of the experminet and explain the step but it wa not reali help for me to visual what i suppos to do . the lab wa not appeal to me and i found it wa bore becasu i could not use my though to think deepli . i thought it wa realli passiv way of lean . then , in my physic class , the other show me the lab in front of the class and told us the all the fact what is happen in a real life which is realt to thi expermin . i could accept the raliti of the lab realli easili that time . i wa abl to think beyond the physic expermin . i also could use my imagin and so my though got realli deep . form my prsonal experi , i found it wa much better to learn fact as my attitud get more activ and more independ from what the teacher teach me a concept . i can learn idea and concept from text book , so i think it is realli import for the sudent to activ their mind and learn the fact .
