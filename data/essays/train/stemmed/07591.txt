the term `` knowledg '' as we see ha a ampl number of branch to be describ . one such branch that we are about to see is that of a student academ . a man is simpli a learner in hi own life . let consid the case of an individu when he is in childhood stage . as a child he learn to crawl , eat , play etc . in thi context he is a learner to go through all the vari function associ to him . later come the stage of be a grown up boy . here would prefer to walk on the ground rather than crawl , thu hi interest ha got confin . in a similar way when we consid the case of a individu pursu hi academ . it would be better to excel in one specif subject rather than go through variou subject . thi would be benefici not onli to the individu but also to the career that he opt for . consid the case of an engin , if he is made to go through the subject like , polit , medicin etc. then it would be infer that the chanc of becom an engin are bleak . the same case may not be applic to all other case . when we take the abov case of an sucess engein we can clearli state in the maximum case that , the inividu ha had a plenti of overview of hi interest and the subject that he ha studi . on the other hand a person with onli confin knowledg would excel onli in hi choos field rather than be awar of the happen around him . let take the case of ani polit leader . as we know leader are not born as leader , they are the peopl come from differ field . a leader may be a doctor , engin , farmer etc . so the individu as a leader ha to be awar of all the happen go around him and also hi region , provinc , countri etc . thu here in thi case we can say that a mere confin knowledg is not enough to be a perfect individu . so we can say that the method of have a broad knowleg of academ subject depend upon how an individu approach it , rather than make it a controversi methodolog
