i strongli agre that `` young peopl enjoy life more than than older peopl do '' for whole lot of reason . first of all peopl at young age are not bother about ani respons . they are free bird and they like to enjoy their life to fullest . for exampl right now i an do my graduat and i am not at all bother about anyth , i enjoy a lot with my friend , go for parti , have get togeth , we watch lot of movi . i never think about futur , i like to take the life as it come . wherea when i see my parent they are lot more concern about differ issu in life , like they are bother about their life after retir , or the burden of their kid . the next thing is peopl at young age tri to be adventer , innov in their thought and idea . they tri out some thing or the other to keep their life intrest . they expect some kind of thrill in their life . wherea the elder peopl doesnot want to tri out new thing and they prefer to spend a stabl and peac life . peopl at young age are veri healthi compar to the elder peopl . they are with full vigor . the health problem of elderli may keep them away from enjoy the life to the fullest . like for exampl most of the elderli peopl may have problem with blood pressur or may have cardiac problem or may have arthriti or ani kind of problem . so these peopl gener tend to keep their life in subtl way and tri to avoid all the nois or tri to live in peac and seren . final the elder peopl may not be know the latest innov becaus of which they may be depriv of enjoy . like for exampl my grandpar doesnot know how to use the comput and they are not intrest to know . so the enjoy which i get while brows the internet and know whole lot of thing , which made my life easier can be defenit compar to what my grandpar are miss . so for all these reason i strongli believ that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do .
