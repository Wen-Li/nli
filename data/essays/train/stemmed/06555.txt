in univers , student have both to undestand idea and concept and to learn fact . in my point of view , these two thing are total complementari in a student learning-process . it is true that , depend on the area of studi , it is sometim more import for a student to understand idea and concept , or in contrari , more import to learn fact . for exampl , a student in histori will have to learn a lot of fact and date to be abl to talk about a war . if you do n't know these , you are not abl to explain them . learn fact happen first , and underst idea , after . mathemat or even econom student would rather say that it is more import for them to understand a theori or a concept than learn fact . if you understand an idea you can thing about it , re-us the idea , or even learn from previou mistak than have been made in the past . after that , it could be interest to learn when a theori ha been though or where . moreov , if you understand someth veri well first , then it is easier to rememb fact about it . for instanc , when i wa in high school , i had lot of difficulti in learn fact and date in histori , especi concern the cold war . after speak to an older student , i realis that i wa n't abl to memor the fact becaus i did n't understand how it happen and whi . after understand someth , you sometim rememb everyth without ever notic it . in my opinion , understand and learn are both import for a student . howev , dure all the year of studi , student have to learn to think , to take decis , to learn from mistak , not onli in order to find a job , but also in their everyday life . becaus studi is not onli be abl to learn fact but it is also the develop from a child to an adult , i agre that understand idea and concept is the more import .
