i agre with the statement : usual advestis make product seem much better than they realli are . i also think that in mani case thi beviour is an illeg way to send a product to normal peopl . in fact , mani time advertis involv situat that are bild to hit particular group of peopl , like children or old person . children are one of the favourit target for advertis , becaus they want to be social accept by other children and usual thi mean that they want cloth , game and other thing similar to those that the other have . parent know that mani of those thing do n't correspond to real desir of their son , but they ca n't say ` no ' in front of mani request , becaus it is veri import to be accept by the other children . for thi reason , mani advertis are prepar for children and they usual show product that are n't good as it seem in televis , or on a newspap . an exampl are toy : in itali , mani year ago , a veri import compani start sell electron game , by mail . in televis they show a particular product , that wa nice and interest , and mani famili bougth it . the problem start when famili reciv it by mail : the game wa n't the one they had seen on televis , it wa shorter and veri difficult to be play . also old peolpl are good target for fake advertis , becaus they are weak and unabl to realiz what they are go to buy . an exampl : my grandmoth bougth a radio , that she had seen on a newspap , and when she reciv it , by mail , she realiz that it did n't work .
