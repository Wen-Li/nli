the main goal of everi univers is to form high perform student , and henc the question is to know how make these student perform and effcient in their futur job ? thank to a lot of theorit cours ? or thank to practic cours base on the observ of the fact and some experi ? in fact at the begin , the role of the school ha been tougth in order to share theorit knewledg , and not to prepar student to their futur job . whi ? becaus some stuff can not be taught and should be learnt outsid from the univers , in an other context , which enbabl to learn fact . therefor i am convinc that the first role of the shool or univers is to provid the theorit basi , which are necessari to the understand of the fact , and the problem of the real life . consequ , i believ that it more import that student understand concept and abstract idea , becaus these are the root of the understand of the fact . moreov , can the realiti of the fact be learnt at school ? for instanc , a job can not be taught realli at school , becaus the school doe not correspond to the real condit of a job . the univers can onli provid tool , abstract concept to make the student more effic in their futur job . but they can not prepar them to manag the everi day life of the job , in term of time manag , stress or commun problem between differ partner . these topic are learn directli in the compani , and the abil of a person to deal with these everi day life problem is base on the experi of these person . a classroom on these apect would be complet irrelev . that is whi , the univers encourag student to make internship . thi show that school acknowledg that it more import that student understand concept at school and then confront these abstract idea to the realiti of a job . in other word , i believ that a student should learn theorit concept at school , becaus thi is the right way to becom an effici worker : understand idea and concept in order to understand one 's own world .
