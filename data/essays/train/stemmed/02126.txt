mani peopl travel around the world in differ way . and it is true that one of the best way to travel is go in a group which is led by a tour gide . howev , i strongli disagre with thi way of travel . i prefer the way travel by myself . and there are sever reason for my way of travel . first of all , if i travel alon , without guid , i can experi more valuabl thing compar with guid travel . i agre that travel in a group led by a guid is conveni and can visit well-known place quickli . howev , while travel with tour buse you just take pictur or walk around place . you do n't realli have free time to experi someth spcial . as the schedul is too tight , you will just look around mani place . if i travel alon , howev , i can spend my time freeli and experi someth uniqu . for exampl , when i wa travel malaysia , i actual stay with nativ peopl . eventhough we could n't understand throughli , we could becom a good friend . from there i could experi the way of the nativ peopl 's life . it wa an unforgett experi in my life . next , most peopl think that travel with a tour guid will be cost effect but thi is not true . if you travel alon you can actual save more money . as a tour is oper by a guid compani , the compani tri to get more profit . so they increas the travel fee . two year ago , i actual want to travel japan by a tour guid compani . but befor i book i check how much money will cost for the travel by use the internet . and it wa surpris that the fee which the guid compani suggest wa two time hire than origin cost to tavel . so travel with a tour guid is total not cost-effect way . in conclus , the guid travel is sometim need to travel certain place such as alaska . but in my opinion , travel by oneself is the best way . becaus it give you much experi which is unforgett and you can save a lot of money .
