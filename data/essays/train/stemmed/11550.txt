everi person should enjoy their life as much as they can . the life is not long , and it will end . so should n't we enjoy our live when we are young ? i disagre the statement , and i think older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do . first , older peopl usual have more money than young peopl do . when you have money , you have the power . money is everyth . although sometim peopl say money ca n't buy happi , without money you ca n't do anyth . old peopl can use these amoung of money to travel everywher around the world , and buy anyth they want . in th other hand , young peopl start to find a perfect job . the power in them are not much . second , older peopl usual have famili , which is the happiest place to be . when they see their childern grow up , they enjoy that happi . when they have the grandchildren , the happi becom more . old peopl have their own famili to hang out with , they share everyth everyday . but young peopl do n't stick around the hous veri often . they want to play , and they do n't want to be control . although they are happi with their friend , not with parent . they 'll miss that . final , older peopl have more time than young peopl do . old peopl do n't worri about the work becaus mayb they are alreadi retir , or they alreadi have the posit in the compani . they can relax as much as they want without worri their job . but young peopl have to work hard everyday and tri to improv themselv to their boss . they tri to find the mate , but they are too busi to find . young peopl ca n't enjoy themselv becaus they alway have the pressur in mind . i am a young peopl now , and i tri to balanc my school and relax time . i ca n't say i am enjoy the life right now becaus i have n't get my goal yet . i want to be success , and then have fun . i realiz that the onli way to enjoy the life is work hard as a young peopl and play hard as a old peopl .
