i think that the most success peopl in the wourld are those who keep tri new thing and take risk . i think that becaus of three reason . the first reason is that thi kind of peopl , as i think learn new thing in their life becaus they do not give up easili ; so they alway tri to dicov new thing and ther is a famou speech say that peopl who fail will final succeed but those who are lazi and do not tri someth new or give up easil will never learn . the second reason support my opinion is that the peopl who alway keep tri new thing have more opportun and are more activ or energet than those who are satisfi with what they onli know ; in other word the first group , for exampl may improv their financi situat better or they may invent someth new that is veri use for our life . let us say that the first group of peopl are nventor and the lazi peopl are receivor . the third thing or reason is that the persev peopl may easili adapt with new situat other than other , for exampl , as think , if somebodi of the first group travel to anoth countri , he will adapt as quick as he can becaus he like new thing in gener . with regard to lazi person , as i like to call them , i know some person of thi kind who could not stay even for a month live alon in a new countri when they travel abroad and they are alway failur . what i want to confirm here is that ani person who tri new thing will final get it pass even if the number of failur he may commit , while anyon who is lazi and doe not want to learn anyth new will stay where he is and , in my opinion , he is alway a failur and someth that is excess to thi life .
