i think that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . they do make lot of good more appeal , and color or handi . the truth reveal when you buy it and us it . although advertis is imprtant to a new product in the market , to show peopl a new line of food , comput or servic . it doe not requir to run the advertis too mani time a day . i think that ani good relaiabl good and servic will eventuali control the market , regardless of how mani time other product would run their advertis becaus they will fail in the sell process as long as they are not as good . when i want to buy a comput , for exampl , i think first of dell , although there are lot of other popular brand which they have lot of advertis that run sever time on sever tv chanal and even on the newspap . i still like dell ' comput . i guess lern from person experi is way more valiabl than all the nice thing you see and hear about a product in an advertis . anoth exampl of servic . when it come to a tv cabl i like direct tv , . thi also becaus of a person experi . the servic that i had befor wa not relaiabl and noth even close to what they advertis . you could never talk to a person when you call them after have a problem . which happen to occur too mani time . like lose the singnal . asid from that . i had alway wounder how much these peopl ( produc ) are make to be abl to afford these expens advertis . becaus thi tell me that the product would realli be much cheaper if they have not wast lot of money on these advertis . although the role of advertis is veri import , it mostli ha been over use . for exampl , in the citi where i live i keep see thi advertis on tv that talk about how wounder thi chain of restur are . the funni part is , thi chain of restur is not exist in the state where i live . total wast of money , unless they expect from me to travel to other state to have a dinner .
