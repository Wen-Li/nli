i complet agre with thi statement . there is no doubt that the advertis do make a product look much better that they actual are . we should understand that the adverstis are air to make consum familiar of a product and to promot it sale . if a compani ha launch a product it ha to have maximum sale in order to have profit . so , they tri to attract the attent of the comsum by project it as the best product avail in the market . everi compani advertis it product as a super product as if no other product would ever be abl to beat their product in term of qualiti and price effect . i feel that they tri to fool innoc peopl for their own intrest . these day , compani project the research about the product . they just project the good qualiti of the product and hide the neg one to mislead peopl . for exampl , they wiill air that the studi have establish that their product is better that the product a , b , c and d in x , y , z paramet but they will hide the other paramet the product is not good in . i feel that a good qualiti product doe not need ani fanci advertis , it qualiti speak for itself and such a product will becom popular with popul just by word of mouth . accord to my feel , make a decsion to buy a product just becaus it is advertis as a veri good product is utter foolish and a wast of money . i , myself have been a victim of fanci advertis . but , i learnt my lesson of not go by advertis by incur heavi monetari loss . i now feel that it is respos of individu to protect themselv from fall into the trap that compani lay to extract money from consum by advertis .
