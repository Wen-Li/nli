i do n't think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i have three reason for my notion . one is the differ of pleasur which young peopl enjoy and that of older peopl do . second reason is that young peopl have a lot of the seed of annoy compar to older peopl . third one is the the amount of properti they have . first reason is the differ of how young peopl and older peopl enjoy their live . young peopl enjoy more activ someth use their bodi like sport , go somewher far from they live . on the other hand , older peopl have a lot of time they can use freeli . they can enjoy the time when they are be abl to be relax , they can feel the stream of time comfort . even though the kind of the pleasur is differ , both are great . what 's more , older peopl have alreadi experienc the joy which young peopl feel when they were young . as a second reason , we can say that somethim it is difficul for young peopl to enjoy their daili life wholeheartedli . it might be becaus of the relationship between friend in their school , the assign of home work . some children even do commit suacid . although older peopl have fewer problem they should do . third reason is the about how much money they can use . older peopl have much money they have earn , but young peopl , especi young children , doe n't have enough money they need . to spend the time do part time job to earn money sound like wast of time . for these three reason , it is difficult for me to state young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
