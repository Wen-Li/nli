i think that everi peopl have to take fun from the life ( young peopl and old peopl ) . could be differ factor that can give more fun to a young peopl but not to a old peopl . for exampl usual young peopl have more time to enjoy but old peopl have less time to enjoy . we can see that watch the job life of the life of a young peopl respect a job life of a old peopl . usual older peopl have less time respect a young peopl becaus a older peopl have a hard job that take a big part of the time in a day . a young peopl usual do n't have a job that take a big time of the day . that is one of the reason , but we can watch other factor . for exampl a young peopl usual have n't a wife or soon , but a older peopl usual have a wife , some soon and that is anoth factor that let less time to a old peopl to enjoy . infact a old peopl that have a famili prefer to spend some time with hi wife and with hi soon go out or stayng at home . a young peopl usual have a girlfriend but not a wife and that is an import differ between a older peopl ( with famili ) and a youger peopl ( without a seriu famili but onli with hi girlfriend ) . that is to say that usual a young peopl ha less problem respect a older peolpl . infact a young peopl ha n't big problem but a older ha probl to resolv as for exampl pay the car , pay the hous , pay the energi ecc . . but in all of thi topyc there is one think to say that is the follow think : everi peopl can fell insid two part of himself . a yonger part when you ha n't big problem and older part that slowli increas insid you when you becam a peopl with famili and with other inter form when he wa young when the problem could be onli the school or the girlfriend or other littl probl respect the probl that you know when you becam older .
