enjoy the life is one of the most signific step that each person should experi . there is no clear cut answer to the question if young peopl or older peopl enjoy life more . i think that it is not relat to the age but the situat of the peopl . moreov , peopl have differ advantag at the differ age . some advantag of the young peopl to enjoy life are their energi and money . howev , on the other hand older peopl have more time and more experinc . one of the biggest advantag of the young peopl to enjoy life is their energi . they are much healthier than the old peopl and have more willing to do more thing in order to enjoy life . for exampl they can travel to the other countri , while it is not veri possibl for the old peopl . howev , energi is not enouhg , time is also requir . when we consid that most of the young peopl have to work , old peopl have more free time for themselv . they are mostli retir and do not need to work so they can enjoy the life better . the second point is that enjoy life mean money . for the young peopl that is not a great problem sinc they are work and earn money . in contrast , for the older peopl it is not easi to enjoy the life with luxuri thing , becaus their salari from the retir is not veri high . howev needless to say is that with the experi that they have gain for mani year they can find the way to enjoy the life with less money . mani of the older peopl have travel and enjoy the life sinc mani year , that mean that they know veri well the cheapest place and thing to do . in sum , i disagre with the statement that ` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do` . base on my person experi i can claim that enjoy life is not depend on the age , but on the situat . as i point out abov , young peopl can have the energi and the money need for enjoy the life , howev that is not enough they need also time and some experi that the older peopl have .
