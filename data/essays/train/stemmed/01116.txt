i agre with the statement of the topic and put my view with regard to my opinion as follow . take for exampl the busi sector , most of the success peopl in are not mere to one sector alon , they have a group of compani or if not they want to improvis their establish by enter into differ field . stand in the place alon can not make them further more success , and here i rememb the say `` success is not a destin it is a journey '' there are mani establish of famou peopl which grow step by step tri new thing out for the newer gener need and the one who get to the need of the trnd is a success person . so in the present day of improvis civilis and technolog new and new invent should be done to reach the peopl and thi could onli by take risk , and i person feel that without risk there are no invent and no progress . how would one be success without a risk or tri out new thing . to state an exampl how would dhirubai ambani would be so succes without hi initi risk in invest for the busi , with hi risk today one of the largest group of relianc industri come into exist and still expand day by day with new field . there a lot mani exampl like thi where success lie onli after a risk . so tain ani field of life success as mention is a journey and to pass through thi journey sever risk are to be taken and if not they will come to a stand still and thi will not be call as success so i agre the statement that success peopl tri newth rather than do what they know .
