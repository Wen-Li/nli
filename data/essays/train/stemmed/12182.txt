the statement can be seen from two side . first , it is veri import for student to understand idea and concept within lectur becaus without thi understand the context of a lectur would not be kept in mind of the student . in my opinion the lectur ha the task to help the student understand idea and concept of the topic they are taught in . on the other hand the lectur at univers can not be compar with a lectur in school . in school the teacher ha the task to work so long on one topic until the whole class understood everyth . in univers the professor or lectur have to help the student get the idea and concept but the student have to keep in mind that they have to work at home addit for the lectur and mayb the lectur onli help them to understand idea and concept . second , it is also veri import for student to learn fact becaus in busi they need these fact daili and to have a profound knowledg hard fact have to be includ . herefor the problem is that the fact can onli be use as a tool when the student know what the mean of these fact are and which topic belong to which learn fact . it make no sens to learn fact without have ani idea for what topic they are use . i think that thi statement is controversi becaus understand idea and concept and learn of hard fact belong togeth . it is necessari to understand idea and concept but the fact need to underlin the argument in a special case must be learn as well . on the other side the hard fact can be learn but without the background of idea and concept the fact are useless . it onli make sens to learn fact when concept and idea are alreadi understood becaus than the argument can be underlin with them .
