i am agre with the given statement . accord to day to day experi as a student i can say , it is more import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . firstli , let elabor it by cite an exampl . in math subject there are few fact , base on which a student ha to do sum . but is that possibl that onli by learn the fact the student will be abl to solv a given sum . until a student donot understand the concept of solv proper type of sum , he will stuck up with the sum . by onli learn math fact student will be abl to solv onli a particular type of sum . if he ha not understood the concept of solv it , he will not be abl to solv the same kind of sum if the sum is slightli twist . secondli , if a student doesnot understand ani subject and just mug up the fact of the subject , he will not be abl to retain it for long . it is a prove fact , that the thing which are understood are more retent than the thing which are just mug up . by understand ani topic of a subject a student can use it more practic . thirdli , let consid medic student . if a medic student just learn the fact about human bodi and donot understand it , he can do big mistak and it will be a question of life and death . if he ha not understood human bodi and just learn the fact , whenev he will find a slightli differnt diseas , he will not be abl to prescrib ani medicin . becaus he might couldnot have learnt the deseas exactli the same way . but by understand he can make out that it is just a slight differ menefest of the same deseas . thu in the light of abov mention exampl it can be safe said that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
