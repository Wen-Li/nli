new advertis is focus on appear and not on qualiti i believ that most advertis is focus on creat a cool imag about a certain product . therefor , all these product are useless and will not satisfi consum prefer . first , compani are more interest to wast money on advertis rather than on research and develop ( r & d ) . consum will prefer to have a more function item rather than an item that is useless and expens . for exampl , few week ago i bought an ipod and i wa not sure to buy it becaus mac ha invest a huge amount of money and i heard some complaint about ipod 's function . anyway , i bought an ipod on friday and just after two day from thi day i accident drop it and my ipod becam useless . second , advertis is alway deep empti and it is aim to show off a certain product . most of the peopl get surpris by a nice look item and it advertis , but i do not . i take into account as a consum the focu group that a certain item is aim to . and if i do not feel close to the idea of the advertis , i will not consid to buy it . third , advertis is aim to hide qualiti characterist in order to cheat consum . i believ that a good qualiti product doe not need ani advertis . as an exampl , my oldest brother ha bought a bang & olufsen stereo and i have not heard of that brand of stereo befor . i did some research by internet about thi brand and i got surpris becaus it is known that bang & olufsen is the best world wide brand for stereo . onc again , advertis alway told me that soni wa the best brand world wide , but it is not if a consum is look for qualiti . in conclus , advertis mayb guarante a cooler product by it gener consent , but not an effect one . advertis is for not intellig peopl and it alway tri to hide defici on product .
