i agre with thi statement for these reason . first , most advertis appeal an advantag of the product , hide a disadvantag . let 's think about the advertis of a medicin . most of them highlight the effcet of the product . not even suggestiong the side-effect of the product . in particular , the medicin for a diet , which is popular in these day , too much focus on how effectivli help peopl lose weight in a short time , not even consid side-effect of the product . if the advertis of these product do not warn peopl about the side-effect , then peopl might get medicin too much than they should do , and caus a big problem . secondli , advertis tend to attract a custom by chang a slogan or an imag of product in purpos . the real product seem not to be differ from the one in the pictur , but if one close look into the product , one might notic that the real product are slightli differ whatev in color or size . thi is one of the strategi of advertis to sell more product , but it prevent the custom from judgig the product correctli . in addit , studiest indic that these littl chang use in the advertis could have a big impact on the custom . third , peopl are like to listen to someon who are wide admir . becaus of thi fact , some advertis appeal their product use the statement of the celebr ; futhormor , these celebr appear in the newspap or tv show to advertis the product . thi make peopl entir reli on the states of the celebrit , and purchas the product without deep consider . advertis is use sometim becaus it provid use inform about the product to custom . but it could fool custom in order to make product seem much better than they realli are by exagger the advantag of product or use some tricki way to advertis the product .
