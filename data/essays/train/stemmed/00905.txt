on my opinion , the success dure life is given by a varieti of element : luck , capac to choos the right moment to do someth , knowledg of cours and , for sure , the capac to tri new risk , new thingh and new challeng rather than onli do what you alreadi do well . let 's think about some exampl . the econom field is full of peopl that start from noth , had a particularli good busi idea and becam rich and famou in a rel short time . i have in mind the exampl of henri ford : he had the idea , he develop it and everyon now know hi name . of cours , you do n't just need a good idea but you need also other element , like the one i wrote abov . moreov you have to know that you are face big risk that could complet destroy what you have made . let 's imagin an hipotet world in which peopl do not love car : the henri ford 's idea would probabl not have been success . thi is part of the risk . anoth good exampl is the follow . let ' s imagin a share market investor : he could behav in a not aggress way , invest almost all the amount of hi money in bond and just a few money in share or he could risk tri to gain as much as he can with the share of an emerg countri . well , if everyth goe well for him , he will becom richer than befor otherwis he will lose what he ha . state thi , i do not want to say that it is better to risk instead of have a secur return ; i just want to say that to have success you need to be a littl riski and tri new challeng that you have not alreadi tri . but mayb it is not the onli way to have success . if you do someth well , sometim it is not use to tri new experi . it could be better to tri to special yourself more on your activ to achiev the success in your field . so , on my opinion , the best way depend on your person and on how much you want to risk everyth you have done until the moment you decid if it is better or not to tri new challeng .
