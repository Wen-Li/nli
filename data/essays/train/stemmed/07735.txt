in my oppinion , i agre young peopl nowaday do not have enough time to help their commun . there are two reason of my oppinion . first , most of young peopl have a lot of homework and afterschooh program . besid , most of their parant do not care about their children if have pacienc to help their commun . therefor they mayb not educ them to help peopl when they were kid . secondli , there are mani attract thing catch young pepl 's eye . in these day , most of young peopl have a lot of homework and afterschool program must to do , especi in taiwan . young peopl want to enter the prestig school and to achiev their parant ' expect `` enter the famou school and have a good job . '' they spent a lot of time studi and get good grade . in the school , teacher will not activ encourag young peopl joint help or servic group to help and servic other peopl . in addit , the young peopl will affaird of lose than other student as they spend time help poor peopl . the homework and the pressur of enter the famou school make stusdent do not help peopl and the commun activ . moreov , most of their parant think help peopl and the commun will make their children not concentr on the point - enter the famou school and have a good job . therefor , when they were kid the parant did not activ encourag them to connect with the commun and help someon . the parant ' view directli affect young peopl 's view . final , the most import is that young children are attract by the newest and funni thing , for exampl , the song of hip pop , the famou singer ect . most of the young peopl think i do not use my time to help other , trace the famou singer is most interst . abov of all , there are few peopl care about encourag their children to connect with their commun and help each other . it make young peopl use their time to do anoth thing which are meaning to them . so i think young peopl do not share thier liesur time to the commun .
