it ha been argu that it is better to gain wider knowledg of numer academ subject rather than to deepli research one specif subject . i disagre with thi idea becaus special one particular subject bring sever advantag for the follow reason . first , sinc technolog is realli advanc nowaday , professin , who have deep knowledg of one subject , are more requir than generalist who have broader knowledg . for instanc , my uncl work in micro soft . he told me that when he start work in the compani , there were mani employe who had vast gener knowledg . howev , sinc comput technolog ha been develop dramat , the compani onli hire specialist these day becaus more sophist programm are essenti in order to advanc it technolog . thi tendenc explain that it is better to focu on a specif subject than to have broad knowledg of wider subject . second , as technolog is sophist , special knowledg is mandatori to protect it as well . for exampl , pc secur and comput hacker are one of good exampl . my uncl ha been assign in a comput secur divis in micro soft . there are 20 core member in hi divis , who all have phd , includ my uncl . hacker do like comput and they studi comput program veri deepli . thu , the secur divis must hire peopl who are veri special to fight the hacker . thi exampl also repres that it is better to gain a special knowledg than broader knowledg of mani academ topic . lastli , special knowledg bring higher incom . for instanc , my uncl receiv much higher salari than hi long time friend who are a sale repres in micro soft . hi friend studi variou subject in hi school age and actual regret that he should have focus on a particular subject . in summari , although some peopl insist that it is better to develop broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to focu on a particular subject , i disagre with thi idea . thi is becaus the latest sophist technolog requir specialist in a particular subject to develop and protect it . special knowledg also bring higher incom .
