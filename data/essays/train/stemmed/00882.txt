i feel that it alway better to understand thing and not just mug them up . understand idea and concept can lead to a better understand of the topic . also if you get to understand it complet it can help you better in understand of it relat topic . you would also be benefit at the time of the examin . understand help you a lot for futur . if you go for research work later in your life then thi understand of topic would help you to take your research easili . secondli when you understand a idea then you dont commit mistak on that particular topic . for exampl , if a doctor dont care to understand concept about the human bodi , then in futur he would be prone toward do error . also he wont becom a successful doctor in futur . and by destroy a case he would end himself in prison . so , the exampl clearli show how import it is to understand thing . we can also take an exampl of a comput engin , where everi fact and concept about the machin count a lot . and if he is unabl to understand idea then he would just end up in choa . he would just damag the machin , and we all know how costli these comput machin are . thirdli understand of idea in a younger age help you a lot when you go and pursu your higher educ . for exampl , the understand of concept at bachelor level help you a lot in understand of the concept in your master . howev , when it come to the examin , when you dont have time to understand concept it alway advis to learn the fact . at time crise it alway better to learn than wast time in understand it , becaus you are never sure that after spend so much time in understand it , will you realli be abl to understand it . also at the time of quizz onli learn fact help you win the game , and not the understand of it . becaus there are so mani thing in the world to know about , and you dont have time to understand there concept , and onli option is to learn it . as reinstat in my answer understand is import , it can not be compar with learn . both have there own stand .
