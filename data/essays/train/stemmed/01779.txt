most product need to be advertis accord to me . advertis help the peopl to know more about the product in detail . advertis increas the demand of the product . it also help the seller to increas the sale of the new product . for exampl : if ani new product is launceh in the market but it not advertis then peopl will not be awar of the product that will automat result in their low sale . advertis mean public . public can be of ani king like mouth public , advertis in t.v. , banner , newspap etc . advertis help the public to know about the new product which is go to be launch in come futur . advertis is the key of sale . it play an import role in the sale of a particular product into the market . for suppos a new product in introduc in the market after mani research , deep studi and test but if at the end it not advertis or publish infront of the public no one will be awar of the new launch . so advertis also equal play an import role in compars to the product of good their market strategi , test etc . one more exampl : if suppos two compani had launch their product at the same time and out of those two one had done a good advertis befor the product come into the market and other had not done ani advertisemnt of their product . we may find the differ in sale of the two product . the product which is advertis is sale among public becaus peopl are awar of the product . they know it will fulfil thir demand . but at the same movement the product which is not advertis their will be no sale of that product though the product is much better then the product which is advertis befor their launch in the market . the differ come becaus of advertisemnt , lack of public among the peopl . so for the effect run of ani product in the market advertis is veri necessari . when peopl will know about the new product they will think when they will think they will buy then the conclus will come up whether a product is good or not . so advertis is veri necessari for the sale of ani product . advertis play an import key role in the sucess or sale of ani product in the market .
