i strongli aggre with the statement that yong peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i think yong peopl have less resposibl than older peopl . older peopl have to earn money and take care of their famili . for thi reason , old peopl abandon their time and life for their famili . otherwis , yong peopl doe not have such a respons . they spend most of time for their own life . in my case , i spend my time on play game and sport , do habbi or watch movi . howev , my parent can not enjoy what they want to do . they work everi day to support us . therefor , i think that enjo life depend on the havi of respons . for other reason , yong peopl are more energet than old peopl . even if someon realli enjoy play harsh sport but is not energet enough , he can not do those sport . in my experi , even when my famili goe vacat to mountain , valley or beach , my parent can not play longer . they exhaust faster than i do . thu , i agre with that statment . furthermor , yong peopl are more open at mani entertain system than old peopl . as time pass , mani entertain system that did not exist in past ha develop . so yong peopl have more chanc and more choic to enjoy their life . in these reason , i gree with the statemnet that yong peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
