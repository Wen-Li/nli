i disagre with the statement . i believ that it is better to special in an area that to be familiar to a whole lot of academ subject . my respons is base on an experi that speek for itself . be from an engin background i wa face with a similar situat where i need to choos between a spealiz cours of inform technolog ( it ) and a gener stream of comput scienc which also includ it . i would rather be good at one thing than know about a wide rang of area . so i took it . now i can proudli say that i special in it n get a brilliant job rather than say that i know about mani area n settl for an averag job . similar case where doctor after do mbb have to specil in a stream to be success . suppos a person is just mbb . he know about everi part of the bodi but doesnot know how to handl a patient who urgent need a heart surgeri . thi again put light on the topic where special count a lot . in thi specif case it could mean life or death for the patient . when a person is good at a certain area he/sh can persu a career in that stream . everyon ha like and dislik for subject . no one can say that he/sh like all area of the academ curriculum . thu the person must persu the area which they are most interest in and special in it . thi will not onli make him/her happi but also keep other happi . and the person is most like to do well by studi someth they are keen on . on the other hand the person who is jack of all trade is most like to be unhappi n make peopl around him unhappi by not be good at what he/sh is do . thu we can clearli conclud that it is better to special than to have broad knowledg about academ subject .
