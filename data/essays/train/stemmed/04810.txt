about the statement , some peopl may agre that , but other may have negit attitud . as far as i am concern , i agre that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their communutu . afterward , i will develop my opinion in suffici depth and detail . first of all , the transpot are so conveni and develop today . peopl , inculd young , go to everywher so easili , their appear are not limit in the commun . when young peopl step out the door of hous , they can take buse , taxi , or subway , even drive car by themselv and go to the place they want to . they even never pay attent to the commun they live in . how to talk about help their commun . moreov , the social secur today becom wors and wors . no one can warrant that it 's alway safe in the commun . it 's possibl that the bad bad guy are our neighborhood . besid young peopl , all peopl may have no confid about the commun they live in . no one is will to behavior friendli to the commun with no confid . last , there are too mani attract thing today for young peopl , like internet , pub , movi , vedio game , etc . so mani funni staff can be done by young peopl . they are too busi have fun on those thing to care about the commun they live in . in a word , i would state my opinion that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun after thoe reason analyz abov .
