i total disagre with the atat that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . two reason came up to my mind . there have been great car now , therefor , i have some posit advantag which will have been not make car fewer in twenti year , . at first , what i would like to emphas that technolog ha been develop veri well in these day . i can say that it is also for car , becaus almost everi car ha got audio player , car navig system , or even system for talk on the phone when we are drive . everybodi ha at least one car each famili and we can not live without have car . in addit , we alway use car even for five-minute-walk distanc in realiti . it is so clear that variou car syatem are develop recentri and i can not see whi it will not continu in the futur . perhap car will have got more effect system that make us more comfort to drive in . next reason is that car are realli import social thing for our countri , japan . japan is known for make a lot of car and when i went to foreign countri i never go out without see japanes car on the load . we often admir to make great deal of car in the world . car are posit one of our prioriti so we should not stop make wonder car for us and also for foreign who love them . it would be foolish if we make ourselv stop make the great product or have fewer carsthan now . these are my major reason whi i disagre with it . i am sure that noth will be abl to replac car , even though there should be such an incred creatur or investig in the futur , becaus it is necessarili for us for everyth such as for keep our social statement and great work .
