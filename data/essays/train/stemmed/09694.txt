the question put forward by the issu is that , whether the succes peopl tri new thing and take risk than do the alreadi know one . the issu is veri import becasu success onli come when their is an effort and risk . i believ that sucess peopl do new thing rather than do what they alreadi know . the first reason of my belief is that , success is the hous of the peopl who take some risk in their life and peopl be success when they have accomplish new thing in a better way . for instanc , issac newton a great scientist the world ha ever known did not sit quit after hi success in the gravit theori . instead he move in other field of physic which is newer to him and earn laurel in all the new field he ha taken . furthermor , do the thing which are alreadi know is not term as discoveri but it is develop . and discoveri are more apprici than develop . tri new thing turn us to be versatil geniu consed the success in the field as the next part . lastli , i believ by tri or explor new thing can lead us new discoveri or new thesi . for exampl , when galileo discov pendulum , he explor to the newer feild of astronomi and discov telescop and declar the previou thesi lay wa fals by hi new experi . thi show that explor in new thing is greater and more advantag than labour on the same know one . ultim , tri a new thing is more benefici and appreci than lay on the alreadi known thing . iam on the side of tri newer thing becaus newer concept are alway intrest than the known bore one and the search of newer way , thing or new idea is alway reward . so i agre that sucsess peopl tri new thing and take risk for further success .
