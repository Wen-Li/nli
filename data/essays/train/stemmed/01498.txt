human be is becom success in everi aspect or everi area which he is enter . peopl who know what to do in near futur are the onli one that will attain success in their life . when we take an exampl of the millionar or the billionair they attain success onli from sheer hard work in which area they are strong . so i disagre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . they will not take risk becaus sometim the success may depend upon luck and the knowledg of the area in which one wa enter and the loss which he had to bare and so on . human be must know the right area in which he can succeed . becaus he will know the easi way to get profit in busi or rise to a higher posit in a compani . if there is a risk in that area he will sure know it and tri to minimis the risk . but when a person enter a new area he will not know the risk it ha . luck is the onli thing that is go to help him in that new area . he will attract to the advantag rather than disadvantag . thi may lead to mani psycolog problem which a human sometim can not bear . enjoy life happier is just the thing that a human want which canb obtain onli by money . some peopl think that they can do ani thing in ani where such that pour of money is more if they enter everi area . if there is a loss he would tri to take hi life also . so peopl must avoid do such thing and success will follow onli when you choos the right path . more knowledg will give more success in that area so that one can rise to a higher level . so i strongli disagre with the given statement .
