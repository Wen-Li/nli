in gener , peopl keep much knowledg along their studi and are abl to use these knowledg in the life . while some peopl prefer to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject other prefer the revers situat of the previou statement . in my opinion , special in one specif subject is better than have knowledg of mani academ subject . firstli , i prefer special in one specif subject becaus it will allow me to improv my skill in thi special . for exampl , i prefer to studi all time in n onli one field to be abl to studi in depth all the phenomenon which are in thi feild . also , it will permit me to be an expert of my special . secondli , it is better to do a special becaus i will permit me to be well organ . for instanc , my schedul of studi will not be share into mani differ academ subject . then , i could be relax to manag my time to do an excel work . on contrari , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is not a good way becaus a person who doe it will not have time to studi in depth all these subject . as an exampl , someon who want to studi in the same time physic , philosophi , theolog and law will not be abl to know deepli each of these subject . also , it is wrong to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus i will not have enough time to do all my work accuretli . such a person who ha to submit within a tini time eight or ten tremend work , it will be veri difficult for him to do good work and submit work on time . in sum , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject ha disadvantag and special in one specif subject ha advantag . as far as i 'm concern , it is better to special in one subject . peopl should special in one specif subject in their studi .
