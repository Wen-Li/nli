some peopl believ that young peopl can enjoy life more than older poepl do . but from my point of view , the opposit is the truth . i think it is hardli for a young man to enjoy hi life better than an older man . first of all , nowaday few young peopl are awar the purpos of their live . it is hard to say that a person could be happi without know the purpos of hi life . instead , mani of them idl their preciou time . they do not know what they should care most in their life . older peopl , on the contrari , know exactli what their purpos are . so they do not care much over other trifl as young peopl do . they know how to set up a goal and keep chase it . thi is what i envi older peopl most . one of my cousin spent two year in a colleag and tri to find her favorit major . but even now she can not make up her mind becaus she chang her interest so frequent . furthermor , young peopl are not matur enough to control themselv . so they make more mistak . mani young peopl do thing just out of an implus , . sometim it can be danger to do thing thi way . as for older peopl , most of them know clearli what is right and what is wrong . they have their own judgement and they can often do thing accord to their life experi . no wonder our young peopl alway need an adult to teach us right from wrong . final , young peopl are much easier to give in to temptat , especi in today 's societi . they are not steadi enough to avoid the bad effect of mani neg thing in our societi . but as for older peopl , they have seen much more than us , so they know when and how to say no to temptat . so , i think it is easier for an older person to enjoy hi life than a young person . but i also believ we young peopl need guid and we learn how to live and enjoy our live through mistak and experi . as we grow older , we will enjoy our live better .
