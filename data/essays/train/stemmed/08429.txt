car are primarili a mean of transport . i reckon that the number of car be use in the next twenti year will decreas . car manufactur might not show their anxious and current sale trend might not show it but other omin sign are on the horizon . thing like popul expans , price of petroleum , low avail of road space and newer technolog will come into the pictur . firstli , the popul of the world is rapidli increas . as develop countri like china and india continu to prosper . their birthrat will most like follow the same trend . but , not everyon will be abl to buy a car , in fact the birthrat in poorer popul have been found to be much greater than richer one . govern will shift polici to facilit mass commut and stymi the increas in car . . high tax for own more than two car are alreadi in place in mani citi with larg popul . also , it is common knowledg that our petroleum resourc will deplet in around two decad . newer fuel technolog like fuel cell will come into the pictur . but these technolog are not expect to matur both technolog and econom in twenti year time time . peopl have alreadi start go to work in carpool , buse and subway , thi way they save money on the alreadi sky high petrol price . imagin , what the price will be 10 year down the line , let alon 20 year . the last point that i would like to make is that car mostli run on big citi road . most of these citi are around 100 year old . they were not built to handl enorm number of car . even after much reconstruct the road space availibilti is not expect to be increas much further . congest is a day to day problem face by all citi . peopl have even start propos fli car and have built some prototyp for the same . which all impli that if there is'nt ani roadspac left , there might not be newer car be bought to pli on them . in conlcus , i 'd like to say that i would much rather put my money on public transport than car as be the mean for transport in the futur . govern polici , rise ga price , road congest and popul expant all seem to point toward a decreas in the number of car , howev fli machin might be in vogu . after twenti year , it just might be a novelti to go out for a picnic in your famili sedan over the weekend .
