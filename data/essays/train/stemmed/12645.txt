i like to see advertis , especi on tv . there is a varieti of advertis ( i.e. , tv commorci ) . some advertis look like a tv drama ; some advertis look as if it threte us to buy it . it is the compani sell podust who produc the advertis for the product . there is almost no except on the fact , i think . thu , i person agre with thi statement . need less to say , advertis are made in order to encourag consum to buy product . there is no wonder that a compani tri to show it product better as much as possibl . i believ that it introduc it produt better than real . when i wa a child , i watch advertis for an air plane toy . in the advertis , i wa the plane fli the air . at that time , i wa so impress and ask my paret to buy me . my further bought me it one day . howev , i wa so disapoint with the plain , sinc it did not fli ! . my further also wa dissapoint at see me be sisapoint . i have never trust advertis sinc then . recent , i enjoy advertis as a kind of fiction of product . i believ that advertis is a kind of present to express what product a compali wish to make . thu , i agre with the statement .
