i agre with have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i think that all peopl need to basic skill and knowledg . if i did not know launguag , i did not studi at all . when i got the job that is veri supecif jpb , if i did not broad knowledg , i would not work at all . for instanc , mr takenaka who wa japanes prime minist , is specil in econom . he decid a lot of effect econom bill . but mr takenaka did not know other progrem well . he made some happen in sumit becaus he is lock knowledg of intern rule . and he made bad effect wellfer bill becaus of hi lock knowledg . so , mr takenaka 's exampl say that good economist who specil someon did not alway good prime mminist . thu we should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than spcializ in one specif subject . if you want to chang your job , you can easi to chang becaus you have broad knouledg of mani academ subject . but i did not disagre with have knowledg special in one specif subject . if i have specid skill and knouledg , i can be charastarist . and i can easi to get my job . so i suggest that pepol , who want to studi , should studi about broad knowledg of mani academ subject as peopl find supecif subject that they want get knowledg . in my experi , i wa high school student . i would like to becam a doctor . but i did not studi specal in sicolog . i studei mani subject , and i reconsid what i want to becom . as day go by , i would like to becom a intern account . so i can chang my futur easili , becaus i had broad knowledg of mani academ subject . and now i major in econom in univers . so i think that it is import to get broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
