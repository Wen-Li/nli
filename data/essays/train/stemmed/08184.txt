in my honymoon my wife and i travel by car to all itali we were abl to stop in ani place that we like ore we can move if we don n't like the place or if we were tire . i rememb thast in florenc the chappel wa close becaus the gober wa repair it so we have the oportun to take the car and leav the citi , also in the pissa we saw the pissa tower , that wa amass , and then leav to the next citi nevertheless we saw a group lead by a tour guid that had to waith until the time schedul for that citi wa finish to move on . whoever travel with a group led by a tour guid did n't offer thi benefit , in my opinion it give tow benefit , the first one is the explan that the tour guid give , and the second one the rate that you have for travel in a group . in some countri there are not tour guid that can splain you the histori of the place , some specif ditail about the construct , the way of leav , recomend in the food , and also recomend in the price , all of thi can be veri helpful when you travel by your sellf . alsoit is amass the rate that you can find in the market if you travel in a group , the person that organis thi kind of trip are alway find the best rate becaus they sell volum so the hotel give them the best rate to fill the hotel , also they areng transport and is cheaper travel in a bu that in sever car . for my famili and i the best way of travel is without a tour guid and by our self , becaus we prefer to spend moni rent a car in a fore contri and have the oportun to decid wheter we wanth to stay in a place or not , also if you travel to lage citi you will find electron tour guid that can easilli fastforwar .
