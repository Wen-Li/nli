accord to a friend of mine , the main differ between the french academ system and american one 's is about the knowledg . inde , the french prefer to studi a lot of subject until univers wherea american have the possibl to choos the specialis quit quickli . in my opinion , to be special in one specif subject can be realli interest . actual , the person is realli perform and it can be benefit for the firm . and sometim , thi specif subjct is realli difficult and search . thi job can worth a lot of money ! howev , i definitli prefer to have broad knowledg of mani academ . first of all , we know mani more inform about the world and it could be help to have an overview . then , for a futur job , it could be better to know sever thing and choos the one where i am the best . moreov , if , i quit my job for differ reason ( employmemt , person problem . .. ) i will be happi to have other qualif in my resum . for instanc , actual , i am in a busi school and we learn mani thing . when i chose my subject i chose a third languag , italien . i realli think that , in the futur , it will be better to understand 3 languag instead of onli one ! i will give you anoth exempl . if you have an abil , that is good ! but do n't lay on it ! in thi world , there qre so mani thing interst , if we had the chanc to studi let 's do it ! that is the best opportun in life ! to sum up , the special is great but have a broad knowledg give us the best chanc in life for our futur carrier !
