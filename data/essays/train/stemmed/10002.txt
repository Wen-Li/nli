i have ever believ that it is more import for student to understand concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , when one understand someth he or she probabl remeb thi idea for a long time . instead when one just learn a fact , probabl he or she soon forget it . next , when one understand an idea , it is possibl to reus thi idea in similar context that simetim have to be face dure one 's life . as einstein said , `` imagin is more import than knowledg '' , and i think that undertand effort stimul imagin , as well as the abil to infer . moreov , whenev one understand a new difficult concept , he or she feel a kind of satisfact and becom a littl more confid . i think that thi is import to find out new breakthrough and the world ha ever improv thank to new idea and discoveri . howev , learn fact is import too . for instanc i think that studi histori is help to avoid error and mistak . in fact studi histori , student learn bad consequ of war and mistak in gener so that they can do better in the futur . in conclus i think that that student should do their best in order to undertand the more they can from teacher 's lectur and book .
