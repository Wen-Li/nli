i agre with thi statement . in my opinion onli learn fact will help you to pass an test , and mayb get a good result , but for your later life you | ll not be abl to understand relat or process which are necesari in mani field . but for area of knowledg which are not need in my further life , learn fact and finish a test is ok , in all other case you have to know | how it work | . for exampl if you | re studi for a technic grade you | ll have to understand , whi physic law are work and how . it doesn | t make sens to know the fact , if you | re not familar with the basic understand you | ll not be abl to creat new electron circuit or work in the field of research & develop . also in mathemat if you not abl to understand | phytagora | ... or differential-calcul it make no sens to goon for deeper knowledg in thi field . furthermor there will be no test , which you | ll pass without present that you familiar with thi thing . also in my life i experienc , that if i will get a detail knowledg in some area i have to understand the simpl and basic concept , without thi understand it | s not possibl to go on .
