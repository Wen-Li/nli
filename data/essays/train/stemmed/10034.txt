in my opinion , apart from some specfic case of peopl who are ` self taugh ' , we alway need to use the experi of our ancestor . it is completli insan to set a frontier between past and present . success in whatev field is built on past experi . for instanc , in biolog , current scientist are lead research program use the conclus of former scientist . alexand fleme discov pennicillin in the 1920 and medic progress could not be as advanc as it is today if he had not . nevertheless , admittedli , if you do not take risk , you are not like to make progress . inde , if investor had not trust scientist to fund their research , there would not have been such an advanc scienc . investor can be state , privat compani , etc . they take risk becaus when they invest their money in medic reserach for intanc , they are not sure that thi research program will be success tomorrow . if the program fail , they can lose all the money they invest in such a program to the detriment to other potenti success program . the solut would be to match both the opinion . most of success peopl tri new thing and use what they know from former experi at the same time . inde , peopl must call themselv into question befor take risk and they must tri new thing to surviv . tht is whi human be are so differ from anim . thi is what we call human intellig . not to take danger basic , i think both part of the statement are true but we must bind rhem togeth not oppos them . inde , in order to go further in the analysi , it is imposs to take risk whithout use what we know and , on the contrari , you can not make progress without take risk .
