i total agre with the statement of `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . whi i agre with thi point of view , and how do i feel about it ? i think there would be some good reason for get young peopl nowaday can be more invo with their commun . first of all , i think whi the young peopl nowaday do n't like spend time with their commun , becaus in the morden day as we are now , there are lot of interest thing and place that young peopl prefer to take . such as video game , internet , travel , and meet new friend these are the reason that take lot of time from the young peopl nowaday than the young peopl at the past-tim . anoth main point i think will be the industri revolut . in the past time they need a lot of bodi work that mean everyon have to get invol their commun to help each other . but at nowaday , we are live in an veri differ form of life than the earli day . that everyon just have to take care of their own life and no need to reli on the other . how is it effect to our nowaday commun by the young peopl do not give enough time to help ? i think it affect in mani way of our sociti . one the main effect , i think , is the relationship between peopl live in commun . as the result of thi problem the relationship get colder and colder between each other . so i think if we can encourag the young peopl to help their commun in mani differ way that will bring peopl close of their commun . peopl will start know each other and help each other , and it can also help the young peopl to do more valueabl thing than just wast their time on the other thing .
