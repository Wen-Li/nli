no one can deni that the countri need alot of work and effort to becom stronger . so all the countri deppend in her peopl to becom one of the best countri in the wold and that would not be until the all commmun work hard to reach that . so if we realli want to becom one of the best we should work hard ; and i mean by we ; all the peopl in the countri young and old poepl becaus the counti not onli for one person it is forth whole peopl in the commun . so about the question i think that i disagre with thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun becaus i think that young peopl is the basec of the commun and without young peopl there would be no commun . moreov , the commun deppend most on the young gener becuas they have the effort and the abliti to work for a long time without complan . besid , the young peopl have the strong and the health to work in differ place . but nowaday there is alot of ald peopl who say that young peopl do not give enough time to help the commun and that is of cours not corret becaus alot of young men nowaday can not find a job so they con not help there commun . but in the other hand nowaday there is alot of other young peopl who work hard and they are realli interest in there job so the give it there whole time and effort besid , the are creat alot of new thing in the commun that are veri use for nowaday and for the futur . so after all thi thing that the young peopl had made nobodi can egnor there import in the commun .
