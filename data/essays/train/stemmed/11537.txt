i generali tri to hire a good guid tour dure my vacat if my budget agre with it . on one hand you could save thi money to be in a better hotel , but on the other hand you can make your trip a lot more worthi . usual the major purpos of a trip is to visit a new differ countri from our own and to learn from an other cultur . it 's a lot of invest to get to a foreign countri , and with a tour guid you can improv the benefit of your trip . let me explain now how : a local tour guid will be abl to make you feel the cultur , and to bring you to none tourist place , which will make you feel realli in the countri . he will also explain you a lot of histor event that you would have never heard about it and it will mayb creat a new interest in thi particular countri or cultur . i went to japon a few month ago with my japanes piano teacher and a good friend of mine . if i had been alon , it would have been a complitli differ and less meaning trip for me . we first live in a local famili , and the guid help us to be more and more curiou about everyth we could and of cours commun with local peopl . it ha realli been a great life chang experi to learn a hole differ cultur , habit and way of think . i can assur you that i would just rememb the nice beach next to our hotel if my piano teacher would n't have come . i 'm now proud to know a littl more about asian cultur , and when peopl ask me `` what did you gain from thi trip '' , i wa happi not to answer `` the sun burnt me , it look good no ? '' .
