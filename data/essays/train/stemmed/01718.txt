the first quot that come to my mind when i read the statement is `` jack of all , master of none '' . i do not support incomplet knowledg not onli becaus of it non reliabilti , also becaus it is harm to a certain extent . there ha alway been a differ in `` know '' some thing about mani thing and `` master '' everyth about someth . a special on a specif subject matter not onli enhanc one abil to excel in that field , but it also creat some great oppurtun for the person to make a mark in hi field . have a broad knowledg in more than one subject doe not complet the ani of the abov purpos . the highest one can probabl do is have a gener talk about it and noth more . but that not one can do all hi life !!! just talk a littl about mani thing he know . special is an achiev in itself . it not onli give the student a satisfact of achievemnt but also a sens of pride to have gain the kind of knowledg he ha alway crave for . it give us a kind of secur within . a kind of peac . one becom reliabl on hi most trust knowledg on a certain subject . one begin to trust himself and becom confid of hi action , and confid is the architect of one 's bright futur . special doe a lot more than just keep one occupi proffesion . it increas the knowledg base of a person and also make the person crave for more knowledg in that area and in thi way he outsmart himself everyday . it make one life a challeng each day . it make one life more and more excit !!! area of expertis is not just appreci proffesion but also in the long run it is appreci as a gather amount of inform on a subject matter . it is not use for the person alon but for the societi , friend , famili as well . and henc i believ in master in what one is passion about than broad knowledg of wide rang of subject .
