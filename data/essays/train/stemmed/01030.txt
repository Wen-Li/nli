a commun is an organis that indulg in selfless activ which will inde be benefiti for the societi as a whole . the commun do not oper for money or commerci purpos . the onli kind of ` fuel ' a commun need to perform it function is the contin support from the peopl which surround it . the support from the young is veri vital in thi case as they have the zeal to accomplish task with great profici . young brain are veri innov and would alway help the commun in variou aspect . howev , in my opinion , nowaday the young do not give enough time to these commun . they have adopt an ignor attitud toward them and fail to realis that the commun is inde make their life easier . let us take an exampl of a commun that work for the old age , the commun 's basic oper are to help the old in live their remain live cheer and without troubl . the commun help them by do a part of their daili chore and by spend time with them to give them some compani . now the young fail to realis that if the commun flourish , it is they who will inde be benefit , the life of their grandpar will becom easier and not onli thi , they would get the same kind of love and affect from other when they grow old . the young are howev unconcern , and would prefer spend their free time watch televis , play comput game or mere wast time with friend . they do not realis that involv in these commun ha mani hidden benefit too . one get a feel of self satisfact and respons as he would be contribut to the develop of the societi , he would also attract apppreci from other member of the neighbourhood and they would valu hi action . one can also learn a lot mani virtu by work for selfless caus , he is expos to variou element of the societi , he ha a chanc to studi their behaviour and characterist and sinc young peopl are keen observ , he would be abl to imbib a lot of practic knowledg . sadli though the new gener ha not been abl to think beyond selfish caus and they seem to have forgotten the wise old say that true happi lie in the happi of other .
