plan futur ahead colleg time is probabl one of the most import time in a student 's life . i believ thi is so not onli becaus we are student and we get our educ at colleg but also it is a place where we actual shape our futur by make our decis now . therefor while we are studi at colleg , we should think ahead and focu on what we expect from ` our ' futur . in the countri i live in , mani student take tha nation univers entranc exam and after they reciev their score coupl of month after they took the exam . then come the decis process , in which you are suppos to determin your colleg and depart . as we might all guess , a student may not perfectli choos the depar he want to be educ in sinc he is quit young and inexperienc . the trend is that if you have higher score , you are just place to a colleg and a depart you have select . let 's imagin a case in which the student is not satisfi with the depart and field he ha been place . sinc it is not alway possibl for student to be transfer to other depart , he will probabl have to keep on with the field that he is suppos to studi . howev , if he keep hi area of studi broad , he can have the chanc to studi about differ topic he ha been interest in and mayb he can continu hi studi further away in time . the question of whether have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject ha also someth to do with the year you spent in colleg . for instanc , if you are an undergradu student , it might also be a good idea to studi wide rang of topic come from differ disciplin . thi would help you get a better understand of yourself so that in turn , you can further defin what you realli want to do in futur , whether to studi in a differet field , whether to join the work life or to go on further studi the subject in the prospect cycl of your educ life . have a broad knowledg about mani academ subject may also come in handi when you are hire for a job that requir you to collat your vast amount of knowledg come from differ area . base on my experi , i can say that most multin compani do have thi tendenc of hire peopl who have broad knowledg about mani academ subject . these compani believ that they can use the manpow * in term of intellect * in variou area depend on the time and their need . henc as time goe by , these peopl in turn can have greater experi on variou work-rel subject than their colleagu who have less broad knowledg about these academ topic and becom more qualifi and desir employe . nevertheless , studi wider rang of topic and have a broader knowledg of mani academ subject might not be a good idea if you are a graduat student . thi is becaus the aim of graduat educ is that you need to special on one topic of your interest that you can studi it throughli , collect specif data and carri out your research base on these gradual step . in the end , you * as the real knowledg person about thi topic * are suppos to come up with a conclus that would make a differ in the academ world . when we say differ , it is not alway meant to be that you are suppos to prove someth new , but you can also contribut with your find - on thi veri specif subject for sure . all in all , we should be care about what we expect from our futur to determin whether to studi wide rang of academ subject and have a broad knowledg as a result . have all these in my mind , i believ that the ideal solut to thi complex will be make use of an appropri combin of these approach while we have time and then plan our futur studi accordingli .
