learn fact are import as well as learn and understand idea and concept . but i strongli agre with thi statement on how import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . that is becaus if student learn the idea and understand the concept that mean they can use those idea as some kind of exampl to solv an answer . for exampl , student can learn about fact , but when it is time for them to use what they have learn like test or in some kind of social event , even if they know about the fact they wo n't be abl to solv those problem . in math test student need to know how the procedur work in order to solv for the answer . but what if student know onli the fact ? `` divis wa discov by . .. etc . '' these kind of fact wo n't help student to score well on their test . if student learn onli fact , they wo n't be abl to make their own hypotenus or to learn how to studi new enviorn by themslev . most colleg professor learn the basic , in thi case the idea and concept of how the thing work out and whi they got that solut . if they did n't learn the idea and concept of what they learn and onli learn the fact , they would n't have ani idea what their do dure their new experi or research . learn new fact are wast of time . peopl can learn fact while they learn and studi idea and concept . reason whi that is possibl is that becaus through learn idea and concept peopl can end up learn few or more of new fact from their experi . so if student understand idea and concept that mean they are learn fact alon and without teacher yell at them . when teacher teach student the idea and concept more than fact , student will probabl do better in academ and social . that is whi i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
