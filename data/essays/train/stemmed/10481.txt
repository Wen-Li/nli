in our live most peopl are use a car that i could say it is hard to live without a car which use a lot of gu . car are vital in nowaday that i strongli agre thi idea that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i would like to say someth befor i talk about thi question that i am not sure about what is fewer car are but i could guess that is a car which is good for the earth that reduc pollut . one of nowaday sociati problem pollut that we can not ignor which is harm the earth morov , enagi for car , gu ha limit . one of my teacher told me that gu will gone by 60 year later if we use gu as much as now per year . we must need to get over thi problem for our live therefor gu is not use onli a car , we need ga for to make other thing like comput or other stuff . one day i saw a tv show that some resarch are tri to find enagi which are abl to altern of gu , they found out the sugger plan are abl to becom an enagi as ga . moreov that doe not produc pollut at all becaus of plant . they are test that enagi right now and i think it will becaom popular to use . in fact one of countri which ha a lot of suger plan have some benefit to use that enagi for citist rather than gu . they offer some money to get a car which could use sugger plan enagi . onli problem is that cost much to make enagi from suger plan that i think that probrem will solv in twenti year . it should solv becaus we have great chemic skill rather than past . other reason for suppert my opinion , each countri are help each other mostli in today . thi grobal probrem should solv all over the world countri togeth and get over . there are a lot of countri over there they might have so mani differ idea . that solv thi problem easil . thu i have exactri same opinion that fewer car in use than there are today that i hope pollut will dicreac .
