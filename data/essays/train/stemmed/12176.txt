some peopl becom awar of the limit life span of human be at their earli age and tri to enjoy it in the best way . howev , there are some who are abl to recogn it when they come to the end . though , there is not a direct correl between the awar of the limit life span and the age , old peopl gener tend to enjoy life more than younger peopl . first of all , young peopl tend to assess the problem bigger as they are actual . sinc it is hard for a typic young to forese the outcom of the event , they are magnifi everi difficulti they come across . for exampl , mani student in my countri , turkey , think that the univers entranc exam is the nost import point in their live . therefor , if they are not abl to achiv it , most of them are damag mental . howev , sinc older peopl ha a lot of experi , they face problem in a calmer manner . secondli , in gener , an older man ha higher chanc of have enough money and time than a typic young person to do what they dream . vast major of us have littl money to spend on our person live , while we are studi , sinc we depend on our famili econom . also , due to our school and summer school , our time is also limit to do what we want to , while oled hav all in all , i am quit disagre with the idea of young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . though i think that younger have more energi and more desir than the older , they could not enjoy life due to pressur put on them by their famili and the limit financ and time .
