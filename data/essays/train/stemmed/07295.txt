i agre with the statement , i think success peopl tri a lot more thing , becaus of mani reason . the most import one is that they have noth to worri about , becaus if you are success , you are good in what you do , so you probabl gain a lot of money for thi . that mean you do not have to worri about how you can feed your famili for exampl . poor peopl mostli have to worri about that , which mean they have not much freedom in what they can do . so , if you are success and rich you have the opportun to do the thing you want and do not have to worri about financi problem , so you can risk a lot more thing . besid , success peopl often need stress and drill , becaus they probabl work a lot of time and put themself under pressur to motiv themself , so they alway must do someth to get the drill , which also forc them to take risk and look for challeng . i also think that those peopl are bore after a certain time if they are good in what they do , becaus they alway work in thi field . so they need not onli a challeng , but also a chang in their life . thi is , of cours , someth , that fit for everyon . everybodi want to have a chang when he doe the same thing the whole day , even if he is good in thi . but , as i alreadi mention , e.g. poor peopl do not have the possibl to decid whether they want to do thi job or take ani risk with stock exchang or whatev . to sum up , i would say , success peopl are not the onlyon , which rather tri new thing than do what they alway do , but in contrast to the other they have the possibl to do so .
