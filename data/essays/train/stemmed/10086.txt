my grandmoth surviv world war ii . she saw the soldier fight on her parent proberti and she saw rel get kill just for fun by these soldier . i think the biggest question is , how to defin an `` enjoy life '' . what is an enjoy life ? is it to be thank for surviv a war and still be abl to breath even though with all these imag in mind ? or is it go out for parti everi weekend , drink alcohol and take drug ? is n't it more worth to enjoy an opera by mozart or beethoven than listen to hous or rap ? i total disaggre with the statement becaus i do not think that most of the young peopl realli know , what life is . they never had to fight for it , they get the benefit of free educ , at least in the western world , and they have never seen the realiti . ye , i agre , that younger peopl enjoy there life more by play comput game , meet with frend , go out for parti et cetera then older peopl do . but that is just a life they are abl to enjoy becaus of the hard work of they parent and grandpar . younger peopl do not have to work on the field of their parent ani more becaus they grow up in a citi . they do not have to serv in the militari like their father and they do not have to see all the dirt that is present in thi world if they do not watch cnn instead of mtv . younger peopl do not appreaci their free time like older do . that is whi i think older poepl enjoy their life more . their experi and their histori make them enjoy it becaus they know , that the life they can live now is much better much saver then it wa a coupl of decad ago .
