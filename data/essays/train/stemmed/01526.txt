have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and special in one specif subject are , in my point of view , both veri import . but there is a time for the two and i think that it 's better to first concentr on learn mani differ thing when we can do it . i mean dure our studi . first , when we know about mani academ subject , we can talk with lot of differ kind of peopl . for instanc , in my school , which is an engin school , there are differ depart such as biolog , civil engin , informat . .. befor thi school i made two year of `` prepar class '' , in which i learn about differ academ subject . what is interest is that i can now talk with my friend who are in differ depart without shame becaus i can understand a minimum of what they say and discuss it . second , have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can help us to know what we want to do after and then chose the best special for us . dure my two year of `` prepar class '' , i learn about physic , math , mecan , biolog , chemic . .. it help me to chose my depart and not to make a mistak and have to chang my educ later . more of that , all that i learn dure thi two year help me in my educ of biolog engin and in my everyday life . i 'm proud when i can answer to basic question about physic that , for exampl , my parent ask to me and i enjoy read easili scientif magazin about differ kind of subject . to conclud , i will say that the special must be acquir onli when it is necessari . we can special after , in our job , but it 's more difficult then to learn about mani academ subject becaus we do n't have the time and we have more difficulti to learn than when we are a student .
