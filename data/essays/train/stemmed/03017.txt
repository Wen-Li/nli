i agre with the abov statement , as student these day are more focus on idea and concept rather than on fact . i go with it becaus to learn anyth you need to understand the idea and concept it is becaus fact are known by everyon but it upto student to understand concept . i want to give an clear exampl to support it as we are in the develop side it import to know about comput . becaus they are as import and necessari tool in today world peopl know about it evid but you need to understand the idea and concept behind it . everyon know about it fact it onli not requir to oper it we need to know the idea behind it . so , it more import to the student to know what lie beneath . i also suggest student to know fact but rarther these wont fulfil the requir . student must know about idea and concept becaus is help him to gather more knowledg and can easili oper them in an proper way . simpli understand idea wont help them as becaus they need to implement them in practic to get the perfect use of it . as in mani case student are not eager to know the idea and conept they tend to face huge complex in life , like in ani product we need to understand it idea by mainli implement them . we can make peopl know about idea and concept they need separ class to know them . likewis i give anoth exampl peopl tend to believ on fact which are given or describ in ancient time the stori from past did n't had proper idea behind them they simpli know the fact and doe n't show interest on idea behind them . like the stori , myth , the stori of legend they do n't requir ani idea it 's just a fact we need to accept . in the later part of the conclus i want to give my opinion that student pay more attent on idea and concept than it is them to learn about fact .
