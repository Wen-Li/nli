mani peopl say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i defin agre with that . that the statement is true , could easili be shown by ani cientif research compar what young peopl in gener do now and what they use to do in earlier gener . in my opinion differ reason let to thi . one reason is , that , compar to the past , peopl live in a more individualist way . most peopl grow up in a small famili , often not even with both but onli one parent , and famili tie becom less and less strong . while in the old day there where alway uncl and grandpar etc. to play an import role in the upbring of a child , nowaday often there is no relationship at all becaus be a famili member is not enough of a reason to keep in contact . thi ha an import impact on a child develop . if you shouldnt even care about your famili , whi should you care about your commun ! thi chang of the way how peopl grow up came along with a shift of valu . for our parent gener for exampl it wa normal and look upon as veri positiv for children to help their mother with the cook , to look after their younger brother and sister , to visit and spend time with their grandpar . nowaday , these action are just not rate veri highli . if a child exe at sport , is veri smart , veri beauti or anyth els relat to it as a singl human be , in societi thi count much more then just be nice and help . it is all about be success yourself and not about how you interact with other . so it is no wonder that young peopl tend to put their own interest first befor they consid anyon els interest ! it is onli logic that children or young adult choos to do thing that other will find attract and import .
