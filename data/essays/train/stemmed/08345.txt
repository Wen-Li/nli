i do not fullli agre with thi statement . undoubt there are a lot of exampl in histori provid the statement . one person i think of is albert einstein . he perfom physic in a time , when the gener opinion wa , that in physic more or less all ha been discov . but he wa in doubt about some fact , which did not seem to be correct for him . by publish hi theori of rel he risk to loos hi reput in the scientif commun , as most of the other scientist declar him to be lunat . and what ha becom of is today ? hi theori explain a lot of phenomena like the gravit forc and hi name is present to nearli everybodi in the world . for anoth exampl you may think of the american express ` from a dishwash to a millionair ' , which state the possibl to becom success in life by tri new way and hard work . exactli at thi point i see a weak of the statement : hard work . it doe not appear in it at all . in my opinion you can be succes in life without take unnecessari risk . you might be one of the lead scientist in your special field of interest . let say you are a specialist in comput databas . whi should you take risk and , for exampl , start a busi sell databas , risk bankrupti ? it is possibl a sensibl decis to offer your abilti to other which will pay you . perhap you will not get a second bill gate but you also might becom succesful . anoth point of critiz of mine is the fact that everybodi find success in differ part of life . have a love famili can make feel success . but i think you should not risk anyth at all if your famili is involv , becaus your children might suffer from it .
