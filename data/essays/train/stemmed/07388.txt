it is commonli said that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do howev there is so mani mani point we have to consid befor agre or disagrr with such opinoin first , and most importantli in my opinion it depend on persom 's charact rather than hi age . some peopl prefer sedintari life style , like work , go home , watc tv . etc . these peopl never get to have social life or they tend to keep it as minimum as possibl . here i am give an exampl of a younger person who would not enjoy much of life when he wa young so when they grow older and retir , they do not realli have much hobbi or interest in their life so they would definit say that young peopl enjoy life more probabl becuas mainli when they leav home , it is relat to work . not that they should not be work but they should find other thing in life to enjoy and tri to find somet they like and learn how to better at , or share it with freind , etc . second , which is also a point to take into consider is the surround envior where the person live . some peopl live in big citi where there is alway someth to do , while other live in smaller commuun where there is not much go on in their small town . nevertheless it depend on where did the person grow up , not onli on where they live , as for instanc if someon grow up in a small town , he might alreadi know what to do in hi spare time , like may be go fish if he live in a citi by alk or river , on the other hand if a person grow up in a larg citi and it happen that he move to that exact small citi for whatev reason is , he may not know what to do there . third , there is a differ kind of enjoy for everi age , it is just a matter of the person find the appropi way of enjoy hi or her life . a person should be readi to adapot to the fact that he or she is get older and at some stage of hi life he or she might not be abl to the same kind of thing that he is use to do . fourth , technolog and comput have chang our live . in a way posit impact us by be abl to find a lot of thing on the internet and make it easier for all age to find thing they would like . in anoth way it neg a mani peopl 's life as they tend to just sit in front of the comput search internet , play game and more or less they end up with sedintari , lkind of lazi and unhealthi life style so , to sum up , anyon of ani age in my opinion can enjoy life and i would not agre with the say that youmg peopl are abl to enjoy life more than older do as i mention it depend on the person 's charact and will to enjoy life and thi can make him adapot to ani of the chang i mention in my exampl , like move to a differ or a smaller citi , get older or ani other factor . it all come back that peson and how he or she is will to be part of hi commun , and to enjoy hi life .
