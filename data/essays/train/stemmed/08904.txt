i disagre with thi statement beacus i can not imagin a world without car . how will the peopl move to everywher ? . everi year the technolog is get better and the car are maken much better . now there are highbrid car and there are car that do n't use petrol but the light of the sun . thi mean that the car are becom good for the envior . they do n't make so much diox of carbon like befor . thi is a big success . mani peopl are use a lot of behicul like a car to go to mani place . we can go from door to door easili in short time than walk . actual , the averag of use car is grow up everi day . so i think it will be veri difficult for the peopl to leav their car and start to walk or run for go somewher . i think that in twenti year there will be more car than now . in twenti year , the technic of make car and the technolog will be better , so there will be better car than now . mayb in twenti year the car could be fli on the air . or mayb all the car will onli use the brigth of the sun and do n't use ani petrol more . i can not imagin a world without car . how will the peopl move to everywher ?
