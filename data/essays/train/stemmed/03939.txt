everi gener is critic by the one immedi befor . it 's natur and i 'm not surpris about that , but the fact is that i simpli do n't agre with statement so gener that involv such a huge categori of peopl as `` young peopl nowaday '' , becaus it 's imposs to me to group in onli one categori a so larg number of individu as `` young peopl '' are . anyway , besid the fact that thi sentenc sound somehow more as a common-plac than as a deepli analyz statement , i do n't agre with it in detail too . i 'm go to explain myself . there are variou way to help one 's own commun , and i know some peopl involv in those activ and i am too , someway . when i wa at liceo , a lot of classmat of mine use to be a part of a cathol associ whose purpos wa to help elderli peopl . everi sunday they use to visit some old peopl and play chart or other game with them , give them joy and happin . i think that thi would be a clear exampl of the fact that young peopl usual help their commun , even if most peopl doe n't alway recogn it . moreov , as i 've alway like deal with children , i spend some of my spare time help kid who have problem in school-subject , and that is the way i usual help my commun , i.e. in the way the most fit me . i could number and write about plenti of other young peopl help their own commun , but i think it would be useless : the most import thing is that i strongli believ that sentenc like that are just nonsens , as you can find some young peopl that never help peopl around them but also some other deepli involv in provid variou kind of help to their commun . nonetheless i strongli believ that it would be better if more peopl help their commun , but i do n't think that thi is due to the fact that young peopl are wors than adult , but to the fact that there is alway a need for help , and there will alway be . my opinion , inde , is that young peopl nowaday are not so wors than young peopl of previou gener : the just behav in their own way .
