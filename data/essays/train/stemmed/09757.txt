i agre with the statement that young peopl do not spend enough time help their commun . i believ from person observ and experi that social servic ha much lesser import amongst the youth of today than what it should ideal be have . young peopl do not seem to think that commun servic should be an integr part of their live . thi is unfortun , becaus social servic ha profound impact both on the individu and commun level . social servic build person charact , promot commun spirit and develop respond in a person . henc it is essenti for the overal growth and develop of the person . commun servic is essenti for a function societi - it promot the gener well-b of the societi , encourag respons divis and deleg and greatli enhanc the integr of the commun . one onli need to look around to find exampl of youngster neglect their societi duti and respons . they are more busi admir and ape transient entertain and fashion icon . these ` icon ' of today do noth to instil social respons amongst their fan . a life of hedon is consid ` cool ' and seem to be the trend to follow for the youngster . they do not have enough concern about the welfar of the underprivileg , or the elderli . they are unawar of press issu that their societi face . even in my own commun - which place immens valu on give respect to elder - i have seen young peopl ignor the plight of their own parent and grandpar . it is essenti that the reason for the greatli reduc sens of social respons amongst the youth be identifi and remedi measur taken . it should be instil amongst them that as a part of societi peopl have duti and respons which simpli can not be shirk . parent and teacher must take care to instil the valu of social servic in children from and earli age , and must themselv prove to be good role model . school must regularli provid social servic and commun ethic cours , and atleast a few of them could be made mandatori . in conclus , i would like to reitier the point that the lack of social commit and respons amongst the youth is a trend that is detriment to both the individu and societi . it is imper that proper measur be taken to revers thi trend and to make our youth more social respons again .
