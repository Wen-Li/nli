to predict what will happen in twenti year from now is a hard thing to do . howev , i must say that i disagre with the statement that state that in twenti year there will be fewer car then there are today . i disagre for mani reason i find reason . everyday our world chang in a way or anoth . we experi chang in the world and those chang can affect us in variou way . becaus the world ha chang radic over the past hundr year more job are provid and more peopl are get realli involv with thi develop . as a result , speed becam a veri import matter in an individu 's life . sinc , more work is need to be accomplish by an individu now than it probabl wa befor and in a shorter amount of time , an individu might find himself or herself in need for shortcut and method than make hi or her life easier . when we go to our job or school or anywher els we usual tri to save time and reach there as quickli as possibl . the most popular method of do that is drive a vehicl or be driven in a vehicl . more and more peopl are find themselv in great need of a car . in some famili , more than just one car is neccessari . so , if you go into a hous of a famili consist of six member for exampl , you will most probabl find two car or even more . in some famili both the parent could have job and therefor , each one of them need hi or her own car . anoth reason is that peopl have more chanc of buy a car or even more today , which is becaus so mani car compani make it easi for custom . those compani allow custom to pay onli a part of the price of a car throughout a specifi period of time . with peopl get busier by the day and chanc of buy a car increas , and speed becom such a vital thing , i believ that in the next twenti year car will not onli not decreas , but they will increas and the number of car will sore .
