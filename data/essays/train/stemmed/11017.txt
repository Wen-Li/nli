in my opinion , the best way to travel is in a group and with a tour guid , becaus when you travel wtih more peopl is more fun and special if is lead by a tourist guid , he will know the best place to visit . if you go to visit anoth countri is import to by led by a tourist guid , becaus usual you will not know anyth about thi place , or countri . he will know the most popular place and they way to get to them . if you go to anoth countri , they peopl from thi countri mayb speak anoth lenguaj , in thi case is go to be difficult to find the place were yo will like to go special if you get lost . there is when the tourist guid will be help , he will know the lenguaj of the countri make thing easier for the group . anoth reason is that tourist guid know a larg amount of histori , in thi way when you are vist museum for exampl the tourist guid will tell you all the import detail of the hystori of the place you are visit , make the trip more interest . in addit to that the idea of learnig the histori of a countri , is more fun with a group of peopl . in conclus a group travel led by a tour guid it will make ani trip more enjoy , becaus the tourist guid will make the trip with less worri , and the group of peopl that you travel with , will make ani trip a trip to rememb .
