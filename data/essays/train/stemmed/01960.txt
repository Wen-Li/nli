do success peopl tri new thing or do what they alreadi know how to do well ? i think success peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk becaus a person can realiz their abil , meet luck or find the suitabl choic after tri a few differ thing in life . first of all a person need to tri thing in order to realiz their abil . for exampl , i learn how to play the piano when i wa in third grade . i wa play it well but of cours , i wa n't a virtuoso . take a risk that i might be unsuccess , i decid to start paint last year , and i saw that i wa more talent in paint . actual , now i am quit success that think i will studi design in the futur , but if i did n't take the risk , i would 've lose my chanc to realiz my talent . therefor , i believ that a person should take risk in order to explor himself/herself . on the other hand , a person can meet their luck tri to find the best for themselv . for exampl when you decid to do someth new like start a new job your chanc of be success is equal to your chanc of fail . as a conclus , it is alway worth tri . for anoth instanc , you have the chanc of win the lotteri when you play it , but if you do n't , you ca n't win anth . i think you should take the risk of lose . last but not least , you can onli find the suitabl choic for you after a coupl of trial . for exampl my aunt wa a tailor , but she want to open a restaur . in spite of the discourag thought of our rel , she open the restaur , and now she earn better than she did when she wa a tailor . so , she wa success with her new choic . the same idea can exist whan a parson need to choos a school . you can alway tri one consid the chanc of be sucess and if you do n't like it , you should have the courag to take the risk of quit it . becaus you might be more success in anoth . peopl should tri new thing in their live in order to find the most suitabl for themselv . success peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk . peopl should alway take risk to be success .
