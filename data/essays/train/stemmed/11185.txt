in my opionion , success peopl are the one who tri to creat or do someth new . the more one develop him or herself , the more success he or she gain . it can be obvious observ from the civil ' develop . as the civil improv themselv they reach higher power . that is the same with the success of peopl . improv and tri new thing ha some risk as well . the risk of to be unsuccess is one of the greatest one . in my opinion , peopl are abstain to take new action due to the fear of take the risk of fail . howev it is over estim idea . you can not do anyth if you do not tri to do someth new . perhap some might say that it will be better off by tri to do your own job in best manner and way . but the question of ` what to do after special on the thing you do ' still remain . i agre that it is more like to special on some issu . howev after special , develop that issu , gain new approach and take risk to do someth new bring success . for instanc do you think that microsoft could be such success if it had not improv it techonolgi or renew it softwar ? i think it would be imposs at all . eventu it would be a risk for microsoft not to work for further develop . we are live in a process that alway recquir improv . that is whi we should alway tri to improv ourselv in our job , or the smallest thing that we do in our normal life . creativ is the thing that bring success . if you stay behind thi process and stay as you are , do what you alway do , you can never be success . you can onli be whatev you are and alway be the same .
