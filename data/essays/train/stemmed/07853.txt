in my opinion it is definit prefer to have a broad knowledg of sever academ subject to special in one singl area . the most import aspect to me is the variaton in topic which one specif subject can not suppli . if - regard the academ - i had onli one topic with which i would have to spend my entir work time i would eventu get fed up with the subject , as variat is the key to keep me interest . special limit your point of view wherea a broad knowledg of differ subject enabl you to understand differ peopl with differ academ background . furthermor special in onli one topic make it less probabl to meet new peopl with differ background at all as you will not leav your main field of interest veri frequent . broaden your skill also might have some posit effect on your social environ . you might find more friend and have more success with the other sex as you will appear more interest not be a ` freak ' who is onli interest in one singl thing but be abl to look like a person with differ facett and divers interest . in discuss with collegu , friend or other person at you will certainli have a less harder time be educ in more than one topic as you might easili find argument and exampl in your variou subject . to summar all the mention point make it by far more attract for me to gain knowledg in not onli one subject but mani differ , although one should tri no to have too mani interest , as superfici knowledg in mani field of mind also will not bring you veri far .
