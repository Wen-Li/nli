i wether do or do not agre with thi statement . from my perspect and i can onli argu in the case of germani , the truth lie somewher in between . becaus , on the one hand you can support thi opinion by stress effect of global through which young peopl do not have time to engag for ani kind of help for their commun . one can say , that the pressur of worldwid competit increas the freetim for everi young individu . but on the other hand , one can respond that the person demand after social relationship and altruism includ still exist in a similar way like centuri ago . if we are look into hospit or other institut , which are aim at help other peopl , we can still find a lot of peopl with veri differ social background who are engag in social work , e.g. for old peopl . here one can oppos , that the number of peopl who are engag in those insitut increas veri much . for exampl the engag in polit parti . the german social-democrat loos around 600000 member until the 1970i . but are those number good indic for the engag of young peopl nowaday ? one can say , that especi younger peopl do mor often use new technolog to engag them for their commun , e.g. they are organ event in their hometown or someth els like that . so young peopl do not need to be `` physic '' engag in their commun . often they are member of other internet base commun or just handl thing through thi new medium . but one can at thi point argu , that thi is an evid develop nowaday . unreal commun were found through new media and the modern kind of commun is not import anymor . i think thi discuss is endless and depend on age and experi . from my perspect younger peopl are think in other more postmodern way . thi is way an answer to thi question is realli hard to give .
