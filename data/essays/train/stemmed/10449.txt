some peopl hold the opinion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today while other believ it in an opposit way . as far as i 'm concern that i am stand for it .. as a matter of fact , with the rapid develop of the countri from all over the world , car inde play an extrem import role in develop a countri 's economi . howev , a better understand of the pollut caus by the car will be enabl us to live a better life . therefor more and more peopl have come to recogn the wisdom of not drive the car . instead of that , take public transport are valu far more than drive their own car when they are out by some peopl , becaus it not onli ha brought a larg number of profit and conveni to the peopl 's life but also lead to less pollut , as a result peopl 's life becom easier and healthier . so the attempt by the govern to limit the number of car ha been veri success , after all more and more peopl will give consider to the public transport when go ousid . in addit to that , the import of the bike can never be overestimated. , for it is portabl and small , that is to say you can take it to anywher if you want. , therefor more and more peopl are more will to ride bike but to drive car while they are out . apart from that , the bike wo n't caus so much traffic jam , which will make peopl wast a larg amount of time when they are on their way to work . abov all , the bike are regard as the environ - friendli tool , which enabl peopl to live in a clean and comfort condit . so to some extent , how wildli the bike are uesd is a strong determin of how the environ can be protect . and an analysi of the meaning event in histori confirm the fact that , in order to save the plannet we live on , we will make good use of the bike instead of the car . therefor , in the futur there will fewer and fewer car in use it can ce conclud from the abov than i agre with thi statement .
