i think that is good to have a broad knowledg in mani academ subject but it is better to specializain one specif subject . my first reason is that when you are studi for your futur , and for the work you would like to have in the futur it is better to studi someth that you prefer the most . if you want to be an account it is no veri necesari for to studi lot of subject that wo n't be use in your futur , for exampl , histori . histori is not a subject that an account would need in a futur an account should studi mathemat , or economi . howev , it is good to you increas your knowledg in differ subject but if you are tri to be an account i think that it is better to studi the specif subject htat an account need for the profess . my second reason is that if you start to studi lot of subject of everi kind then when you want to get a job it is veri difficult to get one becuas you do n't know in what area you are better or in what area you want to work and thi would be veri bad becaus then you will have to studi for an especif subject and you will lose more time to get a job and probabl you will start to forget what you have learn befor . the last reason i have is that is probabl veri hard for someon to studi lot of thing when they are not veri relat . although i prefer to have a good knowledg in onli one specif subject , i think that all the knowledg and thing that peopl could studi and know are veri good to the life , becaus you do n't know in what moment you have to appli your knowledg , and when that moment arriv you will be abl to use all your knowledg and the benefit can be great .
