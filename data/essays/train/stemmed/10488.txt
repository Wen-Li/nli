dure thier studi , student face differ approach to work on differ materi . these approach focu either on the learn either on the understand . they depend on their teacher and on the materi itself . so is it more import for the student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact ? first of all , from my point of view , learn fact seem to be a good way to studi . accord to scientist the memori work like a muscl . therefor it ha to exercis to becom more and more effici . in addit i agre on the fact that learn fact is an effici method to get a big amount of knowledg dure the studi . howev , as far as i 'm concern , learn fact is necessari but not sufficic . on the one hand , thi approach should be undertaken in order to get a background on differ materail . on the other hand it doe n't effici prepar student to their futur life . so thi method ha to be complet by the other approach . for me by understand idea and concept , student know how to adapt to differ situat they could face later . for exampl , in their profession life they wo n't onli be ask to use the fact they have learnt dure their studi . for me by understand idea and concept they learn a particular way of think that could be appli in differ case . thu thi last approach is more import for me . inde their avail to analys and adapt to a special situat come from their faculti to understnad . to conclud , i approv that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . howev these two approach seem to be complementari . in a certain extent .
