i do agre veri much that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i would say that the compani that want to sell a certain articl , have to present it as someth you must have . some time they tell you that will make you nicier , some time they tell you that it will make you smarter , but they allway tri to convinc the custom that if you have `` that '' product you will be better . compani invest a huge amount of money in the advertisemet field . they know those maney are well spent . thi is increasingli happen sinc the world of the telecomun ha been global . an exampl often mention is the coca cola . in everi corner of the world you go you will be abl to see the advertis of coca cola . and it work ! there are mani place in less develop countri where is easier to find a bottl of coca cola rather than wather , and some time it is also true that is safer to drink coca cola insthead of water . actual i believ that the compani , sometim doe not present them product better than they are , but they make the advertis in a way you think that `` simpl '' thing is now nice and useful . of cours behind thi process there are plenti of professionist that just work on it all the time . to make you feel , you can not leav without that `` mobil '' phone . i am old enough to know that the life is possibl ( and may be better ) without that mobil , even if it seem to me , when i think about it , that it ha allway exist . pruduct can be as good as they are advertis , the trick is , how to make peaopl think that thay ca n't leav without it , and i am sure they will find a way to sell you anith they want . there is also a copmetit between them , i mean between the seller , so that they have to show hi product compar to a `` common '' one , and tell you the reason whi hi product is much better compar to anoth , wich is usual less costli . but thi is anoth issu .
