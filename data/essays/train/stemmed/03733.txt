i total agre with the statment that succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . in my opinion , as time goe by , the world is improv , and so do ourselv . we need to improv ourselv everyday to be success . i believ that tri new thing and take tisk is the best way to improv ourselv . as the environ is move on , we meet new thing . sinc we are not familiar with it , we should spent time to find out what it 's all about . in that case , risk is unavoid becaus we do n't know what 's go to happen . in the progress , we can find out and learn a lot of preciou knowledg that we never knew . in that case , we 're improv . in the progress , we may face a great difficulti , which is veri hard to solv . when we manag to solv the problem , we gain experi . in thi way , we make the new thing into the thing that we alreadi know . so we can learn more thing if we tri new thing . for the more , i believ that tri new thing can make us more intelleg . we face differ thing so that we think about differ thing . our brain can reciev a better practic . as a result we can be more intelleg . on the contrari , if we do n't tri new thing and take risk , the onli thing we could do is to repeat do the same thing that we alreadi know . that would have a bad effect on ourselv . when more and more new thing arriv , we still know noth about them . so we would no longer be competit . in other word , we would not be success . as tri new thing can improv ourselv , make us learn more about the world , let us be more intelleg , i believ that tri new thing and take risk is more like to make success peopl .
