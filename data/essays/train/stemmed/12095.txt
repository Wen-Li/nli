i disagre with the idea . i want to travel alon . i have 2 reason for thi idea . i do not have a lot of time to travel . also , i want to visit as much as the sight-se place i could go in limit time shedul . the first of all , i work for a compani as a full time worker . i have the annual summer holiday . howev , it is difficult to spare time for a trip . in thi situat , i would prepar the travel befor to go travel . that 's whi i do not need a tour guid in sight-se . i woud read , ask and resurch about thi place where i am go to visit . i spend thi tour guid fee for extra servic at hotel or anoth servic . in addit , my time to stay there is realli limit . i do want to visit place which i realli want to go . i can not control my shedul when i travel in a group . i will miss some of them if i go with the group tour . also i can focu on visit when i am alon better than in a group . second , it is not free to move personali . the tour guid is the control in the grouop . also i can not chang my sheul when we go in the group . i want to go where i want to go . that 's whi i would like to go travel alon . therefor , i prefer to travel alon better than a group with a proffesion guid . my time is limit so it is import .
