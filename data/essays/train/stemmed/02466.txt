most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and i think thi is cheet on pepoel , it like cover a book from it titel . i disagre with make product look much better then what they realli are , firstli is that it cheet on pepoel from buy the product on what they think it is by look at it for exampl i want to buy a tabl it cheap and in good shap but after i use it , it doesnt continu one day and it broken . althought it might be danger for pepeol use it , exampl buy a chair wich look graet and strong and an old man sit on it and sudden the man fall down he will get heart , so sometim it could caus some dameg becaus of what it look then what it realli is . anoth thing is that these product wont be usful for noth just will be bought and thrown away the next day becaus it of no use so whi wast these thing and tri to make product more usful then on how it look . in my opinion i think the advertis should make the product more usful than what it look instead of make it much better than what it realli is becaus at the end the product is made to be use not to look at onli .
