today man 's depend on automobil is veri much and will increas in the futur . i disagre with the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' man is veri much depend on car which form hi basic mean of locomot without which he can not dream of go out . he use hi car for mani reson such as to go for work , to go out etc . futhermor the public transport is limit on which he ca n't reli upon for evereyth . in order to access public transport he should go to bu station or to railway station for which he should have some sort of transport to take him from home to those place . the main thing which caus us to believ that car will becom lesser in twenti year is the pollut . automobil caus a lot of pollut but recent adavanc in technolog have provid new technolog that decreas pollut to a larg extent . new technolog have come which help to reduc the pollut creat by the automobil and to make them more fuel effici which is also a mojor concern for the car user . new technolog such as use of natur ga instead of petrol and diesel have come which decreas the pollut by a larg extent . thi is also cost effect and ha becom popular in the develop countri like india . anoth technolog which is more reliabl is the use of batteri power to run the car and thi caus zero pollut . technolog like use of hydrogen ga as a fuel is also on consider and research is still go on in thi field . new technolog in the field of manufactur are also come which increas the durabl of automobil to a great extent i.e , they last longer . upon consid the follow factor and reason i dont think that there will be a decreas in the number of car in the next twenti year .
