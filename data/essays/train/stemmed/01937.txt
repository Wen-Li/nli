commun , nowaday , need for help more than ani time befor , especiali from their youngmen . i think that young should prepar enough time to build up their societi , otherwis , they will not go ahead . there are no doubt that young should grab their commun hand to move ahead , or they will collaps infront of their eye . when you switch the page of the histori , you will see mani exampl of great nation that plung becaus of the egnor of their young peopl . the greek , for exampl , reach at one time to a high place that no one els reach befor , but it collaps suddenli , whi ??? becaus their young do not give their nation enough time to build and to help . young peopl , recent , are complet differ from the young from the previou time . mayb they are differ on way of think or on way of act against situat . i am not say that they are better than them but i am point that the more respos the young are , the more power their nation will get . onc a wiseman said `` the societi is for the person and the person is for the societi '' ,,, what did that mean ?? it meant that when a person is fulli respos to hi commun and he is readi to give hi soul to her , hi commun will be readi to him and she will rise and rise . the more power the countri are , the more powerful their nation are . final , i think that what young peopl is say about not have enough time to give for their nation is nonsens , becaus the time is alway here but the will and care are not here .
