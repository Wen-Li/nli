everyon want to be success , in our person or profession life . thi is a level show your qualiti , and thi can show as well your wish to progress in your life . as an exampl , if a work person want to progress in hi work life , he ha to show hi motiv by tri new thing such as give innov idea or spend more time on project . thi will prove to hi manag that he is concern by hi work and by the compani itself . he can reach to a better job by thi way , be promot and earn more money . on the other hand , if thi work person stay quiet , doe not tri new thing , thi mean that he doe not want to take risk . and sometim , thi can be a secur for him , he can keep hi job and he will be sure that he will be paid at the end of the month . inde , if thi one ha a famili , he ha to be abl to buy all hi famili need . mayb he will find a routin in hi everyday life , but he will be secur that hi famili will have what they want . in my opinion , i think that we have to progress in our life . and if thi mean that we have to take risk , or to tri new thing , most of peopl should do thi . for exampl , if i have a report to do in group , i will suggest all the time new idea , even if these are not relev , but at least , i would have tri . i know thi can be bore for other team-mat , but by thi way , the report can progress , and thi could be a success if everyon tri thi . success peopl are not rare , they are part of our everyday life and they allow some work to be done in time , and with idea of qualiti .
