i agre with thi opinion becaus i believ a lot of knowledg give peopl a lot of idea . it look complet true that for be specialist of one specif subject , all you have to do is continu to onli studi the subject for good . of cours i think it is import for specialist to do their best for learn their topic . but i believ everyth in the world is relat complexli with other . for instanc , let 's think about energi . it look veri simpli problem on fossil fuel , howev it is not true . nowaday , most of human be can not live without energi . peopl must know that more and more use of fossil fuel make global warm . in addit , they also know fossil fuel such as oil or natur ga are limit . well , now , how mani peopl can stop their convini life thank to energi ? i believ almost all peopl can not dispos their life complet right now . so what we should continu such life ? becaus of it , these day human are manag to deal with global warm and search next new fuel of energi . when someon treat thi problem , how can he cope with it , onli use one specif subject ? engin ? or chemistri ? or biolog ? i never believ that ani peopl could solv thi problem onli by one specif subject . therefor , i believ that everyth is connect with other in some kind of shape , so we have to studi mani academ subject to cope with such difficult problem .
