i person agre with the given statement . in a natur way , everybodi tri to challeng himself . there is alway someth new to learn or to do . life is full of surpris and possibl . most success peopl enjoy their life as bee success , but they also feel the desir to do someth els . thi could be to work on a voluntari base or to do anoth job . it is satisfi to them to know that they alreadi achiev a lot in life becaus of their studi , experi and their educ . still , they want to do more , some to gain a higher posit within the firm they are work at , other just to challeng themselv . the reason might be to earn more money , but also to liev a less stress life . do the same job everi day might get bore with the time pass by . thi way peopl are open to tri someth new . i think that do anoth job apart from the main one one is do , might be stress and riski . do anoth job mean to put a lot of effort , time and also work into it . thi might lead to stress becaus there is not that much time left for hobbi , famili or relationship . it is difficult to be success and parallel to that to live a pleasant and happi life . mani peopl who are success are alway in a hurri and it seem that they do not have the time to appreci littl thing in life . in my opinion , though . they do a lot more than other by do other thing than just do what they alreadi know how to do well . have the chanc to tri out new thing probabl make peopl happi . some like their job a lot but there is also anoth thing which they do not want to miss do in their life . it is also good to show the talent which god gave us . especi succes peopl are motiv . they also have the money to afford do new thing . thi is whi they should take their chanc and feel free to do whatev they want to do . thi might lead to recognit within the town they are live in and also satisfact throughout themselv . peopl who are success often like to do someth that make them forget work . life get a littl belanc and they feel better . i imagin that success tri new thing like sport or voluntari work . they might have their own busi which is connect to risk , becaus there is not the guarante that it will go well and turn out to be popular . other might lead a sport group or teach older peopl foreign languag . to me it would be import to work woth other peopl and to tri to help them out . all in all , success peopl who take a risk in tri out new thing feel more balanc and more satisfi .
