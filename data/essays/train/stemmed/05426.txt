peopl who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject are usual consid as intellig peopl . whi ? most probabl becaus they will be abl to have and give an opinion on ani kind of topic discuss in societi . in my opinion , the fact of aknowledg a varieti of issu in differ field is the key to an effect and construct open-minded . thi open-minded is constitut by the gather of inform from differ academ subject studi and the synthesi one can make with them . as an exampl , i would feel more comfort debat on a presid 's polici if i took a class about the contemporari histori of the countri he is lead to understand how he got elect , a sociolog class to understand who elect him and a polit scienc class to analys the way he commun hi idea and wht conclus i can draw base upon hi behaviour . by contrast , if i onli studi one of these subject , i probabl wo n't be abl to have a wide view over all the issu that a polici involv . howev , be special in a particular academ field will provid me with the abil to elabor an expert answer , that is to say deliv an in depth analys base upon a more specif knowledg . i person think it is essenti to get special in some academ field . varieti is good for gener cultur and open-mided but special is more use in the profession field . becom an expert in one field provid you with more skill and profici in the subject studi . thi reason make special be a better choic when it come to the applic for a job . for exampl , if i want to be a lawyer , i need to have a law degre . by contrast , if i want to be a busi manag , i can get experienc in a compani as an in hous consel and still be qualifi for that job .
