whether the amount of car will be smaller in twenti year time is almsost unpredict . the reason is that such matter highli depend on the polit and socio-cultur mood of the time . the answer also shift accord to the part of the world one is talk about . the number of car might fluctuat in complet differ way depend upon whether one is talk about develop or develop countri . thi essay therefor take differ turn depend on the differ scenario and countri that are be discuss and base on the knowledg of fact avail today . i will now concentr on the develop countri such as the unit kingdom or the unit state . within the next twenti year , or even within the next decad , it will be imposs to deni the strength of the argument that the environment lobbi and person such as al gore have been put forward . i believ it is slowli becom clearer that the enrom amount of greenhous gass found in the atmospher are larg caus by human action and will have potenti disastr effect on the environ . i believ that there will come a time when car will not run on petroleum anymor , but on altern energi . that might not reduc the number of car , but it will reduc the effect that car have on the environ . anoth possibl , is that state will invest more in public transport . if that were the case , the amount of car might reduc by a good amount . the amount of car in develop and thirld world countri such as most countri in africa , will hope and in my opinion be higher in twenti year time . it is my belief that a substanti car industri and a high amount of car per famili are indic of flourish economi . the ratio of car per famili is much higher in develop countri than in develop one . thu if thirld world coutnri manag to get a grip on their economi and safeti , the number of car are like to rais .
