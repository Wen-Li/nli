i agre with the statement that `` success peopl tri new thing and take new risk . . '' . i firmli believ that ` success is a journey , not a destin ' . if one spend hi entir life do what he alreadi know show to do well , he is not explor new avenu and henc , will never know what life ha to offer . a few exampl to support my view are as follow . the first one is a stori of a littl boy who , out of curios and vision turn around hi life . onc , deject and depress about thing not work with hi comput , he put thought into whi that might be and tri out a ` new way ' to make thing work . today , the world know the man by bill gate , one of the richest peopl and creator of microsoft . a lot of great invent come by accid and one need to open one 's mind to tri new thing in order to run into accid . anoth exampl is the popular 3m compani which manufactur post-it . while tri a `` new way '' to make a glue that stick so well that it never come off , a failur to do so , led to the invent of post it note which are popularli use world-wid today . take risk expos a person to failur and make him a stronger individu , a trait that iron is the essenc of success . i conclud with a few line from the famou poem if written by rudyard kipl - `` if you can make a heap of all your win , and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss , and lose , and start at the begin , and never breath a word about your loss '' ... then `` your is the world and everyth that 's in it , and which is more , you will be a man , my son '' .
