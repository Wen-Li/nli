in twenti year the number of car in use will not have diminish by a larg number , i believ that rather the opposit will be true . the number of car will increas dure the next twenti year . due to popul rise and the develop of differ fuel the number of peopl abl and will to afford their own car will increas and so will the number of car in use . in countri like china or india , that have a larg rural popul without the mean to buy a car today , the continu growth of the popul and the fast econom develop will lead to more peopl be abl to afford a car in the near futur . the price of car will go down in comparison to the incom and thi will lead to more car be in use . anoth reason for my belief that there will be more car in use twenti year from now is that new fuel are current under research and will be on the market in less than twenti year . for exampl the hydrogen power car is alreadi in use today , though it is not ditribut at larg . thi develop of altern fuel will restrict the impact of the decreas of the resourc like oil and ga ha on the automobil industri . that way nobodi own a car today will have to get rig of it becaus of fuel shortag . these peopl can just as easili buy a car power by altern fuel , when their current car break down . the altern fuel , that are be develop today , are also cleaner and less poison to the environ . thi mean that mayb peopl not will to use a car today becaus of environment reason will chang their mind and buy a car when the use of a car is no longer a hazard to the environ . these reason support my belief that the number of car in use in twenti year will not be lower , but higher , than the number of car in use today . popul rise , the develop of altern fuel and the rapid econom develop in countri with larg popul will contribut to an increas in the number of peopl abl and will to afford their own car and thu to an increas in the number of car in use .
