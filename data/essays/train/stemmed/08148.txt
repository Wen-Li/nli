i 'm not sure that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today but i realli hope that thi will happen . today the situat is not good for the big presenc of car and scienc and gouverna must do someth to solv thi problem and to limit the damag that thi car 's presenc give to the environ . twenti year ago there were less car : thi is a sign of our econom and technolog improv but thi improv take us a lot of problem that were unthought year ago . the biggest problem is the pollut of air that we breath becaus of the car 's gase . thi problem brought to the water pollut too and provok the birth of a lot of new ill that did n't exist year ago . so i hope that in futur the number of car should decreas to have less pollut and to have a good environ . anoth solut could be found in some improv of scienc to elimin the pollut provok by car . anoth neg aspect of the high number of car is that , expeci in the citi , everi day , there are a lot of car that crowd it and give problem to traffic . so a decreas in number of car should give more quit to citi and should be easier for peopl go from a part to anoth of a citi . a solut in thi case must be found by gouverna that should decreas the car into citi improv the public transport . if the net of public transport is well organis , i think that peopl would be stimol to use it and to leav car at home and so would n't be so import have two or three car per famili . so , in conclus i think that with a small improv of scienc and of gouverna 's control will be fewer car in use than there are now , and i hope that thi will happen so we can live in health and in quiet as the life wa twenti year ago .
