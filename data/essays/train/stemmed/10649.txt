knowledg is one of the necesseti of life . as far as i observ , most of the peopl want to learn knew thing and the peopl who have knowledg about mani thing are to be respect by other . therefor , i agre with the idea that to have broader knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one subject . first of all , the world is chang everi time especi thank to the develop of the technolog . the need and want of the peopl chang as time goe by and the field which is approv by everyon one day , can not be copnsid as a good field the next day . therefor , peopl should alway improv their knowledg and skill to continu their live . secondli , concentr on in one specif subject make nonsens , in such a world where everyth is relat to eachoth . for exampl , as a student studi econom , i do not understand whi a macroeconom professor ha no idea on game theori . at first sight , there seem to be no relat between them , howev , if we think deepli we can see how the find of game theori , ha import effect on decis make process which affect the decis of fiscal and monetari polici , and thu will reflect on macroeconom stabil of a countri . thirdli , if we consid the social interact between the peopl , gener , peopl do not like to talk with person who alway concentr on the same subject . for exampl , a man can be a veri good doctor , howver if he doe not have other interest , he will not have ani social life sinc peopl do not alway want to hear the same subject again and again . as a conclus , to captur the need of human be and technolog and respons in accord with them peopl should concentr on differ subject rather than onli one . thi will also be help on maintain an effect social life .
