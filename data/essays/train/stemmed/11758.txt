i dont agre with thi statement that sai that succes peopl are the one who tri new thing and take risk rather than those that onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i think that both thing in differ way can bring success to a person life . sometim a person is good at do someth , and it realli enjoy do it , so she/h realli put effort and commit to do the best they can , and they get success on do that . furthermor , a person that dose n't feel good of do someth or feel that they can be better on do someth els should take a risk of tri new thing . for exampl , my mom wa good at her job in a bank , but she feel like she need a chang and so she took the risk of tri open her own bussi . her dream wa to open a spa , that in my countri there are few . so she did it , she took the risk and open her spa . now is the best spa in my countri , even peopl from other countri come to mine just to tri the spa . what i want to ilustr with thi exampl is that sometim if you take risk or tri new thing you could be a succes person , but thi is not alway the case . sometim just do what you now how to do well , and do it with effort and will to do be the best , you can also be a success person . someon onc told me `` do what you want , but do it right '' . so thi is what i am tri to explain , take risk or do what you know how to do well , but do it the best you can and you will suc . success is around the corner so tri your best and you will find it !!!
