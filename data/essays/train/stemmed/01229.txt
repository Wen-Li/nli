i total agre with thi statement . and i think a lot of exampl can be found in everyday life . just look at the advertis you can get in the normal supermarket , like food . in the advertis everyth seem veri healthi , even the choclat nut cake with cream . the compani of the product tell you how much vitamin or other healthi thing their product contain . maybe , that there is a huge amount of a special vitamin found in the choclat nut cake , becaus of the nut it cotain . but the advertis doe n't mention how mani fat is in there becaus thi of cours would n't turn out to be a veri healthi figur . in the past year the advertis tri to captur probabl buyer of their product with the sign `` zero fat '' or `` zero sugar '' . but honestli , who ever expect a lollipop for exampl to contain fat ? other non-eat product like deterg or facial cream as well are not the magic liquid and fluid they pretend to be . mani peopl let the advertis lead their trolley in the supermarket . and when they are at home they discov the truth behind all the colorful promis . one thing that show , that even the politician are awar of the danger of the all to promis advertis is the prohibit of tobacco advertis on tv and in newspap . the tobacco industri ha a lot of money , so they can afford the best advertis which promis the consum freedom , cool , clever and a lot of other thing if onli they lit a cigarett . the fact that wealthi compani can spend a lot of money on promis advertis on the other hand mean that that smaller compani that ca n't afford expens advertis ca n't promis too much to the cosum . of cours thi doe n't mean , that product with less promis advertis necessarili are healthier product . but in my opinion it is more like .
