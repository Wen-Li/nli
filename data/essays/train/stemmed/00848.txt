i agre with the statement that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are a lot of advertis of mani organ that are look for young peopl to help the commun and thi organ appli for mani differ kind of job . for exampl when i listen to the radio or when i watch the televis i see mani advertis about compani that tri to increas these kind of job . if there are so mani advertis , it 's will mean that they need other peopl , especi young peopl . secondli in my countri i know some boy and girl who help their commun in their free time , but it 's not so common . i have just known two or three person who have done that in their life . i have mani friend and of cours they studi or they have a job , but they also have a lot of leisur time . in my opinion the problem is that young peopl in thei free time prefer for exampl to go to the gym or to go home just to relax , or to go to a pub to have a drink . it 's a question of choic , it 's not that they do n't have time to dedic to their commun . for exampl if dure the afternoon you go along the street in the center of the citi you will see that is crowd : there are a lot of young peopl that are have a walk , to go shop or just for fun . if the same day you go in a compani who work for the commun it 's not so crowd !! you can do some differ job for your commun and you can help your commun in mani differ way . furthermor it doe n't take you so much time , you can work just an hour a day , or just two time a week . i think that it 's would be better if there wa much more inform about thi , for exampl more advertis in the school or in the univers . but nowday i do n't think that young peopl give enough time to help their commun .
