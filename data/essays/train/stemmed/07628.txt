i assum that peopl who are will to tri new thing and take risk are more like to be success . take a risk also mean that there is a possibili that one is go to fail . therefor peopl who take risk are also more like to fail than those who do not take risk at all . it also make sens to me to hold on to a tradit method if peopl have been success use thi method for gener . if one learn from a person who ha been realli success and ha achiev a lot , it would be nonesens not to use the inform in order to do a good job yourself . tri to be success by do what one alreadi know well is definet safer than put oneself at risk . still work as well as techniqu have approv throughout histori which show that peopl who have been innov gain success for exampl henri ford with hi first appear of mass product in the automobil industri . in thi world of global one ha to tri new thing in order to succeed and it is also help if one is abl to adjust to new condit easili . to my mind the peopl who enjoy their work are mostli success and to enjoy the job should also be the most import goal when choos a job . poepl who onli do what they are told and keep on do so for year are more likey to get bore while work . therefor it is also a person experi to tri new thing and take risk . if one realli want to be success in busi , creativ and the willing to take a risk are two veri import charact trait one should not miss . it is reason to tri out new thing becaus if you are not go to do it somebodi els will and thu will also gain the success . we live in a world that constantli chang and it is alway better to be the one who initi the chang than the one who is forc to adapt to the chang .
