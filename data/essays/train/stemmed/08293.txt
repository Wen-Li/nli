i think it is more import for a student to understand conceot and idea then to learn fact by heard . thi is becaus of some simpel reason . it might be better for a student to learn fact , date and result becaus that the teacher ask for . but in real life , thi mean the life after school , the time you need to work for your money to surviv , it is better to undestand thing . a person not abl to understand what she or he is do is not abl to develop an idea to find mistak and elimin them . a person who is abl to do thi would be much more succes in her/hi job , just becaus of be abl to make the way of work more effect . in school thi kind of understand and find solut on problem should be teach . anoth point of whi a theme should be understood is becaus of fun . fun motiv to go on , to do more . for some person it might be perfect to lern by haert , but most of them get bore . the more effect way is to support the wish of peopl to understand ( who deo not know the most frequent ask question of a child : `` whi ? '' ) . while support thi whish , by it is more easi to motiv someon for some topic even if it is a theme with a lot of fact . i my self support thi fact absolutli . in school i had in 2 year two differnt teacher in physik . the first one wa not reali motiv and ask us to work with the book and in exam we had to summaris what we have read . my second teacher wa round about the same age , but total differnt . 1. he love to teach and hi method were much differ . he did experi and so on . the first teacher gave me 5 point ( max15 ) the second one is still my teacher and made me choos physik as the subject i like to studi , just by motiv me . the result were 15 point in the final exam . these two point show and my small stori show whi i think that it is realli import to make student understand what they learn .
