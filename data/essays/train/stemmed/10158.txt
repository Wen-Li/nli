i do agre to the statement that it is better to know mani thing briefli rather than know onli few thing in detail . there are so mani differ academ subject that hardli no one is abl to have a deep knowleadg of all of them at the same time . know a bit of mani subject is more worth becaus it make you look at thing more wide . also i think it is more worth becaus you becom open mind . you do not onli focu on few thing but consid mani differ aspect you have learn about . anoth argument to underlin my opinion is that you have better convers with peopl by know mani thing briefli . on the one hand it is great to have a deep knowleadg of someth and of caus it is also veri impress . howev on the other hand i think as that kind of person you can onli have a good convers with specialist like you . you are not abl to see thing in a big pictur . to my mind have a brief knowleadg about mani academ subject is more worth it . to give an exampl imagin you are have a convers in a train or anoth public place with a person you have just met . the chanc that thi person ha the same knowleadg and same interest you do so you have someh to talk about is veri low . but if you have lot to talk about becaus you know a lot , doe not matter if it is just a basic knowleadg or not , the convers would be veri good . to sum up it is just more worth and help in life to have a brief knowleadg about academ subject becaus the chanc you find somebodi you can talk to is veri high . also veri import is that you experi a lot and becom open mind which to my mind you can onli becom if you have a wide knowleadg .
