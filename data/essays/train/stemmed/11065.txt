the topic in disguis deal with , a person be generalist or a specialist . a generalist is a perosn who ha broad knowledg of mani academ subject . a specialist is a person who ha deep knowledg in one subject . i think it is better to have broad knowledg in mani subject rather than have specif knowledg in a singl subject . a person with broad knowledg in mani subject , a generalist , can deal with ani kind of subject thought he can not go deep into the subject he ha good amount of knowledg about the subject . so he can deal with ani of the subject . where as a person with deep knowledg about a singl subject can not deal with differ subject as he ha no idea about other subject . it is must to have knowledg of all the subject to get through the exam and attain grade . even in case of get a job , a generalist ha more chanc of get a job rather than a specialist as a generalist can deal ani kind of subject that is given to him . where as a specialist ha to keep mum when ask about ani other subject . the compani would defin requir a multi-tal person rather than a person who ha great talent in a singl subject . `` as everi coin ha two side '' . we can not alway say that have broad knowledg is vital . henc there is a say `` jack of all trade but master in none '' . a multi talent person with no deep knowledg in ani subject can not acheiv success all the time . knowledg in depth is requir when it come to certain area of scienc such as astronomi , medicin etc . in these area a person can not sustain with vaug knowledg . it is crucial for a person to have knowledg in depth . els these proffes would turn out to be disast . henc what i would like to conclud is , a person must have minimum knowldg about all the academ subject and must excel in one atleast to acheiv success .
