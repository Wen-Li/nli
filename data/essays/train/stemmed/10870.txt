i disagre with the opion that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . although to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject may help peopl know differ field acknowledg , we onli can know the surfac knowledg about each subject . so i prefer to have a special knowledg in one specif subject . to begin with , our time is limit . we can not studi everi subject well . we can not acquir the true knowledg and tecnic if we sperat our time into mani subject . for instanc , if a student learn art , psycholog , math and draw in hi colledg life . i think he may know a lot of thing . howev it is difficult to him have a good mark in everi field . on the other hand , if we pay most of our time in one field . we can know a lot in thi field than other . for exampl , a student whose subject is psycholog pay most of hi time in the psycholog . mayb he can know thi field well . he can write paper about thi field and find job in thi field . in summari , i think it is better to have a specail broad knowledg in one subject than to broad knowledg in mani subject . it is good for person and the whole societi .
