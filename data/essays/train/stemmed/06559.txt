differ way think school and univers have differ way in teach their student . we have thousand of school all over the world , and they have differ way in teach . we have a problem which is that their are two way inord for a student to studi . either he understand idea and concept or he just learn fact as it . learn fact is the studi in which a student just learn the fact as it is without know the origin of it . i think that thi isnt a goodway . long ago we have theori done by scientist from differ countri . everi scientist doe hie experi and come out with a hypothesi and consid it a theori . in our present life some peopl just learn these fact without understand it . we have mani problem and wrong issu that peopl come out with and we cant just trust it and move accord to it . we should studi the origin of these theori and tri to prove it wrong . accord to us fact is someth that is found as it is and we should all work with it . on the otherhand , we have the way of understand idea which i think that it is much better than learn fact . a student should not just know thi or that idea , he must understand it well in order to use it . for exampl in my nativ school which is said to be one of the best school in lebanon , follow the first way of teach which is understand idea . understand idea is a way that help the person brain to be more open and refresh hi mind . accord to my opinion , i think that we must understand idea first in a good manner . we should not learn fact as they are but tri to understand from where did thi fact come from and studi it well .
