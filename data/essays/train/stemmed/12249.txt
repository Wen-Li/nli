the question state that , theseday , young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . i agre with thi statment . theseday , i think becaus young peopl do not mind that , if their commun get risk or someth not like old peopl . actual they do not think their right to do for their commun , peopl have right to vote , pay tax , in korea , men have to go to armi . but some young peopl do not give to help their commun . firstli , young peopl do not go for vote for their commun , they go for a trip or abroad instead , or some peopl go to migrat to other countri , so then they do not particip their commun eventhough they have a right to vote . therfor the less peopl is vote for their commun and they get unsatisfact their head of commun . secoundli , youn peopl do not pay their tax to their commun . so then the commun can not oper their work for the commun . young peopl donot mind about the commun . final , in korea , men have to go to armi when they over 20 year old , but some tuong peopl go to migrat to ecap from the govern that tri to catch him becaus he doe not go to armi . or sometim they are tri to get ill , so then they would not go to armi . it is be the most big problem in korea . i agre that the young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . it should be chang , and then all of the communiti can oper better .
