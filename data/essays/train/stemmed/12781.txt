certainli some peopl think that young person seldom particip and help the commun these day . but person i believ that the educ and societi give young peopl the chanc and the time to have a contact with commun to help other peopl . first , the school focus on the import of volunt work in the commun these day , so that student give their more time to do volunt work than befor . for exampl , when i wa in high school , the teacher set up the volunnt commite which give the inform and chanc to do volunt work in the hospit to clean the room . in addit , the school produc the event that student pick up the trash around the school onc a week . the experi of attend the volunt work and help the commun onc a week is enough time for student . that experi give me the chanc to have a contact with my commun . i wa veri busi at studi , but i have a chanc to realiz the import of help commun . accord to the newspap , the school more emphas on teach the import of volunt work these day . thi exampl demonstr that school make enough oppotun for student to help their commun . second , the commun have a chanc to young peopl to help their commun . for instanc , in tokyo , where i live , the number of the troubl of robber and fire accid caus by peopl is increas . therefor , in my town , the commite of the town decid to ask youg peopl to look around the town to protect the accid dure the night . i attend thi activ onc a week . thi exampl also show that the young poepl have a time to help the commun becaus of their need to defens by themselv . i can understand the opinion that young peopl are busi of stude and eager to play the tv game , so that they seldom help their commun . howev , the school and communiri make enough time and chanc for young gener to help their commun . therefor , i definetli disagre with the statement that young person do not use their time to help their commun .
