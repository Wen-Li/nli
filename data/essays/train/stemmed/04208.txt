i disagre with the statement that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peapl do . of cours , it realli depend on the person , but i dare not to say the life is better when we are young than after age . first of all , young peopl are still work on look for their purpos in their live . they sometim struggl , confus , and are treamend sensit ; it may be veri hard time to live . howev , by get older , the memori of their adress will be good . thi mean older peapl have richer experi in the life than younger peopl have . second , gener young peopl do not have much money . older peopl may be confid about that they can afford someth by themselv . after becom adress , continu to depend on one 's parent is go to be veri pain . last and most import , older peopl know the qualiti of life . they are matur to live , and abl to find joy in the life . compar older peopl , young peopl may be soft and flexibl . on the one hand , that is veri worth , but on the other hand , it is not stabl . the sens of valu of the youth is still shape to be matur . thu i think older peopl can enjoy their life as well as young peopl do although they lave alreadi lost their youth . moreov , believ the life after get older is nice , it is veri import to make our live happi .
