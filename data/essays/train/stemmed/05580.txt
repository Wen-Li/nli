the textbook in which the student studi with are list with fact . most of them can not be taught by the student themselv without full understand of the content . by thi fact , other exampl and person experi , i have been convinc that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . our current societi requir student to use their knowledg effect later in their life . by just learn fact , they can not understand the basic concept and idea to make their knowledg use . our current societi is advanc rapidli to fit our need and want . in order to keep the advanc , the student need to understand the concept rather than fact . if , for exampl , a student learn onli the fact that one plu one equal to two , and two time four is equal to eight , the student will onli learn the answer of that problem without ani progress . the societi work the same . student must learn the major concept and idea in order to progress later in life . anoth reason is from my person experi . while i wa studi the polit scienc , i could onli memor the fact and could not understand the concept . in the test that occur a day later , i could onli answer the question which were exactli same as the sentenc state in the textbook . i request the professor for a retak . when i ask my father , who ha a job involv polit , he gave me the basic concept of polit and how it work . consequ , i wa abl to get a perfect score in the same subject the next day . onli with the knowledg of the concept rather than fact can one to put it in variou solut to method . by just learn the fact , one can onli earn one fact . by learn the idea and concept , howev , one can use it into variou method and eventu aquir numer fact . therefor , i beleiv it is crucial for student to understand idea and concept rather than fact .
