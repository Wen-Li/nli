ye i do agre that success peopl alway tri out new thing and take risk rather than do the same thing what they alreadi know how to do well . becaus peopl will with hi own experinc not from other experinc . if we tri out the new thing then onli we will come to know what we have to do and how to do . in start we might may go wrong becaus that is the new thing for us . but we have one prolong `` alway keep tri unless u get success '' and one day sure u will be success . there is one stori of one king who fight for hi kingdom . he lost and hide in one cave , there he saw one small spiderman tri to clim the wall . but he keep on fall donw , but he never loss hi control and temper he keep tri it until he get succ . from thi king understand that there is noth imposs in thi world only6 the thing is we need to give our total dedic toward our work . he understand thi thing and went back , gather hi armi and faught again . he keep on tri it and in last he won and got back hi kingdom back . so he learnt the lesson from a small spiderman that we should never give up . alway keep on tri . so in the same way i feel that , if we have confid upon ourself we can do anyth on thi earth and get success in that , though it might be from differ field which we not deal with . but what we need t o have is confid and strenght in ourself that we can do thi thing . if we have thi qualiti then no one can beat us . we will alway be success in our life and in our work . it might happen that be a experinc person also he might fail . becaus anyth is possibl in thi world . so i conclud that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . onli we need to have confid on our self then we can do anyth on thi world .
