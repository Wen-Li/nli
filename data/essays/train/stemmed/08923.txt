i ca n't agre thi statement . whi i think so , there are some reason . firstof all , when i go on a trip in a group led by a tour guid , i have to do everyth with my group . for exampl , i have to eat the same food what group peopl eat , i have to see the popular tourist attruct where veri croud with the amount of peopl with group peopl , and so on . next , i love to stay at a rich hotel and relax , becaus the most of my perpou of go travel is relax . howev , pack tour 's timet is too tight for me to relax , and there are mani peopl in a group , so i do n't relax . walk around unfamiliar place without some map and brouch is also a relax . i can found my favorit seaneri where peopl do n't know . the most import reason whi i think go on a trip not to use a pack tour is bore . travel agenc want to make a veri cheap tour to buy a lot of ticket as mani as they can , so pack tour is more bore than other travel . when i use such a pack tour , i will go to the veri famou plase to see , but i do n't like such a famou place . probabl , there are mani peopl in a such a veri famou place , and i will be not abl to find that i realli want to see a worthse place or a lot of peopl . i do n't want to have such an experi . therefor , i disagre with the statement
