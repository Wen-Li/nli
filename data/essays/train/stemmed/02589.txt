nowaday car are the most common transportaion vechil for human race . the reason for thi fact are firstli car are individualst so you can use whenev you want . secondli it can be faster than public transport . final and absolut car are much more comfort than ani other vechil . but what are go to happen to car in futur ? i think in futur the car will be use less often than today . there are too mani reason for thi opinion . for exampl in my countri the number of car are increas but the road ca n't be enough for thi much car and the driver are exhaust about traffic jam so they start to think about get rid of their car and use public transport . furthermor i think the biggest problem is gasolin prize . they are get higher and higher so one day we might not be afford to buy ani . these are the socio-econom disadvantag of use car . also there are differ possibl to make car less import and less usabl . technolog is grow so fast and scientsit can make faster train , faster plane and the station and airport are becom more comfort place and the ticket for more comfort transport are n't as high as they were befor . by thi way use plane is n't a luxuri anymor . furthemor technolog might make a fli car like in science-fict movi . i think thi is n't a wait for too much becaus 40 year ago automat open door were utopia in book or movi but they are real and common now . so mayb someday we will travel by fli on ourselv not in plane . in conclus by the develop of technolog and the socio-economi difficulti of have car make us to find altern way to transport . even now car are veri popular that doe n't mean that it will go on like that . new discoveri will make car unpopular but thi will take long time .
