i agre and disagre with the statment to some extent . there are definit advertis that exager the product extrem . for exampl all the weight reduc product prais on tv are just pure bogu . there is research show that pill that promis lose 10 pound in a day , or muscl stimul machin develop your muscl over night are not effect at all . howev , peopl 's hope and sorrow are abus by money hungri compani to suck the money out of the believ . addit , `` half truth '' or suggest statement are use in advertis to make the consum believ in the superior of the product . a famou chocol prais it valu by point out that milk is contain and that it is therefor healthi for children . look more close at the content reveal that not more milk is includ in the receip of thi particular chocol than in ani other milkchocol . unfortun , peopl are veri much fool by color move pictur and convinc actor . new technolog like tv or the web induc a high level of accuraci and verif . the crowd like to believ in what is shown on new media as it is much easier to consum the inform without much thought than constantli tri to figur out if the provid inform is true and verifi . howev , mani compani believ that the advertis should repres their firm imag and product . they understand that custom who realiz that they had been disguis by an add wo n't continu in buy that specif product . therefor , produc an accur represent of the product with the advertis is of extrem import . for exampl it would be unwis if a car compani would advertis that their car are extrem safe without suffici evid as accid falsifiy statement like that would result in huge neg financi concequ and law issu . the statement that `` most advertis '' exager their product i ca n't fulli support as i have n't look into statist concern thi topic . howev , in ani case advertis have to be look at critic as they definit not alway show real life .
