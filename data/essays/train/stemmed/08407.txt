in my view success peopl do what they alredi know how to do well becaus if they knew somethig aboout what they are do it will be more advantag . by compar with the previou peopl they may set goal and they will perticularli know how much time it had taken to the previou peopl who had alredi tri . and he may also get an idea whi the previou person or idea is fail and what must be done to over come that . i think no bodi want to take risk if they had choosen what they realli didnot know and it is also veri difficult to deal with the new rather than with the well establish or well known . they are much more clear as they did it mani time and also so mani had did it previous and mani refer and the work they did preiousli will help them on the other hand if they tri the new idea they do not know they will suc or not and thi lead to get some neg idea such that if i fail ? and they even feel emberase in the comun as if they realli fail if they do what they had knew previous succed chanc is more and they some posit forc by imagin after their success will travel them much faster to their goal . for an exampl mani scientist work with their profess after gain knowledg and know about the thing they will get an clear idea by do the same research for year and thi will lead to the extens of the previou idea which he had aquir previous . and as histori and the scienc have so mani record who aucced in thi way . and also as the children of the great scholar buissi men muscian u will daili accostem to the atmospher and thi also encourag to go in to the studi and suc in that field thi is slso one way their involv less risk and less mental stress and u will be successful in life in 80 of 100 case as they clerli watch and do the same thng the previou knowledg will help rather than tri differ thing . so i conclud that it is risk free and suce chane or more so mani choos what they did earlier .
