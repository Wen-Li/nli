most advertis seem to make product seem much better than they realli are . most advertis seem to emphas too much of their benefit or vital point in their product . to make the advertis more effect , peopl work for the advertis use more color , put overstat about the product in good way , and use popular actor , actress , and even singer to make the effect bigger . in gener , custom should not believ in too much for the advertis itself . i have two exampl to show how the way advertis work . one is that the advertis of camel cigarett , there are actual two advertis paper for men and women . but the common point is that there is a man and woman who look beauti and look cool with the cigarett on it both advertis . the advertis want consum to think to be look cool or even matur when they smoke like the model on it advertis . the other exampl is about nutrit pill . there are mani kind of pill or powder such as diet pill , protein powder , omega 6 pill , etc and it advertis affect peopl greatli . those advertis make peopl think their bodi look not nice even if they realli do not , and let them buy those pill to loos weight or make mascl . some peopl might believ if they take big amount of protein powder , they would make huge muscl which they want . howev , the truth is they can not . those protein powder doe not help to make more muscl . peopl who buy the protein power are just waist their money . peopl can buy anyth they want in thi societi . howev , mani of them do not realiz how they are affect by those advertis when they go shop and choos thing to buy . custom have to know onli what they realli need to buy , but not for the product they think atract becaus of it advertis . be a smart shopper .
