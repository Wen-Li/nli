life is a seri of experi . these experi start from birth till life end . if a seri of experi are enjoy , we perciev that part of our life as good . if we went through a seri of bad experi , we perciev our life to be dull & bad . thu , the degre of enjoy one encount in life is a result of the qualiti of the sum of seri of experi one had in a lifetim . i disagre to the statement , young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i strongli believ that the degre of enjoy one experi in life is depend on variou factor , the most import be one 's own mental-set . for exampl : an old man woud rather be enjoy more , play with his/her grandson than the grandson him/herself . so , enjoy is not base on age . it is one 's own mind set & it abil to perciev thing posit & appreci them . in turn it will result in an enjoy experi . live life enjoy is a skill . it ha to be learnt , either through experi or through knowledg . the young peopl assum parti , go out with friend , see movi are the great enjoy that they are experienc . but they are least expos to the fact that these are onli trace of happine , just like bubbl on the water surfac . there are deeper , intens & more joy moment in life . the emot happi of spend lifetim with a partner is one of the deep enjoy older peopl go possess . with age come matur & stabil to withhold happi . the experi of life also provid the much want toler to older peopl . thi make them a better knower of life , relationship & how to deriv happi from it . in my opinion an older person is a better taster of differ kind of enjoy in life .
