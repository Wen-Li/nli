i donot agre in total with the statement given as i would like to state some reason in support for my stand . young peopl are alway inspir to make thing happen in all way includ the help for the commun , but , some time they have to pull away themselv from thi type of act when situat donot allow them to do so . firstli , i would like to take the pride say young peopl are contribut to a massiv extent for the develop of their commun . there are peopl form group and associ in their place and a lot of social work is be done by them . thi is not new as thi process is go on sinc sever year , infact i would say sinc centuri . they form union and provid help desk at differ place to ensur the problem pepl are face in their commun are solv to the maximum extent . next , these youngster are alway readi and charg ever to their part in the emerg situat like a draught , an explos , flood and mani more . doe ani one know that a consider amount of the fund rais for the victim of recent disast `` tsunami '' are by the youngster onli . they are the futur of ani countri and the countri com year depend on these youngster itself . moreov they are the one who join the militari , and other educ cours like doctor , enggin etc . the well known peopl in these day were youngster at one stage and the deciss they made at that point made them to be at the place where they are today . if georg bush or ani other didnot take up good cours at the teenag , would they be here at the posit they are now . in my countri still the largest group that come forward first in ani situat is the youngster group . they are allset to do ani type of help like move injur one to hospit , rais fund for the need , and lend their hand in everi possibl way . howev in contrast to the reason i have sta abov some peopl are not encourag to do such activ . thi is due to the environ they are grown up . if the parent encourag their children to do help to the societi these situat donot occur . also the increas demand of financ and work load are leav the youngster , who are will to do some help to their commun , helpless in such situat . but they definit take time in their leisur to make some good chang in the area they can can afford to do someth . final i would like to conclud on the note that youngster are alway readi to do the requir help to the societi if the situat permit and some freedom is provid from their work place .
