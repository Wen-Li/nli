i must confess thi is a tricki question to answer . i agre to thi statement onli to some extent . in fact , i strongli believ that peopl can enjoy their life alway dure their lifetim and the reason whi they do so is much more connect to their person worldview than to their age . howev , i think that there are some ineluct element that are close relat to age and that help to enjoy life more , but they are equal distribut between young peopl and old one . i will tri to use a veri simpl exampl in order to show it . on one hand , young peopl are usual healthier and have more energi than old one . for these reason , they can do more activ and spend less time rest . secondli , they are a bit unawar of life , so they often face new challeng with more optim . thu , they plan veri adventur trip , for instanc . on the other hand , older peopl mayb have less energi and health , but they can afford trip better becaus they have more money ( at least in my countri ! ) and they have learnt a lot from life . their experi help them to know what is realli preciou in life and what you had better to do in some difficult situat . as i state befor , life ha it own cycl and each part of it can be deepli enjoy by everyon in differ manner . i am actual wonder if older peopl enjoy life more than younger one becaus of their experi . they might have get awar of what are the most import thinng in life and so they are suppos to suffer less than young peopl becaus of silli reason . howev , i think that thi can onli depend on each person differ experi and especi on what he or she believ in . in fact , some peopl that have everyth someon could desir are actual rather sad and other that keep have tough time turn out to be the happiest one . .
