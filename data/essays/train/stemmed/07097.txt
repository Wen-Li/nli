to travel is one way to learn and extend our horizon about the world and life . i have some import reason to travel without a tour guid . ye , i do n't prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guid although i can not deni it pro . i believ to experi new thing in your own world for yourself should be privat . you do n't have to give up from your freedom as well . secondli , when we do n't have ani schedul to follow travel may be more relax and be more stretch to expos thing which are not familiar to us . one of my aim to travel is to experi new thing and be face with beauti or ugli thing dure thi travel . to read about one place 's histori bring a mental challeng and give deeper and extens knowledg about that place . to find out the most beauti but hidden place are uniqu experi for me . also , not to follow a tour guid that mean not be tie by a incoher group can give much space for your discoveri . you wo n't have rush to follow ani schedul or you wo n't wait someon whom is take your time at all . it may seem harsh thought but i count on my experi . in sum , i suppos that i am more individiulast one that led my decis favor of travel without a tour guid . i like expos and experi freeli and myself .
