in thi period , it 's veri import to tri to do new thing or new job becaus with the develop of innov there are less opportun to becom a success person , and as a result onli if you take some risk you will obtain some good result . a good exampl of thi theori is bill gate , that ha use the innov to becom the most import person in all the world and now he can do everyth he want . as far as i 'm concern , i 'd like to have an idea like bill gate , becaus i 'm sure that thi idea could be a solut to all my econom problem !! but i also believ that if you do what you know how to do well , you can have a normal and nice life , with some good aspect but also with some problem , instead if you want to becom a success man , the onli thing that you can do is to tri an origin job or a new trend , becaus in thi era onli if you are a creativ person you can found success and easi money . for instanc , my father ha done the same job for thirti year , and he ha a veri normal life , he help me with the univers 's tax and he ha lot of friend , but he 's too far to be a success man . in spite of it 's veri difficult to be consid a success person , there are lot of success man in all the world , so i think that it 's not impossib to becom an import man , but it 's sure that if you do n't look for a new idea , you ca n't be consid like thi one , so in conclus i 'm agre with the statement .
