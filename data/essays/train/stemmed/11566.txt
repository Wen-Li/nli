a question ha been rais about whether or not the young peopl nowaday devot their time to help their commun . in respon to thi question , i think that there are two kind of young peopl nowaday : one kind is more polit , other kind is less polit . usual , the young peol are more polit becaus they have their parent more quit and more love . mayb when thi young peopl have a problem they can ask a help from your parent without have fear to them . so , for thi kind of young peopl is normal to be help and when they see other person that suffer they would help him or her . instead , the young peopl are less polit becaus their parent are more angri or mayb their parent pass few time with them . so , usual when they have some problem they resolv it alon without ask a help and if they see a man who have a problem they think that he or she can resolv alon . so , i think that it 's import that the parent pass the most of their time with their children . my parent work everi day , and they come back in my home veri later . i never ask them to help me becaus they are n't . so i have difficult to ask or to give a help and i prefer stay alon rather than stay with my commun .
