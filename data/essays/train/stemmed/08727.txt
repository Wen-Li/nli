mani peopl think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid and mani do n't . both type of travel have their advantag and their disadvantag . when you are travel in a group , you have the advantag , that you do n't need to plan your trip exactli . you can just follow the tour guid and let him think about which place you are go to visit . like thi you can see mani beauti place , which you have n't known befor . the onli problem you can have is , if you like to visit an other place , which the tour guid did n't plan befor , you can not alway do it , becaus you have to follow the guid 's instruct . also , when you travel with a guid , you can get inform about place and build you are visit veri easili . you do n't have to read in a book and look for the intrest inform . a tour guid can give you inform veri fast and know the intrest detail . travel in a group , you can also meet new peopl , make friend and spend time togeth on your trip . so , you are never travel alon . but when you travel without a guid , you can also have fun . first you should organ your trip . for some peopl thi can alreadi be veri excit . they buy book about place where they like to go . they can choos by their own , which church , which other build and tourist attract they want to see . and when they arriv there , they alreadi know someth about the place they are visit . when you are travel by your own , you can also chang your plan . if you like a place you are visit and you want to stay there for a longer time that you have plan , you can do that and you do n't need to follow the group you are travel with . i person prefer to travel without a tour guid . i like to plan my trip by my own and i do n't like to follow the whole time the guid and a group i possibl do n't like .
