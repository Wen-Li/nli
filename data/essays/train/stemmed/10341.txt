i-m agre with the statement and i realli hope so . i think that in twenti year a lot of thingh must chang and the use of car is obsolut one of these . consid first the main problem > the price and the dispon of petrol . in twenti year mayb some giaciment will be empti and the new one more and more unuseful becous of the reval between the east and the west of the world . so if the price of petrol is too hight we can-t use the car , is too expens for a famili have two or three car . .. so becom onli one . anoth import reason to get fewer the number of car is the pollut ! if the number of car continu to encras we will be summers by smog , smoke and poison ! isn-t possibl to live in a world more sick than thi . i think also that inth 2026 all town will have new kind of buss and train more confortebl , cheaper and faster than the actual one . so to go to the work , to go out for a pizza or to do anith els you will take the underground not like now . infect a lot of town don-t have underground an the most of peopl don-t fell safe take it ! for exampl i-v been in japan , to kyoto and i can sure say you that there wasn-t traffic !! all by bicycl or by train ! so you can go aroud and not hear the nois of the car and without sniff their smell ! i ralli hope that in all the world peopl can enjoi their countri , can live in town without problem and expeci that all econom and en problem close to petrol will desappear ! i give you 20 year of time
