some peopl in japan , where i live , the life old peopl ha is more enjoy , but i think young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl for the follow reason . first , youg peopl can do mani sport without concern about their bodi . for exampl , when i wa a student at kaisei high school , one of the best univers in japan , i wa on a basebal team whose name wa swallow . even now , i can rememb those day easili . i practic basebal with my friend everi day . that wa the most enjoy time for me . it wa not matter for me whether i could catch ball . the most impot thing wa do my best for catch white ball . the moment when i jump in to the ball wa the best moment . so , i think without excit sport it the life is not enjoy . second , the happi to go to school is what onli young peopl can get . for exampl , when i wa a student at waseda univers in tokyo , japan , i had a school festiv . our group decid to open waseda cafe . though we use a lot of time and money , we were happi becaus we could get import friendship . so , i think school is veri good . as the reason and exampl show , i strongli believ that young peopl can have much more enjoy time than that older peopl have .
