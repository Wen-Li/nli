in my opinion i think that the old peopl enjoy their life than the young peopl . there are mani exampl to show that . some of the young peopl in thi world have take drug or smoke . these two thing do a lot of damag in the bodi , if you take a lot of drug or smoke you may die . some of the young peopl may go to die becaus they broke up with their grilfriend or boyfriend , i think that it is selfish . there are mani thiev are young peopl too . do you think that a person who enjoy or like their life will do these kind of thing ? on the other hand i know mani older peopl who studi . i saw a lot of older peopl studi in night school . one day i had ask aold man whi he studi in the night school ? he replid me that he did n't student good when he wa young and he feel veri bad about that . he also said that he want to know as much thing as he can . i know a lot of older peopl who are lean to use comput . i think that the old peopl are much more hard work than the young . mani student in my high school is sleep , chat , or play game dure the lesson . most of them are wait the bell ring they do n't know how import about student . the older peopl had live in the world for a long thime , they know that knowledg is so import . they enjoy the process of learn . i know mani older peopl know that drug and smoke are not good so they stop it too . i think that the older peopl enjoy the life than young peopl . they do a lot of good thing that the young will not do .
