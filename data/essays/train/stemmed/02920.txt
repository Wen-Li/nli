i do not agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do for variou reason . first of all , mani young peopl today are under so much pressur , that they often do not find time to just `` enjoy life '' but have to studi or work hard to compet with mani other their age to get a satisfactori job or a place at a good univers which they want to attend . elderli peopl , on the contrari , especi if they are alreadi retir , are much more free to enjoy their time . as a psycholog research ha shown , peopl experi a shift in valu dure their lifetim . while younger peopl are still veri much keen on achiev materi rich and tend to compar themselv much more with other , older peopl seem to put more emphasi on emot closely-knitt relationship and valu materi good less than young person do . henc , one could assum that elderli peopl do n't experi as much social pressur from societi than youngster . the high rate of suicid among young peopl would also speak against the assumpt , that young peopl in gener enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev , i also do not believ that older peopl gener have a more joyou life than the younger gener . they face differ challeng : while young peopl might experi greater mental stress , older peopl most probabl have to conquer more physic stress , often in the form of seriou diseas . as an open question in the end i would like to ask whether it is at all possibl to determin the level of a person 's enjoy from an outsid perspect ! ?
