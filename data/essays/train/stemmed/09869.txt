i complet agre to the statement that adversit realli make the product look differ and much better than it acual is . thi is just a mode of increas the sale of that product . advertis do highlight the advantag of the product but everi coin ha two side and all that look beauti from outsid is not alway not so . they just exagerr and present everyth . let not forget that peopl do beiliev these advertis and end up loosen mani time . some time back there wa an advertis about some new hair product on tv and i it seem so attract that i could n't help get it . the result were n't veri impress . i end up with fall of my hair and dandruff problem which i never had . one shoud n't just beleiv in what is present extern , it is n't what it is actual . yesterday onli i saw that advertis about the quizno sub state that what they offer is much more , not onli thi but they also degrad the product of anoth compet . i do n't think that ani one ha a right to do that . advertis your own product is accept but not degrad other . in my countri the rule are differ , peopl ca n't realli do that . sometim i realli think that advertis are just a mode for fool peopl and noth more , befor buy anyth at all one should find out the advantag and disadvantag both and than decid . dont just blindli believ in what is be present . all that glitter is not gold . similarli all that look good is not alway so . it is veri easi to spend money but veri diificult to earn . so dont just spend your hard money on these useless advertis but think logic befor you take a step . advertis are help but not alway .
