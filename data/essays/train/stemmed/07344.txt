are most advertis can make product more attrctiv and better when they are advertis ? to some extent , i agre with the author 's gener assert that some advertis do have some posit effect on consum ' impress on product but onli through advertis can not necessarili make product seem much better . howev , the author unnecessarili extend thi broad assert to an irrevers extrem while overlook some essenti factor . on balanc , my point of content involv the fundament and deep analysi as discuss below . on the one hand , i would like to admit that the author 's statement , although suffer from some obiv drawback , ha some merit primarili in some special case in which the implicit rational behind it accord with common sens and our experi in daili life . henc , it is partial correct . in the first place , i want to point out that advertis can have posit effect on consum ' recognit of certain product . sinc client tend to accept the fact that onli firm produc superior product will advertis their product becaus onli those firm can make end meet or even profit greatli through advertis . it is true that market a product through advertis mean invest a lot of money and a firm can not know in advanc whether these advertis will be use to the success of a product . henc , advertis is a high-risk invest and onli big firm are appeal to advertis their product . for instanc , microsoft co. or coca cola co. often advertis their new product through all type of media . thi phenomenon make consum think that advertis product are good in qualiti , howev , which is often not the case . further more , advertis tend to overst the qualiti of a product . some word use in advertis will elabor the attract of a product and will be unwillingli to admit the defect of a product . consequ , consum who watch advertis will aptli think that the product describ in the advertis is veri good in qualiti although in realiti thi product is not so good . on the other hand , recogn that a more applic should incorpor differ aspect of the issu as suffici as possibl , i have to point out that the author overlook some compel factor that may affect thi issu . in short , thi statement is problemat in some way . for exampl , some product do have the same qualiti as present in advertis . in conclus , issu of whether advertis make product seem much more superior than they realli are is a complex one , requir subject judgment . consequ , there are no easi or certain answer . so differ are the person experi and emot concern among peopl with divers cultur that thousand individu might hold thousand opinion . accord to me , some advertis do have some posit effect on consum ' impress on product therefor can make these product more attract .
