we all know that technolog is the most rapidli develop thing in the world and who can predict how we will live after twenti year from now ! it is realli hard to tell what will futur bring us . twenti year from now , is a veri long time and i think everyth that seem imposibbl today might be normal in daili life in futur . thi includ the use of car , of cours . i think i am not agre with the idea that fewer car wil be in use in a twenti year time period . becaus the 21 th centuri is the centuri of the speed . peopl even today are alway worri for not to be late to go from some place to anoth . thi is usual caus a big stress to peopl . i close my eye and can imagin the time 20 year from now . what i see are peopl that are more faster and hurri around than today 's peopl . in my opinion peopl of futur will need much faster car than today 's car . furtermor they will need much more car than they need today . becaus the number of the peopl is increas day by day , rapidli . in order to support the increas peopl 's need the number of the car will increas , either . anoth thing that support my idea abov is the global . the trade and the commun between counti are spead everi day . thi global will caus an increas in transport between countri around the world . in order to transport easili and quickli from one place to anoth there will be more heavi transport car such as track exc . i think these are all to say in order to support my idea that 20 year from now there will be more car than today . may be car will chang and may be they look diffrent but thi wiil not chang the fact that their number will increas .
