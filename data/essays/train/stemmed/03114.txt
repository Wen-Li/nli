i total disagre with thi statement . so mani young guy today are help other peopl to manag their life . i live in a small citi call erd and also in such a small citi a club to help student to get better mark establish . i join thi club one year ago and first i wa surpris how much young peopl were offer there help there . all of thi peopl are graduat student who use their free time after bee in their cours and class to spend it at teach other student . a major fact is that the other guy and me do not earn a lot of money by thi activ . sinc my first visit in the club i have been do privat lesson onc a week . and i think it is a great honor to see the person teach by you get better and better grade . i also have a friend who support a poor famili in asia with 400 euro a month . without that help they could not even buy cloth for all of them . 400 euro is quit a lot of money also for the european way of life . but the girl work hard for bee abl to afford thi project . anoth exampl for prove my statement given abov are mani other student and friend of mine . i have alreadi ask mani peopl for their opinion about the fact that mani older poepl that the younger one do not care about the environ surround them . most of them refus to join the militari after finish school . instead they did a social work . thi would be for exampl help older poepl to get to the supermarket or to the church . and surprisingli everi one of the enjoy hi job . everyon agre that they gain a lot of social experi whithin thi time . to sum up i would say that young peopl often are misunderstood . they are neither laisi nor not will to offer their help . you can find young poepl all over the social environ work for free and help the peopl who need thi help .
