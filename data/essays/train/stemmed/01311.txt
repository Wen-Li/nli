there are three aspect of travel involv in the statement . first , the best way to travel ; second , travel in group and third , have a tour guid . i do not agre with the statement as a whole and i will explain with respect to each aspect of the statement that i point out abov . the follow are my reason for my disagr : i believ there is no one best way to travel . it is a veri person prefer and differ from person to person . the best way to travel realli depend on what kind of place are you go to tour , what is your object of tour and what are your prefer . some peopl may enjoy compani of a larg number of peopl while travel and some peopl may love to travel all alon and experi dure their travel . i do believ travel in group leb by a tour guid can be veri enjoy but sometim travel in group without a travel guid or travel individu can also be enjoy . travel in group ha it 's own problem . there might be disagr among group member and it may delay thing . if my object of tour is to learn and at the same time enjoy the compani of my friend and famili member than i would prefer to go in a group led by a tourist guid . tourist guid are familiar with the place and they can provid us the histori of the place in a veri short time and you may not have to put lot of effort to know about the place . if my object of tour is to explor new place , learn more about the place than have a tour guid may not serv the purpos . tour guid provid a snapshot of the histori of the place . in thi situat i would like to travel on my own and explor the place in my own style . to sum up , i would choos my travel method depend on the situat and my person object . if i want to spend time with famili member i would like to travel with my famili member in a group and would like a tour guid to help us but if i want to explor and experi with a new place i would prefer to travel alon so that i have independ and liberti to take my decis and experi .
