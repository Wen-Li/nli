as time goe by , lifestyl ha chang a lot back than in the 1970 's . some peopl believ that yong peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i strongli agre with thi statement as follow support . howev , i have to say that it depend on viewer who are young peopl or older peopl . first of all , for exampl , my father just enjoy play golf whenev he ha time , howev , i do n't like golf becaus it feel like bore to me. so i usual go to sea to swim for summer and go for snowboard for winter with my friend . i think the reason is that older peopl did n't have chanc to have those sport which i enjoy . basic , becaus i am young , i can have more chanc to do someth which i prefer to than my father . in addit , older peopl usual like do non-act action such as read , watch movi , seed . howev , young peopl usual like do activ action such as soccer , basketbal . actual , i think that these kind of theori are natur rule . my point is that between older peopl and young peopl have differ thought and lifestyl . final , mani year ago , peopl have to work to surviv without break . for exampl , my grandfath use to work outsid until he die . thi effect caus by social circumst . howev , he realli enjoy hi work for life . as you know , at that time mani peopl did for their life . howev , as i mention abov , everyth is chang by time . of cours , if i have son , my son will enjoy life much more than me. that 's whi i realli agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do .
