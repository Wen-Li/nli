i do not agre with the statement say there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . first of all , car industri will not allow such thing to happen . in some compani , car are deliber built to last less than 10 year , so the owner will buy new car more often . they consist produc more car and way to encourag peopl to buy and use them . in some countri , even the govern encourag automobil consum . those countri build more and more road and also expand the alreadi exist one , so more car can easili get on the road . the govern , or the citi planner , could have built more railway and mass transport instead of more road if they want to reduc traffic and pollut , but the govern fear that the automobil industri , which is a major part of the countri 's econom , will fail to increas if they take such polici . build more road instead of build complic mass transport system might also be in fact a cheaper solut , and the onli solut avail at that time for reduc traffic in the short term . the second aspect of use car is that the peopl who have been drive will not easili go back to walk or use mass transport unless it is a much better substitut for drive . drive and have an own car give you the kind of privaci not easili gain by use mass transport , and go back to an old habit need a lot of determin . the type of car use today might be use fewer in the futur , but new and better type or car will domin the futur . the downsid of drive wa to have to concentr on drive and keep an eye on the road , but more and more technic develop allow driver to drive less and let the artifici intellig do the work . there will also be car with less , hope no pollut . the car will almost defin be much less noisi than the one today . the comfort of drive or ride on car will consist increas , becaus the compani investig for reserch in those area . becaus of these reason , the overal number of car and the usag of them is more like to increas than decreas .
