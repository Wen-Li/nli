thi statement bring up a veri import concept that i have had sever occas to reflect on dure and after my student 's life . as my own experi prove me mani time , it wa more import to have the tool and concept to understand the fact around me than to learn the fact without understand the whi and how of them . i have follow a scientif educ and been veri sensit to all scientif topic sinc my youngest age . what alway appeal to me in scienc wa the fact that event could all find a logic explan and that the world , after all , could be direct by understand law . as an exampl , know that the water , when boil , becom vapor , and therefor a ga , onli give the student a fact that he can observ , but from which he can not draw ani conclus in the futur . on the other hand , know that all element on earth can have three differ phase , solid , liquid and gaz , give the student a concept . thi concept , in turn , can be appli to ani materi on earth . it then explain whi water boil , but it will also explain whi iron melt or whi azot can be found in a liquid form at lower temperatur . anoth exampl could be found in histori , where know the fact is , at first , the primari work of the student when they are teenag . the teacher would spend hour tell them about the histori of their countri and what happen when . but , i know for myself , that the most interest part of histori teach is not the fact , but whi such event happen . and how these event help form a nation 's histori , which in it turn creat new fact . know a date in itself doe not realli help to understand whi a countri decid to invad anoth one . as a conclus , train the student , to deriv conclus from observ and concept they have learn , is a veri import skill that would help anybodi when face later on in hi life with new event . personnali , thi is how i have alway view my educ , as a provid of a great toolbox , that i could use anytim . so far it help me a lot .
