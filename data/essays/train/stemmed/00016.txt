i agre to the statement propos . in my view it is veri import that one shoould undersatnd the idea and concept befor they sit down to learn the fact . i would like to support thi statement by give a person exampl . i am a student studi in the 12th grade . today the concept and fact that i need to learn are not veri easi . defin , a lot of hard work goe into learn them ! but , if i sit down and understand whi and what i am doing. , then it defin make it much simpler for me to go through an entir chapter . i think thi is the case with mani of my friend too . i would also like to put down the fact that i am a student who ha shift from the normal c.b.s.e an indian borad to the intern baccalaur becaus of one simpl reason . at my earlier school the standard norm wa that of rote-learn . we would just have to mug up the entir text book and regurgir it on our exam paper . . but my current school help us understand what we are do . they make us do activ and give us explanant on what we are go to do and whi . thi realli help me and my peer to learn faster . so , i veri strongli believ that what ever we do ha to have a great deal of understandingbehindit , befor we jump in to learn the fact . we should alway ask ourselv a set of standard question befor we jump into a task or start learn fact that we dont undersatnd or we dont have the basic knowledg about . most importantli , whi ? whi is it that i'am do thi ? what ? what is it that i am doin ? what am i go to gain out of thi ? where ? where is it go to leed me ? i think by answer these question we make a veri good and learn individu . we do understand and defin , learn better !!
