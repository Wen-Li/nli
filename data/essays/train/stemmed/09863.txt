ye , i agre to the statement . there are mani reason and exampl , i would like to cite in support of my opinion . gener , in everyon 's life success come through hard work . by take new risk , tri new thing one can achiev success in their life . onli success peopl tri new thing and take risk than do well which is alreadi exist . for exampl , in consider of my life , firstli `` i will alway tri new thing and take risk '' . the reason are by take risk and tri new thing - we can know more thing not onli on the subject but also on the practic purpos . it is alway benefici to take risk which help to work on our goal , it improv our talent , brisk , stabil , strength , curios to know the thing . secondli '' when i am do my project in my colleg lab - all lectur , friend told that it is imposs to continu on that project . but i had taken it in a challeng way and lot of risk is taken on that project , i read lot of book for that project which help me in gain more knowledg on the subject and even some thing are know for me which are not told by my professor . in thi way , i final succeed in my project and all are prais me as a success person . so it is alway better to tri thing in new way and take risk to becom success person rather than do on the exist . therefor i suggest to tri new , learn new thing , and to do risk . howev , in some case success person are not take risk and they are do work on the exist thing to the advanc level . it is also an achiev to do the work on the exist thing . it all depend on how we approach and succed toward to that aim . but some peopl success or not , it help to enhanc in their individu think and creativ . insum , i would like to reiter my opinion that the statement is agreeabl from the abov reason and exampl .
