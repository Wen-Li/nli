some peopl might think that success peopl tri to new thing wherea other might believ that they should do well what they alreadi know for the success . in my opinion , i can agre with the statement onli if the success peopl alreadi do well what they alreadi know . one possibl reason is that do easi thing can reduc the risk of fail to do new thing . if small problem that can be easili cope with are left for long time , it will be the interrapt of the success . even tini problem can be bigger when they are left over for a long period . if the basic ha been done , the success new thing will yield more benefit . even if there were small thing which were easi to be done , they would result the liabil . to success , the thing that are basic and have known alreadi sould be well done . it decreas the risk of the failur , and the new thing that are tri will increas the benefit from the success . if onli new thing are tri from no background , that will yield noth and cost .
