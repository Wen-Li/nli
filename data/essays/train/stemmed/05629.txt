i 'm of the opinion that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . firstli , the activ most of the youngster do are chat on phone , surf inform , hang out with friend , go out for movi , restaur and the list goe on . they do not even give enough time for their studi too . the activ they do will not fetch them anyth worth . their psycholog can be understood easili . all of them think in the same way . they like to play game and want to enjoy their teenag life by not take ani respons . instead of spend time on watch movi one can utilis the same for a good caus . student in primari school are made to particip in such program so that they will follow the same later on . for exampl mani of the school in my citi particip in a program call `` janmabhoomi '' a program meant for keep the citi clean and green . but these activ are not follow later by most of the student . they becom reluct toward do these activ . secondli , they do not show activ particip in commun activ like keep it clean and green , improv the exist condit of the societi and work for the welfar of the commun . they are the one who can improv the standard of live of the commun . i think everi teenag should take the respons of help their commun . in sum , i would like to reiter myself that youngster should give out time to help their commun .
