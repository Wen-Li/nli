due to the current level where scienc ha reach by mean of content and achiev , it is obviou that you need to special in one particular area rather than deal with differ field . in otherword scienc ha all it resourc from the academ studi and subject and move them to a next level by mean of continu thi progress for the commonwealth , we need to focu on one specif subject while be awar of the influenc of the other relat field as well . when we consid the polit as an academ subject , we can not separ it from sociolog or relat social scienc . therefor we should be awar of the sociolog in order to studi polit as a scienc or an academ subject , howev in order to be succes in the relat academ subject , thi line ha to be drawn veri care by mean of know where to stop . if we take a look at the peopl who are special in their academ subject , it is veri common to see the exampl of abov model sinc all subject in certain limit are effect each other , sometim supplement , sometim result in contradict . on the otherhand the definit of ani academ titl requir veri deep knowledg which should make our way into have a broad knowledg of one specif academ subject which we are special rather than deal with differ subject . the professor in univers realiz academ studi is a good exampl to be consid at thi point . but as discuss abov we should not ignor the abov model in term of have at least a basic inform about how the other subject effect our studi . histori is also anoth factor to be consid in term of compar the exampl . mani sciencist had work on particular academ subject in order to progress themselv and accomplish their respons against the human by invent differ devic , offfer differ thesi which are still lightn their follow . such as edison , einstein and mani other are good exampl of thi heritag . consequ the academ subject ha to be handl one by one or specif in order to be more innov and use for the human . in my opinion , past is the best mirror support thi approach .
