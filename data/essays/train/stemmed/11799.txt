i agre with the statement . in mani year , sinc car were creat and got on sale , peopl have use them and had them in their live as their leg to go where they want to go . and car are also contribut to carri stuff faster and easier , not just peopl . today , car are need by world and peopl live as i wrote . but you know what car need to move . that is gass . peopl also have use much gass along with car sinc they start to ride car . but it led oil that creat gass to be use up from underground of the earth faster . if peopl did n't touch , it would n't happen . but spend or wast of gass is still go on now . so , wast of oil caus use up of them . that is about whi countri that have oil is make the oil ( gass ) price higher and higher . then , who need more car that use gass even more than now in the futur ? look at the plobrem , scientist are tri to find or creat new kind of fuel to move the car for gass . for exampl , there is an interest way to get new fuel . they are find the way out to get fuel form suger . when suger get heat up , it make a kind of alcohol . and that can be use for car onli if they are mix with gass . now , suger alcohol ca n't be new fuel be use by itself , but scientist believ that they will final sucss make them complet and peopl will be abl to start use them to ride their car . actual , thi work is go well now by the scientist . and that 's whi i said peopl wo n't need ani more car move by gass . that can be said that it is not so far peopl start ride car with new fuel , i consid . otherwis , peopl wo n't be abl to have their live like right now with car . from the reason i wrote avob , i agre with the idea in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
