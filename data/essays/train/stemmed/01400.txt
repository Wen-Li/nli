i agre with the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' . i think today the compani are spend a lot of resouc in order to have their product better show , i think there is onli one reason to spend so much money to achiev a goal that should be not import for the custom . in fact , i think that , if the peopl would think without ani advertis , they would choos the product that ha the best qualiti , and so the compani that are not produc good qualiti product have onli one solut , and the solut is to make the peopl think their product are better than they realli are . i am veri interest in thi issu ; and so , in the last few year , i studi a lot of market tecniqu in order to know what are the compani do in thi field ; howev , i am also interest in be a good custom , so i want to tri to avoid be a custom of a compani that ha a bad polici regard the market commun . i know that thi is today quit difficult to achiev , but i feel that i realli have to tri it . anoth reason , i want to argu to support my idea , is link with the qualiti of food we are eat today . in fact ; today the peopl have and averag of diseas much higher that it wa sever year ago . i think it is due to the qualiti of food we are eat , i am affraid that , despit thi fact , the peopl are still spend no more interest in order to know what are they eat . i thing also the govern should take some decis in order to clarifi the situat . the last reason , i would like to point out , is link with the agricoltur econom field . i know that today thi field is not so import as it wa some year ago , but mani peopl are still work in thi econom field . i hope the huge compani will not conquest the while market . i know that the progress can not be avoid , but i am still affraid of the futur . i hope we could give to our son a world better that the one we have .
