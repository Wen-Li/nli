there is no direct answer to thi question it all depend upon the situat . i do agre witht he statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' but on the other hand i also diagre with thi statement . peolp should tri new thing too and take risk but on the other hand they should also tri to do thing that they did wrong . not all but most of the success take risk and tri new thing becaus do that they get new idea and they come to know differ thing and peopl . thi risk take qualiti help them to rise from their expect but also throw them down beyound their expect . poepl who tri do thing which they alreadi know help them to becom profession and perfect in thier field . thi help them to stay where they are and doe not help them to rise and if they want to rise they have to risk which are import . there is a famou say that : `` practic make a man perfect '' so thi is suitabl for the peopl who are not risk taker but tryi to do thing what they alreadi know and by do that they are tri to make themselv perfect . all thi is also depend upon much knowledg a person as about the particular thing or topic and also on person 's luck . for exampl my father and hi friend studi in the same school and they both graduat at the same time from the univers . both are success person in their field my father is lawyer and hi friend is an engin . on day both stood against each other my father wa arisk taker while hi friend wa n't . both were fight for the same contract at the court but due to my father 's luck and abil of take risk at that time hi whole carrer wa at stake but final he won and hi friend who di n't take the risk lose . thi tell us that take risk is not use all of the time it can lead you to faliur and on the other hand it can also help in the victori of a person like in my father 's case . in the i would say that it all depend upon the situat , your person experi , knowledg and most import the luck .
