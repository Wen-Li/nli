the issu at hand is , whether it is good to travel alon without a tour guid or in a group that is led by a tour guid . thi issu is veri troubl to me becaus there are so mani peopl in the world who enjoy go to differ place by themselv without a tour guid although they can afford one . but i 'll support the tour with a guid with a group of peopl becaus sometim you can find mani good life long friend in a group and mani beauti sceneri that you can not see without the help of a tour guid . i prefer the best way is to travel in a group led by a tour guid becaus a tour guid can give you a lot of inform about the place you are go to view . you can not find that inform if you are travel alon without a guid . moreov , if you are travel in a group you will actual enjoy the travel & you would not even know about the time that you spent for travel . on the other hand , if you are travel alon without a tour give you can caus troubl for youself sometim . for exampl , you can not find all the sight sceneri without a tour guid & it will be a great hassl if you are travel alon in a taxi without know anyth about the citi you are visit . second reason whi a grop travel with a guid is preferr becaus of the econom figur . for exampl , suppos you are travel alon without a guid it will caus you to spend a lot of money if you do n't know the visit citi well . on the other hand , in a group tour all the particip pool money so that everi individu ha to pay a littl amout of money . furthermor , travel by a group of peopl can enjoy their travel a lot instead of a singl individu . in conclus , i 'll say that travel in a group is far more excit experi as compar to travel alon withot a guid . i believ thi is better option becaus it is econom , excit , worth spend money to travel with a bunch of peopl rather than alon .
