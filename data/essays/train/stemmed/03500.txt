in these day , lot of compani want from their employe to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . howev , in my opinion , to special in one specif subject is better for peopl for some reason . first of all , to special in one specif subject is good for a person . if a person onli interest in one specif subject , he or she can focu in that subject care and he or she can know all of the detail of that subject . he or she whoever studi a specif subject will be an expert of hi or her subject . second of all , if an employe in a big compani have broad knowledg of mani acedem subject , the manag of that compani can do out of work other employe becaus of the person who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . that is unemploy and it is not good for economi and employe . so everybodi can do their job in the big compani . third of all , if a person want to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , it would be killing-tim becaus that person can start their career in a compani and he or she can start live real life a few year ago . to sum up , although lot of compani want from their worker to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject nowaday . becaus of these reason such as focus in one subject , employ , start to live real life a few year ago it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
