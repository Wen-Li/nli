advertis as a part of system i sure agre that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . howev thi is not simpli caus by advertis . it is also relat to the capitalist system and marx 's idea of commod fetish . by those process , peol easili see those thing more beauti then they actual are . first of all i want to describ the basic consequ of commod fetish . peopl by care more about the exchang valu of commod instead of their use valu , get integr to the system . marx argu that by thi way peopl are control by commod that they actual had creat . i think thi is the basic featur which underli whi and how advertis make product seem much better . if peopl were not a part of the system and were not control by the commod , they would n't be buy thing that actual do not need . howev by live in the system they do n't care for the real featur and use valu of thing . a person who realli and onli care about the use valu of a product would n't be atrract by the commod which are now seem much better than they actual are . advertis can give them more valu becaus the system allow simpl product to act as they have a real valu independ from peopl . if those condit were not avail , no matter how good or succesful an advertis is , it could n't show a product much better . becaus without those condit there would n't be a human conscious which would perceiv them better than they are . if onli the use valu could be care by peopl advertis would even not be on stage . so when i say that i sure agre with the assumpt it is becaus of those underli featur . for commod to control peopl , the system need the advertis in order to manipul peopl more effect . so as the system is still exercis and work properli all of it part should also be work properli . and as the advertis is a part of the system , it ha also make it job and show product better than they realli are .
