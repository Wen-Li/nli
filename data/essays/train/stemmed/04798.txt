nowaday , most of the young peopl have a job , a famili or live onli in a relationship with a girl/boy . so they have n't much spare time , but in the follow text , i will mention my opinion and how it could work . on the one hand , if you live at home with your parent and go onli to school , you should support your parent in the household , becaus you live there and get everyth from then , so the parent can ecxept some help . you should n't do anyth but you can share the work , which ha to be done . for exampl you can make a plan for a week or longer about who have to do the dish or to clean , so everybodi make some work in the hous . the work should be fairli share . on the other hand , if you go to work to work all day from morn until the even , it is veri difficult to find a fair solut for everybodi . after the work you are tire and if you should do then some work in the household is veri hard . for thi problem , the solut could be , you can arrang with your parent to do some work at the weekend . ok , you are young and would like to make parti in the even , but i guess you live at home and your parent care for you , so you should give someth back to them and they will see that you know what they do for you . they get someth back for there care or worri about you . i ca n't understand the young peopl , whose think that their parent have to do all the work in the household . when the parent cook for me , it is absolutli okay and my job to make the dish . moreov it is my job to clean my cloth and to iron them . final , i think there are not mani young peopl who do like me . most of them , it is sad but true , think , their parent have to do all the work at home , so they can go out and meet friend . i absolutli agre with the statement that a lot of young peopl don , t give enough time to their commun .
