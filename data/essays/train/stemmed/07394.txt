to a larg extent i agre that the best way to travel is in a group with a tour guid . especi if you are visit a new countri or place where there could be a languag problem then have a tour guid is veri desir . i would like to recount an experi i had when my parent and i had gone to australia on a vacat . australia is a veri beauti countri and i 'm fortun to have visit . we went with a group of twenti peopl from differ locat . all of us start off from a common meet point . the advantag are that all our flight and hotel reserv were book in advanc so we did not have to bother about get flight and hotel reserv . the tour guid is train and are well equip to solv ani problem that aris in cours of the journey . all local transport wa arrang for in advanc so get from point to point is not a problem . an itenari of the place of interest that we would be visit on a particular day is hand out so we know where we are go and what we are go to see . the disadvantag are that we have to follow a fix itenari and can not see or visit place not written in the itenari . the other thing is that differ peopl have differ tast , some like visit museum and place of histor interest while other like amus park . irrespect of our like or dislik , we have to be togeth with the group . sinc we visit as tourist , we donot get to see how day to day life is . final there is a possibl of not be abl to get along with some of the group member . we have to be tolar toward everyon in the group . i person feel that the advantag of have a tour guid out weight the disadvantag . these choic are usual depend on temper ( s ) of individu , peopl who are adventer may prefer to plan vacat on their own while other may choos a path that tri and test .
