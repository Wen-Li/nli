i have travel mani place throughout my life . i love to travel with my parent , but of cours , there were mani time that we travel in a group led by a tour guid . i person prefer to travel without a group and defin to travel without a tour guid . the first summer vacat that my parent and i went to japan , i wa onli six year old . we were with a group of peopl , and there wa a tour guid . everi histor place or ani amus park we went , we travel with a big tour bu . the tour guid would then explain detail for inform that tourist should know . though it seem to be use , i felt most of the time i wa `` trap , '' and `` bore . '' and i want to see thi veri phenomen templ on our way to the hotel , but i wa told not to do so becaus we were on the group ; it wa not on the schedul . i felt it wa such a disappoint . in addit , i could not have stay in a place where i want to stay longer ; daili schedul wa alreadi written for us , and the place we went might not be the one i wa interest in . i have travl to hong kong , unit state , korea , and japan alon or with my parent . it wa such a big differ compar to if i wa with a group . i could do everyth i want . i wa free to stop by a comest shop whenev i felt like it . my time wa flexibl . it wa the best when i acut went to korea and stay with my friend ' hous . they brought me to place that i do n't think i would go if i wa with a group . for instanc , my friend 's grandpar garden and place where famou band concert perform . it wa incred entertain and that is whi i am passion about travel without a group led by a tour guid . though there are reason i partli like to travel in a group led by a tour guid , i do not think that is the best way to travel . i am more comfort either travel alon or with my parent becaus it not onli benefit the relationship between me and my famili , i also see the world larger in thi point of view .
