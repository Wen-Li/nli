i agre with the statement becaus i think that spot make hi product seem better almoust alway . from the product point of view it is a veri good think becaus in thi way they think that it is possibol for them to sell mach more product and so it 's possibl to make much more money . i think that thi is not true in fact when someon goe to buy someth becaus he see that on tv or by some other kind of advertisi , he mant to have that product with the propieti that were illustr . if he come back home with hi new object and whene hi tri it and it note tha the propieti are not seem as the advertisi 's one , he is not sadisfact at all . when happen someth like that the client will never buy again the same product and he will never buy anyth els by the same factori . for exampl : is chrisma , you want to buy to your son a new toy . you want to buy a small nice train that you saw on a tv spot . it ha the railyway station and it is full of light . the spot say that the light turn realli on . on the chrisma day you give your present to your littl son and you say to him the the light turn realli on . he is vari happi for that but when he tri to turn on the light noth happen . by now i 'm sure that you will never buy anyth als from the train 's factori . for thi reason i think that a product have to make a real and true advertis for hi product , in thi way peopl who buy someth from him are sadisfi and so they mayb will come back to buy someth als from hi factori .
