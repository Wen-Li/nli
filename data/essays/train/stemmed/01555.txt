i agre with thi that . it is realli import for student to unbderstand idea and concept . it is more difficult thing than learn fact . first , they can learn fact anytim , if they wish . but how about the idea or concept ? the answer is it wo n't . becaus to understand idea and concept are n't on the text or onlin . even the teacher wo n't teach about that . and i think the most of the kid doe n't know which of these . do you know whi ? the most oof the parent and the school side think they are not necessari to teach or need them . but i think it 's wrong . if we get the fact and concept , the children can understand the realli realli basic part of the thing . and that make children interest . second , the fact and concept are more specif thing . everi adult think , they are difficult for children so the children do n't have to know about that . that is not true . the truth is the adult do n't know about the fact and concept . that 's whi they say about that . they do n't know so the children doe n't have to know . i think that 's kind of stupid . and the adult scare about the kid will learn that someth they do n't know . i think it is veri good thing to know about the fact and concept . i know it 's hard , but if you learn that your world will be chang . do n't you think that 's more interest thing than ljust learn from the text ? i think ye . so iwant to kid to know about the fact and conceot . then they will interest about the lot of thing . if all kid interest in fact and concept the world will be chang more interest thing ever . so , if they learn and know about tfact and concept they will theach their 's futur kid . and the world will chang . i hope that world will be come as soon .
