advertis is an assenci way to introduc product to the custom and to increas the usuag of the product so all produc advertic their product . they tri to show their product as it is the best one among the other in the same class . so i believ that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus an advertis do mention to good part of the product onli rather than be object and advertis do not show the exact result reach by the product . first of all an advertis mention the good part of the product onli rather than be object . produc want to show hi product as it wa excel , do not have ani weakn or do not have ani harm . for excampl there exist cosmet advertis on tv 's everi day . advertis indic how a woman beautifi by the hair dye , how attract she becom . but advertis never mention the harm of the hair dye which caus cancer in long term usuag . so women use thi product without be awar of it harm , they form a better imag for the hair dye in their mind than it is in real . secondli advertis do not show the exact result that the product advertis result . they show the result which the pruduct must reach but not the result reach in real . for exampl let investig an advertis of a chemic , use for clean the dish . in advertis , the dish wash by that chemic seem reali clean and they shine and it is also announc that chemic is cheaper than the other . when you by the pruduct and start to use , you face with the result that your dish are not such clean . thi mean you are misslead . again the imag of the product in custom mind is better than it is in real . as we see from the exampl and experi in our daili life most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
