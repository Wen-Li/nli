understand is the most import way of learn i would say that understand the idea and concept is more import for student than to learn fact . in math , understand the idea and concept is the onli way of pass a test success , becaus there are onli a few fact that could be learn . you have to now how to add 2 to 2 in order to get the right solut . becaus onli know the solut to be 4 doe not help you with ad 145 to 589 . anoth exampl is an interpret of a text . the student ha to know how to do the task . he ha to analys the text concern rhetor devic and theori of commun in order to get a good mark . the knowledg of an metaphora in a special line doe not help him to compar it to the epoch or characterist of the protagonist . in gener , fact concern a special problem or situat , like in histori . one exampl for a fact is the exist of a monarchi in germanz until the 20th centuri . but the concept of a former german monarchi is similar to a former french one . onli when you know what idea and concept are about you are abl to compar them to anoth similar situat or use them on anoth subject . and usual the knowledg of develop and their reason are more import than the date alon . when scientist are search for a problem , they compar the aspect they know to the fact they discov , but to understand how a process work , thez need idea and concept . despit the fact that student must learn concept and idea to succeed in test , they should not neglect fact , as well . everi thesi need a backround of fact , which prove that the idea an concept are correct and use . to summer the idea i have to state that the understand of the idea and fact is more import than the knowledg of fact . but ani idea would exist without fact , so the second question in a test will be about specif exampl .
