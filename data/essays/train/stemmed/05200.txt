i complet disagre with the statement that state : `` success poepl tri new thing and take risk rathen then onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , becaus the criteria to be success person doesnt depend onli in do new thing that no one did befor . in opinion , that do ordinari thing is better for mani reason . firstli it more safeti , for exampl , tri to fix electr equip even if it veri simpl , will be dangaer if there no enough inform how to fix it . second reason is save money , for instanc if you tri to take risk of someth not ordinari such as throw yourself from high build to small swim pool , may lead to break some of your bone and get ingur , if the risk did'nt be secces , so you will spend the money in vesit hospit and doctor . other reason for hold is opinion , that is wast of time , so tri to do someth thet you know it veri well will reduc the time to tri do someth no one did befor . although some poepl argu that do some thing new is criteri of success person , for exampl , discoveri of use and good invent is success , such as invent of light by adison . howev , nobel invent the bomb , but i can not consid him as success person becaus he invent aw thing in sum , in my view the success person who do success work , even if the work is well known .
