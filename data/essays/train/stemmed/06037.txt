i do n't agre that the best way to tavel is in a group , special a group led by a tour guid . there are some reason whi . firstli , tour guid prepar the schedul about travel . they do thi regardless person prefer . so we can not satisfi about their schedul about travel , becaus the travel is our travel , not their . as a result , a costom may complain about their schedul . so i preper travel alon schedul by myself . secondli , travel in group led by a tour doe not provid person time for us . a tour prepar schedul whole travel time in advanc , so they shoud punctuat the time . as do that , they complish their respons . as a result , we are veri busi to obey that time , and we can not have enogh time to enjoy in one place that we are veri interest special . so we can not appreci a place or landscap . i 'm sure that person each other must be have the thought of prefer . they 'll be unsatisfi about thi schedul . thirdli , there are mani peopl in a group , so i can not have my time . in my case , i like to pictur the sight , enjoy and think about the place , and medit alon and silent . but , in a group , there are nois about convers and voic of tour guid , so i can not concentr to my notion .
