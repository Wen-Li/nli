i beliv that is veri nessesari to travel in a group but not lead by a tour guid . if you travel in a group let say may up with person friend , you normal want to explor by your own , without have so mone lead you . thi way you woukdnt have ani problem in want to go some where els or want to just have fun . in a person experi not veri long ago , i went with a group of friend to pari . we went by owr own . we had a graet time , we did n't learn us much us peopl would by a tour guid but we had a chanc to explor evreyth , by read ask or even think by owr own mind . anoth group that went but with a tour guid , said that it wa n't that great , for a matter afact , they even came earlier becaus they whre sik of listen about the histri of all the rock , church , hous , etc . they said that it wa just like a class back at home . and becaus he wa alreadi paid by their parent they could n't get ride of him . anoth reason whi tour guid are so bore , and is much better to go in a group , is becaus they want you to see everyth . thheir is no time to waist . thi take charg of evryth , time to wake up , divis time , etc . iam not just say thi , i know about thi . my mom who ca n't go anywher without a tour guid alway hire one for owr trip , and leti me tell you , at taht time i wish i wa back at school , and iam not over react . i defenetli beliv that you should just travel with a group and forget the tour guid , i can ashor that you will learn us much and a great time , expect for tho peopl , like my mother , who ca n't go anywher without a tour guid , if she would expir just the group trvavel i bet she would swich . i know that i will never hire a tour guid to show me around with a group .
