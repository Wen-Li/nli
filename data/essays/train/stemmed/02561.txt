when youth of the past decad are compar with the current young peopl , a dramat result appear , which is that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun nowaday . in order make thi comparison , we have to examin how it wa in the past , and how it is now . most of the nation have young hero in their histori . to give an exampl from turkey , consid ataturk . he wa veri young , when he join the armi . he wa about 20 year old , when he decid to do someth in order to increas the overal live standard of hi own commun . ataturk is onli a singl exampl from the thousand of the young peopl of that time , who fight to death or thought about solut to the problem , which their commun are face . it is veri clear from the histor event that youth of that time had seriou concen about their commun . when we examin the young peopl of today , we come up with a whole differ pictur . again to give an exampl from turkey , i can say that there onli a few young peopl who are concern with the current problem in their commun . we see that , our young peopl can kill someon els becaus of a soccer team , or a girl . other than that date with someon is more import than the hunger of the commun for most of the young peopl of the current time . it is veri frustrat to admit that we are rather live in our own world , as individu , rather than live in the real world as commun . eventu , it is veri easi to say that the young peopl are not give enough time to help their commun . they are not concern with the problem of the societi and they do not tend to do anyth even the commun face a seriou threat .
