i total agre with the statement becaus not onli i find that memor fact is most of the time total useless , but i strongli believ that there is no use in learn if student can not appli the acquir inform in differ way . fact such as date , name , place , and definit are record in book , encyclopedia , newspap , and electron document . there is no point in spend time memor them , when we can have access to such data if we know how and where to find it . rather than have student memor the mean of a word , they should be taught how to look it up in a dictionari . instead of ask student to memor fact in a particulari histori passag , they should be present with such inform just to help them understand the background in which a histor moment took place . when student are given the opportun to transfer the idea and concept that are be taught into differ situat , particularli when those situat are close relat to the student 's realiti , the learn process `` set in '' . show them the relationship between speed , distanc , and time on the blackboard , and most of them will not be abl to understand it . but ask them what happen if they are late for their first class , and most of them will answer without ani hesit that they would drive faster . in my experi as a comput scienc teacher who teach program in a local high school , i 'd rather have my student tri to figur out how to solv a particular problem by understand what need to be done , than let them worri about the implement detail . thi approach is not easi for them at the begin : they want to know how all instruct in a particular languag are written , and they often feel frustrat when instead of give them the answer right away , i ask them to check the develop 's document . onc they understand that the languag detail are not import , becaus they can alway go and check how a particular instruct is written or can be use , they can focu on what is truli import in comput program : develop the skill that are need to solv ani given problem . the most reward comment i have had in these 12 year as a comput scienc teacher came from a student that is now in colleg studi a major in engin . i found him thi morn here , at the ibt test center , and he said : `` ms. cannon , thank you for teach me problem-solv . you ca n't imagin how i still use the strategi that you taught me in your class , even in subject that do not have anyth to do with engin .
