i use to think that have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject give peopl a widen point of view _that is to say a better one , as i thought_ on contemporari issu but i 've chang my mind . in fact , i realis for mani reason that have thi broad knowledg is unus to tackl real issu . to tackl an issu , you do have to have a broad knowledg , but a broad specif knowledg on thi subject . you inde need to have a veri precis and accur knowledg on thi issu to understand the other issu it rais and to point out the consequ . thi specif knowledg is in fact necessari to provid a seriou work , to challeng the societi and the govern for instanc and to give solut . research in econom polici is a good exampl : it need a veri accur knowledg in econom to tackl real issu such as unemploy and to tri to find solut to improv the situat . but we have to notic that thi need an interest in other academ subject and other issu in order to be awar of the complex of such an issu and of it consequ . let 's talk about unemploy , the economist ha to be awar of social consequ of unemploy becaus it is necesari to give good solut and improv the situat . to conclud , i want to underlin the import of a multi-academ subject learn dure the studi befor specialis , becaus the two of them are complementar .
