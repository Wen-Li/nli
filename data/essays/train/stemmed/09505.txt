i think that we should have broad knowledg of mani academ subject instead of special in one specif subject for mani reason like : peopl will know more about life and about who thing work , also , they will be more prepar to serv their societi better becaus they know more , final , they will help in develop thier societi becaus they are more educati . first , when we give peopl broad knowledg , they will know more inform then if we onli give them one specif subject to studi . they will be know a lot of inform which they need in their daili life but if you specifi your subject , there will be a lot of thing you dont know about or have not hear about . if peopl had broad knowledg , they will be mor prepar and will help and assist their societi . dure thier work time , gener iform which is gain through broad academ studi will help the worker a lot to do their job in a better way . unlik specif which will lead into a narrow stock of inform . when you train peopl and teach them about everyth , they will becom a great help in develop thier societi . there will be more thinker and inventor who can connect between larg sum of inform and that in it 's self will help societi to develop and will benefit futur gener . but if we onli studi one specif subject , peopl will not be as help as if they studi more and gain more knowledg . finalley , for those reason , i think we should give peopl a broad rang of academ subject ineast of special in one specif subject .
