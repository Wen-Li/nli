the human alway need to be educ to reach good life standard therefor learn is a veri import aspect of humanslif . everyon ha differ point of view about the idea of educ . some assum that it is more import for student to understnad the idea and concept , in contrari to those some think learn fact are more import . i person agre with the second idea . these are my follow reason ; firstli , learn by fact is perman . experi are good exampl for fact . for exampl , the one make an experi on the frog in the lab in order to see the system insid of it bodi , he wo n't forget what he ha seen for the year later . becaus it is realist and live . in addit to thi , learn fact make peopl feel confid . for instanc , the one is studi medicin if he studi just on the idea of the professor and the concept in latin it will not work , he need extra experi in order to be a good doctor . as he ha experienc the fact , he will gain self confid becaus he will have the control on the patienc . the last but not least , learn fact are easier than idea and concept . for exampl , the teacher will tell the student about a histor event , visit a museum will be more attract than read from a book . becaus when they visit the museum they will see the photo taken and the paint drawn in that year . photo and paint are the most help equip for the fact . the student will not onli enjoy the time in museum but also will learn easili . all in all , as i said befor learn fact is both perman and make peopl feel confid as well as it is easi . the long and the short of it is that , action speak louder than word .
