i agre with thi statement becaus i think that nowaday for the global market is more import to sell the product and take profit than control it . infact most advertis make product seem much better than they are . for instanc if we notic an advertis about a car , we may see that the advertis present the car how `` the best car you 'll never drive '' and thi caus that the constum want thi car . i think that thi sell method is wrong , becaus the advertis should repres the product for what it is and not for what it seem to be . in my opinion is a kind of manipul of the mind of the costum becaus the costum , on the basi of which the compani commun on the advertis , trust the compani that sell the product . on the other hand , costum should not complet trust on what is comun by the advertis becaus , as they should know , it is not the truth . howev , i think that the costum that watch an advertis should take the essenti infom on what is the product and do not take inform on the characterist of the product becaus most like they are wrong or not respect by the advertis .
