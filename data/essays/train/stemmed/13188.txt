`` innov is mother of success '' i strongli support the prompt that success peopl tri new thing rather than onli do what alreadi know how to do well . sure , success come to those who tri new thing . `` risk is anoth name of success . '' if one take risk to invest in a new bussi then two condit take birth . first one is that he will earn profit for himself which is posit aspect of the risk taken . but on the other hand there is equal probabl of hi failur which is a neg aspect . in my opinion , both of them ca n't be state as success . becaus what real success is to learn from failur and then again hit your target , but thi time with full prepar and time . then i am sure that the person will not loos again . thi impli that a person learn from hi failur . ye , i agre that , success come to those who tri new thing and with a proper plan . but it not onli tri new thing without even ponder over it . if a person take risk to gambl then it hi luck that will win one time or two but it not that he will win alway . it just wast maoney and abov all time . so risk should be taken in a right direct . it should not in vagu direct . let 's have an exampl of the great industrialist of india late dhirubhai ambani , founder of relianc group . in hi earli career he onli tri hi hand in textil and he succeed which encourag him to tri in other field too . he tri and got a victori over all the field he invest in . thi ca n't be state as luck rather it wa the risk taken by him and the plan which gave him the crown of victori . to conclud . i would state that it not tri new thing which gain you victori but the plan and hardwork along with risk . blend othi could make anybodi a `` winner '' . `` success is take risk at proper time with proper plan and hardwork .
