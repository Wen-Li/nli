we live in a world which is veri interest and contain plenti of knowledg . is n't fair to say which one is better for us , either in have broad knowledg of mani academ subject or be a special in one specif subject . i beleiv we should have knowledg of mani subject and be a special in ani one subject to which we feel that suit us . let us have exampl , as we are in our school we are taught to differ subject like mathemat , life scienc , social studi . as we grow up to univers level , we are given a chanc to choos what we are interest in like medicin , engin , busi administr , music , law etc . so i beleiv we should have enough knowledg in all aspect of life . if i beleiv in have broad knowledg of mani subject rather than be a special , then it is highli imposs for me to rememb the thing . for exampl a doctor ca n't be a lawyer becaus the medicin knowledg is endless where as the lawyer ha to rememb all the law and he ha to upgrad himself with chang in govern and in `` law and order '' . so a person cant be special in mani subject . let us say i beleiv in second point of be a special in one subject rather than have enough knowledg in variou subject . .. suppos i am secial in busi administr and if someon ask me about the busi i am abl to answer to all of their question and if one day someon ask me anyth irrelev to my subject of busi i may not be abl to answer the question . if we take an exampl of sport , we often have interest in mani sport but we love onli one sport . that whi an footbal comment can not do commentari in badminton becaus he may not be know of the rule correctli . learn the good thing as much as we can whether it may be from a scholar or from a small kid becaus learn never end .
