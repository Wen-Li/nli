21 centuri gener ha more oppurtin in everi aspect . they are more free than befor they are , they have more right : polit , the indivicu aspect more develop in thi gener in that situat can we say young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ? i disagre with thi statement becaus i think young are under influenc of the globalis . i think we cant say young peopl dont give enough time to help their commun sinc young peol are work for global problem like individu right of all peopl in the world , human right , enviroment problem or food suppli like in african countri so the the concept of their countri disappear and young peopl are think in a global viw point . anoth reason of my disagr is that young is firstli educ in their countri . later they are work in their countri about their collegu . thi the begin of their professinol life start in their home countri and then later , most of them start to work for the intern componi which are result of global economi . i mean you are firstli spend your all time in your countri and then tri to develop and improv the life standard of the all peopl of the world in ecomicali or social . peopl prefer to work for the worldwher is their home countri . in conclus , there is not concept of `` their countri '' ani more becaus peopl are awar of that they are citizen of the world and everyth they should do must be for all peopl in the world rather than for just their home countri . :
