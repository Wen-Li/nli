first of all , i total disagre with the follow statement . and the reason follow . one , by my person experi , travel by a tour guid is way more expens than by on own . becaus the travel compani which the guid is associ in alway suggest expens hotel with bad statu and flight . in that case we might not abl to chanc to stay in nice hotel with cheap price and have no season discount on flight either . for exampl , one of my friend went germani from korea with a flight cost more than $ 1000 through the travel compani , but i went same countri follow week , less than $ 850 with get season descount on my own . one more thing is that guid alway lead the travel onli to famou spot which are list on the itinieri . in that case you wo n't get chanc to visit some nice place that onli few peopl know . i onc had a chanc to stay on a nice old castl in franc . most of friend are jealou and are die to visit their after saw the pictur i took . two , travel in a group may be safe sometim . accord to the 8 year of person travel experi , most travel accid occur in a group travel . becaus when we travel in a group by a tour guid , peopl are alway crowd and they are usual pay attent to the guid . and that caus accid such as robberi . one of my roommat onc travel spain in a group with a tour guid and the guid said pay attent becaus they were pass the import spot the guid state . and he had paid attent . but while he were do so a stranger cut out hi camera . three , if we travel alon we get a chanc to make intern friend . i still keep in contact with them and when they visit my countri i guid them . final , travel in a gruop is not alway good in mani reason .
