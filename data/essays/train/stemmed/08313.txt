although the car market is a harsh busi as we can see from the crash of compani such as gener motor or rover , i do not agre with the statement say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that there are today for two main reason . first , the develop countri that are today the first custom for car are still develop new market with electr car or hybrid car and the car market is go realli well . moreov , western countri popul are veri attach to car sinc they allow peopl to be independ and go wherev , whenev they feel like it . in some coutri you can not imagin how it would be without car . in the unit state for exampl , peopl would not be abl to live properli sinc in most citi you can not do anyth without a car . and plublic transport system are not efficeint enough to make citizen to abandon their car for buse or subway . the second factor that make it imposs for the number of car to reduc in the next twenti year is alreadi in motion . countri which use to be underdevelop are now emerg and have a flourish economi . these coutri , like china or india are gener overpopul and as soon as these popul reach a decent leav standard they will get car . thi phenomenon is alreay happen in china where rod are be built everywher and peopl get car . with a popul of more than a billion person china will soon be the first custom for car and also the first produc . it is imposs that the number of car will be reduc in the next twnti year becaus there are mani other countri like india or china that are just wait for their turn to be develop . so basic it can not be said that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year sinc the market is do good in western countri and that a whole new market id develop in the newli develop countri .
