how can you judg or measur , if someon enjoy hi life or is happi . i think you ca n't generalis that young peopl enjoy their life more than old peopl . you al ca n't say wether rich or poor peopl are more happier . the first thought is mayb that young peopl like children or teenag could be enjoy their live more than older peopl do , becaus they do n't have to care about such a lot thing like their parent , like pay the bill , shop some food , go to work etc . it appear that young peopl have more free time , what give them the abil to do mani thing they like an enjoy . but in everi part of your life there are certain typic thing you worri about . for exampl a teenag ha to grow up , find out what type of human he is , what he like or dislik , make experi with the other gender . that can bring joy and pain . the most peopl look at their childhood and believ it wa a veri good time , but the most do n't want to make certain experi again . although in your later life you normal got more work to do and more thing to worri about you could enjoy thi special part of your life . one other thing whi older peopl could enyjoy their life less , is mayb that they do n't have famili and are alon . sure on the one hand it happen to old peopl that their friend die and they have no famili , but on the other hand there are so much exampl of old peopl , who are still marri and still have a lot of friend and famlili . in my opinion happy and joy can not be categoris by such thing like age , gender or the money you have . your life and everi part of it can bring you joy . everyon is respons for hi own joy , no matter how old he is . therefor i disagre with the statement .
