the process of learn chang through the educ of everybodi . at the begin , at kindergarden , you just learn process and how you can manag certain task , like cut out or paint a nice , cute pictur . later in pre-school and junior-high you have to learn fact to get a basic knowledg in all part , which are import in life and are of interest for your later develop . but the latest in high school , under ideal condit , everybodi should n't just learn fact and figur . just stuy number and note give you the opportun to have an answer readi to each question but that doe n't mean you are abl to explain what you have studi neither can you transfer your fact and figur to other interest field . i total agre with the statement , that idea and concept are much more import . they make you abl to gener what you know and learn interdisciplinari . an exampl would be , if you know about the polit system of europ and can contrast it with other polit system and have realli understood the concept you can easyli judg the monedari polit of countri and whi money and law can make a differ . thi just by ad your knowledg of math and government studi with your knowledg of law . with just know fact about the polit system and not have understood the process , thi combin and explain would not be easi to make . besid , by not just studi fact , you will be abl to adapt what you know much more easier to field and area you have n't heard of . i think , especi in colleg , thi is realli import . it help you connect everyth you see and learn and give you the abil to take part in complex discuss . from my own experinc , i know that thi overal problem is disscuss controverci . although some peopl might think is make more sens , have all the fact about a topic readi , i prefer be abl to explain everyth in my own word , becaus i have understood what i am talk about . thi usual goe to show if somebodi ask me to explain someth he ha n't understood . if i ca n't put it in my own word , me too , do n't realli have a clue of what i have studi . of cours , it take a lot more time and passion to read about a topic , but you can say you got the whole idea behind it and i strongli believ it 's worth it . by do so , i also keept that knowledg for a much longer time than the knowledg i have from learn fact . thi mean that i usual ferget those after take the test i have learn them for . versu the understand i have from figur out a topic by tri to get the idea and concept behind it . thi topic i usual keep for a long long time . all in all , the decis to just learn fact or the whole concept ha to be made by everi individu becaus it is also a matter of learn habit . i have decid and a rather studi idea than fact .
