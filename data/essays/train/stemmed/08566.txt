the issu at hand is whether broad knowledg on mani subject is bettar than special in one specif subject . the issu is import becaus special on a specif subject is a major aspect for student dure thier graduat and higher studi . in my opinion to special on a particular subject is much better than to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . firstli , if the student special on a specif subject , he will be focuss and concentr in hi field of studi . tri to have knowledg of all academ studi might overburden the student and it might leav him in disarray and in a choatic condit . sometim it may lead to seriou consequ of get veri low grade . furthermor a subject will have lot of topic relat to it . so a specializt on such a topic will give an entir knowledg of that subject to the student . he is definet go to master the entir subject . special on a particular topic will lead to research , as mani thing are yet to be unravel in thi world . if the student pay specif attent to the special subject in case of higher studi like post graduat , he may face new problem in that subject and result in research relat activ which is veri good . take for exampl if no one tri to pay particul attent on a specif field , there might have been no invent and discoveri by the scientist . if einstein had not paid specif attent to hi special subject of physic , there would have been no develop becaus all human creation of thi date are base on hi mani thoeri like three law of motion , theori of rel , quantum physic etc . final i want to conclud by support that special ona specif sunject is much better than have knowledg of mani academ subject . as the say goe `` jack of all trade master of none '' ; a student focuss on specif subject will be call a master of specif subject . so student should be advis right from their secondari school to pay particular attent on subject they are intrest in and go for higher studi .
