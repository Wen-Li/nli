i agre with that it is more inport for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . here are three reason to support my agreement . the first reason is that the idea is the most import one of everyth . onli you know the main idea about it , you can think about more detail and ask more question . furthermor , the concept are the main bodi of the lesson or someth like that . you should understand the concept and after that you can learn other inform . for exampl , if a student ca n't understand the idea and concept of the chapter at accout class , he doe n't know what thi chapter talk about . then , he gain noth on accout class . the worst thing is that he will fail the class . the second reason is that understand is more basic than learn . you can learn someth after your understand . for instanc , in order to learn how to read , you should to understand what doe read mean . it mean you should see the word in the paper and say them . therefor , you must gain the idea and concept of read . after understand those , you can learn other thing such as differ kind of read method and how to read . moreov , when peopl are talk about read , the first appear in your brain is the mean of read . it is the basic one . the third reason is that idea and concept are alway put in the front of the book such as outlin . you can know what is the author mainli mention about in the book becuas of the idea and concept . then , you can read the book from first page to the end and learn the detail and fact . gener speak , it is normal when you read book and learn them . on the whole , you ca n't learn the detail and fact without have known about the idea and concept . it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . sometim , it is enough for them to know idea and concept . there is no need to learn fact .
