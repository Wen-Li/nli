in my opinion , it is more imnport for a person to have as much extens knowledg of a varieti of academ subject as he or she can becaus of two good reason . firstli , it could be consid to him and other as hi bachkground knowledg and experi of life . secondli , some knowledg of everyth is prefer that one might someday be in need of the use of that type of knowledg , and employ it in hi or her own life . on the other hand , be epeci in onli one subject and forget about know a littl from and a littl from therer might make someon ignor when he or she is expos to situationm where he or she is requir to make a respons to a gener knowledg stimulu . one 's life is not limit onli to book and what he or she is special in . in my societi , when peopl gather at a parti or ani similar occas , they do not just sit there . they talk about ani topic that might interest their live or think . for exampl , dure my brother 's wed last week , peopl ha discuss the impact of terreorist peopl on tourism in the middl east . i wa person astonish to know from common peopl that the number of visit franc is doubl the number that visit the middl east everi year . what puzzl me more , is the sourc of the inform . anoth import issu here is that we should not limit our knowledg to book becaus what is ion book is mostli hypothet , and what we need in our life is some kind of knowledg that can be practic and benefiti . so , do we sometim need to use that gener knowledg we have ? the answer to thgi question might lie when ani of us face a problem and think of a solut . provid our knowledg is limit , we may not be abl to find a solut to that problem ; if the problem requir some knowledg of physic law , or some chemic background . we do not need to be special in one field and when we have a small problm ask for help . thu , our gener knowledg of differ subject definit help us to avoid everi day troubl or have suggest soultion to problem that need a specialist .
