i do not agre that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , becaus car are most use transport today , and it is not easi to creat brand new machin in twenti year , and nowaday there are more eco-car on the road , and car driver care about the natur recent . the use point of car are that there are mani road to drive and they are more than rollway or subway , and you can go close place to far place individuali . becaus of the good point , when you go your famili trip , the car make you more confort , and it is easi to make your own origin plan . i guess that it is easyier to make car easi to drive and confort spase than creat new machin . some peopl might say that drive is too rough and make them tire . howev technic skill are grow up day by day , it mat be not far futhur that you do not have to drive a car . some peol are consid the effort of car to enviro . they think it is good to use train and buss rahter than your own car . howev , the eco-car can slove the problem . nowaday , the use og eco-car are rise and consid about our natur . moreov , drive car will be easi and confort becaus of recent the high technic skill . from the past , the car are the most use machin for indivisu and also pubric . i do not think car use will not down , peopl still depend on their car . car will be still the most use transport in twenti year .
