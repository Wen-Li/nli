some peopl think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . howev , i disagre with the previou statement that the younger one enjoy life more than older peopl . there are sever reason for hold thi opinion . first , younger peopl are alway busi with their studi and schedul becaus of competit among them . thi hectic life might be painstak and arduou job for younger one when compar to the older one as they are settl and no tension are around them . they relax themselv play with their kid , garden , which sooth their mind . second , younger peopl need to go to their respect job for their serviv . but the old peopl alreadi struggl with their job , and earn suffici money for their rest of life . so , they do n't need to worri about job . as someon state that enjoy life is noth but do the thing which sooth our mind and bodi . for instanc , a retir polic offic may not enjoy hi / her younger day as he/sh is busi with hi / her duti as it is imposs to meet hi famili and friend . howev , after retir she/h can enjoy her/hi remain life . final , younger one do n't have matur intellig and the do n't know the import of enjoy life . they think that enjoy life is noth but have bad habit such as drink . but , the older peopl enjoy life with their famili and friend , which is the best . even the younger one do n't know how to enjoy life and the mean of their live . in sum up , i feel that older peopl enjoy their life than younger peopl do as they dont have much time , need to go to their job and they dont have matur intellig .
