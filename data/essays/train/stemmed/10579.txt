in my opinion , i admit that some peopl like to have broad knowledg than special one , but i rather like to have special knowledg of one specif subject . the primari reason of thi is that peopl should have good or bad at academ subject . i think it is wast of time to studi dislik subject which they know they will never ever use after the examin or graduat . in my case , i had to studi mathmat and scienc when i wa a first year at my highschool , but i hate them and the grade were veri bad . becaus of thi , at the tutori , my tutor recommend me to quit them and concentr on other subject , so i did and the decis wa veri good for me . i could use all my time for studi essenti subject for my futur and i have never regret of my decis ever . on the contrari , i have to admit that there are some good point for lern , ani academ subject . the biggest one is that we can think of someth from variou direct . thing sometim relat each other and lie on to variou subject , so broad knowledg could be veri use in some case . howev , i still believ that there are more good point in onli one special deep knowledg than sever shallow knowledg . the next reason for thi is that most of the peopl shoud choos one specif subject sooner or later , so i think it is sooner the better to concentr on the subject which they realli like . in addit , i think it is much easier to rememb or learn the thing which peopl are interest in than reluct to . from the reason abov , i believ special knowledg in one specif subject is better than broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
