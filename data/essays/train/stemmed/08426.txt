i definit agre with thi statement . mere learn fact without a real uderstand of it true mean is of no use in my opinion . one can have all the knowledg in the world but at the same time can be incap of put it to ani use . what use is all that knowleg if it ca n't bring about ani favour result ! to support by absolut agreement with thi statement i am go to tell u about an experi of mine that taught me about the relev of have a complet understand as to just know the term . when i wa in the 7th grade my parent migrat to the u.s. from india . till then i had onli been expos to the indian way of educ . out here in india we were taught that the onli thing that matter when it came to academ , wa how much of text have we been abl to mug up . it did not matter whether we actual understood it . the onli thing that count wa whether we were abl to reproduc it while be test for it . inevit , all the data that wa memoris wa instantli forgotten on the complet of the test . initi when i start studi in the u.s. , the indian method of educ work as a hindranc in be abl to adapt to the american style of learn . in america educ meant lean the understand of idea and concept . with the right understand one would be capabl of access inform relat to a particular topic . a simpl action of access innform pose itself as a huge task for me . as i had been use to onli reproduc without have ani understand of thing , i wa complet handicap and did n't know where to begin from . it wa thi lesson that taught me the necess of comprehend thing over mere memoris . one is better of comprehend less matter as compar to have a whole lot of fact stack up , which one is incap of put to use . do n't get me wrong here . i do not mean to condemn my countri 's method of educ . what i 'm tri to say here is that , my countri should cultiv thi statement of `` it is import for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact '' into it academ .
