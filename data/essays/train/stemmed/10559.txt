car have caus mani problem to the societi , such as pollut , some have been resolv , other not : for the pollut special equipemet have been invent to reduc it , but peopl want more will car evolut be enought to make them surviv ? car are caus a lot of problem : pollut as i mention , but also cost requir for their functionn ( rise price of oil ) , nois they make and perturb they caus in traffic of big citi . to these issu car-mak are offer sever evolut , but it is not enought : mani brand of car have recent be in great financi troubl . gener motor or ford are exempl in the unit state : they had to reduc their product and have made big chang in their direct . they also lost mani point in bours cotat , and had to fire mani peopl . in franc the same problem of lose of competit ha appear recent : brand like renault or peugot have lost more than 10 % of their market part last month . thi is go to lead to main restructur in the next few month . for these reason car do not have a bright futur , and a reduct of their number can be predict in a few year . altought all of these elemet tend to confirm the car decreas , i think that car have not alreadi done their time , or at least the new gener of car . to my mind car brand have mani resourc , everi sector ha been in difficulti in a period of time . they are invent a new gener of car which is go to revolution the world of car : new car are go to work without petrol , but with more clean materi . for thi reason they are adapt to new mental of save environ . these car will make less nois , and will be more adapt to an urban life . also all brand are not go bad : brand from asia as nissan or toyota are grow up in the unit state and in europ : they may remplac local brand . to conclud , in my opinion even if tradit car may dissapear in a few year , they will be remplac by new car and the number of them is not in significantli go to decreas . so we will be confront to an evolut .
