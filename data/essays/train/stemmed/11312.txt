nowaday , the quantiti of car is increas veri fast , but car need petroleum and thi resourc is decreas fast too . for these reason , we should ask ourselv if it will be possibl to continu use car in the futur . in my opinion , in twenti year there will be more car than today , but the import differ will be that those car will be more ecolog or they will use anoth resourc than petroleum . firstli , it is not sostin to keep the actual consum of petroleum for mani year , so there will be a moment when we will have to find anoth energi sourc for car . at the same time , new technolog are improv theirselv everyday , so in few year it will be possibl to find a good altern for petroleum and to invent new machin much more ecolog . thi mean that the fact that petroleum will finish doe not mean that car will finish . futhermor , everyday car are more necessari for peopl . that is becaus , in modern societi , peopl need to move much more than befor . for exampl , mani time some famili have their home far away from their job or the educ center , so they need to drive a car to go to the workplac , to bring the kid to the school or to go shop . final , we have to know that mani undevelop countri , where now there are not mani car , are develop their economi and in the next year they will demand more car for their popul . for these reason , i think that in futur , the quantiti of car will continu increas , although , with the new technolog , car will be ecolog .
