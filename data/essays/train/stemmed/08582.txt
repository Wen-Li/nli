at my way of think i disagre with the statement becaus if you are go to sell a product you must show the peopl the real product not show someth better for onli win money becaus later pass a few month they are go to see that the product is not the same that the product shown in public . my opinion is that if you are go to by a product becaus you saw it on the televis you might be sure that is the same product becaus later you are go to know that it is not the same and you are pay someth that you dont want and that is a wast of money . i know what it feel that becaus when i wa 15 year old i went with my mother to a mall from peru to buy a perfum that it wa veri expens , so we think that if the perfum wa expens it wa go to be a good product , so we didnt open and seeif it wa good . four month later we found that it wasnt smell good so my mother knew that she wa cheat . the next day we went to the store and say the saller that the perfum wasnt good and the boss told us that the seller who gave us the perfum wa a bad person so the next day they the boss fire him and we reciv a new perfum and that wa ok . but in the other hand the peopl who do the market they put the product better than the origin , so thay can impress the peopl and they can sell more product but that can bring you bad consecu becasu then they are go to buy the product and they are go to know that the product you are sell is not the same of the market and that person is go to be a cheater for all hi life . other point of view is that when you are in the store and you are aceppt someth you must cheak it out in case that it is wrong . the import thing is that if you like a perfum you can buy it but make sure that it the good one . in conclut what im say is that all the product you have to be careful what are you go to buy and tri not to go onli for a nice product .
