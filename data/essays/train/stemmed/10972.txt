there is a say in my languag that goe like : ` if onli the young could know and the old could do ' . thi explain an import lesson , but one ha to attain a certain degre of wisdom to understand it . in my opinion be young is more enjoy , be older may make somebodi more experienc but it would not make hi life less bore . while you 're young your mind is fresh , open for idea and futur is full of possibilti . excit is more prefer than the regret which inevit come with the old age and even feel of fullfil ca n't beat the hapi you feel when you 're upon a new discoveri . just rememb your greatest triumph . would you feel the same after ten year pass ? nobodi can deni that have an energet , heathi bodi is better than be frail , depend on medicin or on someon . you ca n't tri parachut jump if you 're past 60 . doctor would n't allow it . even the eat would n't be the same with lot of constraint . it 's alway easier to meet and get on well with new peopl as a young person . peopl accept and trust each other easili . it 's simpl to find common ground when you 're young . older peopl tend to be more rigid in their view . trait and idea begin to turn to stone . after a certain age it becom imposs to chang them . let 's face it ; peopl do n't get wiser when they get old . they onli get old , both in mind and the bodi . it 's becom harder and harder to deal with them so unfortunatli some famili even consid to send them away .
