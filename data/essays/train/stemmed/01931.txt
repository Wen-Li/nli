like we have learn from the book entitl `` the end of histori '' , in wich the author held the thesi that after the fall of berlin wall the histori had come to an end , tri to make forecast on such a long period as 20 year is veri danger , but i feel fair comfort with say that such a diffus mean of transport as the car will not disappear in two decad , and even that the number of car will actual increas . the car is the engin of modern economi , becaus it allow fast travel , which in turn mean that peopl with the right knowledg or skill can be quickli and easili collect in the place where they are need , thu render easi both to use their exist knowledg and to build new . i am think about worker commut to their job place or professor reach univers by car . public transport ha prove inabl to be a full substitut of car in thi role , and as new econom power like china and india emerg from poverti they will develop their car popul as rich countri have alreadi done , and thi process will take more than 20 year , in my opinion , so that the number of car will keep increas over thi period . of cours my analisi can not forese an eventu tecnolog revolut that could render the car useless , like the car ha done with hors in the twentieth centuri , or a major econom breakdown which would render car too expens to be use , but such trend break event are unpredict . if the actual trend of the world will hold , it can be assert that it will take more than twenti year for the number of car to start decreas , if it will ever do so .
