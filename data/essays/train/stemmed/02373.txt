i think it is necessari to defin the term car concern thi question , it can either be the car as we know it today , a vehicl use a larg amount of a non renew ressourc , or it can be the same thing , just differ , differ in shape and size , but mostli in the type of energi it will use . i disagre with the statement becaus i am of the opinion , that as soon as petrol get too expens for the averag driver of a convent car , the possibl of altern car dese and engin , will soon be much more attract and new custom for new idea will be found by then . i think peopl will call those vehicl car as well and there will be a larg amount of those new vehicl . probabl we will have more car than ever befor , becaus onc the big car compani think they can make money with car run on altern fuel or engin , they will tri as hard as they can to be as competet and influenci as they are now . thi influnc can lead to larg substiti and tax advantag in the begin of the rise of those new car , that will make the process veri fast if it ha startet . some might say that there will be an increas in the use of public transport system , that is true , but onli in big citi where car are not as import as they are outsid urban area . human be are creatur with habit , one habit is drive car , have the conveni of independ . i do n't think that it is possibl to take car away totali , not even partli , there can onli be more , becaus that is the way almost all our societi work , base on growth and develop , there wo n't be ani step backward , there will be chang in the way we drive , but human will drive becaus we are use to it .
