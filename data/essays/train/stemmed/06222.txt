i can say i do agre with the statement becaus the whole industri of advertis ha been construct on the use of psycholog trick that can work to perasuad averag peopl , or more like some target of peopl , to buy a certain product . the characterist describ in tv advertis have often been exager becaus peopl have to be impress in first place to rememb the name of a product , recogn it in the shop and then buy it . fact is , that peopl can effect realiz how good a product is onli onc they have tri it , but thi way the aim of the advertis campaign ha alreadi been reach . now , what are the strategi peopl can develop to defend themselv from thi sort of manipul ? first , they can tri to get suggest from peopl they know and trust , such as rel of friend , about a specif product they are will to buy . second , they can take advantag of the larg number of offer dealer make when they have to launch a new product on the market : thi way they can tri someth new without spend too much money on it . third , peopl can alway count on some associ , which have been specif creat to defend custom from manipul of compani ' advertis . these are often no profit organ which are give to give suggest and assist when peopl need it , make sure that the claus `` satisfi or refund '' is respect . in conclus i would like to recommend peopl to alway think twice befor buy someth which look too good , becaus , as far as everybodi know , good brand never need advertis simpli becaus their name is alway on everyon 's mouth .
