accord to me success peopl tri new thing and take risk . if someon want to be good at anyth , he ha to do someth origin . origin thing take attent and peopl care about them for instanc , let 's assum a group of student work on synthes a chemic compound that can be use as a drug for cancer . everi student work on the synthesi without ask or question whether thi compound is experienc befor or analyz in a laboratori . in thi case , if a student want to analyz , thi will differ him from the other . thi one ask the work and think the consequ of thi synthesi and also question whther it will be use practic . the compound can not be use becaus of it structur or may not have the special to be use as a drug . in spite of the fact that , question either the situat in which peopl are or the work which peopl do , provid some one to improv himself . as in thi exampl , the student who want to analys , besid synthesi , may learn about the analyz method . thi a simpl purpos for improv himself . from anoth aspect , everon can not take risk easili . gener peopl are afraid of the consequens . but on the other hand , by evalu the advantag or disadvantag of a new way ( a new rout to synthesi for instanc ) or a differ solut to a problem , may result suffici . so tri anoth synthesi rout may have risk . due to the fact that , the chemic are difficult and danger to deal with , chemic reaction shoul be consid veri care . but with a good research a student can chang the way of synthesi . final , peopl have risk all the time in life . to be succes , peopl should take risk with cryticis everi aspect . in addit to that , question lead to learn more . in today 's world , the more knowledg , the more success . competit in everi area forc peopl to take risk and to improv themselv to surviv . in order to live in better condit , peopl should tri new thing . unless they ` regener ' themselv , life can not be a place to live , to surviv .
