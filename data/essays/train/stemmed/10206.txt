there are sever way of travel to mani differ kind of destin . peopl could travel in group lead by tour guid , by themselv , with a partner . i believ that the best way to travel vary complet on the destin of the trip . if a american doe not know how to speak japaness is take a trip to japan , it would not be advis for him to go by himself . in that situat i would much rather prefer to travel in a group with a tour guid who obvious speak japaness . anoth case scenario would be an american person travel to hawaii were it languaj is spoken . of cours it would not hurt to have a tour guid who know the place to show thi person around but if the purpos of the trip is head to the beach to relax and enjoy , no tour guid should be necessari . i would travel with someon other than a tour guid . in conclus , i do not fulli desagre with the statement nor fulli agre with it . i firmli believ that the best way to travel depend on the destin and the circumst of the trip .
