the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid is veri veri fun . first you just start from the bigginig befor you tarvel , go shope with a big group of friend . you buy a bunch of stuff for your trip , and at the same time your just have fun with your friend . in just buy stuff , then while your at the airplan you talk , take pictur from the plane with your friend too ! then when you get to the place , let say pari , you want to go there becaus you and your friend decid to go and becaus your go to have a lot of fun . then when you are there you start with you tour guid that is veri bor , obvious you have to learn a littl about the countri your visit ok , ill handl that but not everi day , and then go visit all kind of museum . after all that crowd day at night we go ut with my friend in group , that the big deal here go to have fun with all your friend togeath , becaus your with peopl that know waht you like or do not like , and becaus it a veri special trip for you in a big happi group . about a tour guid wasnt that fun becaus he like your boss well not like your boss serious he just tell you what we have to do all day and what we need to visit . i could do that all that stuff but in a calm day with my friend . but i can handl all what the tour guid tell us to do while im with all my friend have fun , and it just becaus im with my friend , to see how fun it is to be with a veri big group you know well and can have a great time .
