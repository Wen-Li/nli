i agre that travel in a group led by a tour guid is benefici in a number of way but with a few reserv on group travel . i would explain my reason in the follow paragraph . firstli , tour guid is a profession who know alot of place , thier histori and how to reach the place , where to stay , what food to eat etc . , . also tour guid is profici in the nativ languag of the place . these two advantag overwiegh ani other disadvantag of travel . secondli , travel in a group led by a tour guid will be cost effect as more peopl will share the travel expens . tour guid will explain the histori of the place visit which we can not know unless we do some homework on what place to visit and read through it histori which we often donot do . travel in a group will help to build new partnership with fellow travel in the group which can not be done if travel indivdiu . thirdli , travel in a group with a guid help us to avoid problem with nativ languag speaker and also fishi shop trick by nativ speaker . also as a group , more number of place can be tour with same amount of money if spent on individu travel . but , there are a few disadvantag for group travel led by a guid . limit knowledg of the tour guid will make us to tour fewer place which tour guid is familiar with . co-ordin effort among the group of peopl with differ mindset is difficult . privaci dure travel will be be voilat dure group travel . travel individu allow the individu to see place of his/her interest rather than constrain by the group travel . in conclus , group travel is advantag in most of the scenario in mani term but it depend on the individu prefer and his/her fnancial limit .
