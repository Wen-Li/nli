the issu at hand is whether student are suppos to know idea and concept or to know onli fact . even though some peopl consid memor fact is more import , i agre with the statement , which mean that understand idea and concept are more import . first , i would like to discuss it by use specif academ subject . for physic , some teacher think that student should learn onli formula , ie fact , not basic concept . last year i had a teacher who beliv in thi way and i wa miser confus . as the formula of physic seem to be ident , i could not figur out what formula i wa requir to use in the exam . as a result , my grade wa terribl . howev , thi year , my teacher ha taught me the fundament concept of physic and how each formula came form . thi time , i could handl formula and succeed in the exam . from thi reason , i strongli believ that understand idea is extrem promin and vital . furthermor , it is essenti to learn concept becaus lean and memor fact are just pain . in my opinion , to learn someth is to deepen one 's knowledg by have fun . if peopl are encourag to memor fact and not to learn basic idea , they will like to dislik studi . on the other hand , if they are suppos to learn concept , they will be abl to know the way a thing is and realiz how much learn can be fun . for instanc , learn histroic fact are bore . nevertheless , understand whi the event happen is a realli attract method to approach histori . in other word , memor what happend dure the world war ii is not fun , but understand whi thi happen is extrem interest . in thi manner , understand idea and concept is suit to my opinion .
