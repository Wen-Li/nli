i do n't agre with thi statement . of cours you need a littl of broad knowledg , especi to be abl to talk and understand when you speak with peopl that are special on other field , but you need to be special in one specif subject to do well your work , becaus you need to know that realli well , and it 's imposs to be special about everyth . also if you know just a specif subject there is realli a lot to know . for exampl , i am a psychologist and there are a lot of field i could work , like development , clinic , health , evalu and other . but everyon of thi need a lot of theori and model to know and a lot of experi to do , that take year to be realli prepar in just one of these subject . but after all the train if someon ha a problem about what you have special you can be sure that you can give him the best support , that you can help him in the best way becaus you know what you are talk about . instead if you just know a littl about everyth you ca n't be realli help but you can just tell to the peopl where go , usual a special centr , to have all the inform they need [ that is do counsel ] . after my degre i work three year in a depart of neuropsycholog and until now i ca n't say that i know that subject becaus it 's realli wide , so when someon ha a neuropsycholog problem need to talk with anoth one that did a lot of year stude and work in that field , that know all the acquir brain patholog and all the test to do the right diagnosi and that know also about the rehabilit , and that is abl to explain to the rel what is go on . of cours i do n't want to say that you have to know just about one subject , but that you have to be special about one subject and know , i.e. in a less specif way , about mani .
