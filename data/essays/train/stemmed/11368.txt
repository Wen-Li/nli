some peopl believ that the product in advertis are the same as the real one becaus it look like the real one . howev , i do not agre with it . i believ most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are becaus of well-taken pictur and the stratagi of commpani . first of all , well-taken pictur are veri attract . the purpos of advertis is to show the product well to peopl . for perfom that purpos , the product in advertis should be a good shape . a freind of mine , he is work in advertis compani in korea . one day , he show me two pictur of appl . one wa just regular pictur and the other one wa the pictur that he ad some color balanc with photoshop . two pictur wa total differ from each other , and he said that hi compani will use the latter pictur for the appl advertis . for thi reason , i believ that the good in advertis is better shape than the real one . moreev , advertis should make peopl to want the product , and that is the stratagi of advertis . for let peopl buy the good , the advertis have to use ani way to attract peopl even they exagger . one day , i saw the advertis of kim-chi , korean tradit food , on televis shop . the seller wa eat it and it look like realli realli delici . i could not wait to buy it and final i orderd it . howev , as soon as i god it , it wa not that delici than i expect . for these reason , i strongli agre with the idea of that most advertis make good seem much better that they realli are . becaus well-taken pictur and the purpos of advertis are most import factor of that peopl choos the product .
