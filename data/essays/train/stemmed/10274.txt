i agre with the opinion that in these time younger peopl are more like to spend their time with other thing than in spend it in help their commun becaus of the follow reason . first , the contin advanc of technolog over the last coupl of year ha creat a complet new world of media and arcad possibl . young peopl are influenc from all side with comput game , variou tv program and the internet . so they invest their time in these thing instead of do benefici work for their commun . second , and thi point relat in some part from the first point , the avail and the access to thi variou kind of entertain tool nowaday prevent young peopl from concentr on their school or studi which somewhat is also a negativ aspect on their commun , becaus when a commun ha n't a lot of educ young peopl , it will appear that these commun will look underdevelop when compar them with other commun . on the other hand young peopl that are not interest in school or in good educ tend to be uninterest in their commun aswel . so in paragraph one and two we consid onli those young peopl that are somehow affect in a bad way from thing that promis amus and therefor leav their respons behind . if we consid young peopl that are veri encourag and challeng student of school or univers i feel that it can also appear that some of these student are too overwhelm with their studi and would more like tri to achiev a good educ goal than invest their time in their commun which obvious and on the short-term would n't affect them and from which they have hardli ani benefit ( so do they think ) . in today 's world ( young ) peopl are get more and more selfish and do n't see ani sens in help someon or someth without get ani benefit for themself from it . sum the mention point up , nowaday it is not so unusu that young peopl are not interest in help their commun becaus of the immens influenc of media and technolog and the increas respons that student have and the selfish that tend to appear in our today 's anonym and cold societi .
