there have alway been argument or complain about the behaviour of young gener among the older gener , it is an histor attitud of human in all period of time . so the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun look like a clich and i do not agre with it . there are some reason for my argument . first , the statement seem to me like a clich becaus when my mother is make such kind of complain , she say that her mother wa also make similar complain to her . furthermor i have read an articl about thi topic and it is state that in the write of ancient civil there were complain about younger gener . what i mean that , the reason of such statement is the fight between gener . second , we have to look at what doe it mean help commun ? i thing it depend on the time . for exampl , in the time of second world war , work in a hospit as a volunt meant help commun . from anoth perspect , children of a farmer can help their father in field so they may at the same time be help for the comun . howev , for the time be , young peopl are abl to contribut their societi throug sit befor the comput for hour . the activ ha chang by the time by it ha alway been the young gener who come up with the new idea that lead to develop . as a result , we are live in a global world the most import aspect of which is inform revolut . qualiti of work in mani area depend on brain forc not on the muscl forc . peopl can work in their home with their person comput and achiev much more thing then befor in a short time . by the same token , young peopl are also follow these develop . they learn mani realiti of the world and develop idea for their solut by searc in internet in a veri short time . it is not necessari ani more to particip some kind of social respons clup , be awar of realiti of world and develop an attitud . there is short way of do everyth includ help societi .
