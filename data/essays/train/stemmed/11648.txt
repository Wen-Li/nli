i agre with the statement given . becaus it is import to teach the student to underst what they are be tough . there is an old chiness say that ; if you want to save somebodi from hi or her hunger , you have to teach him or her to how to hunt instead of give him or her ; a fish to feed with . if a student or a child doe not underst the idea or the concept that are be tough to them they will simpli memor the subject but not learn from it . some school system or train program are build on the student or the attend to memor what is be given to them which doe kill their imagin and doe not prepar them to life . for exampl cous and effect can be tough to a student in a scienc class and most of the childeren if not interest specificlli will not enjoy the scienc class as a social scienc student i hate it . if a child doe not underst the reason of a cous and effect situat she or he will not use it to understand peopl reaction about her or hi action . if a scienc teacher teach you the cous and effect princip via give you exampl of your ordinari life , exampl of what you do dailli action you will understand what you learn . if not just make it an experi in a lab class you wont rememb it until the examin time and after that never . when you memor someth it is a great risk fort you to forget it . and it will happen becaus our brain are like comput . as we do to make our comput when it is full wiht inform and becasu of that it speed slow and doe not work more effect . we must delet some old inform to get new one . and the first inform it will delet will be the one you do not rememb or do not understand whi it happen , the one it is put in without ani mean . if teacher and parent are the one that shape our person and futur they must be veri careful to teach the young mind with a great hunger how to fish not to give us a fish just for onc .
