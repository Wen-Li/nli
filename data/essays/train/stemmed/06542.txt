most student think that it is more import for them to understand idea and concept in order to allow them to use them again in their futur life . on the other hand , other think that it is more import for them to learn fact becaus histori is made of fact , and fact are the result of the use of such idea or concept . howev , in the final analysi , i believ that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , the fact to understand idea and concept is the most import requir that teacher ask their student to do . for exampl , after a class , everi student will have taken note on the main fact of the lectur and would be abl to learn them back home ; but onli a few could say that they understood all the idea and concept of the lectur . moreov , there is a differ between understand and learn . if almost everybodi is abl to learn some fact , such as date , everybodi is not abl to understand idea and concept , and replac them in a context or appli in other case and situat . last but not least , peopl that have understood idea and concept have the possibl to appli them . if we consid that fact are the result or the consequ of the involv of someon 's idea , you can deduc that the most import is to rememb the way to achiev thi result . to conclud , i am firmli convic that the most import for student is to learn how to think through the understand of idea and concept rather than learn
