sinc differ peopl have differ life activ and style , it is realli difficult to gener if youg peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do . howev , from my experi , i think that older peopl enjoy life more than ypung poepl do . first of all , mani young peopl do n't have freedom while the older do . for instanc , they have to belong to school to ged educ , and they have to studi serious everi day as long as they want to get a blight futur which is essenti to get a good salari job and famili . to studi is one of the most stress activ they experi . on the other hand , it is more like for the older to forcu their live on what they realli want to do such as hike and travel . for instanc , i am a colleg student so that i do not have time to spend for my hobbi such as rockclimb and swime in the semest . and i envi older peopl who enjoy ride a bike . secondli , teenag tend to have difficulti to establish a good relationship with other and have other seriou distress such as famili probrem . thi actual make mani of them commit suisid . young peopl tend to depend on their parent so that they do n't have ani abil to chang their live . as a consequ , it is more difficult for younger peopl to have time to enjoy their live . final , young peopl do n't have good econom or finaci establsi so that they tend to have money problem while older peopl do . to have joy time , money is essenc . if you do n't have enough money , i connot enjoy you life . therefor , older peopl have more time to enjoy life . each peason ha differ life in differ age so that it is not possilbl to detrermin whether young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do . howev , again , older peopl have more opportun to have time to enjoy their live , accord to my experi .
