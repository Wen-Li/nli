in my environ i can find a lot of exampl of young poepl help their commun . exampl like scout organ or similar one show clearli that youg peopl nowaday give enough time to help other peopl . that is whi i do not agre with the statement . first and foremost , think of all thi organis like scout or christian yough movement . in each countri you can find thi kind of organis . they all have the same goal . they want to make young peopl more involv in the commun and more over , teach them how to becom a respons adult . in my countri thi kind of group are veri popular and they have a lot of activ member . i also use to be a member of such an organis . that is whi i can say that they do a lot for their commun . for exampl , they help parent to guard their children if they do n't have enough time , they collect money for carit organist . all member of such a group give sure a lot of time to help their commun . by the same token , i would like to say that you can also find young poepl involv in individu action . let 's take for an exampl young peopl who go shope for older poepl . they also help immediatli their surround . other go to help older citisen in clean their hous , or do their garden work . all thi are nice exampl of young person give time to help their commun . of cours you will alway find some young , respectless , and egoist young poepl who just want to make profit and to enjoy life . but thi is noth new . thi kind of poepl have alway exict and of cours exist also nowaday . but they are not the major . not where i live . to sum up briefli , i realli do n't think young poepl do n't care about their commun and do n't give enough time to help them . i realli think it is like it alway use to be , some poepl care and other do n't , but the major is involv in social life and give enough time to help their commun .
