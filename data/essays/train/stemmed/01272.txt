i most certainli agre with thi statement . as a music teacher myself , of cours i want my student to learn their fact , but it is more import for them to understand it . i believ that a student should be abl to understand what they just learn becaus that is whi we learn in school . we go to school to learn and understand the materi to appli it to our live . if a student did not understand someth , then they are not go to be abl to use it in life . the best way of know what they have been taught is ask them to use it . if they can not use what they had learn , then that mean they do not understand that certain topic . it is absolut pointless for a student to go to class and just memor fact . to understand someth mean you can use it , teach it to someon , and be abl to go further than just '' memor '' the fact . to me , in order for ani student to excel is for them to be abl to use what they know . i am not say that learn fact are not import for a student , but sometim there is no point in teach that topic to the student if it mean they do n't know what just happen . a student can walk in a class and ` learn the fact ' , but that student will come back out with onli fact . for exampl , there is a math student who just learn all the number of a problem . sure , he know all the number , but how in the world the number got to where they are is a complet differ matter for the student . that is whi teacher today take time to pull thing apart and explain them in detail . thi situat can happen in ani class . poetri can be read and the student can read it and learn the vocabulari to onli read a poem . although to go through the detail of the poem would be much more effect in a student 's literatur skill . i do not agre that fact is all we should learn about in life . there is much more to learn than just fact and statist . be abl to truli understand what wa taught is the same as say , `` okay , i know how to use it now and it definit make more sens than just memor note .
