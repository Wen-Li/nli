i neither complet agre nor disagre with the statement that that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it might be depend on variou factor . advanc in research work relat to automobli technolog and develop of an altern synthet fuel could have a bear on thi , apart from other . there is a wide spread concern over the environment problem caus due to the automobil . that 's whi it ha been said that noth can make the world come to a common platform than environment problem as they are global in natur . so , much of the present research is on develop pollution-fre vehicl and also on develop a synthet fuel . certain phenomenon like adsorpt of liquifi hydrogen ga on a suitabl adsorb can becom a solut for thi . thi usual mean the fuel , the adsorb and other equip need to be carri along with the vehicl which usual requir some addit space . due to obviou reason that much space can not be be devot to fuel in two-wheel but can be done in car . so assum that research work bear fruit in anoth ten year or so we can say that it trigger an increas in the number of car and decreas in the number of two-wheel . but if the research mention in the abov paragraph is not fruit , it might actual trigger a chang in the opposit direct i.e , a decreas in the number of car . there are alreadi problem relat to traffic in mani place and there is no deni of the fact that each year mani new vehicl hit the road . the road can not be expand for ever to tackl thi increas in the number of vehicl . peopl might then be forc to resort to two-wheel as they requir less amount of space . also some other factor may play a promin role like increas in the averag incom of the peopl . thi mean that they would go for car becaus of luxuri and other reason . improv in particular technolog relat to car and other vehicl which determin their price might also play an import role . so onli time will tell what actual happen .
