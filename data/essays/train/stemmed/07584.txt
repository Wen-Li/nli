young peopl live their live mainli for their futur that is still more than half of their live span , while older peopl live for the day they die . so older peopl tend to enjoy their live more than young peopl do becaus young peopl are alway livng their present for the futur , which can not be enjoy their live , but onli work hard enough to be happi when they are old . but old peopl have onli shor period of life span left and have less futur than the young peopl which let them enjoy their live rather than work hard for their shortly-left futur . compar a student and a old professor in colleg , the student is not enjoy their life , unless he or she ha no futur . the student is tri hi best to learn as much as he can about hi career that he want to do in the futur . howev the old professor just watch him struggl sometim and help them , then watch the student be happi after achiev what the student ha want . the professor ha been what he had been want forev when he wa young and now enjoy hi life help hi student who is not enjoy hi life yet , but eventu will . they do n't have to plan their life ani more , all they need to do is just help the student or just have break read the book they want to read and prepar for the lectur , which is fun for the professor becaus it 's what they want to do for life . it appli not onli for the professor but also with all the other peopl who ha a profession job . old peopl tend to enjoy their live more than younger peopl becaus they have done what they have plan when they were young and now they just need to relax and spend the rest of shortly-left futur with what they have achiev . younger peopl could seem to be enjoy their live in a lot of way like parti , but that is not the real enjoy , becaus they are worri about their futur in the corner of their mind , while te older peopl are realli enjoy their live without worri about their futur even though the way they enjoy live could not be as crazi as the young peopl do .
