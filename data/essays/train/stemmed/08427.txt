in my opinion , is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject instead of a special in one of them . i say thi becaus i think that is the best solut in order to find a work in today 's societi , where compani are contin on chang and requir a huge flexibl and adapt for the new work . accord to thi , school must provid to give a basic instruct , teach mani differ subject . in thi way , each student will have a quit complet background in the fileld he choos . i think that also special is import for work , of cours , becaus it impli that a person is realli good on do someth specif . but i also think that an high level of special could be reach onli with year and year of studi and work , and school ca n't give thi opportun to everybodi . an exampl : i studi design , but lot of kind of design . interior design , virtual design , graphic design and much more . but what i realli like to do is web design . so , school give me first the opportun to learn about differ tipe of design and , second , to understand which is the best for me . after the school i can special myself in web design by work , becaus i have a basic prepar that school gave me , and , in the same time , the other student in my class could choos anoth special , accord to their prefer . thi model of teach subject give lot of advantag , becaus it is n't neither rigid nor bore . it give anyon the possibl to choos , without creat limit . academ subject are onli the start up of the student 's work life , that he can and must develop in hi career . but at the same time they are veri import , becaus allow the student the opportun to understand what he realli like to do in hi futur .
