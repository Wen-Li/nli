i agre that young peopl do not give time to help their commun . recent , the world becam veri busi and the societi chang drastic compar to 50 year ago . there are two main reason which prevent young peopl from help their commun . first of all , young peopl becom veri busi , they can not spend enough time in their commun . for exampl , nowaday , young peopl go to not onli school for studi but also privat school . around 75 % of junuior high school and high school student in tokyo , japan go to privat school twice a week till night . in thi situat , it is veri difficult for student and young peopl to spare the time in their commun . moreov , young peopl 's life ha been chang . they play with their friend in the citi not onli in their commun . the citi ha been develop , and there are mani entertain , such as movi , internet cafe , and shop build . thi attract young peopl so much and let them spend most of thier free time in the citi . thu young peopl never come back to their communicti . second of all , the commun itself ha been chang . nobodi in the commun doe not care local activ ani more . 50 year ago , there were alot of local event and meet in the commun in even tokyo area . one of the reason of thi is alot of peopl are move in and out in tokyo becaus of their studi and work , and peopl do not settl down . thu nobodi will take care of local activ . on the otherhand , young peopl in the suburb tend to move out to big citi for studi and work and come back sever year later , and natur , they can not join or help their commun . as a conclus , i support that young peopl theseday do n't give enough time to help their commun becaus of luck of time and chang of commun .
