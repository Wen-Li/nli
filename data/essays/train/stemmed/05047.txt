first of all i do n't agre with thi argument becaus think there will be more peopl on thi planet and peopl need transport . but what i do believ is that there will be fewer car that need petrol for their motor . i think that we will run out of oil sooner or later becaus there is limit oil on the earth and at the moment we are wast the oil we still have . thi will be the main reason whi there will have to be other motor in car . anoth argument whi the use of oil is go to decreas is that peopl start to realis what impact all the pollut of the air ha on our planet . the pollut result manli from burn oil and a lot of oil is burnt in motor of car . the pollut of the air caus climat chang and natur catastrophi that allreadi effect peopl im an amount that make them chang their think toward a more environment think . the car industri is one of the most powerful industri in our world and they wo n't just give up their posit . therfor there is allreadi a lot of research bee done to find altern to oil as the energi sourc for motor of car . altern would be motor that run with hydrogen or motor power by batteri that can be recharch . these altern are not competit yet but as soon as we run out of oil a lot of progress will be maid in new technolog . so in twenti year there will be more car in use than today becaus peopl at least in the first world can afford to by car and peopl need car as a mean of transport . but maybi there will be mani car that do n't need petrol ani more . our scientist find out new thing everi day and maybi not to far from now we will all be fli around in our car and we will use clean energi to pwer them .
