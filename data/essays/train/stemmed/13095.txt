travel impli discoveri . i have myself travel a lot to differ contin , i have howev never been in a group direct by a guid . the good point of have a guid is that everyth you look at - the other type of architectur , the other cultur , other rituel - are describ and explain by the guid . from what peopl told me about it , i guess that go on trip with a guid is a more relax way to discov new habit than look by yourself into book to tri to understand what is all around you . nevertheless , the point of view you get is the one of onli one person . as far as i am concern , i prefer go to new place without a guid . i like get to know the cultur by myself . you take the time to discov . in consequ , you interf with the new cultur and catch , understand the habit of the peopl around you . it 's a more person approach to the cultur . thi point bring my second thought on the subject : i prefer travel with a friend rather than with a group . travel with a group mean that you follow timet . you do not see what you necessarili would have like to see . most of all you remain with peopl who have the same cultur . as a conclus , my concept of travel mean that you should enter anoth world . i come from pari and live in india for three month with two friend work in hospit . we dress with the cloth everyon wore , so that peopl thought at one pointthat we had been live in india for a long time . the experienc and time spent with peopl impli that we were three and not a group of fifteen peopl . we were no tourist somehow but observ , discover , walk , eat with the peopl who live there .
