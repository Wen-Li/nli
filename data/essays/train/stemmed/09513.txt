i basic think that it is import for the undegradu student to have chanc to get knowledg of mani academ subject . and for the garduat student , i think they should special in one specif subject . but i person think , no matter the undergradu or graduat student , it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i will mention the reason whi i agre with the statement in the follow paragraph . first , i think peopl should keep broaden the sight for live by studi a varieti of academ subject . i think peopl can not live by do one thing , and need to learn a lot about thing through live . and if peopl can learn a numer kind of academ subject rather than one specif subject , i think peopl can get more chanc to do someth . in my case , i learn mani academ subject when i wa a colleg student . i especi learn about account , intern trade , english and also chines languag class . i am now work at a japanes trade compani and in charg of trade oolong tea leav from hongkong china . and now i feel the subject that i took at univers are realli use for my busi . for thi exmpl , take mani academ subject to broaden knowledg is tremend help on our way of work . second , i think that broaden knowledg by take mani academ subject make us greatli motiv . as i mention abov , i took the account class when i wa a student . actual , i wa not interest in it first , but as the class went ahead , i total addict about the attract characterist of account . now i am work in a field of intern trade but addit to thi , i am now studi to get a licens of japanes certifi public account . in conclus , i think to have boroad knowledg of mani academ subject make cahng our sight for live , enlarg way of work and our mind incred motiv . for those reason , i myself agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject .
