i strongli believ that that the student must understand idea and concept about a partricular topic and subject rather than just learn fact without understand anyth . it is most import for the student to first understand the content of the subject becaus one can not know about the topic of the subject without understand anyth about the idea and concept of the subject . just crame about anyth is a wish thing without understand the subject . for exampl i a student of chemistri , in chemistri there are variou type of complic and difficult theori , law and reaction . if i can not understand the basic concept of the reaction how can i learn it and though chemic reaction are so much tough , and complic no one can learn it and write in the examin without understand the basic concept about the chemic reaction that is how it happen ? , how the reaction proce ? and what are the product form after the complet of chemic reaction . for exampl take the process of format of rust in iron , no student can learn it fact without understand the basic concent of rust of iron and i am sure that no student can learn it chemic reaction without understand what are the compound involv in the rust of iron and what is the formula of the reactant and product form in the process of rust of iron if the student doe n't know name of the reactant and product in the rust of iron then how can he or she knoe the formula and the most import thing in know the formula is to first know the symbol of the element involv in the compound of rectant and product . the reactant involv in the rust of iron are ferric oxid , oxygen , water in the form of moistur and they all combin to form ferrisoferr oxid known as rust . so for thi to learn and write in the examin the student first ha to understand the proceess and condit involv in the rust of iron and the student must know the symbol of the element involv and then onli the student can write the formulea of all the reactant and product involv in the rust of iron . in thi way the student can explain the process of rust of iron and write it properli in the exam by understand the basic idea and concept involv in thi particular process of rist of iron . in the same way the student can write the chemic reaction of the process of photosynthesi by understand that it invov oxygen and carbondioxid to form carbohydr thu all branch of scienc can onli be studi by understand ideasn and concept
