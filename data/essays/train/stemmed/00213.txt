some peopl emphas learn fact at the educ my countri korea is also follow that belief and whole educ is establish under that concept . howev , while i go through the 12 year 's korean educ system , i found that it is not good for student . i prefer the other way , emphas understand idea and concept at the educ , sinc it make student be abl to use their knowleg , be creativ and enjoy learn . most of all , even though student know fact , if they ca n't understand them , they ca n't use their knowledg . when i took music class , teacher explain me about chord - c , d , e , minor , major , etc. - but i could n't play music by them . howev , veri after i hear those chord by touch the key of piano and understand what they are , i could play lot of song . such a smart idea it wa to understand the concept , not satisfi by onli know them . moreov , understand idea and concept make student more creativ . if student learn onli fact , they onli know about that . howev , if they understand the origin idea and concept , they can creat and chang those in their own way . thi experi may extend their knowledg and give a new concept of futher studi . inde , it 's signific to understand idea and concept sinc it make them creativ . furthermor , student becom enjoy learn while they understand concept and idea . as understand idea and concept , they can feel the joy of discoveri . they can feel the feel of the one who first find the theori . it make them enjoy learnig and studi by themselv . alway , peopl who want to studi well , they should enjoy it and understand concept and idea help them to be like that . in conclus , understand idea and concept is better and more import for student owe to that they can use their knowedg , becom creativ and feel joy when they studi . if the educ system of countri follow thi way , it might be better for the student of that countri . i suggest my countri korea to choos that way , either .
