travel is a wonder experi that everyon should access to onc in a while . so whi ruin it with a group of peopl you do not know and who do not have the same interest as you do ? whi let a tour guid take you to onli the most crowd place ? i do not agre that the best way to travel is in a group , especi not led by a tour guid . let 's start by say that we are all differ , and that while we may have some point in common with other , there is alway an interest that is uniqu to us . therefor , imagin arriv to pari and join a group of peopl that doe not includ just your famili , but also ten unknown person . how would you decid wether you all want to go and have a tradit `` pain au chocolat '' with coffe or wether you are all go to go shop ? or how would you decid if you are to all go to the highest level of the eiffel tower or just go up one level ? accord to peopl 's interest , it is imposs to do everyth that everyon want and you would be stop from do what you realli want for the benefit of other . if you absolut must travel in a group , i disagre on tour guid . of cours , they can be help on specif inform about the citi 's monument . the problem is that they do not go at your rythm . for instanc , if you are in new york and you wish to spend more time admir the glitter time squar at night , you may not be abl to becaus the tour guid will have a precis time schedul that he must stick to . i would therefor recommend buy a book with all the inform about the specif citi . thi ha two advantag : you are abl to enjoy the citi at your rythm and it 's much cheaper ! in all , i do not beleiv that a group or a tour guid are the way to go when it come to travel becaus it bring too mani restrict to what should be a complet free pleasur moment in your life !
