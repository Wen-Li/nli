it wil be better of know broad knowledgeof mani academ subject rather than to special in one subject . educ is the manifest of perfect alredi in man. the knowledg which we get from duffer subject are un compar with the horizon of the sky , the patienc of the earth , the flow of water , the greenari of natur . if we go through the academ way there will definitli increas inth burden in the subject in thi manner we can improv our skill to solv a problem , if we are concentr onli one subject it will be good onli to that subject where we can score good mark onli in that subject , here the main disadvantag is that we can not solv differ kind of problem , he may be profeession in that subject than also he can not use the other tactic which are known in other subjest . consid a student who interest in the subject physic and he concentrat onli on thi subject , and he also had a mathemat subject where he concent less on it , it realli creat a problem in futur becaus physic deal with some part of math and the student must known the minimum knowledg about math so that he can solv a problem , so it is must that concentr on differ academ lead a perfect life to the student . here iam talk about the acdem subject , these are alway relat to the previou subject so it will be easi to understand the concept easili onc we follow and these concept can be appli to solv a problem easili and accur . if here student are confus with the differ subject then atleast they should concentr on there core subject which alway relat to their previou semist and thi will definitli help in the techniq field where he should know the basic of the subject . here student ha make shour that they are concentr on there relat subject rather than unussu thing like student in math field should not concentr much on the medicin field becaus they are not go to deal medicin in futur , similar way medicin student must not concentr much on math field . here conclus to thi is it will be advantag to the student who had much knowledg on differ subject rather than student who concentart onli one subject .
