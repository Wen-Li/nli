i think that understand a concept about a subject give you a better knowledg of it instead of learn the fact relat to it . a theori give you the mental prepar to face all kind of fact , stude onli fact doe n't get to anyth becaus fact can chang dure time . if you see and studi a fact , you can get the highest level of prepar on that specif issu , but probabl it doe n't give you that standard procedur you need to deal with it . i am an univers student , my degre cours in econom is primarli base on theori , while anoth univers in my citi base it cours on practic ; peopl of that univers alway say that they 'll get the best prepar on their subject becaus they are stude them from the real world ; as an exampl they watch the everi day stock variat and use model to describ them . i wo n't say that thi is unuseful , but i think that instead of it , it would be better to studi as mani model exist in order to get a complet prepar of all kind of stock market . learn a theori enabl the student to understand thousand more , and , more import , could give the student the possibl to think with hi own head and enterpret all kind of event with a singl way of think , which can adapt quickli to ani situat . moreov , if you think about how ani kind of exam it 's made , you 'll find out that what is ask is usual not what wa said by the professor in the classroom , but is someth relat to it , someth new that you must elabor with your acquir skill , otherwis is just a memori test ! to conclu i think that as we are not like comput record data , we should use our brain to understand fact in order to know how to deal with other differ situat that we will face . experi can help , but is not enough .
