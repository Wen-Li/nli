i disagre with the abov statement for , simpli put , it mean `` jack of all trade and master of none '' . i certainli have no idea who came up with thi particular phrase but i do perciev it to be veri true and apt . a `` broad knowledg '' to my understand may be defin as enough fact to project a scholarli imag in refin societi . in other word , claim to have a read a book by read it ' back cover . limit knowledg of multipl topic is of no real use unless a person 's vocat requir him to possess such knowledg . special on the other hand is what lead to pure geniu . certainli some men are born a true geniu . but other can get there through hard and consist work in their particular field mean special . to support my idea i put forward four exemplari , indian nuclear scientist - dr. homi bhaba , vikram sarabhai , raja ramanna , dr. abdul kalam . these men shape indian nuclear histori . they absorb nuclear scienc into their veri blood and brought about a revolut in the nuclear field . india owe it present day nuclear statu to these men who laid the foundat stone for the edific of indian nucleardom . what would be our statu today if these men settl for a broad outlook on gener knowledg ? but thi is not to indic that special make everi person reach the height that these four have achiev . but certainli an in-depth knowledg of ani subject leav the individu with a person sens of satisfact for actual have achiev a mileston and also bring him a respect posit in societi where hi achiev is appreci by both hi friend and other . if we , for exampl take a heart specialist or a engin construct hous , they can not hope to execut their respect task without special in their field . they touch the live of all the peopl they serv and in addit to their remuner , they also earn the last gratitud of the peopl for a servic well-rend .
