in twenti year from now there would be noth but car everywher and i definitli dont think there would be ani way to pretend that there will be fewer . peopl need car and vehicl all the time , they need to go to work , they need to pick they kid from school , they need to buy a second as a birthday gift for their wive , they need to race , they need to brag about new gener of exepens car , so that mean that nowaday , car are as much import as water and food and as the popul of the world is increas , we go to need more car becaus there will be more peopl . but let get real practic about it , whi there would never be fewer in 20 twenti year ? the answer is easi , but the consequ is go to be realli devast . let see , we have a rich famili that own more than two car , and as mani kid they are have it is new car come with it , not becaus they realli need it , but just for the lexur of it , the brag and boat that come among they social class when they start talk about how mani car they have and what kind of car it is . that is just for one . on the second , there is the econim car gener , that is the main reason would be noth but more and more car everi singl year m if not say everi singl day . these kind of car are not realli expens , better yet , they are not expens at all , that is what allow everyon , middl class , upper class , some poor folk to get a car for a cheap amount of money and with all the help that the bank give peopl to buy anyth , we are go to see more car in the upcom twenti year , and i bet that is will to reach a number that would even go beyond the human be popul over earth becaus if we just tri and analys it , we are go to find out that everi singl man ha more than one car and that is actual ruin everyth , ruin the citi , ruin the environ , ruin the economi of some countri and most of all ruin the world and the natur .
