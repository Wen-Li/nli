i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than tehi realli are , and it is defin a requir for compani to sell it product more . the compani ha to introduc it product in a best way to attract custom , and to make most profit . what will you do , if you have to introduc yourself in a interview at the colleag where you want to go ? i can tell most of peopl introduc themselv in a best way that they can get into the colleag where they want to go . thi is same as whi the product are differ from the advertis . the compani ha to introduc it new item in a best way to attract peopl 's eye . did you ever go into cloth shop , which ha onli look bad cloth ? becaus peopl usual think from what they see , the compani put it best effort to make it product look great . for exmapl , the advertis of boy 's toy ha great background and sound effect , so when i wa young i use to buy after i saw adverstis of toy . how about the food 's advertis ? from the advertis , everysingl food look great , becaus the food are color with special ink , so they look much better than they realli are . as i mention with two exampl , the advertis make look much better the product on tv show , and i can tell everysingl adverstis is made up for make look better compani 's item . there are mani peopl who blame about the advertis becaus of the differ between real product and product from the tv , howev , we need to understand the differ . therefor , make product seem much better than how product realli are ture and understand .
