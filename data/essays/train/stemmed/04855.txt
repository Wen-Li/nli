i believ that the young peopl enjoy life more than the old . there are two major reason for thi claim . at first , the young peopl are healthier than the old peopl . health is everyth for human . in fact , if one is not healthi he/sh can not enjoy the life at all . most enjoy human activ , such as relationship with the other sex , eat , do fun thing such as play sport game , danc , etc. , requir healthi peopl . as human age they lose their abil to enjoy most of these activ as much as they use to . for exampl , a 70-year-old man can not eat food that have high calori and a number of unhealthi ingredi . in contrast , a 20-year-old colleg student can eat from the same food as much as he want , and noth happen . secondli , older peopl loos their enthusiasm to do a lot of fun activ becaus of their financi risk . older peopl tend to avoid do activ not onli becaus of the health risk , but also financi risk . unfortun , most of the fun activ in today 's world cost a lot of money , such as go for a vacat on an expens island . at young age peopl do not think about financi risk of their action becaus they think they have a long life to compens . howev , older peopl would think that if they overspend they may not be abl get a job and work to make up for it . although it may be argu that older peopl would have more money to do the expens activ than the young peopl , i think that young peopl have the potenti to work hard and save enough money for these activ . in conclus , i strongli believ that as the peopl get older they enjoy the life less becaus of a number of limit that age bring to them .
