although it may vari for each countri , i do not think that young peopl nowaday give enough time help their commun . in the past , the sens of commun wa much stronger : peopl , and especi youth , were much more commit to their commun , and perhap had a stronger senc of belong . but nowaday , thi sens is fade , and young peopl are becom less and less attach to these group . in my opinion , thi grow indefer in our societi is relat to the phenomen of the extens technolog and mean of commun . with the develop of these mean , peopl no longer feel a real need to take some of their time to help their commun , therefor accomplish an act that use to be consid as a social reunion . instead , they - and especi the young one - have found an altern in technolog : cell phone , comput , and especi internet , by which young peopl perform most of their social interact , and therefor , although have a perhap infinit larger number of peopl in their new commun , have a more and more restrict and limit contact , or even no human contact at all . indead , if we consid less develop countri , where technolog is comonli use , but ha not yet becom a full part of peopl 's life , we can see that they are much more comit to their respect commun , and give a lot more of their time to help them . therefor , the sens of commun is be littl by littl shroud by the modern and more and more dishuman world we live in . but thi is not necesarili a neg fact : the peopl have evovlv , and thi evolut , as usual , especi touch the younger one . mayb the sens of commun will , in the year to come , be redifin to be adapt to a more modern world , and to differ way of think and act .
