i strongli agre with the statement that ` success peopl are the one who tri and undertak new thing but also take risk rather than onli do what they know how to do well . ' although without much further thought be given to the topic , it may seem that peopl who alway do the same thing are ` success ' in a way , there are mani other factor to take into account . in fact , the person who carri out the same task everi day or the one who go through their life with the same amount and state of knowledg could be consid success expert in their area but they do not tri to go beyond their limit - a clear sign of success . let 's take the exampl of a basic biologist in a laboratori whose daili task is to analyz blood sampl to detect a diseas such as aid . thi scientist is obvious an expert in hi domain and most certainli success sinc the accuraci of hi decis affect the life of other peopl . and yet , thi biologist would not be qualifi to detect more specif chronic diseas for exampl , thu reduc the scope of what could be consid as success in hi area . on the other hand , given the definit of success , it can be impli that the more success one deriv is close link to the action he or she will undertak and make proof of . let 's consid the busi area : a success manag will most like be the one that is will to take up new challeng . by be creativ and clearli demonstr differ skill from the one of hi or her competitor , thi manag will probabl take more risk but result in higher profit . therefor a manag will appear - and be more success - if he is will to face new challeng and take risk that will make hi busi famou . unlik a busi leader who would onli gain profit and recognit from copi the work of other , a success leader will be prais for hi or her creativ , a great part of success . bill gate is probabl the most obviou exampl of a manag who wa readi to take risk and accept the consequ of it . who would have thought that hi new gener of comput would becom the world standard and result in such high profit both for the compani and the man itself ? although money should not be consid a proof of success , it is a great part of it . therefor , the more a person take risk , the more exclus hi or her deriv product is and the more success he/sh is like to have .
