at first is to say both way are import for student . you have to learn fact sometim but also you have to understand idea and concept in gener . i would say you can realli understand concept if you have learnt a few fact befor . i imagin to be a student in inform technolog . how could i understand the requir and the develop of a secur and profession work it network for a compani e.g. , without exactli knowledg of the featur and perform of the compon for such a network , both hardwar compon and softwar compon ? in my oppinion the learn of fact is often the basi to go the next step . onli if i have achiev a veri good level of detail knowledg , a veri good level of known fact and inform i will be abl to think in higher dimens and to understand the context and goal of thi descrip idea and concept . the experi from practic will support the abil to creat success concept . to talk about anoth exampl . i have to develop a market concept for a special new product . how can i do thi without know how the product work , what the consum requir and so on . in other word , befor i can develop market concept i should have sold a few product , i should have talk to a few consum of the regard market segment . i should also have done a few market research to learn the most import topic about competitor . all thi `` to do '' can be descrip as learn of fact , either learn in theori or learn in practic . both way of learn fact are veri import to be successful later in understand and also creat idea and concept . so as a summari i would say it is not the question what is more import , learn fact or understand concept but it is the question what come as first . i am sure both of them are veri import
