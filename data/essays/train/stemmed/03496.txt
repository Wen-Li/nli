i do n't think young peopl enjoy life more that older peopl do but in fact i neither think the contrari . in my `` short '' begin life i met lot of differ peopl from all age . i met young peopl like me who want to discov everyth . they want to test new sensat , discov new cultur , go out everi night to meet peopl and make parti . when you are young and you want to do that you can ! but when you are young and you want to jump from a plane to experi thrill of fall you meet an older instructor . when you go to the best discothequ you learn that the owner is 50 year old . when you drive fast on the highway and think `` i am the ( stupid and crazi ) king of the highway '' you see an `` old '' man behind you in a bmw / merced / audi car that drive faster than you . i think most peopl think that when you are young you can make lot of enjoy thing becaus of your health , strenght , young mental , freedom etc and when you get older you have more contraint . but in fact i know peopl older than me that show me that you can enjoy life if you have children , if you ca n't run veri fast and jump everywher . there is not an onli way to have fun and all peopl have there own way to entertain . to conclud , i think you can enjoy life while you are not so seak that you have to lie all day long on a bed . it do n't depend on your age or the money you have . enjoy life is a way ... of life
