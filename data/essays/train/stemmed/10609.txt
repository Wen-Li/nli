big expect i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in my point of view , advertis are the mask that product wear . with those mask on their face , you can not understand the product ' qualiti . becaus advertis are just hide the realiti . to start with an exampl to illustr the advertis ' show side , there wa an advertis of a chocol and on the advertis the whole school wa eat it becaus the chocol tast veri nice and it includ more calcium in it than it includ the chocol . howev , when i bought and tri it , it wa aw and when i read the ingredi of the product , i saw that there is veri littl calsium in it . the advertis wa just a lie . the chocol on the advertis wa wear the mask that i mention befor . moreov , the advertis hide the realiti in the sens that they do not allow - and can not-th consum to tri the product . behind the scene , they just appear as they would be demand . may be if a consum tri the product on televis , he or she will find lot of bad side of it . sinc it is the relationship between suppli and demand , the advertis just give what is demand by curtail the real ingredi of a product . all in all , accord to my opinion , advertis busi is a show busi . show requir lie , small trick and big and pink expect . advertis show give these tricki thing in such an intellig way to it audienc that they want to make that audienc to buy and consum that product . whether the product is as it is shown or not is not their primari concern . so most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are just to attract peopl and make them buy that product .
