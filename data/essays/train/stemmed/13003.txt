i believ that it is not import for success peopl to tri new thing and take risk . when we talk about success peopl we should know that there are mani way to look for someon and say he or she success pearson . actual , it is independ about what kind of job or what hi or her major , becaus there are some kind of job or some kind of major that do n't need ani risk . for exampl , i see my father as success pearson becaus he ha high possat in hi major , he is teacher , and in anoth hand , he do n't like tri ani thing new , he is alway do the same thing everi day and for a mani year , so as a result , he had high possat now . howev , some kind of job or major need to tri new thing and get some risk . for exampl , the reaprot in newspap , he or she tri to get news about the war and should go to the denger pleac for cover news and write the real stori about thi war , he or she realli take a high risk , but in the same time , he or she will be feumo . i think that have success life , it is some thing which iam look for , but i think also , my life is more import , there for i choes quiet job that make me as success pearson and in the same time with out ani risk . in short , to be success pearson , it doe not mean you should tri new thing and take risk rathen than onli do what you alreadi know how to do well . you can will be success pearson by just do what you onli know and you can do it well .
