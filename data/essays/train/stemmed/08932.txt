i disagre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not use enough time to help their commun . i think that it depend on the educ and the econom condit which young peopl and thier commun have . first of all , japan , where i live in , ha mani volunt organ which help local commun . mani young peopl belong to these organ to help the older peopl and the handicap person in their commun . in my experi , when i wa univers 's student , i belong to sever volunt organ . the organ wa establish by student to help the local commun . mani young student work sincer for there to get satisfactori of their mind . in japan , we can find mani volunt organ found by young peopl . in japan , we learn the import of help our own commun . in thi result , mani japanes have help other person and commun sinc children . i think that it depend on the educ which they were given whether young peopl help other or not . secondli , i think that it also depend on the econom condit on their commun . especi , in japan , some of area which have much budget on welfar , young peopl do not help their commun veri much . in these reasion , the local social organ help their commun mainli by use enorm budget on welfar . to help commun is the social enterpris in which much of unemploy peopl work to get money . in such condit , mani young peopl do not need to help thier commun . for these reason , i disagre with the statement that young peopl do not use enough time to help thier commun . i think that it mainli depend on between the educ which young peopl had and the econom condit which their commun have .
