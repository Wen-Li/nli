i complet agre with the statement from my person experi and from my observ . the good thing about travel in a group is that it 's easier for travel . becaus the travel plan is alreadi well arrang by the tour guid , so the travel do n't have to spend lot of time make the plan . the onli thing that need is to follow the tour guid and have fun . also , sinc they do n't need to worri about the schedul , they can complet relax and enjoy the tour . moreov , to travel in a group is safer becaus the gang wo n't easili conduct crime to the person who are in a group . there is one more benifit for travel in a group , that is , the price is often lower due to the special discount for group peopl . besid , the tour guid is more profession than us , therefor the travel can get to know mani histori and bakcground of the scene . fot exampl , from my observ , the honey moon would be the best if travel in a group led by a tour guid . becaus the coupl can realli enjoy the trip without fight with each other in where to go or which place to go first . as a result , the new marriag coupl can maintain good relationship all along the honey moon . on the other hand , when travel alon , travel are take the risk . first , sinc they might not be familiar with the place they 're go to , the plan they made would probabl expos themself into the unknown danger . second , they need to worri about their schedul all the time . that would give them the pressur when travel and make them becom nervou . third , as compar to the group , the price of travel alon is often higher . in sum , i agre that travel in a group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel .
