i agre with the statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . as we can see in the everyday life there is a decres amount of space to get around with car . park it is becam a real challeng , and the frustrat that build everyday is assum veri big proport . the statist show that in twenti year the popul of the world will be at about six billion . right now we are onli four billion . what that mean is that the level of pollut of the air it will be unliv for ani human kind . the space avail per person will decreas and the driver will have an increas in anger . unfortun we are abl to see that in indonesia right now . their problem is that everybodi use a car . therefor , live in a confin countri , with an increas popul doe n't allow a sanitari and better life . so , to avoid thi problem , we should decreas the number of car by simpli appli to few rule . first of all , we should make a law that forbid peopl to drive by themself . what i mean is that car should be consid for a minimum of four peopl . if that doe n't happen the owner of the car should n't be allow to drive , penalti a tiket or wors . then the commun should make avail more commun ride like buse or ani other vehicl that hold more peopl than a car . do so , we should be abl to decreas the number of car , the pollut of the air , the ga consumpt , that nowday is reach incred price and we should be abl to decreas the frustrat and anger of everybodi . in the meanwhil , anoth good thing that could be done is allow the circul onli to the vehicl that have a gpl or a methan implant . that doe n't decreas the number of car in circul , but at least decreas the air pollut .
