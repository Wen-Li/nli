our is a fast develop societi and and we have vari branch of studi in which we can gain special . the question whether it is better to have a knowledg of mani academ subject or to special in one subject is a veri debat one and the respons may vari from individu to individu . here , let us anlyz the situat .. univers to day offer mani subject in which student can choos to major such as the scienc , math , literatur and art ... each of these subject also have mani appli branch . take for instanc scienc which compris of medic scienc , physic scienc , astronomi and so on . .. the scope of learn today is so vast that one can not hope to master complet even one subject , so the view of learn may subject seem to be complet out of question ... therefor , i strongli support the view that student should special in one specif subject rather that learn a lot of subject . my argument for the same go as follow . as it is said that `` the qualiti of educ should have a direct bear on the qualiti of life '' , true as it is . if a student focus hi energi and time on learn one subject he she can gain better expertis and thu he will be more profici in that subject . a profici in ani field in turn bring with it better work opportun and a better qualiti of life . on the other hand if a student ha sveral subject to studi and he can not devit hi time to one , he will probabl end up be aimless and jobless too . here some peopl might counter my view by say that . if a person ha knowledg about vari subject he will be in a better situat to face the challeng of life . ye , that is one fact that is undeni but as far as profession educatipn is concern i strongi support the idea of major in one subject onli . we all have plan for the futur and we know what we want to be in the futur , we are awar of our abil and interest so after calcul on all these factor one should choos a field that he want to special in instead of tri to learn all subject becaus it is virtual imposs for mortal to retain all that they learn in school or univers . so if i want to be a comput engin whi should i be bother about learn about the variou form of music . the answer is obviou - it will be of no practic use to me . in view of the fact that i mention abov we can safe reachth conclus that one should focu on special in one field onli rather than creat an anarch situat in your mind by tri to gain expertis in variou subject .
