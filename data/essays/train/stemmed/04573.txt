tri new thing and take risk are two veri import factor to succeed in life . to begin with , tri new thing actual give a person a chanc to find out what exactli is the person good at and where doe hi interest lie . i feel it veri import to do someth in life which interest you and excit you . thi alway drive you to give your best in whatev you are pursu . one who doesnt tri differ thing in all probabl will be do the same thing throughout hi life and may be in the later year it will be more for the sake of do it and not becaus he enjoy it . sachin tendulkar , world famou cricket is a tenth grade drop out !! he did make an effort to studi but that never interest him and he had famili to support him and who encourag him to follow hi dream rather than follow the convent model of keep the studi at prioriti instead of sport or music . but at that point of time sachin tendulkar and hi famili did take a risk and did someth uncovent and today he 's one of the most influenti person in the world !! anoth thing which is worth mention is , that onc peopl becom success they are in a better posit to take risk becaus of strong financi , social and polit support . eg a famou industrialist who ha hi busi in it sector can think of ventur into health care industri which is pole apart from hi expertis . but , with the right plan , organis and support he can do wonder and expand hi busi into alltogeth differ field . so , i strongli feel that have the courag to tri differ thing in life and take risk can lead one toward success and with success come the liberti and eas with which one can further take risk and succeed to greater height in life .
