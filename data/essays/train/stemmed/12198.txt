ever sinc i have been introduc to the learn system in our countri , i have been alway face with two approach while learn : the american approach versu the french approach to deliv knowledg . wherea the french system encourag the assimil of idea and concept for a specif topic , the american way tend to deal with the more practic side of that topic . but the question is : which one is the best ? here lie the `` chicken first or egg first problem '' . some believ that the best way of teach a student about a subject is by introduc him/her and explain to him/her the theori behind that subject . thi way , the student knowledg about the subject is enlarg and then he/sh might be abl to predict fact emerg out of it . as an exampl , if i want to teach someon about how an engin is turn on , i would introduc him/her to the mechan theori and concept behind it . while thi approach is follow by mani , other believ that expos the student to fact ha far more impact than teach the idea and concept . in other word , by be expos to fact , student will gain the advantag of interact and most probabl will be simul , lead him/her to understand the idea and theori behind the subject in a more effici . in other word , if we are to come back to that engin exampl mention abov , instead of explain the theori behind how an egin is to be turn on , the way to run the engin can be present to the student in a way to experi and be expos to that subject , thu assimil much of the theori behind the idea . i emphas the import of learn fact over understand idea and concept . i can still rememb the effect 's power that a fact will leav on student , at least on me when i wa back at the univers . i wa more excit and felt more involv than when listen to abstract concept and idea .
