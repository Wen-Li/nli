i agre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . there are sever reason whi i think thi way . in thi essay , i am go to talk about them . first , we can appli those broad knowledg base of mani academ subject to further learn . without basic broad knowledg of mani academ subject , it can be hard to learn new thing becaus what we onli know well is onli one specif subject . in thi sens , we can onli adopt new thing relat to the one specif subject we know well about . for exampl , say that i did n't focu on ani other subject but onli on chemistri . and i face new graph like veloc vs. time . even though i can just memor the characterst , it will be veri confus to understand whi the graph look like that without knowledg in mathmet . therefor , some knowledg in mathemat would help me in learn chemistri as well . thu , broad knowledg of mani academ subject is import . second , it will develop us in think critic , beyond and abov . if our knowledg is limit in one specif subject , then our brain will work relat onli to that specif subject . for exampl , say that i learn about european histori in the histori class . we are to memor the fact that happen in each countri time by time for intern assess and test . at thi point , imagin you also learn a lot about econom in the class . now then the event took in each countri time by time will appear a lot easier than they were when you did n't know anyth about econom . thi is becaus the histor event are somewhat relat to it econom condit at that time as well . like thi , broad knowledg of mani academ subject help us think critic , beyond and abov . lastli , we can have a good convers with ani kind of peopl in varieti of job or profess in societi . if i lack of broad knowledg of mani academ subject , it will be hard to understand peopl of differ profess than our . therefor , it can result my bad relationship with other peopl later on . for exampl , say that i 'm profession in econom and i 'm meet a philosoph for first at a cafe . person , i want to make a good relationship with him . howev , dure the talk , whatev he think is way too much differ than i think that is . also , it 's hard to understand him becaus i do n't know anyth about other subject from econom ; as well as philosophi . therefor , i will definit have a hard time talk to him . but imagin if ani one of us had broad knowledg of mani academ subject ; say the philosoph did , then he would understand me even hi thought are differ from what i think . then , we will somehow keep good relationship between each other . like thi , broad knolwedg of mani academ subject help us in commun with other peopl and make social relationship better in the futur . in conclus , with the fact abov , i think that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . it help us appli them to further learn , develop our critic think skill and give a chanc to make a good social relationship with other peopl .
