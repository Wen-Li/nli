it 's sure import to the student to undertand idea and concept and mayb it could be more simpl to explain to their in that fashion , especi when it 's for exempl an math cours and you consid that it 's either not import , or is not their level yet . but if you see thi problem like that , you will be oblig to work in it case by case , so in a gener view a think that some person consid in mani case that with onli the concept or the idea the person understand well the problem without to learn the fact . what it 's sure wrong , becaus you can be sure that he did the experi , so he know the fact . mayb he do n't know whi or when , but he did it . and you can check it with simpl problem of the life for exempl , so if you consid that you know it becaus it 's simpl , you wrong , all can be resum by ower experi or fact of experi of anoth one . and mayb the stronger proof that i can done , it 's when you are in a somewhat difficult idea and concept , you are oblig to take in count the fact to undertstand the idea , becaus you ca n't did it whithout . and logiqu we understand that the experi play a great part in ower logic and comprehens , and you ca n't that understand you are oglig to observ , work in it , or do an effort to obtain the fact
