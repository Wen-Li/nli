in mani school and institut it is beleiv that the import in learn is by memor fact and concept other than actual understand them . we are face two veri differ type of learn and teach , and i person think that the best way is to anal and comprehend . in the older day , teacher left asig to the student of memor and copi fact , date , name , number , among other thing . then , the student woul 've pass not even 1 year and he would have forgotten everyth the histori teacher told him to memor about the second world war . it would n't have been of ani of memor in the first place . now , in the other hand , i think that a more modern type of teach is by make the student anal the problem and understand the answer . for exampl , in mathemat or physic , instead of the teacher give the formula to meassur the air , or to find a number , let the student find the formula by himself . in a way , i think thi type of teach help the student to develop certain abil and it esaier for them to solv problem in a far or close futur . i think it is veri import to actual use the whole porcentag of brain we are capabl of use and to think , and figur out our own answer . we are not born with the abil we have , but we reforc them , make them stronger . in my person opinion , it is much more imoport for us ( student ) to understand and comprehend idea and concept than it is for us to learn and memor them . besid , memor is alway bore . it funner to learn by apli thi type of teach . think is fun . understand is fun . learn is fun .
