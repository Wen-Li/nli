while we start learn someth , we have to understand the idea and concept first . it seem to be critic for us to learn those thing first so that we can build the foundat of what we are go to learn . actual , if we just understand the concept or idea and we do n't understand the fact . eventu , we are not realli learn someth . from my point of view , to understand idea and fact are both import . there are wide varieti of exampl in our daili live can prove my view point . i am take psycholog class right now . last week , my teacher talk about how to analyz dream . i got to learn the basic concept of analyz dream . when i understood the concept , i wrote down one of my dream to my teacher . then , she analyz it for me . as a result , it wa not realli accur about what i thought and what i wa go to do . then , she told me that fact and concept might not be the same ; therefor , we had to learn both . on the oth hand , if we are go to learn sport . first of all , we will learn concept and how to play . then , we will get to learn skill . can we just learn the concept and we will be good at it ? we must practic and play game so that we can learn the fact that what will it realli happen while a game . we may not be abl to use all the idea while we play the game . to conclud , student must understand both idea and fact . those are crutial for out learn . we ca n't lack either one dure our learn process .
