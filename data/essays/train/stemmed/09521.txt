`` the world will chang '' thi wa what our teacher told us one day . for my part , i think there will be fewer care in the twenti year than there are today for mani reason . first i think that the sourc of energi will decreas , especi oil . so it will be hard to provid oil to car . now the oil price is over 70 $ ! unless if they discov new sourc of energi . in addit to price of oil will get higher and higher . peopl will have problem in get ga for their car . second thing , popul of the world will increas . so it will be hard to drive becaus of traffic , and it will a take long time to move from one place to anoth . as most studi state , and as mani peopl immigr from poor countri to the develop one . third , discov new mean of transport such as subway , or express trian will be a good reason that peopl will leav car . becaus they are cheper , faster , and safer . also , mayb there will be new `` gener '' of mean of transport as rocket . who know ? forth , becaus of globaliztaion , i think , the price in general is increas . the price of food or hous for exampl is get higher and higher everi day and the salari is get lower . as a result of that , peopl will not be abl to buy car , or even to provid the thing that car need like oil or spear part i think the number of peopl use car will be less than today . but i hope that we will find new way to move from one palc to anoth in a safe way that will no
