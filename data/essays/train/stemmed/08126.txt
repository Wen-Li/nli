most of the peopl are happi with the knowledg they have or say they are unconcern about new topic , while some other type of peopl , have an appetit to do new thing that is tri out new thing . my type of categori is the second one , so i would go with and agre to the statement - `` succesful peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well. '' for their insati curios , alway activ and open , risk involv . unquench curios is the drive forc behind all the successful peopl . it is thi forc which keep them engag in their work . as for exampl , let us consid an scientist . he is a person alway want to know how thing work , what will happen next , what would be the respons if i do it that way - are some of the question arous in mind of these men . thoma alva edison is one of the most succesful scientist & a men with these virtu . he experi with around 1200 idea , and final invent the electr bulb . it wa thi appetit for invent , rather say do thing differ from rest of the mass made him a successful person . alway activ and open to idea is an anoth attribut of the wise . they clasp or hug new idea with open arm . isaac newton can be a consid to be a part of thi speci . everyon saw appl fall but onli newton wa the one to cast doubt by think `` whi that appl fell . '' by take calcul risk they take their bussi , principl to peak or pass off as an forlorn entiti . a whole lot of peopl get success by tri out new thing differ and innov an alreadi activ idea . some of the ingredi of these kind of peopl is their curios toward their work , their open mind and the abil to take risk . to be success in life , a person ha to be : keen toward hi work , open to differ view by differ peopl and the abil to take some good risk . .. atleast onc .
