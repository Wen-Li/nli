as far as i am concern , advertis realli are good way to make the product seem much better than they realli are . especi in thi modern scocieti and dure thi commerci and valu time . dure the histori of china , there had been some kind of advertis in the big citi : such as the changan citi of empreor tang . some owner of the restur put the list and the main ingredi of the meal out of the hous to attract the custom . sometim they cook the meal in the front of the restruant and ask the custom to tast the meal for free . acctur , these free food were veri delici and enough for mani peopl to eat , but if the custom enter the restruant and order the same food , they would find the food 's tast is just so so . that is the differ between advertis and the real product . the product in the advertis are allway seem better than the product realli are . to tell the truth , i realli like to watch the advertis of the make-up and orther beauti product from tv or newspap . but i will not buy a product immediatli when i see a new advertis . becaus i do n't know if the product is realli like what the advertis say . i often ask for some sampl of the product or ask my friend about it . i think it may avoid the risk of hurt myself . anyway , the women 's face is veri import . adervertis r
