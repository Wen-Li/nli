in my opinion , i support the idea to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject . there are two reason whi i support the idea . first of all , to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject to help us to think about thing wide angl . for exampl , if i have differ opinion from my friend , and get fight from it , then i think it is veri import to tri to think in differ angl . in other word , to avoid to think my claim is alway right . anoth reason whi i support the claim is becaus it would help me to live in societi with enjoy . to have variou knowledg may provid me to commun with peopl easili . becaus i simpli imagin that if i have variou knowledg , then i wo n't have much tough time to concid what shoud i talk to peopl . it will provid me mani friend . i do not think to special in one specif subject is bad . actual , i respect peopl who is profession about specif subject , becaus it is result of their concentrain and devot time to studi about it . that is great effort i think . how , i think to have variou knowledg mean similar to be flexibl person . i would like to be flexibl person . what is flexibl person for me is , to think about wide rang , and can think about by stand other person 's posit . then my world would be more expand and life will be more enjoy . abov all , i support the opinion to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than not .
