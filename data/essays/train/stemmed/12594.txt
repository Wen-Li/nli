i think that thi is a mainli key point in the new econom societi ; but it 's veri hard to conclud a gener idea about to how to have a success . in thi case the question is veri limit , and reguard onli the complet or uncomplet peopl knowleadg background for the own of success . in my opinion is imposs that the peopl can arriv to success onli with hit knowleadg , but in necessari a mix of the variou elema that make it possibl thi ; is more possibl that one peopl that ha n't particular knowleadg , eccept the econom skill , find the success than one veri knowleadg peopl without ani skill in the econom world . but is also true that the knowleadg consist in a princip help for the aim of the success . for the first a success peopl must be tend to the risk , becaus without the risk ca n't have what do you want ; the risk is proportion to the result that can be have if the new thing that finish in a good result . obviou thi is n't mean that for have the success is suffic take some risk , becaus thi can have dramat consequ complet contrari to the success , in ther word thi is mean lose all thig . for the good final result the risk must be use with knowleadg about how and when the risk is possibl to use . infact is necessari know when one risk can be have or no in relatioship to the thik that it is relat . in conclus i ca n't exaplain a correct answer for the question , but onli my opinion that is not determin but is a mix about some thing ; thi becaus the thing is veri soggett and must be anal in each case .
