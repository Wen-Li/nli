nowaday commun are at the base of our societi , which is made up of children , young propl , adult and old peopl . adult and young peopl are the most activ part of our societi . the statement ca n't be taken as an absolut , i think that it depen on the societi in which we live . at differ societi correspond a differ way of think . first i have to point out the import of the educ . as a matter of fact especi in european countri and north american countri , where educ is a fact of great import , young peopl are more involv in our commun in order to help them . it is a biunovoc relat as the more young peopl can help their commun the more can be both educ and help in their growth . there are some activ such as parish activ that inovolv young peopl . for instanc i usual help children to sudi as a volount . that is a good way to help our commun . nonetheless i have to state that in some delevop countri young peopl have no much freedom and that caus mani problem in the relat between commun and young peopl . moreov all peopl tell them what to do without give them reason . besid there is some young peopl who do n't figur out whi they should help commun . thi is due to the fact that there are egoist and they do n't like to help other . but it 's not complet thei fault . there are differ outlook in the educ of a person . one can choos not to forc hi son and let him stay all day in front of a comput or in front of televis or one parent can make the chois of spend time explan to hi son the import and the love sensat that hammer out in help other , that i sto say in help commun . in conclus i support the idea that if it seem that young peopl nowaday do not give enogh time to help thier commun mayb it is becaus they had never seen adult do that with passion and love . so we have to own out our respos and never give up in front of unforese hindranc , instead we can chang our outlook and we can share our sparetim with young peopl in order to focu togeht on the big opportun we have to help our commun .
