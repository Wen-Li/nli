i think to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is good for peopl than to special in one specif subjuct . if someon onli studi about mathemat , he or she ca n't make a life more various and miss mani use inform for surviv . i would present two specif reason to support my idea . first , a person who studi onli one subject ca n't sustain their life well . peopl are social be so they have to learn about mani thing to surviv . for exampl , if a professor of the histori learn about histori he or she could be poor becaus lack of econom knowledg . my major is histori , so i alway see my professor who studi their own intrest . howev , they are not good at financi techquin , so they to miss much money that they could earn . if they could earn much more money than now , they can concentr on their subject as they do n't worri about thier financi problem . secondli , one subject is relat with other subject dens . if you want to studi histori you have to learn other languag , literatur , philosophi and so on . when i read a book about roman histori , i also need to studi about their literatur and philosophi . in addit , i have to learn about other languag if i want to read materi from other countri . it onli allow me to understand specif factor accur . to conclud , i think to studi board knowledg of mani academ becau of it use facor to surviv and help factor to studi your own interest subject .
