i disagre with the idea that understandig idea and concept is more import than lear fact . it is more import to learn , even if you do n't know exactli what someth mean , becaus if you can learn how to appli what you 've learn in real life , then you wo n't forget about it . one of the main object of a student is to learn , or at least it should . there are sever factor that could chang the goal of a student , or even the result of what they 've learn . in order to learn , you can use real-lif exampl to understand a concept in a better way , and that 's an easi way to learn . when your teacher use easi exampl in the class , sometim you do n't even realiz thay you 're learn until you rememb that particular exampl in the real world . and i think that 's the best way to learn , becaus you might not even tri to learn and you do it anyway . in my person experi , i love teacher who explain someth to me in a simpl way . one of them is by give exampl you might know , or some experi you might had . and the best of all is that , one day without ani effort , you rememb what your teacher tought to you , and the exampl he/sh gave you . it is veri import that teacher tri their best to make student consid that is more import to learn the fact instead of memor a concept . becaus if you do that , mayb you will know the definit dure the class , dure the week , or dure the cours . but if you never use that concept again , or if you do n't even care about know how to appli what you 're learn in your real life , then it would be like if you did n't learn a thing . it is realli import to be awar of thi import aspect in learn , and it 's a homework we all have to accomplish : - student in order to be better prepar , and - teacher in order to improv student ' learn .
