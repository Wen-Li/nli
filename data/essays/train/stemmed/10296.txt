there are conflict view whether young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it depend on the locat the person live or the background situat the person underw . nevertheless , in my opinion , yound peopl enjoy life more as they have not encount much , thu everyth will be novel and excit for them , plu , they have healthi bodi that permit them to enjoy life and young peopl tend to be less stress , thu enjoy life more . gener , the younger the person is , the less experi s/he had gone through . therefor , everyth they do , it will be exict for them as it would be a novel experi for them . to exemplifi thi idea , a young person who travel by air will be enthusiast , as for them , plane travel could be someth extraordinari and novel , contrari to an older person who ha alreadi had abound number of air travel . for that older person , it would be tire and unenjoy . more importantli , it is no exagger to say that the state of one 's health determin whether a person can enjoy life more than other . it is a known fact that the younger the person is , the healthier s/he is . to mani , climb the himalaya mountain could mean enjoy life , see the natur beauti of the planent . trek for a month to climb the ever-last rang of mountain until reach the apex requir healthi bodi . thu in other word , the younger the person is , more it is possibl to enjoy life . lastli , i am sure that mani peopl will agre with me , as older we get , we tend to get more stress out . when we are young , we onli have to worri about school report or do well at school . therefor we can freeli enjoy life . go club and danc all night without ani worri . howev , older peopl have mani thing to worri and care about . parent have to worri about money . enjoy life by go on a holiday , they worri if they can afford it or can they take a leav from work or more commonli , who will look after the children ? to conclud , young peopl tend to enjoy life as they have the health capac to do so , the mind and the passion . they do n't get headach like older peopl about money or children . therefor , it is actual depress to point out the fact that when peopl age and reach their retir age , they can not enjoy life as much as young peopl can .
