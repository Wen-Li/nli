i agre with the statement that most advertisen make product seem much better that they realli are but not alway . media nowday play a big role in make correct decis . advertis are use to promot sell of product so that the compani can have profit . it is never for the sake of one 's good . compani care for their profit and loss and that 's the reason whi law have been enforc for make advertis to protect privaci of peopl and filter the content of the advertis . insur are to protect peopl not to show their lifestyl or someth . by say that what i mean is the better insur that you get peopl think that the better off you are . by better insur i mean the reput one or the one that ha a lot of media influenc . for ex , i see an advertis for geico car insur almost everyday on the t.v. tri to get more custom by say that their price are lower , but what it turn out to be is that they reduc price in one place but make up for that and profit in anoth section . it is basic trick peopl . like if you do n't you well on a certain part of the test you tri to make up for it in the other section but it doe n't help becaus it affect your grade anyway . advertis are not alway like that they sometim they are made in favor of the well be of the peopl . for ex. there is ad which ask parent to be friendli with their teenag children and talk to them about not go on the wrong way like becom alcohol or smoke . i think that ad like that are not bad and they just help reduc gener gap in my view . in conclus , it depen on the type of the ad wheter it is tri to make the product seem much better or not . but most of time the statement is unfortun true .
