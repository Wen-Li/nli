i have travel abroad for more than five time . half of the travel i made wa with a tour guid , while the other half did n't . i have to admit that travel with a tour guid in a group is realli a easier way to travel . everyth is plan by the tour guid . you do n't need to worri about where to stay in the next stop , how to get the next destin . howev , if i have time to make travel plan in advanc , i prefer travel on my own . i can take my time to enjoy the journey more when travel alon than with a tour group . i like go to museum , see art display and savor the exot cuisin . i can keep my own pace in the journey and realli have a good look at the citi . the travel plan made by the travel agenc are often too pack for me . i do n't like to be in a hurri . the other thing that i like to travel alon is that i do n't need to put up with other peopl in a tour group . sometim i mett member in the tour group that realli have bad habit . for exampl , i 've been in a tour group , and one of the member in the group wa often late for the schedul time . as a result , the whole group had to postpon our next schedul just becaus of hi late . compar with travei in a group with a tour guid , i enjoy travel by myself more . in thi way , i can realli see what i want to see and i do n't have to face the inconveni caus by some member in the tour group .
