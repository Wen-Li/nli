we often hear the word `` neet '' in japan , neet is the person who ha onli part time job or do not have job . i have some friend who are neet . they have free time , so they can enjoy life without think time or date . now , i am a graduat student . i work for my laboratori from earli morn to late at night everyday . i am busi everyday , so i am alway think that i want to have a rest . for me , i sometim envi neet 's life becaus they have freedom . howev , i do n't think that it is good that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i have 2 reason . first , young peopl need a lot of money if they want to enjoy life as older peopl . but in most case , mani young peopl earn so much money . if they get money from their parent , i think they should not enjoy life as older peopl . the money that older peopl use their to enjoy life is earn by themselv . but the money that young peopl use is not ! i think that it is veri hard to earn money by themselv . when we realiz it , we know the import of money and we appreci money . if they use a lot of money without know it , it is veri danger . second , i think that we work so hard when we are young . when we are young , we can move freeli . when we are young , it is better that we enjoy onli to do thing we are young . when we get older , it is hard to move , and they can not get less knowledg than we get . so i think that young peopl enjoy thing we can do onli when we are young . for these reason , i disagre with the statement .
