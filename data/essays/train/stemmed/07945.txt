studi is a quit difficult and time-consum task . for thi reason , it is veri import for student to know where is more effici to put all their energi . one option is spend most of the time tri to memor fact , such as number , formula or date . anoth aproach is tri to understend the concept which actual explain those fact . i agre with the idea that it is more relev for studen to have a complet comprehent of the concept than just memoraz fact . also , i think that an aproach of learn base on understand concept is more effect than an aprocah of learnig base on memor fact . there are two main reason which support my point of view . first off all , learn concept is more enjoyl than memor fact . i rememb when i wa stude at the univers and i use to hate all kind of list . in that time , i had to take a lot of histori cours and it wa quit common for proffesor to give long list of date of differ event . becaus of my studi , i have memor a lot of lit and i can say that thi is not fan at all . secondli , i think that when we understand concept relat with some field , we can also use thi concept to understand differ area of knowleg . thi is the reason whay i bealiv that understand concept is more effect than memor fact . for exampl , at the same time that we are understand concept relat with the biolog of the human bodi , we can also be understand idea that make us abl to have a comprehent of the other mammal 's biolog . all in all , i can say that i am sure that concep should be consid more relev than fact by student . basic becaus there are more enjoyl to learn and repres a more effect way to get knowleg .
