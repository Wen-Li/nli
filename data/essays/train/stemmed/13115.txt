i will justifi my view on three differ point : i have to disagre with thi statement , firstli becaus of the current context which is that on an averag basi , peopl have at least one car if not two . they keep get awar of the import of pollut and the ecolog problem it caus , nevertheless , they go on use their car daili even for short and unsignific distanc . for exampl , most peopl will take their car to go to work or to go on vacat , which is justifi , but they also will use it to go to the movi , as they could perfectli use the transport . it is by get more and more lazi that they end up use their car for ani distanc . the second reason whi i disagre with thi statement , is the fact that peopl are veri much into high technolog and each time more modern technolog . so mani differ type of car are creat as the year go by and it keep on improv . so in thi statement my point is that peopl first think about their own interest and what is best for them and certain not about collect interest . they alway want to go faster , we besid could compar thi to airplan that are built ( like the concord ) which main purpos is again to alway go faster . at last , the third reason i will mention is that the car market is in constant growth , so it is a consist part of the economi go on , not onli for the seller , but also for the oil market . the peopl who rule and control thi most import commerc involv way too much work and effort to have their sell decreas . they do n't have the luxuri to have less costum countri , especi when we know how rare and difficult it get to pump oil out of it element nowaday .
