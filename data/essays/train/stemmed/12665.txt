there are sever view which is relat to thi topic . some may think that there is no help from young peopl for their commun . howev , i disagre with the statement that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . nowaday , there are a lot of social problem in the world . these problem have to solv by citizen . howev , if it ca n't solv at the first gener , the new gener , young peopl is need . therefor , we can easili observ from the case that most of univers student is particip for their societi . they sometim resist about unfair polit or not good enough intern plan . for these case , we can realiz that how they are realli interest in thier societi and tri to help thier commun . furthermor , all societi are educ young peopl . thi educ make student to think and adjust for their new life when they grow up . so we can not determin that they are not help their commun . becaus studi is the basic resourc which make educ peopl to think about social problem and to find the way to solv some problem . for a real , educ peopl usual particip their sociey . final , the school ha a respos for educ peopl without ani limit except age . they educ not onli academ resourc but also the import about help behav to poor peopl . we can easili notic from activ in school like go to orphanag and help orphan . of cours , it is involv in the score and most school requir the record of work for poor peopl . young peopl are educ effici for help their commun . when they educ , they natur have an attitud to think about social problem as well as the student who did not studi hard . also young peopl is the main resourc which will manag and control the world . thu , it is not appropri argument that young peopl is not help thier commun .
