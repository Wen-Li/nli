is advertis mislead ? that i think the way we can rephras thi statement . the question impli that actual ye it might be the case . but let 's review what is advertis and discuss whether the process is aim at `` embellish '' the truth ? what is the role of advertis ? it is , i believ to make awar the largest popul of consum possibl of the exist of a new product . so advertis technic ha a valu of inform . at the same time it ha the mission to promot to graeter number of peopl the product . the ultim aim of the advertis is to convinc the majorit of consum to buy the product . but i believ there is clear distinct between inform a poulat of the exist of a new product and promot a product . inform is commun fact in it minim and truth way . for exampl , a new drug come to the market and as health advoc you want to inform the commun and health profession . what are you go to tell the professionn ? you will give all the element about the drug ( chemic entiti , mechan of action ) that help peopl to understand what it is , who it is for , and what are the risk associ with it use . now when you see the avertis for a drug , a drug for arthriti ( painful debilit diseas ) for exampl what do you see ? the add tell you what it is and who can benefit from it . but it is also show you some great , slim , ladi happili jump , run , . in addit , in mani case , it 's also tell you that it 's much better than so and so . so what doe it mean . is thi drug much better your cure ? doe the advertisemnt refklect tell you what to expect from tyhat drug ? my answer to that is not so simpl . the advetisemnt is not lie but it doe n't give you the real fact , the truth . it doe n't telll you , for exampl , thatthi drug is good f for onli one categori of the popul , that drug may have some unplaes side effect . so my advic : be circumspect when it come to advertis drug .
