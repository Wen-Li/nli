i do agre with the statement . but i have to moder my claim . come out of the univers , i can see i have learn a lot of thing , and i have forgotten an equal number of it . what will stay after pass year ? the idea , and the concept . in cours , it , s realli import to learn a way to think . not the same as the professor 's one , but it own one guid by teacher experi . so , is the knowledg unuseful ? certainli not . in order to develop hi own way to learn , the student need strong basi . if he doe n't have good instal , hi scienc build is go to fail . in the elementari school , we alreadi have to set up those strong basi . otherwis , the onli way to build up a good mental structur is to receiv exampl to learn . how to understand a car is ride without know how work an engin . the knowledg is also import to be abl to make connect between differ area , to compar some stuff . as an archeologist discov some news object . he need to know how wa the environ , the atmospher to figur out how those object could be useful for peopl who live there . in belgium , we have thi big issu in the high school level . actual , we tri to reduc the knowledg of student and to give us more skill an abil . but the colleg professor start to mean their student come into their cours with too big lake . so , there is an emerg in find the best middl way between pure knowledg and skill . i think that the more we grow up , the more we have to leav knowledg to get a lot of abil and concept . at the and of colleg , student get veri variou job and have to learn again what is typic need for their domain . so we never stop to learn , and colleg is there to give us concpet .
