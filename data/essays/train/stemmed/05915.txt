when we turn on the tv , or the radio , or when we read a newspap we can see or listen to or read a lot of advertis . the advertis is the process that show a product and tri to convinc peopl to buy it . mass media are full of advertis , sometim we can say that mass-media are maintain by advertis ( a factori can spend a lot of money to buy space on tv , newspap etc . ) . expeci from the 80 's / 90 's spot 's campaign becam veri veri import to promot product . .. there are factori that spend a lot of money to studi how a spot can influenc the mind of the peopl , and how the spot can be an advantag for the sell of the specif product . the phrase that i 've red is about that most advertis make product seem much better than tey realli are . i complet agre with thi statement . as i said befor , in these last year the promot of the product becam obsess . a lot of product , in tv for exampl , are shown like the `` perfect product '' : they are clean , posit , beauti and expeci veri veri attract . when i wa a littl child i rememb that i 've seen a spot about a game , i do n't rememb the name , but thi is not import . the game wa a plastic man with a lot of blade , car , gun , enemi . .. when i saw thi spot i praid my mother for a lot of time to buy me thi game , and when she bought it i wa realli impress . the man wa smaller , poorer . .. there wa onli 1 blade and not all the gun that were shown in the spot . the problem of the spot is not about child ' game , but is about the lie that are insid of it . you can lie about a game it doe n't matter , but you can not lie for exampl about a food , about someth that can caus danger to a person ( like mcdonald 's for exampl , if you have seen the film `` supers me '' you 'll understand thi ) ... now i do n't pay attent to the spot , ` caus i know that they lie a lot . .. but all peopl do thi ? or i take part to a minimum percentag of peopl that doe n't seem to pay attent to the advertis ? as i said befor advertis are realli strong and can condition the decis of the peopl . .. and thi is a factor that ca n't be left behind .
