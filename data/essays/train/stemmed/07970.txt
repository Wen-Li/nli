the influenc of market in our societi ha been enorm in the last few year . the practic of public also ha chang dramat . from my point of view , compani exagger the person of their product in an outlandish way . thi is unfair for the consum who believ in the authent of the advertis and the messag that buyer are get are not true . first , peopl most of the time are get messag through the media that someth is realli well develop and it qualiti is not compar with noth els . thi is not right as peopl think that the messag send to them is honest , thu they believ whatev they heard . thi is like play game with the peopl . second , when peopl face realiti , it is when they go to buy an item , then they are realiz that what it is offer to them is not what they have shown to them . their realiti come true as someth of veri bad qualiti and the price ask for such item is awkfaulli expens . peopl realiz that the messag wa just an scam in order to get their attent and then go to buy that good . final , peopl who use advertis thi way , they are veri dishonest with their buyer . so , nowaday we have to be veri care about what compani offer us in flayer , newspap and tv . it is veri easi to get someon attent offer the most wonder and perfect item in the world , but it is what we are get . overal , peopl who advertis , they do not regard other peopl as soon as they will be abl to obtain whatev they want . it is their final purpos , regardless the consequ . thi is a veri popular way to get peopl . thu , i agre with the abov statement .
