in my student experi , i often use the memori to learn the fact , in the case of the lesson with a lot of date , name or formula but i 've alway had the fundament idea that studi without understand principl , concept that are at the basi of the fact could be an unus work . in fact , know the einstein 's formula , but then not understand the principl of the graviti energi is not intelling , beacus even if you work onli with your memori . my ph.d. advisor , a professor in coastal engin , does't usual rememb all of the drag coeffici valu that appear in the darci formula but he reflect about it signific and , use the knowledg of the pricip law and the practic sens , is alway abl to give me the more realist valu for all of type of surfac . i often loos thi practic abil to understand the real problem and the idea that is hidden by the formula . for a student , it 's simpler to learn fact , even if often the professor ask them to refer themselv to a specif number , or a particula paragraph of the book . the student , also for thi reason , is use to prefer to learn fact , without realli comphend the gener topic . now i 'm not a student and i know that onli the realli understood concept are place in my mind while all the formula and number that fill my memori in thelast year , are now vanish . so , i usual suggest to my student to understand the concept that are below a formula or a mathemat law and to not learn onli with the memori !!
