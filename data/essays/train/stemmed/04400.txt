frankli speak thi is a difficult question to answer . i think that a lot of peopl would like to answer to thi question becaus thi involv a lot of econom and social interest . howev , i 'll tri to express my idea . when i wa born ( 1970 ) there were fewer car than today and even if the fuel is more and more expens , the insur is veri expens and car are not cheap , the number of car is increas everi year . thi is due to a moder growth of car in the more industri countri but also to a rapid and uninterrupt econom growth of less develop countri . the continu growth all over the world is requir more and more mobil . it 's understood that mobil doe n't mean car onli . you may have train , plane , ship and so on . but car still remain the most diffus vehicl that peopl use to move from one place to anoth place . in my opinion it 's also difficult to think about a reduct of the number of car all over the world . we can think that in the near futur the number of car may declin in big citi due to the traffic which is alreadi chaotic but thi will be compens by an impress growth in other countri ( e.g. china , india and other grow countri ) . that 's whi it 's veri difficult to agre with the initi statement . it 's also true to say that we all hope that the number of car will not bring addit smog . what i hope is that new technolog will allow a more substain growth . some of these new technolog alreadi exist but are simpli more expens than gasolin . but i hope that electr , hydrogen and hybrid vehicl will replac the tradit car and will give us back blue sky , even in the big citi . cristian spallanzani
