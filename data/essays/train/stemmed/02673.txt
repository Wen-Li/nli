for young peopl , life seem not to end . they live their live so fast that old peopl ca n't . there are lot of thing and option for them to do , lot of chice to make . but for old peopl , lot have been live and done , it 's like time pass slower than normal . children are fill with lot of energi that they can spend . they run , they fight , they even do so weird thing that mani of us ca n't even imagin . thi can be seen on almost all the young peopl . have lot of energi and the state of have littl respons caus the young peopl to live their live so fast and funni . when i wa young , i never thought that i would come to an age of 30 . i had no responsibilit other than studi for the exam in school . so i had lot of time to do lot of thing and had so much fun . i enjoy all part of my life until my age of 30 which i am at now . but when i think about my futur , i usual feel depress and a littl bit hopeless , becaus while enjoy life i seem to miss some seriou point in my life like have a seriou job or marri with a nice girl . as poepl grow older , they tend to think more about their futur or care about the peopl they love . they begin to spend their time on these . so the funni and enjoy part of their live slowli fade and they face the other side of the coin . doe thi mean that older peopl miss the enjoy part of the life ? i guess not . .. but consid the younger peopl , i can say it is get rare .
