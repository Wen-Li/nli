i agre with thi statement for mani reson . the first one is young peopl spend their time in other thing . the second , they focus their affort in other staff . the last one , they do not have good support from peopl to help their commun . first of all , young peopl spend most of time in activeti belong to them self not for their commun . for exampl , they spend time in play , visit friend , studi and help each other . secondli , they focus their affort in thing which it give the benefit for them . for exampl , young peopl may do some work with veri hard work if they get money or at least a littel gift which it unforchintli doe not happen often in commun . thirdli , they may not have good support to that nither from school or home . the reson is the school and home - speacili home - told them to do some thing belong to them or make benefit for them without think in sociti . i think young peopl will do some scoiti activ if somebodi give them a littel advies to particip peopl and help them in so mani way . in addit , it is scoiti club ' resbonsebl to help young peopl to give someth to commun where they live . final , they some young do alot of thing to their sociti and still . but the other doe not for reson which are minshond abov . the young peopl have huge enrgi that should everi bodi take care about it .
