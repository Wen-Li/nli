i disagre thi statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i like to travel and i have join a tour group led by a tour guid mani time . but i think i could n't enjoy my travel . now i would like to support my opinion use my experi . first of all , i would like to make a travel plan myself . if i hire a tour guid or join a tour group i could n't go ani plani wherev i want . a tour guid would make our day schedul and we would move and sightse strictli . i want to take my time to see and know a coultur and enjoy the countri or citi where i went . secondli , i would like to research myself . if i hire a tour guid it is easi and convini to know the coultur where i travel . but i like to research myself about the countri or citi 's histori and coultur . actual , i do n't rememb that a tour guid tought me someth onc i hire a guid . that i research myself is more memorizebl for me . final , i do n't want to pay my money for guid and tour compani . now i 'm a student and i do n't have enough money . and tour travel and hire a guid is usual expens for me . so if i would pay my money for a tour guid i want to use my money for food or sourvenior . in concludion , i like to travel individu . a tour compani and a tour guid make our travel plan and do n't give me enogh free time to sightse . and i have to pay expens money . i want to travel myself and meet mani peopl who live in where i travel . i like to know about my coultur and travel freeli becaus i could get good experi and good memori and i 'll think i want to travel somewher again .
