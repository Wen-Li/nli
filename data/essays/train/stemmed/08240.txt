i think success is a thing which can be obtain from hard work and ofcours in some case it may comethrough luck also , but it will not remain for a long time . accord to me `` hardwork is the main concept for success '' and come to success peopl , i think they succed becaus of hardwork . by implement the new idea in the field of busi they have develop their busi . these new idea may be some time riski and may lead to the loss in the busi . but everi success person think that `` failur are the stepe stone to success '' . a success person never and should not be discourag . there is noth new in do the same thing they know and make to run the busi asusu with normalprofit . and that 's also not that much interest in life . accord to me everi busi person in the field of busi think of grow more na more and to reach a higher posit in life . everi person in the field of busi should have zeal to grow up . for exampl take some of the indian who r in one of the top posit in the world and in the countri , those are mr.lakshmi mittal , anil ambani , mukesh ambani , ratan tata , ajim premji . .. etc. , and mani mor . all these person are not born with silver spoon while birth . they have reach their posit by care implement the requir rule and regul for the new idea or thing which are riski . they did not stop their achiev by just do the same busi what they have start first and becom calm . everi person should have a specif scope in order to reach someth new . no person should stop at the level they have aquir and should tri for higher posit . therefor i conclud by agreement that success person tri new thingg and take riska rather than onli do what they know how to do well .
