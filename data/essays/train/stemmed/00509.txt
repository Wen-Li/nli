we are live in a consumpt world . in such a buy-consume-rebuy world advertis constitut a great part of our live even though we are not awar of it . have you ever watch a match or a seri in tv or walk to your local market without see ani advertis ? i guess your answer is no . mani of these advertis are show us how their product is realli nice and high qualiti . do you think are they honest ? my point of view is that most of these advertis make product seem much better than they origin are becaus of the competit both in the market and between the advertis compani . the first reason whi most advertis show product better than they realli are is that there are mani compani that are sell the same product . therefor , there is too much competit in the market . to be abl to compet with other firm and stay in the market , compani spend unbeliev amount of money in advertis and show their product as the ` best ' product that is in sale . as an instanc , in my countri a candi brand call ulker made an advertis in which there wa a quot say that `` you can forget it name , but never it tast . '' when i ate thi candi , i saw no differ in it tast than ani other brand ' candi . secondli , besid the competit between compani that spend money to these advertis , there is also competit between advertis compani . to make their advertis like by the compani that hire them they should prepar the advertis such that they will persuad the compani worker that thi product will be sold . therefor , most of the time advertis compani are exagger the featur or the qualiti of the product in order to be like by the product owner and be hire again in the next time . all in all , becaus of the competit between compani that are produc the product and the compani that are make the advertis , most of the time the product advertis are shown as better than they realli are . thu , consum should be care about those advertis and should not reli on them .
