with the abov made statement , i fulli agre for the follow reason : the best exampl would probabl be the tobaco advertis shown on tv , the cinema or as larg poster at bu station . nobodi could say that smoke is healthi or make you feel free , but a certain brand trye to provok thi pictur by show landscap , cowboy and hors . anoth exampl is the food industri - what they say to be healthi often turn out to be tho opposit , if you onli have a close look at the ingredi list print on the back . but often peopl do n't even realiz what they are consum after have taken a close look at it becaus they do n't have the knowledg interpret the mean of what they read . of cours - not everybodi is a doctor or pharmacist and is awar of the danger that certain thing might becom to our health . and that is one of the point i realli think to be unfair from the froduct firm . to sell bigger quantiti of their product , they willingli make believ peopl wrong thing . especi for children those advertis might be danger as they even know less about what healthi and unhealthi substanc can do to your bodi . they just want to do , have , eat or drink everyth they are told is good , brandnew , cool . and so do their friend . conclud my essay i would like to outlin that of cours thi is not the case for everi product or even ` most ' as is written in the statement . it would be unfair to declar advertis to be gener fals , dishonest or danger . there definetli are advertis which state the truth about their product ! mani adversit even show a houmor content and can be realli amus . - for these reason we can see show at tv contain the ` funniest tv spot of the world ' - what an enrich to our tv program !
