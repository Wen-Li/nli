learn is like aquir knowledg . as we ca n't measur the depth of the ocean , in the same way we ca n't measur the depth of knowledg . we are alway learn someth like if you are watch some thing then at that time you are learn . now peopl are learn in two way . first they can aquir the thing form understandind the idea and concept logic or they mugup the thing and do not want to understand the idea behind that . well in my point of view we should alway tri to learn someth logic . for ex.if you want to learn about the math and you want to rememb the formula 's associ with that . in thi case if you tri to mugup all the formula 's rather then understand the logic behind that , then definit after some time you ca n't rememb it . on the other hand if learn it with the help of concept and the fact behind them then you can easyili memor them amd you also get the knowledg about how to use them . let take the anoth exampl , if you want to learn about the electron , and you want to learn that how to make a circuit , then at that time if you do n't know about the basi thing and requir then you can not even make the simpl think . on the other hand if you have the knowledg about all the thing then you can easili make anyth whatev you want to make . on the top of that if choss the right way to learn the thing like with the help of exampl and figur then you can memor them easili and with the faster speed . you can also consult with the expert of the particul subject , who give you the batter explan of the topic then you can understand it more accur . even if you have all the idea about ani thing then it will also help you to solv the aptitud question in examin , which need the concept behind the subject . lastli , if you want to learn some thing then it alway need an extra affert and need logic behind that , if you clear thi stage then no one in the world , are abl to wash your memori .
