some peopl prefer to divid theirselv to sever area and know a littl thing about mani subject while other prefer to get deepli inform on one subject . base on my experi i strongli believ that a person should special in one subject . there will never be enough time to get deep knowledg of all the subject and there are sever advantag of specialz in one subject , easi to reach success and live iin a more organ way and it unfortun there is a big time problem in recent year . i mean there is a lot of thing to do but not enough time for them . peopl should use their time veri econom . tri to get knowledg in mani differ area is a big time lost ; moreov it is a challeng idea . due to the high respons there will never be enough time to realli understand all of the topic , no one is so intellig . in addit , i do n't believ that a person can reach success by give hi or her interest in differ area . i had such a friend that encount such a situat . we werw at the same class , he get everytim high grade . then he decid to studi architectur besid chemic engin and at the same time he play guitar in a bar . after thi decis hi grade declin significiantli : moreov he loos hi job becaus he wa so tire and could n't give good perform . to be an accomplish worker a person should have detail inform of hi subject . without know all the aspect of a subject no one can do a good job . becaus he or she would n't have appropri knowledg to use when heor she confront a problem . a person is go to live in a more organ way by studi one subject , becaus all the thing that he ha to do dure a day will be fix . there will not be ani disord to disrupt hi day . in conclus i prefer to special in one susject rather than have broad knowledg of mani subject becaus i believ that there are sqarc time to deal with mani subject , it is easier to reach succss
