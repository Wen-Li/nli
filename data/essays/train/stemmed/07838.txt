nowaday , a lot of student go to univers becaus their parent whant to , but it is not their desit . first of all , we can discuss the point what the sentenc want to tell us with the word `` understand idea and concept '' . undersand a chemestri fomul it will be problabl hard . to understand a math concept can be mayb easi . but student realli care about understand ? i do not sure becaus the actual student in hing school or secondari school just think at the moment and not for the problem they mayb can find in the futur at univers . on the second point we can discuss the second point in the subjet , it the `` leran fact '' . that is clear to say that leran and memoris mean or formul in ani subject than to understand or mayb tri to understand someth . we problabl do not understand it whi ? i think it problabl becaus we don-t realli think about the futur and just to the present , carp diem , we problabl need or tri to understand too all of the formul or the mean of all of the subject . i think it will be easier for us to understand the idea and concept to help us to learn fact to us , becaus if we do not understand someth we can realli learn as good as we realli understand . we mayb do not have the experi as an student in univers , but at the end of the hing school we need to start think about thi . i am disagre with thi sentenc becaus all of student now want to learn and they doe not matter if they do not understand , they just want to know to do , for exempl a math exercic for their exam to have a good grade , without think to the futur .
