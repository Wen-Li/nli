i agre with the statement . but i do n't mean that young peopl are nowaday unkind but mean that they are look at other place , not thier commun . for exampl , mani young peopl want to go oversea to help other peopl . it is a kind of trend among young peopl to particip in project of npo or other group do volunt activ . in actual , i saw mani time the advertis of such kind of project , tour or distribut . even though travel agenc offer those special tour that tie up with those activ group . so i can say that it 's veri veri common and popular to help poor peopl or distruct green . but i do n't think they are realli seriou about the comun around them . probabl they do someth for their commnun , but will not give enough time to do that . there are two reason . the one is becaus of grobal . we learn so mani thing about other countri from mani sourc and some of young peopl can learn it directli . they could get to know the peopl in south africa sufferd and hunger . these knowledg is enough for them to particip in the tour for deliv food and comod for the peopl in south africa . the anoth , is also relat with that . everyth of other countri is veri differ from thing that they have . food , custom and cultur . these thing are veri interest for young peopl , and it make them take to other countri . they can learn atract and new thing , and some of them are realli abusolut in thing of other countri . compar with thing gs other contri , thing around them is less atract . so that 's whi they are not veri interest in their commun .
