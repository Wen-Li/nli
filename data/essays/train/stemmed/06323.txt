i fulli agre with the caption statement . as a member of young peopl gener , i believ that we should find much more time to dedic to and help our commun . the societi in which we current live put al lot of pressur on young gener in order to push them to think about their studi and their carrer . the messag that young peopl receiv from famili , school , work are not orient to develop a feel of the commun where they live . on my opinion , our societi is build selfish peopl concentr on their own interest and goal . i am current leav in milan , the busi capit of itali . in milan the feel of live in a commun is quit disappear . by thi , i mean that we are all concentr on our project and we work so hard that we do not have time to think about ourselv . we all live as singl peopl with amazingli work hour that do not allow to think or to find spare time for a commun . thi mechanin is completli wrong becaus it destroy the sens of commun and all the benefit that a commun can bring . i rememb , when i wa live and studi in a small villag where my parent current live , befor move to milan , that i alway appreci the exist of a commun . we all knew eachoth at that time , becaus the villag wa veri small . if someon need help , everon wa will to give their support . the famili in the commun were veri close to eachoth . i person grew up with mani other children of other famili of the commun and we were oblig to help peopl with some difficulti . i rememb that i wa teach at that time italian languag to foreign littl children , come from africa but live in our commun , and i wa so happi to be of help . in conclus , i believ that commun are veri import for our live . they can greatli contribut to our need . for thi reason , young peopl should keep aliv the sens of commun and make a lot of effort in find time to help their commun . i can affirm that help your commun can be veri reward and that life is not onli made by your person goal and career .
