young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do i am truley agre with thi statement . i support thi statement becaus young peopl are with full of energi and power to enjoy and celebart each of their day as a festiw . on the contrast old peopl have littl energi to enjoy . as time paas the old peopl are becom less energet , emot weak and depend on young peopl in everi aspect of life . anoth reason , i support thi statement is young peopl are full of sprit as they have not seen the hardship of life and they have the companion or a partner to enjoy with them , on the other hand , old peopl have seen mani problem and they usual stay alon as their partner are not with them or their children are far away . they either are studi or they left them alon in long journey of life . furthermor , the young peopl are well in everi aspect such as health . they are also independ finenci . wherea old peopl they are not healthi social and as well as mental and they have to depend finenci on other . and in the last i would say becaus of chang pattern of life the true meanig of enjoy is lost . now a day peopl are becom veri materialst and parctic and they tri to within themselv . but in older time peopl use to enjoy with other and were veri social . last but not the least to enjoy life age is not the limitaion , you should have tendenc to enjoy ever aspect of life . and young peopl should take care of their elder and tri to enjoy with them also
