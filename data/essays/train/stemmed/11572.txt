some peopl like to tri new thing and are n't afraid of take risk . but take risk and tri new thing make peopl succes ? in my opinion the key to success is to take risk and tri new thing which doe n't exist . first of all , without take risk peopl can onli remain the place where they are . onli do what they alreadi know how to do well help them to stay where they are and doe n't give ani opportun to make a good career in their life . i claim that take risk is a veri danger way of be succesful . becaus there is noth guraanti after take the risk and tri new thing . the end could be veri miser . but consid the benefit and the award of take risk and tri new thing , take risk are prefer than do alway the same thing . secondli , take risk can give veri good vision to see the world in a differ way and affect the cultur of peopl in a good way . as a simpl exampl , tri a new kind food is veri hard thing to do for most of the peopl . peopl would prefer eat the same kind of food all the time . but one who tri the new kind food gain a knowledg about thi kind and hi cultur about food increas . to think take risk in busi , for exampl , think about a factori which is produc the same kind of product sinc the first day , can onli earn littl amount of money becaus the product is old and could be produc by other factori and the demand is reduc to thi product . but a new factori that tri a new product and take risk by make an invest to produc the new product can be veri profit and earn better than the other factori . in conclus , if peopl want to be success in ani area of the life should not be afraid of take risk and tri new thing . thi will bring the succeess to them .
