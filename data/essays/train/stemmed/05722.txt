even though it is call the age of special , it is much better to have the broad knowledg of mani subject . i have heard some peopl say that in the special age , as we call , it is not necessari to have all kind of knowleg on mani subject , becaus tri to equip all knowleg will make peopl busi and final wast their time result in failur . an pastor i have known for sever year , mani time told me about thi . he is energet and activ . he alway tri to do hi best in hi field . but the result seem not to be veri success . one day he preach `` nowaday student have been so busi and tire of lear too mani subject which are not relat to their major . becaus of thi , they seem not to have their own specif knowledg that they can use for the benefit of thi societi . they have broad knowledg but not veri use for their success . '' thi sound ridicul . whenev he ha given sermon , he wa veri monoton and made the saint bore and sleepi . noth interest . there were mani kind of peopl in the church and they had differ background of their major . but he alway use same and rutin articl . suppos that you are listen same stori almost everytim ! who can endur it . when some christian gave him a question , he had no idea , even he could n't join other convers with other . it wa a fiasco . have univers and gener knowledg on mani academ subject can help peopl have broad reationship and success social life . and the enorm knoledg will support hi specif field and lead to good success .
