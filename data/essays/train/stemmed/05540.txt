i think most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first , the motiv for produc to make their product seem better than they realli are is that produc want to convinc consum to buy their product . today 's competit among compani in busi world is like wartim . for a compani to surviv and make profit a compani need to sell as mani product as possibl and rais revenu . second , a compani can make product seem better than they realli are becaus consum do not have enough inform about product . even though compani make fals comment about product consum can not tell comment are true or fals . some consum may be too busi to look for inform to judg whether comment are made correctli or not . also , the fact that the function of the product in market are not veri differ play a role in make fals advertis . sinc the function of the product in market are so similar to each other consum will be easili convinc to buy product if consum hear comment by produc that point onli to strong point of product and exagger the featur of the product . third , peopl are more easili convinc by visual imag than other type . if a product look better than other product , a consum might want to buy that product even without obtain inform regard fuction . in conclus , produc make product seem much better than they realli are through advertis becaus produc want to surviv in competit and consum do not have proper inform and are more suscept to visual imag .
