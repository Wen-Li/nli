the question mention two type of knowledg . have broad knowlegd of mani subject and special in one subject . have a broad knowlegd mean a lot of subject but less inform . special in one subject mean less subject but tonn more inform . they both have advanteg and disadvantag . have a broad knowledg of mani subject mean that you have less infrom about mani subject . have knowlegd on a wide rang of subject is a good thing becuas it mean that you understand a lot about mani thing . howev as it will be onli broad mean that you will onli get the basic infrom you need , therefor thi wont be enough to answer or fulfil certain thing . i think you should onli have a broad knowledg of thing when you want to be gener in thing you should do . exampl a gener doctor should have a broad knowledg of what differ diseas are and their symptom . special in one subject mean you onli do one subject but you concentr on it and you will get more inform about the subject you are do . by special in one subject it mena that you will have more time to concentr on the subject you are do which will make you as a person an expert in that subject . in some profess you will need to special in one subject , such as be a profess in a colleg or univers . exampl and geolog lectur should specialis in geolog , thi will make him have more infrom about geolog as he will have more time to concentr on what he is do and learn . thi will result in a more effieci professor ! from my point of you i see that they both are good and benefici depend on what you are go to do i the futur and what you think is good for you . if you want to know that basic of mani subject and have be a bank of basic infrom that go for a broad knowledg of mani academi subject . on the other hand if you want ot be an expert in what you aar do then specialis in the subject that you want to be an expert in as you will have a much greater knowledg about your subject , thi is laso becuas you will have more time to concentr on your subject .
