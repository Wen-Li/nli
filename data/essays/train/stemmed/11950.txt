in my opinion it better for me to special in one specif subject , becaus if i special in mani academ subject i 'll get distract and i would'nt manag to pass in all of the subject for exampl i want to studi gener mass commun but when i thought about it i figur that i ca n't manag to to studi four subject , so i pictur my self for futur and i thought that adverts would be veri good for me if i pass my toel hope , and some of the peopl have job i mean part time job so their job make studi harder for them , and am not say that if peopl want to have broad knowleg of mani academ subject is wrong , half of the peopl can manag and the other half ca n't , that whi peopl should know thier abil of understandig and wroke hard unless they should special in one subject , but i dont mind tri to studi more than one subject and if i do handl it i will continu it veri good to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , it is veri useful for futur and for your futur job and you will have the apportun to work in so mani field if you did n't like a job you can move from it and go work in other job but as i said peopl should know thi abil if they can or if they ca n't so they could manag themselv .
