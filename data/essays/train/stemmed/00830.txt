i believ that while peopl who keep do what they know they can do well can be success for a certain period of time , they will eventu have to turn to someth differ and tri new thing in order to stay success in the long run . thu , peopl who are success over long period of time are usual character by the willing to give up the familiar and to `` explor the unknown '' , that is to tri out differ thing even if they do not know how it will turn out . in the short run , peopl can be success by cling to what they know how to do well if they are do someth which other can not copi easili . consid , for instanc , a painter who master a certain techniqu of paint which is popular among buyer of art and which other painter can not copi . thi painter may be success even if there is not much altern , say , in the theme of her paint , becaus she is the onli one who can produc such work of art and peopl are will to buy them . but success base on keep do what one can do well may not be of long durat . let us continu the exampl of the painter introduc abov : other painter may tri to copi the artist 's paint techniqu and theme , an eventi they may manag to do so . if so , the work of art of the painter who had use thi special techniqu first do not ani longer stand out as much as they use to becaus other have gain the abil to reproduc similar work of art . in order to stay success , our painter may now have to tri out someth differ : for instanc , develop a new techniqu or turn to differ theme . she will have to explor new way of paint . if she manag to do so in a way which friend of art find appeal , she will again be one or sever step ahead of her `` competitor '' , and she will continu be success and reknown as a painter . a similar logic can be appli to the case of industri product . a person who invent a new kind of product and who is the first to introduc it to the market will be success in sell thi product at a high price and will make profit if custom like thi product . howev , over time competitor will manag to copi the product or suppli similar substitut . thu , the produc will have to decreas the sale price of hi product if he still want to sell it , and hi profit will be reduc . in order to keep profit on their previou high level , the produc will have to conduct research in order to invent and introduc new product ; that is , he will have to give up the familiar and tri out someth differ . therefor , i believ that peopl who are success over long period of time are peopl who are will to tri new thing instead of simpli keep do what they know they can do well .
