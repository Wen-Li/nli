the issu at hand is whether it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ field or to special in one subject . thi question is not easi to answer , becaus i am convinc that thi question is not abl to be answer gener . i believ that there are sever point which do not support that knowledg of mani subject is the better option and there are sever one which do . a disadvantag of have broad knowledg is that thi sometim mean , that you are less familiar with each subject . sometim in work life it is realli import to have a subject you are realli good at and not sever one you are less good at . if a compani is search for a new translat for english , it doe not help that an applic is also abl to speak french and italian , if the result is that the english skill are onli good instead of veri good . but i am also quit sure that special on onli one subject could be disadvantag , becaus it is alway import to be interest in and to have skill except your specif subject . some job requir skill in mani differ field . teacher are a good exampl . for be a good english teacher it is not enough to speak english veri well . a teacher should also have knowledg about didact , psycholog and pedagog , becaus he must be abl to teach , to commun and to handl student in a appropri way . addit , there are some skill , call soft skill , everbodz should have and which is more import that acedam knowledg . be abl to work in a team is a good exampl . it doe not help you to know everyth about a knowledg , if you are not abl to work in a project group . in conclus , i am quit certain that a mix of both , special in a subject and also have a broad knowledg is the best option .
