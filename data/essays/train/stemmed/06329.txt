i believ those who think there will be fewer car in the futur are wrong for sever reason . it is usual fanci to think that the world will chang in radic way in twenti year , and by radic i mean our great depend on car for transport . for that to happen we must be introduc to newer mean of transport that will be cheap and avail and that should provid sever advantag such as be faster and not have traffic problem . the onli innov that might help reduc the number of car is telepor , that is transfer of matter from one place to anoth via light wave . howev , thi is unlik to take place and catch up in twenti year . anoth possibl invent that might take up the place of car might be small airplan that use highway in the air , but sinc we will veri probabl still call these vehicl ` car ' the total number will not decreas . and as in my previou discuss , the price of these vehicl will be too exorbi to make they good buy , at least for the averag consum . the onli argument that might favor a reduct in the number of car is the impend scarciti of petroleum and the entail increas in oil price . thi argument can not hold becaus scientist will have invent new energi sourc that can replac today 's oil . in fact there is one more possibl reason for peopl 's final give up their car and decid to walk to their destin . peopl , especi those live in big citi , may say that they are fed up with traffic and regret the year they lose in traffic , and thu discontinu drive forev . come to think of it there is still anoth possibl explan for fewer car . mayb peopl will becom veri conciou and conscienti creatur in the follow twenti year and say that they have pollut the environ , stress themselv out , and harm their physic health more than enough . thi way they will send their car to junkyard for recycl and contribut to world economi . sure enough , each of these assumpt is beyond the reason limit of the mind . therefor , i can safe asum that in twenti year there will be more car in our street that there are today .
