in my opinion most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , but i think it 's the market way . it 's absolut comprens that a compani want seem an hi product better than it realli is ; a compani , in fact , have to see multipl factor , like for exampl the actract of the market , the other concorr compani and in thi situat the impact with the custom is fundament . we can think , to understand the concept , how much advertis is watch on tv ; if a messag is reicev from a lot of peopl , a certain product can be buy from a larg part of the popul . probabl thi way is not ethic correct ; a person can be fascin from a particular type of product , after the wiew of the advertis , and then he can discov that thi product is not what he expect . but i repeat that thi is the market law , so the compani ca n't make in other term . i think the posit way of thi process is that a good product can have a lot of visibl wih the advirtis . my mind goe , for exampl , to linux , an altern softwar ; most of it 's expert say it 's better then window , but it doe n't have the necessari visibl ( and mani other factor : for exampl linux is not organ as a compani like hi concorr ) to fight it . in mani case i have choosen a product for the fantast advertis of that product ; i like veri much coca - cola , i ever buy it , probabl i 'd prefer pepsi , but i have never buy it , becaus i 'm a fanat custom of coke , in part for hi beauti advertis , that remind me when wa a chld . in other word , a lot of advertisemnet can decid the consum of a produc
