some peopl believ that older peopl enjopi life less than young peopl , becaus the young peopl are activ , erenget and mayb have more time . but in my opinion , it is not ture , there are at least three reason for my believ . first of all , most older peopl have their clear goal for their live , after more experi , they know more the more mean of live , and know themselv more . then they could easili choos their type of ilv base on the real surround . it is excit and meaning thing to churs up the goal they have . so they will feel enjjoy dure the time to get goal . anoth import reason of my believ is that the older peopl have more chanc to do the thing they want , becaus they have abil to arrang their time and have enough money to help the ti \ hing they want come true . for instanc , mani peopl like travl , no matter young peopl or older one , but the young peopl it is much more difficult to have a comfort trip than older peopl . obveri , the young must face to much problem , the last but no least reason for me is the older peopl experi more will understand more fact of the problem in everyday live , they can easilli face to the bad thing which can not chang , avoid bad thing befor it happen , solv the problem which had been happen . on the other hand , older peopl cherish the beauti moment more than the young peopl , becaus they understand it is difficult to have the changc . so in front of the real life , even bad thing happen , older peopl will have more enjoyth to do
