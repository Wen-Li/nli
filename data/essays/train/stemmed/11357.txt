first of all . i agre with `` most advertis make product seem much better than thi realli are. '' becaus if i have compani then i make some advertis for some product . and i show them in the tv for the peopl , also i show them in the street , but i shwo them in a bad way . i mean they were seem bad or ugli . then nobadi go to by anyth from my commpni . they go to put ex on it ( all the peopl gone to heat it ) . ani way ani one want to make an advertis have to show them seem gret way . to attreact peopl to that kind of product wich mide the advertis for it . here is the exampl for two peopl mide two advertis for two diffrent kind of baybi milk . the first ont show the baybi milk with darti stuff and with sick child . also the pearson show that advertis with bad music . the second one show the baybi milk with clean stuff and with cutt baybi . also with nice music . now here is the bottom line . the peopl who wictch the two advertis , wich kind of milk they are go to buy ? . difnlay the second one , becaus it ha realli great stuff and realli great way to ahwo the baybi milk . that even in other product . iti depend how the product show . and wht the gift come with it . also if it ha good offer or not . i mean it is depend how is the product shwo . that wa my opinion if i agre or disagre with `` most advertis make product seem much better than the realli are . '' and igre with that .
