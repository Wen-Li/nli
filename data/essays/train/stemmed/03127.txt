in my opinion it is veri import to combin both the situat and i do not think that one fact is more import then the other . everi educ program should involv theori and then support the theori with a larg number of fact to confirm the previou . i would like to give an exampl on what i am tri to explain . in histori we can find and evalu how idea and concept can not be separet from fact . the second world war wa a result of the idea that the white race wa superior to ani other human be in the world . the nazi idea of be superior wa support by intellectu peopl scientest , propaganda and mass media . as a matter of fact the german were convinc that they nation wa the strongest and power nation in the world . now the consequ of that period in histori are well known around the globe , and the fact demonstr that the idea wa wrong and danger . so i think it is veri import to correl idea and fact becaus it is not necessarili true that an idea that seem brilliant pace and fair ha alway posit consequ when we tri to put it in practic . i talk about the german but i also could talk about the communist theori and it applic in sever countri . a doctrin that seem fair and just reveald not to be a good econom system . as a result million of peopl die becaus of thi idea . it is veri import to understand the consequ of what an idea or a simpl concept might lead to . it is also vital for student to estim what exactli a concept is in the real world . an idea it is in fact someth abstract . in my opinion it is alway better to compar someth re
