my person opinion toward thi matter is that a person with a specialis academ subject tend to be more success than someon who ha a good gener overview of most subject . by thi i do not mean that a person with a specialis subject is more knowledg than a well round person . someon who ha studi a subject in depth and ha receiv a degre for it , will be more prone to get a good job in their field of studi than someon who ha a wider gener knowledg but a shadier knowledg in a certain particular field . nowaday , a degre is perhap the most essenti element requir in order to get a good job due to the increas competit for place . therefor , somebodi who lack thi degre will not be as like to get the job as someon who ha perfect their field of studi , as the latter is like to be more effici and to provid a compani with a differ and wider approach of the subject requir . notwithstand that it is import to specialis in a field of studi , it is also essenti to have a wide understand of other aspect in life which could be help toward a career . through past experi , i have encount peopl who concentr on a subject and are probabl near to be the best at it . howev , i have also notic that some of these peopl lack basic skill such as socialis with other . thi is not a generalis , but a partial observ . in conclus , it is vastli import to have a good knowledg of a certain field of studi , but optim , it would be better to have an equilibrium between the two , have a broad gener knowledg as well as know substantiali about a certain topic .
