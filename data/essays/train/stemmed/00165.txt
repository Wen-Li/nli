i realli hope that in few year the number of car go down ! today the car in our citi are too much : our air is drammat pollut and thi is becaus of the car ; there is also a lot of traffic and sometim you take one hour to go onli on the other side of your citi . i think that today all of peopl and govern have understand that the problem is big and import : probabl in the next year they are go to approv some polit in order to reduc the number of car and to offer some substitut servic or to improv the one that exist . i 'm speak about bu , for short or medium travel , and train . i think that the govern and the citizen af all the word have to cri to obtain thi . i think that petrol compani and car industri that probabl want the number of car increa in the next day ; ca n't be heard by the govern becaus the most import thing are our wealth and qualiti of life . for a famili of four person is today quit normal to have two or three car . i think thi is veri danger for our societi . if there are a lot of car the problem is first of all the pollut , that i think is drammat import and is necessari a solut veri soon . other problem are the traffic and the park . for all these reason i think that there will not be fewer car in use in the next year becaus is realli danger for the popul . if the number of car increa i would be veri warri and i think we will have a lot of problem for our wealth . so i hope that the uman is not so stupid to loke more at the posses , like car , than at the wealth .
