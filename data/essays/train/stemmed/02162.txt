nowayday , there is a great gener gap between the youth and older peopl . sometim they are quit distinguish from other . it wa gener agre that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . but in my opinion , i do n't agre to the opinion . in the first place , mani young peopl enjoy their life so much . they are veri modern and familiar with all the new-com product . for instanc , internet , electron product , and newli convent are made great use of by them . they realiz what the real world is and have their ideal life style . their idea is to make the world color , funni and full of signific . onli by do thing for the societi can they feel real happi . oppositli , there still remain a larg number of young peopl who are do noth everyday . if they were ask what they are do , they would answer they were enjoy . they drink , do sport , play comput game , chang boy/girlfriend frequent , rob money or small item from children and do whatev they can . is it a real `` enjoy '' ? absolut no ! ignor the bad thing they made , they lead to bad impact to the societi . from the view of some peopl , older peopl are consid to be outdat . but to my surpris , in some case they can enjoy their life much more than young peopl . in spite of their weak bodi , they will be laugh everytim . see the sun rise from the east , they will get up , do exersic and listen to the radio . they will fill up their life with happi . after they concern about the current affair , they will note down their thought and send to the gover . in citi , they will be a volunt . the traffic manag , cleaner or a `` move map '' are shown ever all in all , both young peopl enjoy life .
