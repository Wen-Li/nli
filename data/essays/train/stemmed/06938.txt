i do n't agre the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . from my point of view , understand the idea and concept and learn the fact have equal import becaus at first without fact idea and concept ca n't be understood . let me explain thi with a person experi , i 'm studi textil engin at univers , in all class our lectur tell us the fact about textil materi and the fact about how they are produc . and then we argu on how we can improv the materi qualiti and product techniqu and in the end of the lesson lectur give his/her idea about them . by thi way we learn the fact about the materi and product techniqu and understand the idea and concept about improv them even we can creat our own idea . but if we do n't clearli know what the featur of the textil materi are and how it 's produc we can neither understand the idea of the lectur about improv them nor creat our own idea . secondli , if you both know the fact and understand the idea and concept about a certain topic then you totali know the topic . for exampl in an art class if some exampl of draw of leonardo da vinci are shown and the date of them are given , it 's good you have seen how leonardo da vinci 's paint look like . but what about the idea behind these draw ? if the lectur tell you his/her opinion about what he might think while make these draw or encourag you to imagin leonardo 's mood while make these draw then you can have a total knowledg about leonardo da vinci 's art . in conclus in order to gain the exact knowledg of a certain topic at first student should learn fact and then understand idea and concept . educ system should be organ accord to thi logic from primari school to univers in order to rais well educ and intellectu student .
