in my point of vew as a young person i would say that , obvious young peopl enjoy life more that old peopl do becaus all the advantag that you have as young person in term of movement , flexibl , energi to do thing , how enjoy thing look to you etc . also to me it seem bor how the older peopl live and thi is in part for how the tv and the societi present us , ( young peopl ) , how we should live life when we grouw up , no more play arround and do fun thing but work and work all day to get to your home and onli sleep . from the other side i shuld n't be abl to say exactli which of both life are better enjoi , becaus as i said i am still a young person and i do n't know what is to live as an older man and what activ do they have to enjoy themselv becaus as all the differ par of live there is alwis someth to entretain you , for exampl when you are a babi what you enjoi most wa all the littl teddi berar , when you are a kid all the toy and littl car made you enjoy life , when tou are a teenag the videogam came to your life to stop your bor aftrenoon and night and now at my age what i enjoy most and what make meenjoy life is to hang out with my friend , have some drink and arriv late home . as i said previous futher on in life there should be some other thing that entretain you in life and not onli base it in work , thig such as real car , women and even get marri and have some kid to form a famili and to abl to mantain it and see your children grow , and mayb when you are and old man your entratain would be that your son and grendson come to visit you and your wife everi weekend . in conclusuon i woul 'd like to say , that is impos to determin which , young or old peopl enjoy more life , it all depend in what you do in your life , and simpli that enjoy everith you do .
