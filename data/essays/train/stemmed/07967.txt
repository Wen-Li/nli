i do not agre with the statement that the number of car will be smaller in number in near futur than they are today . it is evid that the traffic within the citi center is get wors each day and the public transport is gain increas import . especi around big citi , like istanbul which i am live in , it is true that peopl are increasingli avoid car usag due to the abov mention reason and have the tendenc to use public transport or taxi etc. instead , which might lead one to think that the number of car will decreas in time . howev ; there are other dimens of the subject . first of all , even if some peopl are becom increasingli reluct to use their car in citi , most of them still feel it necessari to have one . the reason vari . one could be privaci , which you can not have with public transport . the other could be avail ; all of us have experienc not be abl to find a taxi when you have an import appoint . your car is alway at your servic and is actual a medium for independ . besid , the increas number of suburban live area make the peopl live there almost total depend on car as public transport is wider and more frequent around citi center . final , due to increas technolog and the satur level of the market , car come to the consum at lower cost when compar to past . the compani are extend product rang to cover the maximim number of consum within a wider rang of econom statu . therefor car are more afford and also conveni to use compar to last two to three decad . i think these improv will continu with an accelar speed and car will reach a wider rang of popul . even if the frequenc of the usag of an individu car might decreas , i think the total number of car in use could onli increas dure the next twenti year regard the abov mention reason .
