most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are i agre with the abov statement . today the best way to sell a product is through advertis . so you have to show the product in a much better manner even though the product is not good . i will explain the reason in the follow paragraph . first , for exampl advertis for a wash powder or liquid . in the media whether it t.v or radio they advertis by show that by use littl amout of powder of liquid you can wash mani cloth and make them shine a new . but in real you need more powder to wash the cloth to get rid of dirt and the about the shine , they do n't shine as they show on t.v. it onli the mean to attract peopl by exaggreg the product . second , let take tele shop as exampl in thi they advertis product and explain it use and they also show how it work , and show the result , now let take exercis machin , they say by work on thi machin you can build good muscl by show the person in the t.v. but in real you can not make good muscl as they show on t.v. becaus they use onli well train and well build muscl man to advertis . sometim it is difficult for us to perform some exercis becaus we need some trainer to help use do some excercis when you are do for the first time . let talk about the drug they show on t.v . they advertis the drug by tell about the use and advantag but they do not tell about the disadvantag of the drug and the sideeffect of the drug , who should take the drug all thi inform is not advertis on the media . becaus you are creat a neg impress on the drug . in conclus i like to say that watch the advertis do some research on the product and then plan to buy the product . in thi way you do n't wast time and money behind the product that never give you the result . so think while you act .
