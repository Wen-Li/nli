i think most peopl think that the most import is a learn . thu , i disagre with thi statement that it is more import for stduent to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact beacus student need to know about the fact . moreov , if studnet know the fact , they can have higher quiliti convers . first of all , student have to know about the fact becaus they are an idividu in the world . for exampl , i have read a news about a girl . one day , she walk to home . she felf that someon wa follow her . she wa afraid of it . she wish the other man live same apart . a man kept follow her and the other man also wa follow her . when she arriv at home , she had to take an elev . the man who walk with her , he also took same elev and got off same floor . he talk to her that there were a man who is murder so i follow you . thi happen wa realli seriou . moreov , after she got thi experiecn , she realiz that the fact is so difficult . in addit , if student learn fact , they can talk to adult about it . for exampl , i alway talk to my father about societi . my father also tell me mani thing about it . thu , when i talk to anoth older peopl , i can talk to them veri easili . in conclus , i strongli believ that it is the most import for student to learn fact becuas they can have experi and when we talk to peopl , opposit peopl think that we are smart .
