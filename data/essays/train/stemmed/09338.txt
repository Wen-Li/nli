no , i wont agre with the statement , in my opinion just simpli know and understand idea and cocept is not suffici know the fact is veri import , just simpli know concept doesnot help in all case , know the fact about the thing is veri import then onli we can know wheather the thing which we understood are correct or not . in some case without know the fact we can not come to the conclus . fact should be known . there is a chanc of get mislead simpli by understand concept and agre the thing , in such case fact are veri use fact are real thing which we can see or tast . simpli uderstand the concept will help the student upto some extent onli that mean upto exam onli , but in case of kow the fact it will be help in futur when the same problem repeat in futur . the concept are those that are simpli print in the book or said by the professor in the colleag but fact are those which we see directli in the lab or in daili life . for exampl if we take an experi in a lab if we do it by ourself and the both if the expect and the result match then we can say that the experi ha pass . other wise simpli listen to the professor about the experi may or may not give the expect result , there ari lot of doubt , therefor after onc if we perform the experi there is no chanc of get doubt in the whole life time about that experi . at some extent understand is enough but in all case it wont work . especi in work of get import such as civil engin work , mechan work do the test person and know all the fact about all the product and materi onli the work can be complet success . understand the concept are use upto the exam point of view , after that we may forget them but about know fact they wont never be foget . thi is how know fact is import when compar to understand fact and perform them .
