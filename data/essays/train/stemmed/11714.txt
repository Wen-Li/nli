no matter where you go , what you do or what your educ background might be , you will be confront with advertis everi singl day . you see them in newspap , magazin on televis , even at bu station . that whi it is no wonder that compani spend thousand of dollar for the market of their product . in my opinion it is true that that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . becaus most compani spend a signific amount of money to advertis their product , they obvious want as mani peolp as possibl to buy their product . in order to do that , they must make their product sound as good as possibl , probabl even better than the product of their competitor . to be abl to do that compani need to make sure that all the emphasi is on the posit featur their product obtain . and therefor also tri to hide all the imperfect a product might have . if you take a look at just the advertis in a magazin , you can alreadi tell if it is a magazin that is suppos to be read by femal or male . if you think about a veri well known magazin for women like instyl , you find one ad for lipstick after the next . everi singl one of them tell you how uniq the lipstick is and what great featur it ha , but none of them point out ani neg thing like if they are produc in a 3rd world countri or if ani anim were use for the test of it . compani need to make sure that their product stand out and that peopl feel they desper need it in order to get peopl to buy their product in particular and not a similar one of anoth brand . compani tri to give the reader of a magazin the feel that they are onli young and hip and fit in with everyon els if they own their product . that is whi in my opinion product often seem so much better when they are advertis than they realli are . not onli becaus compani put the emphasi on the posit thing but becaus they tri to hide the thing that would make their product much more difficult to sell .
