sinc mani year and among the histori of the human , the use of the car as alway be import and in some case indispens . nowaday , the situat is chang and we are face to a problem : do we still have to use our car while mani factor influenc us to use other solut or to use less the car ? in my opinion , i would rather say that in twenti there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , it is import to remind the actual situat on earth . the cost of ga is extrem high and more than befor . we can also say that it might continu to grow for mani year . whi ? to serv interest of the govern and power peopl who lead nation or corpor . i think that peopl know that the ga ' price is too expens and will continu to increas year after year . moreov , it is relev to say that the car ' cost is as much expens as the gas'cost . in fact , today , if we want to buy a new car it cost a lot of money and in mani case , some famili need to borrow money to get one . it is becom a luxuri product . it is use to say that household are bore of thi import growth . they would like to find other solut in order to avoid take their car . then , one of the most import thing in our societi today is the protect of the environ . how mani household would stop use their car and find other way of transport in order to `` save the earth '' ? a lot . i think so . the pollut due to the ga , the problem encount with the forest all around the world becom more and more familiar to the popul . and i realli think that peopl feel more and more concern by that . by the way , it is import to notic that sinc a few month , we can assist to the develop of a new form of transport such as the commom transport ( bu , train ) and the come back of the bicycl in the big citi for exampl . in my opinion , the best exampl to prove that is the citi of berlin . in fact , i wa impress when i went over there for the first time , becaus we can see bicycl everywher around us and peopl tend to use those new form of transport more and more . i realli like thi idea which spread out in mani citi today . final , we can say that the motiv of be a good citizen , the increas of the cost of the ga and the car , will hope help peopl use less and less their car and prefer bicycl or common transport . i realli believ that in twenti year , peopl will find other way to go from a place to anoth . it depend on mani factor but one of the most import is the motiv . i hope that peopl will take these piec of inform into account in oder to chang the futur and learn how to use less the car .
