especi dure the last few decad , there ha been a consider decreas in commun work done by young peopl . thi result from mani factor includ the way commun is seen , the moral valu that chang over the year , and problem of young peopl of today , which prevent them from tri to becom benefici and effect member of the societi . in these modern time , individu ha becom the essenti motiv that challang all of human 's life style . a modern person , man or woman , is complet independ from ani bind social or communi group , and although he/sh might be involv with differ level of societi , in the end , everi man is for himself and we are not member of a group or societi , but mere individu who particip in certain event from time to time . thi way of life and think ha caus young peopl to focu their energi to thing that will be more benefici for themselv , rather than their commun . they do not feel be a part of a commun which can be enrich by their support , becaus they never see the exist of such a commun which valu all of it member . relat to the chang in the concept of commun , moral valu have also chang over time . chivalri is consid a thing of the middl age , and selfless is associ with be gullabl . competit ha been valu so much , be honor , gener and give ha left it place to use ani mean lead to success as long as it is legitim , and sometim even challeng the law , by work around it , is seen as normal and wise . in such an environ , expect commun work from young peopl which will gain them noth , would be too optimist . last of all , young peopl have lost their belief in rightious . current democraci doe not empow it citizen , and bureucroci discourag them . with all the war and ill-do gong on in thi world , young peopl feel lost and insuffici . for someon to take ani kind of action , he ha to feel that he can make a differ , but our young peopl today lack the belief and confid that their effort can do ani good to thi world .
