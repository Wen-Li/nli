i agre with the statement that a lot of the advertis spread across our societi are tri to make product look better than they are in realiti . actual , the reason for thi develop are rather obviou : firstli , the steadili grow amount of product of compar function and qualiti caus the need for custom to distinguish between these otherwis equal product . take into account the enorm exchang of inform nowaday , it is quit understand that evolv a product is not as common as it wa in the past ; most of the relat product are on the same level of invent most of the time . therefor , advertis have to come up with a individu way of creat an incent to favour a particular product among other . secondli , the averag custom is actual look for someth superior to the content of hi or her 's everyday life to enrich it . he or she want to be special instead of compar and is thu look for attribut that make a differ . iron , thi is what make these peopl most indistinct , sinc a lot of them are motiv equal by these unconci desir . as a result , the author of advertis compos their creation servic as well the wish of the produc as the wish of the custom , make product seem `` larger-than-lif '' . in some aspect , advertis are a replac or addit to religi or spiritu desir : the irrat long for a special import of the own exist , the wish for immort through extrins approv rather than intrins satisfact . in my opinion , thi develop is someth rather annoy - at least , if you are a question person . i would not go as far as to call it intimid or even danger - from my point of view , thi develop is more like a symptom than it is a diseas and therefor not the issu itself but a consequ of it .
