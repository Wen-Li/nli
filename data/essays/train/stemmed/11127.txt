the world now is full car . actual it is beleiv that the number of car now exceed the number of built hous . so is thi situat about to end at least in the next twenti year ? in twenti year from now i do n't think that there will be fewer car in use than there are now . i beleiv thi is true for mani reason . the first reason is that develop or obtain ani vehicl or tool replac the car either in size or in price will requir a long period of time actual much longer than twenti year , besid it will cost a lot of money so the replac thing wo n't be cheap and most of the ordinari peopl wo n't be abl to afford it so they 'll prefer to buy car instead . the second reason behind my thought is that car price are now decreas , most of the peopl now have car actual not onli one car but mani car , for exampl , if i am in anybodi 's place whi would i replac a car that does'nt cost me a lot with anoth thing that is still new and will actual cost me a lot of money ? the third reason is that one of the main problem caus by car nowday is on it 's way to be solv within veri few year . thi problem is the pollut caus by the consumpt of the car fuel . i 'm say that beacus research is be done now to find a replac for fuel , that 's becaus we need a more cleaner replac so as not to pollut the air , also becaus the world is run out of fuel and the cost of search for and extract the remain fuel is veri high if compar to the cost of develop a replac for fuel . an exampl to support what i 'm say is that recent a car wa invent that work with heat energi . anoth one also wa invent that work with water . the reason state abov were the reason that made me think that in twenti year there wo n't be fewer car than there are today .
