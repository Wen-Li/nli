group travel with a tour leader and individu travel have both their advantag and disadvantag but i favor to go on an individu travel than a guid group vactaion which would like to point out in the follow text . the group travel most like have a work out visit plan and a time schedul . the peopl in the group will not have their own choic what to visit and it might sometim be veri interst and other time just bore . on of the main problem here is to be oblig to follow the pace of the group and not your own . i will not be abl to skip a site which is of less excit for me . on travel to foreign countri i like to stop at certain place for a longer time and enjoy talk to peopl about their daili life . thi way i might learn more about their life and cultur than visit one church or museum after anoth . although i also ador go to histor meaning place which form cultur and life of peopl just in my own speed . dure a group travel the individu will most like visit mani interest site of a certain countri or citi , which might not acces for an individu and will obtain a lot of inform about them . but as i alreadi mention for me quantiti is not alway qualiti . i would consid me as a lucki person sinc i have mani friend all over the world . one day i hope to be abl to visit them and explor their countri with my own privat tour guid
