there is no doubt that advetis special today look much more attract than the qualiti of the product itself . in my opinion thi statement is correct . while mani other peopl may have differ opinion . from these peopl point of view , make good advetis can encourag peopl to at least tri thi product . so thi product may be good and they buy it afterthat . but if the method of advertis is not good and not interest to peopl , thi will lead to failur of the advertis product . so they see that the advertis must be better than the product at least till peopl tri it as it 's the first step for the product to succeed . in my opinion thi is not correct advertis for a definit thing , but it 's call cheat . the sincereti in advertis must be consid for the gener benefit . if the advertis did n't reflect the actual properti of the product , thi would lead to a bad reput and so death of the product by time . in my life i have an exampl that make me aggress about these type of advertis . for instanc , one day there is an advertis about new meter for measur blood gluco level . they said that it 's the most accur one and it needl caus no pain at all , etc . .. then we bought it for my father who is diabet . we start to use it and everi time it give good and exel read about sugar level . suddenli , one day my father drop on the floor . when we pick him to the hospit we surpris about hi sugar level which is veri high . as a result it causd seriou complic to him special on heart . in a nut of shell , it 's right when you say that the product are not realli good as their advertis introduc them . so , my advic is never to buy ani new product except after it 's thrown in the market for a longtim and wa tri by mani peopl .
