i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk ratheer than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i think if a parson who know someth well and use the skill to be success will also be success but it will not be success as the parson who tri new thing and take a risk . the reason i think is becaus the person who know how to do well is just follow the step that he know and the he doe not have ani idea to challeng someth new . that mean is he will never find ani better way to do someth even if there is one . even it is easer to do the thisng that you alreadi know and more less riski , if you choos the difficult way to tri new thing there is more chanc to success . when you see the person who are success , i think most of them tri new thing with high risk . for exampl there wa a man who ha own a compani which wa not do well , and the one of the worker said that he could improv the thing that they sell
