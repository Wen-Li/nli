i agre with thi statement becaus of follow reason . first , it is natur that advertis make product seem better than they realli are becaus the advertis want to sell their good . second , i alway look forward to see new product ' advertisememt becaus it is realli fun for me as a custom . if the advertis show real prodcut to consum , i think the advertisem compani hav difficulti in captur consum ' attent , and geet a lot of money . indee , that the advertis do not give consum to ther real product look is not so good aspect as consum . howev , if the advertis alway show exact what product look like , i am not go to buy the product and watch the advertis like cm , magazin , and poster . final , the advertis compani can not attein a lot of money from cm , magazin , and poster . i think that usual the compani earn a great deal of money from advertis . thu , if they are not allow to get moni from these advertis , the compani would not make better advertises than previou one . in addit , if mani custom becom not go to the store , the store are suffer from that . the advertis are realli effect way to sell product , and store also take a lot of advantag . all in all , i agre with thi statem as a consum .
