i do n't agre with the idea that the best way of travel is to join a group led by a tour guid for sever reason . first of all , no matter how mani peopl are contribut to the group , hire a tour guid is alway a lot more prici than travel by yourself or with a friend or two . inde , i find these tour as tourist trap becaus the tourist pay doubl or tripl price when they visit museum with the ` knowleg ' tour guid , compar to the amount they pay at the door . for exampl , i went to moscow last year and at the kremlin palac i notic that the visitor are given two option , either you can hire a guid at the door for an outrag price or you buy an audio guid for onli three dolar . is n't it obviou which one make more sens ? some peopl might argu that a tour guid ha a lot of inform about the citi that is be visit , so it is essenti to be led by one . howev a well-writen guid book would compens the need for a tour guid and these guid book could easili be obtain from the bookstor or even tourist inform offic . recent these guid book are be written by local of the place and they contain all the valuabl inform that a visitor may need . furthermor they are be updat as new place open or anyth chang in the place . also travel with a group ha the inevit disadvantag of move as a group . despit of the fact that each individu ha there own interest and their own prefer , the group ha a certain schedul for the entir trip and mostli it is requir to follow thi schedul . thi requir led peopl to see place that they have no interest in and in a way it turn the trip into an unpleas event .
