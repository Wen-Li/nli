i agre with that statement . most advertsi make product much better in five way . first way is that product in advetis onli with the good side . everi product have good side and bad side but advertis state onli good side . for examlp video game advertis that hase good quoliti of imag . the quoliti is the advantag of thi product but it may have disadvantag such us short stori , poor sound , or difficult set . second way is if they use graph , it might be enlarg . for exampl , if the advertis say that no1 sell in the countri and show the compar with other compani 's product sell it might have few differ between two but they enlarg the graph it apper to be big differ . whi they apper so differ is that graph is enlarg and and differ seem big . third way is that adveretis make us think that one we alreadi have are not good enough . like tooth brush advetis that show dirti tooth and becom clean use tooth brush . the tooth brush that we alreadi have is enough to clean the tooth but thi advertis make peopl think that the product make it cleaner . the forth way is for candi advertis . it explain lot about the special outlook or special thing that happen to your bodi . but it doe n't expalin how the tast like . the fifth way is toy like action figur . the one on the advertis is paint . but the one that is sell is sometim not color or less coloer than the one on the advertis . sixth way is that they take pictur or video better . with angl of light product can be seen much delici , or better . it depend on which angl they are light , what kind on light they are use , or which direct they are thake either pictur or video . these are the way that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . and most advertis usesmor than one of these to make it look better .
