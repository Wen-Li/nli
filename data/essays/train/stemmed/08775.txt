there are two type of peopl in the world in my opinion : who is brave and who is not brave . the brave are that peopl who can look at the futur and take risk , the not brave can not take import decis for their own futur . i believ that in hi own life everi person must risk and fight for the thing that he or she want to do , without think too much time if hi or her is right or wrong . for exampl , i did not want to go to univers after the secondari school and i began to work immedi . after some year , i have think that i would go to the univers , but without stop work . sinc that moment , i am studi and work in the same time , without think that it is more difficult that to do onli one thing , becous it is a target whose i want to arriv . i do not agre with the peopl who want to have a quiet life without ani kind of risk , becous that peopl do not have the capac to think about their own futur and they are happi to remain at the same level of life for mani mani year . anoth exampl that i can give is that i would do the engin after the univers and not the employe for the rest of my life , becous in my opinion is better the life of a free professionist , who can spend hi time and hi money in the way who he can think is right , than the life of the employe , who is not indipend and ha the same condit of life for mani time . sure , one employe do not risk to do not have hi payment , but the life of a free professionist in more excit and can give to me mani satisfact , altought it will not give to me the same rassicur to have the payment everi month of the year . to finish , one life without risk is one life without target .
