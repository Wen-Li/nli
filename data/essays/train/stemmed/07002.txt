in my opinion , i would rather like student to learn fact more than understand idea and concept . i will describ whi do i think so , and give an brief exampl in the follow paragraph . let me say we have some issu , for thi essay . first of all , idea and concept are just surfac of an issu , while fact are clarifi matter . also , idea and concept are sometim peopl 's opinion or imagin which often unreli , while fact are realiti and truth . those factor let me think idea and concept are less import than fact ; wchich ever contain detail and truth are more valuabl . to give an exampl , sever year ago at kyoto , japan , there wa a polit meet where presid bush refus to sign the issu of co2 . mani countri were upset about it . in the argument , there were lot of deffer opinion and idea which were critic or support presid bush . for some countri , they even chang their mind becaus of the presid reaction . the fact in the wa that the presid did not sign the issu period . fact never chang , but peopl 's idea and concept do . i do not say have one 's own concept and idea are not good . but when in the learn process , student need to know truth first befor have their own opinion . i think it would be wonder when a student ha hi own opinion base on the truth .
