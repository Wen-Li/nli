i agre with the follow statement . i have two reason whi i agre . the first reason is becaus the fuel is get expens . as everybodi know , the fuel in the earth which are use in larg amount of machin and build are get less . so the gasolin which provid energi for car is also get expens . then the peopl who use car will stop use car so often , and start to walk or use bu or train . the second reason whi i think the car in use will be fewer , is bacaus of the enviro problem . the dioxigen which is includ in the exaust from the car , is damag the ozon which is cover the earth . and it is still been damag . to stop damag it , peopl have to stop provid dioxigen . so peopl will have to stop use car so often . thi is the two reason whi i agre the statement .
