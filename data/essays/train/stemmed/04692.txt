i total agre with the opinion that success peopl tend to take risk . in deed , do just ordinari thing is stabl . at the same time , howev , it 's not inspir the next . i suppos that if peopl do n't take ani risk , they feel bore and have limit to more success . my grand father could success hi job . he did a lot of thing in hi job . at first , he start chines restaur . as soon as thi is success , he start open anoth restaur which is forcus on beer . in my grand father 's era , beer is not as popular as now . he rializ thi situat . then he opend hi anoth restaur call `` beer garden '' . actual he wa not first person who start beer garden , but hi second restaur wa more success than first chines restaur . i think he could success for the follow reason . he did not feel riski at all , when he establish hi new busi . wherea it seem that he wa glad to start new thing . it is import that do new thing is glad to .
