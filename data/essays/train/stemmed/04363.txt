given the choic about young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun i agre or disagre . i agre thi topic . there are three reason wa follow . first , our educt never encourag them : `` you need to help their commun . '' instead of commun help alway becom a way to make them be good . so , they did n't want to join the commun help . they feel thi is not a good thing . second , young peopl have too mani choic to get a right one . today in taiwan , homework alway full of young peopl time . it is imposs that claim they to help commun . young peopl alway feel too tire to do other thing . they onli care about their grade . third , young peopl mere think what is good for them . and their point alway on dress , money , enterti . they did n't want to pay some time or money to help commun . they feel thi question of govern . to sum up , i think young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . i think we should educ our young peopl to help thier commun . becaus they can get mani benifit when they start to pay their time . help commun is a good thing we should do it .
