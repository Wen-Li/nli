tri new thing have mani advantag but it ha also lot of neg effect . i disagre to thi statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . becaus of the reason that it is wast time , often danger . even though peopl can gain new experi through tri new experi , it is wast time . keep work on someth they alreadi know how to do well is the way to be success and save time . if peopl tri new thing , they alway start and learn all thing over again and again . nevertheless , they can discov and get to know more deepli if they keep do what they are familiar about . for exampl , me and my friend start to play flute when we were in third grade . i am still learn it but my friend decid to play anoth instrument next year . now , she forgot how to play flute at all and she want to play it again . then she have to go over it all again and forget about the one that she wa learn befor . thu , tri new thing is wast time . it alway can be danger to tri new thing . becaus they do n't realli know and not skill about it . about 3 year ago , i decid to learn snow bord sinc i onli know how to ride ski . i thought that ski and snow bord would be similar but it wa n't . i wa realli confid befor i fell down sever time and hurt myself so badli . in addit , peopl can fall into thing neg like addict becaus at first , they are not sure what it is and just start it . therefor , tri new thing can give risk . i would rather keep improv thing i am good and skill at than tri a varieti of experi becaus it is wast time and could harm myself . safe is alway first . do what they alreadi know how to do well is the way to be success .
