`` understand give you a better clariti and vision rather than learn fact '' , i agre to the point that understand idea and concept ha a better result than simpli learn it . when you are learn the fact , what exactli happen is that if you are not repeat it again and again you tend to forget the concept and idea . in learn you tri to memoris the text without look at it 's practic implemnt and after a period of time it get vanish . learn could be lucr onli when you have to swallow thing like . in histori , where you have to learn the time and seri of event that ha happen in past . but in creativ and intelectu subject like . scienc , art , mathemat it is not good to simpli learn thing becaus these area need you to understnad the idea and concept . in understand the idea and concept yoy use the creativ , activ and imagin part of your brain . when you understand someth you do n't have to push yourself to revis it again . take `` mathemat '' as exampl when you understand the concept geomatri , than onli you will be abl to use it properli and effici . understand the idea and concept open your brain to see everi part of the subject . and after do a brainstorm with urself you understand the fact which you never forget . understand a concept is easier to do than learn it . it is often seen that student focu more on learn thing than understand becaus they have their exam pressur on them . at last i would suggest that the dynamci of an educ cours should emphasi more on give a better understand . when an individu understand a concept it come into hi behaviour . learn is like look at the ocean from a distanc and understand is more about enjoy the depth of it .
