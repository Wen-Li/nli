first of all , i do not disagre with the statement of young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , and secondli , i think thi statement is mere base on the stereotyp which the adult project on adolesc . nowaday , young peopl are act more independ than their senior . they know more of what they want , whi they want it and how they go to get it . howev , thi chang doe not pleas most of the adult who still believ in the social hierarchi of age which is keep junior under control . thi is the crux of the problem , and in thi case , the two pari see the titl and definit of `` help thier commun '' differ . in my neighborhood , there is a brilliant young girl who ha save mani children from domest abus . whenev sara hear parent beat their kid in a much too violent way , she is brave enough to report to the author concern about each sever case in the commun . nevertheless , most of the adult complaint about her behavior to her parent , and sara get ground sever time for rescu bleed children and even bruis infant . moreov , in my colleag year , i have seen student organ club which aim at supervis the school 's recycl operaiont or urg more tree plant on campu . most of their scheme , even in their most well-design and pratic form , are reject . the school 's reluct to particip in such commun reform activ show a rather great contrast to the student ' effort and desir of chang the world into a paradis . as far as i know , onli young peopl of sara 's age admir her devot to the neighborhood , and the adult simpli see her as a troubl . also , the club member in my colleg never give up ani chanc to come to the commun 's aid despit the neg of the school . these situat teach me a lesson about how adut or the whole societi will not alway be right . young peopl from around the world all possess great passion in help their commun to becom a better place to live , and sometim , they are even more enthusiast than the grown-up surround them .
