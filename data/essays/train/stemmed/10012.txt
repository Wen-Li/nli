i person agre with the fact that understand a concept or an idea is more use than to learn about those fact or idea . to support my statement i will mention the follow : - the learn process doe not impli that the person ha understood and may be capabl to reproduc the fact in question . - the definit of the learn process could be veri much complex and it level could be difficult to ass . - the understand of a concept or an idea impli that the student is capabl to explain `` what it is all about that specif concept '' - the understand of a concept or idea give also to the student the freedom to manipul the inform receiv and associ it with some of hi other learn and understood concept . while the learn process could also includ repeat or copi of a concept without alway be abl to adapt it or use in a difer context , understand appear to be more import . it is import to mention here the fact that the better studend will understand difer concept in school the better will be their adapt in the work environ . the import of understand idea rather that onli learn them is , that whatev is understood psycholog remain longer insid our brain than ani other thing what we have learn without be capabl to acquir the concept or main idea . anoth reason , i may mention here is the fact that it is obvious less stress for a student who did understood a concept to prepar and pass hi exam , than to ask one student to learn some fact that he is unabl to understand and reproduc those fact dure an examin , or even to reminb them after some time . in conclus i person believ that it weill be more useful to our societi to make sure that our student get whatev inform they need in a such manner they can understand it , and make it their . in thi way we can be assur that the next gener have what it take to go further than the gener it is replac .
