in my countri , there is an old say ; to teach the way of take fish instead give fish . it say import of lear not onli the fact but also the `` the way '' . but it highlight that the import of the way . like thi old say , i agre that student to understand idea and concet is more import than to learn fact . first , if student understand idea and concept then they can understand more difficult question . for exampl , when i wa middl school student , at first time of math class , i could n't understand what teacher said . but final understood the way of solut , i could solv anoth math question . although that question wa more difficult , i understood the way of solut so i could do it . if i could n't understnad , i could n't solv that question . sesond , if student understand idea and concept , they can imagin more idea nad concept . i mean , for instanc , when i wa high school student , i learnd about poet . most of peopl do n't like poet becaus of word . that word were difficult to understood except teacher . teacher could understood all of word . that is whi that is import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , i could n't understand becaus i did'nt have ani idea . so i agre about that statement .
