i believ that a student should take care of both understand concept and lern fact . particuarli i am firmli convinc that a good educ should provid enough inform to be learn and enough concept to be understood . depend on the class or the studi sector , one of these aspect can be preval but i 'm sure they should be both present . in an engin faculti inde a student should probabl give more import to concept understand , while in a medicin faculti inform , fact are more import . non the less i believ that concept requir a lot of inform to be understood and aslo fact can be learn after have understood some concept . i can give an exampl base on my person experi . i am a civil engin , and of cours i learn a lot of inform dure mu univeristi career . these inform , studi in math , physic and geometri class , were essenti for understand how a bridg or a build react to load or earthquak . viceversa a medic doctor can make a good diagnosi , and understand what actual caus a certain desea onli if he/sh did learn the relat sympthom in book . some student give probabl more import to understand idea becaus they find understand easier and quicker than learn . studi can be in fact bore when it requir too much time , but i think thi is not a good approach for reach a good cultur and especi for have an effect background educ . as student and worker i am convinc that what we understand and learn in school or univerisuti i s the key factor of our futur success in life . particularli i do n't see ani chanc of success for all the peopl that learn everyth without understand also someth , becaus they would not be abl to adapt their knowledg to the realiti of their job . viceversa , and in conclus , i do n't think that a person can do a good job if she/h ha not a suffici background of inform learn in school or unveristi .
