the statement `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' is a statement that can be enhanc or contradict . i agre with thi statement for mani differ reason . first of all , everyth depend on the definit of a `` car '' . if we consid a car to be a vehicl with four wheel and a engin that depend on oil in order to function , the statement ha a lot of chanc to be true . it is possibl that in twenti year we wo n't have ani petroleum left . the kind of engin we use now would then becom obsolet . even if we consid that we will have some pretoleum left , the product would have becom rare and it price would certainli rise . onli wealthi peopl could then afford to drive , which would lower down the number of car in our street . howev , it is possibl that we find new kind of energi that would adapt to other kind of wehicl . would we still consid those new wehicl as car ? if not , the number of `` car '' would be less than it is now , but we would still have new travel way . it is also possibl that we chang onli the engin part of the car , use , four exampl , hydrogen energi . we would then keep the four wheel pattern , and we would still be drive car . as time pass , the global popul tend to get richer . it impli that the number of potenti custom who will be like to buy a car will rise over the year . even now , some countri as china or india are industri quickli . more than a billion peopl are now demand for car . if we find news way of energi , the number of car owner will rise expodenti . the statement will then be wrong . howev , if the scientist do not find ani other type of energi , our petroleum suppli will turn to be empti in a few year . sinc i do not beliv that we will be abl to find and put in use new kind of energi that cost the same price to exploit than petroleum in less than 20 year , i agre with the statement .
