give a real contribut to the commun is an import social aspect . in my own opinion the time dedic to thi purpous should take a part in the life of ani of the member of a commun . i disagre with the statement becaus i think that young peopl nowaday is the most invov in help their commun . mani of my friend give their contribut to differ social assotiacion and they do not earn money for that . they simpli do that becaus they believ in the import of their help . i think that young peopl is more involv in help commun rather than grown up . thi could be ascrib to the differ amount of time which they have . grown up are more like involv in career and in famili so they are not abl to dedic a larg amount of time to thi purpos . instead , young peol ha more free time and , in addict , less worri to deal with . therefor is reason that they use thi chanc to help other peopl in the commun . howev , acccord to me there is also anoth reason for young peopl is larger involv in give their time for the health of the commun . a young man is tipic more idealist and full of enthusiasm . therefor we can immagin how a boy can enjoy the idea of help peopl spontaneusli . on the contrari a father might prefer to use hi time and hi sourc to help hi own famili . in conclus i think that young peopl firmili believ to share their time and sourc to help the commun . the result , can be seen in all the widespread activ and no profit associ that we commonli meet . therefor i am pretti proud of the way the peopl of my age deal with the need fo help in the commun .
