over the past decad , atmospher pollut ha becom a major issu for the intern commun , as the sign of the kyoto protocol , ment to reduc toxic gase product , in 1992 show it . car contribut to such a pollut , and therefor it is essenti for the futur of men to stop use them . but yet , it doe n't seem to me that neither politician nor peopl are readi to get rid of car in a period of time of twenti year . first and foremost , it is clear that in develop countri , where most of the car are use nowaday , politician are not will to implement polici that would forc citizen to get rid of their car . in the most power of these countri , the usa , the current administr doe n't even consid atmosph pollut to be a problem to tackl . it will therefor certainli take more than twenti year befor someth is done about thi . in other countri , if politician acknowledg car contribut to pollut the air , they prefer protect the car industri whether than take measur to restrict their use . onli london and stockholm have restrict the access to car in their histor centr . and as infrastructur that could replac the use of car are miss , peopl are n't readi to get rid of them besid , the emerg countri ' will to benefit of car ha to be taken into account . for the good of their economi , they can not restrict the developp of the car industri , and they also want to benefit from the best way of life . they will therefor certainli not forbid peopl to use car . all in all , consid the econom context , the current polici implement at all level to reduc the use of car and the peopl 's will to do so , there is no doubt that there will not be fewer car than there are today . i 'm affraid there will even be more of them .
