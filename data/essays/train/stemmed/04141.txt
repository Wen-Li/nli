i disagre with the statement , i prefer to travel alon without a tour guid . becaus travel in such condit spoil the numer opportun in travel . the first reason i am against for the idea is the tour can easili becom reactiv . travel can lost their opportun in learn about the destin . the travel who are also a custom of a tour guid do n't need to learn about the destin . the servic supplier , the tour guid ha made a tour complet . all the travel have to do is follow the tour guid . it can spoil the oppotun to enjoy the travel deepli . for instanc , when i wa in high school , i wa in a grade trip committe and organ the trip . i am sure that peopl in the committe work harder to know about the destin so that we , the menber in the committe enjoy the trip the most . we could understood mani thing in the place , for exampl , the reason whi the custom is like that , whi peopl think in that way , etc . the second reason is that it can caus travel not commun with peopl in destin . it ca n't be said that you understood the place not know the peopl in the destin . due to the secur reason , tour guid are scarc introduc mani kind of place . to add to , the travel ' chanc to commun with peopl in destin were taken away by pay money to the tour guid . they threw away the opportun to reserv hotel , resarch the transport , what temperatur or weather there , etc . it is much work .
