`` jack of all but master of none '' is the say that is use to convey the mean of the statement . i do agre that we go to have a knowledg of mani academ subject rather than to special in one . the reason for thi is the current world need flexibl i.e it not necessari that you master a singl subject but you must know the concept of differ subject . moreov there is no subject that is self contain , everi subject ha got some co-rel with other forexampl physic ha got math into it biolog ha got physic principl into it so are the other . a student need to be well vers with the basic of mani subject , for the practic problem that he face are not confin to a singl subject . what would be the use if you master physic principl and can not solv a practic physic problem given with equat ? that where you got to to appli math . the child would observ hi surround in a broader perspect if he is expos to differ subject . he can understand everi law that govern differ situat in thi world . broad knowledg on all the subject would give a wide scope of build up intrest while special would be rather bore to studi . as flexibl is need to surviv in thi world we must have a broad knowledg of subject becaus if there aris a situat where the principl of the subject you master fail so it mandatori that you make a transit . if you lack knowledg on other subject then you would perish in the situat . aother practic exampl is a child who ha master in comput scienc would confin himself to the comput there would be no other world beyond it . if the comput crash down due to some faliur for instanc due to power faliur in hi hous he would have no other option to call up the board to rectifi the minor problem . in contrast if he ha got the knowledg about electr principl he would be rectifi it all by himself there by save hi money and time . thi is the reason whi educ institut have been teach their student variou subject so as to have an all round develop in differ field of the student .
