in 20 year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today with the constant advanc of technolog in our world today , mani solut to problem we face today can be solv . certain issu that can be seen to have alway been discuss and debat over , time after time can probabl come to an end . through advanc of technolog and the conveni that car seem to have brought to human be , it came hand in hand with a number of issu that are wide discuss today . first of all , there is the pollut issu that rise or declin with the usag of car . next , there is the deplet of scarc resourc that we use to fuel our car . last but not least , is the cost of purchas a car and the ga to fuel it . it is becaus of these issu , that there is a high chanc that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . pollut contribut to the usag rate of car within a countri . take bangkok , a citi that is pollut and notori for it traffic jam as an exampl . peopl live in bangkok are probabl immun to the amount of pollut that they breath and interact with everyday . tourist howev , are a differ stori in term of the pollut rate in thailand . some complain of bad skin , some claim of constant cough , some complain on blur vision with the amount of smoke on the street . when the pollut rate of a citi is so high , there will be a reduct in the amount of car that are use . the govern will most probabl bring out polici that control the amount of car through mean of indirect tax on car and the amount of road that they allow to pass through at a given time period . in thi case , it would just be conveni for peopl to travel through mode of public transport . when there are tax on car , lesser peopl will purchas car , and for conveni purpos , more will use public transport . therebi , reduc the amount of car that are be bought and driven on a daili basi . follow that would be the deplet of scarc resourc of ga . the escal oil price have made headlin more than onc in ani form of mass media worldwid . the thai govern had subsid the oil price from rise in thailand for quit a while , and thi allow the thai to continu their transport as they wish . howev , after the thai govern ceas to subsid the oil price , did public mode of transport like the subway becom overcrowd . with the gradual deplet of scarc resourc like that of oil that fuel the car in which we drive in , the cost for the scarc resourc will rise . when a price of a good rise , thi will discourag the consum from purchas such a product . it can be seen that oil fuel car , so without fuel for car , there will be adequ reason to purchas or use more car . in thi case , the amount of car that are use today and in twenti year time will most like have decreas substanti . last but not least is the better altern that our technolog is come up with . on a day-to-day basi , there are advanc of technolog seen everywher . even after the rise ga cost , countri turn to altern of ga . in a few year of cours , it can most probabl be assum that ga will run out so anoth altern will have to be thought of . now with the conveni of public transport in the sens that it is more effici , less time consum and cheaper in term of ga and maintain price of the car . most peopl will be turn to public mode of transport as oppos to privat mode of transport in travel in car . more and more peopl are becom educ , and thi ha increas in the awar of the environ . peopl will then tri to reduc the amount of pollut by use less of product that produc pollut by find other altern like that of use public mode of transport . in thi case , becaus car produc a signific amount of pollut to our world , the amount of car purchas will have decreas quit a deal . henc , it can probabl be seen and assum that within 20 year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . with escal oil cost and pollut , gradual deplet of scarc resourc , better technolog that can come up with altern and enivornment friendli peopl , the amount of car that will be purchas in the next few year will be gradual declin . therefor , it can be assum that in 20 year time , there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
