in today 's develop and competit world , not onli the introduct of a new product to the market is import , but also the way use to attract peopl 's attent to that product is essenti . the busi which includ thi process of make a product seem attract to the public is call the advertis industri . although it may contribut a lot to the sale of the product , i strongli agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two main reason whi i support thi idea . first of all , the aim of an advertis is to increas the amount of product sold . so , most of the time the advertisor tend to exagger the benefit of the product . as better the product is present , the more peopl will buy it . as a result , the advertisor misinform the public and present the product as a super product which actual is not . secondli , base on my person experi i think that most product turn out to have harm effect that are never mention in the advertis . the problem is the advertisor tend to mention onli the posit aspect of a product and they ignor the negavit effect of it . when the custom use the product , he or she come across the neg effect of it as well . so the valu of the product immedi decreas for the custom . for exampl , a few month ago a wash powder claim to be perfect for wash machin turn out to caus sever damag on the machin . now , the advertis of the wash powder is no longer seen on televis and the sale have decreas consider . in conclus , advertis are need for give us inform about new product . howev , the fact that they most of the time do not reflect the actual qualiti of a product decreas the reliabl of the advertis . so we should keep in mind that no product is as super as it is present in the advertis and that they may alway have neg effect which are never mention in advertis .
