i agre with the statement that is the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guid , but not alway , as for the statement , there are advantag and disadvantag . start with the advantag , go with a group of peopl and a tour guid will prevent you from be lost , or even be stolen . also it is much more fun to go with a group , like a group of friend or mate from a certain class . as a matter of fact , stay alon will also increas the danger for an individu becaus he might get stolen or rob . but there are also certain disadvantag for a tour with a group with a tour guid , althought it will be fun , it might be much expens than tour individu , but also ani person will just feel depend on the tour guid , or even if he ha a certain job to go by himself he will face troubl and how to start like book a hotel , rent a car , go to a restur , also he wo n't be abl to discov someth new , like he wo n't be abl to make friend , nor he will be abl to talk to anyon except if he wa alon or with a partner , in my opinion , i would prefer to go for the first time with a group and a tour guid , and then when i will be familiar with the place i think i would tri to go alon and figur everyth by myself becaus it will tast differ . in addit to go alon , go with a group of friend is realli excit , as i had tri it onc when we went with my friend to europ for vacat , althought we had n't a tour guid but it wa fun explor thing alon and tri them , and look at the fine place , and by ask you can reach ani place you want to reach .
