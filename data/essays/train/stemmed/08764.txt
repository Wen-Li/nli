advertis is one of the key factor in the success of a product in market . some peopl feel that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i do not agre with thi and will explain my point of view in the follow paragraph . in today 's world , there is a lot of awar among consum and the product manufactur know that they can not fool them by give fals impress about their product . they know that if they give a fals pictur of their product in an advertis , they might fool custom for a short term but in the long run custom will know the real pictur . therefor , intellig and success businessmen refrain from wrongli advertis their product . thu , we gener do not see an add of a product that project it fals . in today 's world , onli the best product are abl to sustain themselv in the market . it is gener these success compani who can afford to invest and do invest lot of money in advertis . as the market is veri competit , there is littl or no differ in the qualiti of product from two compani . the motiv of advertis of such compani is to catch consum ' imagin , to influenc them emot so that they buy their product instead of their competitor 's product . therefor , i do not think that compani that manufactur product that do not meet the market standard ever advertis their product . neither do they have the money nor is it worth spend money becaus there are better product avail in market and consum alreadi know that . if we observ the advertis nowaday , we find that they are veri creativ . compani sometim do blow up their product in their advertis but that is just to make their add more interest and appeal than that of their competitor . they do not project wrong inform about their product . therefor , i feel that advertis project the product that they advertis correcti and that in today 's world , they can not surviv in the market if they advertis a product fals .
