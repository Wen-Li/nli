i would n't agre with thi statement . of cours , it is veri import to have a good overview over all academ subject . but after have achiev thi one should decid on what is most interest to oneself and special in thi specif subject . first of all , tri to stay broad in one 's knowledg mean to prevent oneself in special in a specif area . but without do thi , it is not possibl to gain a deep understand of ani subject and there is the danger that one is just scratch the surfac . thi is particularli import nowaday . each of the academ area ha grown extens in knowledg and experi so that it is even imposs to get a full understand of just a singl area . furthermor , in order to produc new scientif result or new thought in an academ area it is import to have a good knowledg of the latest develop in thi specif area . thi is can just be achiev by concentr and work hard on one subject . moreov , i think that it is import to devolop interest , and mayb sometim also disinterest , in certain area dure one 's academ educ . as far as i have experienc thi , it is just possibl to achiev great result in a subject when one is interest in the materi and thu is abl to develop enthusiasm for one 's one work . alway forc a person to deal with thing that are not so import for he or she , the person will feel uncomfort with hi or her work . so , special in a particular acamdem area help and support the develop of own interest and thu increas one one product .
