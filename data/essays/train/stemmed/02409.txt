a broad knowledg of mani academ subject sure ha mani good aspect . but it also ha two major disadvantag : it is limit in qualiti and quantiti . it is virtual imposs to have a more-than-bas knowledg of veri mani academ subject . and the more subject there are you know someth about , the smaller the amount of inform will be that you have about these subject . howev , a broad basic knowledg of mani academ subject is nevertheless veri benefici . but such a broad knowledg should not be base on the expens of veri specifc and detail knowledg in a particular academ area . our world today is incred advanc in all field of scienc . more progress , new discoveri and invent can onli be achiev by special in one , or mayb a few , academ subject . if everyon had a broad knowledg , everybodi would know the same thing . there would n't be ani expert with specif knowledg that could be further develop . anoth result of have a detail knowledg is the abil to work togeth with peopl who are special in a differ branch of scienc . that mean that some peopl with specif knowledg can achiev far more than a great number of peopl hold broad , but onli basic , knowledg . for exampl , research special on cellular structer are much more like to discov unknown detail about cell , becaus they exactli know what is alreadi known , where there are chanc for new discoveri . a research who is not special in cellular structer might veri well discov someth new , but it is possibl that he doesn'r realiz that , becaus he think that it is onli new to him , or her . anoth point is that research conduct today investig veri specif and detail problem . it is thu imposs to contribut to such kind of research with broad basic knowledg . i definit favor specif and detail knowledg , but i also understand the valu and import of a broad educ . thi kind of educ is especi vital for teach in elementari school and possibl also high school . on a univers level , howev , a specif knowledg is clearli requir .
