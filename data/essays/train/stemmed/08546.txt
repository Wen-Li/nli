i disagre with the statement , becaus i think , that older peopl enjoy their life more . the problem is the definit of the word enjoy . in my opinion is `` enjoy your life '' not , to do everyth i could do in the less time a day spend . furthermor it is to select the import thing , that take you further or let you becom more lucki . young peopl sleep onli less hour and use the time to make parti , do a lot of sport or hang around . that 's their definit of enjoy life . the older one have more experi in their life , becaus they are older and they also were young . as they were young they test everyth , too . and now , they know what kind of sport , cultur live , meet they need to be lucki . so they can concentr themself on the real `` funni side of life '' . i think , that young peopl not enjoy life more than older one do . i think , they are look for the right answer , of what is the best thing i could do with my time . on the other hand , older peopl normal have more money than younger one . so they can affort expens sport , event or other happen , which younger one will never seen in that way . and the main point of enjoy life are the famili and long grown friendship ! i heard it a lot of time , that parent and grandpar said , that the greatest , the most amaz gift is a child ! and they never want to chang the time they had befor . and they enjoy spend time with their famili or friend . that is an experi , which younger peopl can not understand .
