it is hard to imagin the fact with concept . they are both interrel . i agre that student should concentr more on understand the idea and concept becaus it is difficult to understand the fact without know the concept behind it . it is easi to clear the concept and understand the idea while studi becaus we have the help at hand and our teacher and mentor are there to correct us . for exampl if i see a patient with a swell and without ani histori and clinic examin i can not tell what swellingit is and how i am go to manag it . to reach the diagnosi i need to clear my concept to take a proper histori and to examin thi swell . then i need to know the common sweel found in the specif area and the patholog . i should know how to investig thi swell and than i will be abl to reach the correct diagnosi and would be abl to treat thi effici . as i am in the learn phase and dure my train i have been abl to learn these basic concept with the help of my trainer and mentor . therefor befor jump to know the fact we should know the basic concept first as i go through the basic thing befor reach the diagnosi . anoth exampl when a child grow up he speak onli few word initi and doe not start speak the complet sentenc fluentli becaus he tri to learn the basic thing befor he can speak and perform like adult . in conclus i would like to say that learn the idea and basic concept first is veri import and if we do not follow thi principl then we will onli know the fact not the concept behind them . if it happen our knowledg and studi will have no mean becaus the main purpos of the educ uisto make us awar of the concept .
