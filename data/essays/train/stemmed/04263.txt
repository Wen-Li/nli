i strongli believ that the abil for student to grasp concept is of the utmost import . my belief is base on three main reason , that are further develop below : first of all , learn concept and idea allow student to understand the core of a scientif explan , of a gener idea . while simpl fact are more like to chang frequent over time , concept and idea tend to remain the same for ten , even hundr of year . even though some main idea can be contest , their understand remain vital to the comprehens of current debat in a field of studi . it also allow the student to better understand ( and rememb ! ) subsequ fact . for instanc , a biolog student ha to be familiar with darwin 's theori of speci variat in order to understand the spectacular surviv of a special type of bird . secondli , i feel that student , especi post-gradu student and-or research assist , are often invit to juggl idea themselv , to come up with an opinion of a specif notion or idea . be familiar with a gener frame of refer help them develop their own critic and make them free thinker ! i could also argu that there are plenti of way to learn fact ( for instanc , watch a news bulletin , read book and articl , or do a research on the web ) . howev , it is a known fact that concept and idea can be more effici grasp in univers ( or other academ institut , for that matter ) , where the structur is design to help student develop and perfect their ` mental framework ' . in conclus , i would repeat my belief that it is crucial that student be introduc to abstract concept as the main focu of their studi . nonetheless , i feel that fact do have a place in an academ environ , in that thi type of ` concret ' knowledg can help student better apprehend the differ conceptu idea .
