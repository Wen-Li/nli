there some differ between young peopl and older peopl . i want to explain import point that their characterist . first , young peopl are more activ becaus they have to go to school , they have to learn what their requir . they also have to grew to becom what they want to be . though , they are grew up , there are a lot of sturuggl that they have to face to it . they are confus and lost becaus they can not see what is go to happen next . second , think about older peopl are more calm and have knowledg , go done though that their develop . they can do whatev they want to do becaus they finish high school . they may have time to think about their grand children who they got . but there are thing that they can not do which is go to school , play sport over beyond their avarag , be expart at some thing new . so some limit come up to them becaus their age is increas . but it doesnt mean that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . for exampl , if you want to have own time like relax , sleep , talk with friend , seem like young peopl have time to those kind of stuff , but young peopl may not do it becau there are a lot of thing to do like home work , sport club , plan for univers or job . but older peopl may do it becaus they have time , mayb they are have job that they realli want to do . school wark is hard to have fun , there are such a limit time , they are still struggl with everyth . older peopl can enjoy what that young peopl enjoy , if they want to play sport as much as that young peopl do then they can do it . young peopl can not do it exactli same thing as old peopl do . they have futur to enjoy and older peopl are enjoy that futur right now .
