i agre with the statement say that most advertis make product seem much better than they actual are . inde , advertis are made in order to sell a product , they are not base on object . in my opinion , advertis are not a fair represent of the product they are prone . most of the time they emphasys the good side of the product but they avoid mention the eventu problem that can be found when they are use . for instanc , an advertsi for a piec of cloth will insist on the aesthet aspect or on the fact that it follow the current fashion , but it wo n't insist on the fact that the fabric may be of bad qualiti . furthermor , advertis make product seem better becaus , when it come to cloth , the garment is advantag by the fact that it is wore by a person who fit the aesthet criteria of the popul . when a potenti byer see a piec of cloth , it is alway present to him in a way that it appear to perfectli shape the bodi wherea , in realiti , the advertisor have certainli choosen the person who will make the garment look perfect . it probabl wo n't be the case when an averag person wera it . last , the peopl who design the advertis often do survey prior the releas of the product . the survey are use to ask to a certain number of peopl , repres of the class aim by the product , what they think about the product , what they like or dislik about the it shape . thi way of funcion unabl the design to know what are the attract side of the product , it is easi then to highlight those aspect in the advertis in order to attract the buyer . that is whi i think that peopl should not trust the advertis they run accross . most of the time it ha been design to appeal to the custom and , when use , will prove to be much differ than what one could have expect by see the advertis .
