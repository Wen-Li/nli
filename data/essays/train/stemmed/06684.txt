is it better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject ? or is it better to special in one specif subject ? tricki question . i would have to say that it depend , they both have their con and pro . for exampl , when you 're in high school , which is my case , you definit should have knowledg of all the academ subject that you need in order to graduat and pass on to your next step in life , which is colleg . but onc you get to colleg , for exampl , whi would you need to know advanc math when you do n't want to studi anyth relat to it ? you would just be wast your time and money . right now , i 'm requir to know , at least a littl , about everyth , from ancient histori to the mean of the mathemat term pi . but sometim i find myself ask : will i ever use thi again in my life ? whi should i learn all these thing if i do n't want to studi anyth relat to it ? but then there are some other time when , for exampl , my younger sister come to me with a school problem and i can help her becaus i 've learn those thing befor . sometim we can be veri lazi and onli learn what is present to us at the moment . but then there are the time when we want to know everyth . like for exampl , when we are kid , that everyth our mother do we question them whi . whi thi and whi that , and there never seem to be an answer to all of a our question . go back to the question , a pro of know about differ subject is that you actual know about pretti much anyth . thi make it easier to have a convers with anoth person and even to get a boyfriend . a con is that mayb you 've spend way too much time do your research and when you realiz it a part of your life ha gone by . a pro of special in onli one specif subjetc is that you can be better at what you do . a con is that you wo n't have so mani thing to talk about with someon outsid of what you do . to summar thi entir thing , i definet think that everyon should have knowledg of basic inform and subject and even read the newspap , at least onc in a while , and be educ , but have more knowledg on your field of studi and that way you can be the best profession that you can be .
