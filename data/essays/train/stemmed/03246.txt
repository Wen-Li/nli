i disagre with the statement that it is more import for sudent to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . fact are thing that are true no matter what and in pretti much everi scenario . although idea and concept can vari . idea are what a person or a group of peopl believ and may not be one hundr percent concret . concpet can be alter , modifi or even proven to be fals . a fact would be , what goe up must come down . that is a proven fact . no matter where you are on earth , whatev is launch up into the air not matter how high , it will eventu come plumit down back to earth due to the gravit pull . an idea and concept on the other hand would be the evoluion from monkey to man . thi is just an idea noth is for certain about thi hypothisi or concept . mani peopl may believ other wise that man kind origin from adam and eve and that they both live in the garden of eaden . although one may be more believ then the other they are just idea and differ concept made up from differ peopl whom may have influenec other . that is anoth problem with idea , they can be forc upon a person . it is not like a fact which are imposs to be proven fals . there for you no choic in believ it . on the other hand , an idea or concept there is reason to doubt .
