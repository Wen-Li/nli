some say that , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . thi make no sens and is not logic at all when we consid the real fact that we see everyday . there are two main point which show that the number of car in use will increas instead of decreas ; firstli , it is alreadi increas instead of stay the same ; and secondli , the world and the countri are get bigger so they will be more necessari in the futur . first of all , it is obviou that the number of car are inreas each day goe by ; so it is not realli wise to say that it will decreas in time . it is not realli possibl for thousand of peopl to suddenli say that `` ok , i do not want to use car anymor . '' . moreov it is a need for peopl more than a choic and nobodi seem to solv the transport problem . the fact is , peopl will keep buy car unless there is a better way offer for them to go where they want to go and it seem like it is so far away from now and the futur . secondli , the citi and the countri are get bigger ; and it is not a realli good option to use public buss , taxi or metro anymor . car seem to be the best option . taxi is a realli expens way for transport and buss are realli slow . metro is neither but it is realli crowd and there happen too mani crime in the metro so it is not a realli good option either . car are in the middl of all of these . it ha all these problem and risk as well but in littl amount . so again , car are the best option that peopl have . to sum up , becaus of the reason that the number of car are alreadi increas and the world is get wider everyday , the number of car will not decreas in the futur . in fact , it is more reasonalb to say that thi number will increas . in everi aspect , car are the best option that is offer to human and no one seem to be look for anoth option for them . in order to decreas the number of car in use , peopl must be offer someth new and better to use .
