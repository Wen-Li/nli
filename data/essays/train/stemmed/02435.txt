i disagre to the statement that young peopl today give less time to help commun . i myself form a relev exampl . i am twenty-seven year old and have been activ involv in commun servic for the past six year now . i have taken up variou type of project . i have given lectur in health camp organ for the slum dweller . i have organ blood donat camp with the colleagu at my workplac . while i wa in gemani , i tutor english to student and job-seek from variou part of the world who had come to germani for studi and work but could not afford the costli languag school . be an electr engin , i have volunt to teach profession cours of electrician , to help peopl make a live for themselv . current i am work with a project for rural women . i am organis thi project in order to build expertis in rural women to take up small task which can help them earn a live and also rear the tradit rural art of cook , stich , embroideri , etc . and it would not at all be strang to reveal that all the activ that i have mention abov have been done in group of fellow young student and profession . i name us all `` philanthrop enthusiast '' . i have seen peopl from differ background join hand to improv the societi around . and whenev i have ask the amateur about the reason behind their interest for commun , i have got the same answwer . that they all get a strang satisfact in these volunt activ . thi feel of fulfil fill the void in their live which is creat by the day to day struggl at univers , offic , person relationship , etc . in fact , i feel that young peopl today are more activ than they were a decad ago . thi may in turn be to some part attribut to the educ system across the globe . school and universitit today mandat that a particular number of hour per week be spent in commun servic . thi madat help student learn the advantag of such work and in the process they start love it . they also realis that how the volunt work serv dual purpos , of enhanc the commun and the individu as well .
