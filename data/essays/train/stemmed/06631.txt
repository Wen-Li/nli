the number of car in use ha significantli increas dure the past decad and it ha been a controversi issu that thi tendenc will continu in the futur as well . some peopl might claim that the number of car in use will continu increas possibl thank to the increas popul in the world . howev , i think in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , for two reason ; high gasolin price and increas interest in the enviornment issu throughout the world . firstli , the price of gasolin ha been fluctuat over the past year , partli due to the natur of the resourc - limit and will eventu dri up - , and therefor it is easi to say that the price of gasolin will continu go up . also partli becaus of the tension in the southwestern asia region , where the resourc is mainli come from , due to the polit conflict and war , the suppli of gasolin seem to have been unstabl and thi situat ha affect the price of gasolin consider . for these reason , the price of gasolin is veri like to be unstabl , and eventu , continu rise ; it would be more and more difficult to use car financi , which could lead to a fewer number of car in use . secondli , as the larg number of car in use ha consider effect on the enviorn mainli by pollut the air , the increas interest in the protect of enviorn might bring some restrict or limit on the number of car in use . for exampl , in korea , although it is not legal restrict , it is encourag not to drive at least onc a week by the govern program to make the air of seoul cleaner . although it is onli the recommend by govern , given that the mani countri and ngo have greater interest in the environ issu than they did befor , it could be said that there would be some govern which start to make restrict on the number of car in use in the citi to protect their enviorn . all thing consid , although it can not be predict accur , i think it can be said that the number of car in use will be less in twenti year than it is now for two reason such as follow , 1 ) the price of gasolin will be unstabl and eventu will rise too much to run a car and 1 ) the greater interest in the enviornment issu may lead the govern to impos restrict on the number of car in use in the futur .
