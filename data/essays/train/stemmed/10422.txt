i have to disagre with the statement becaus of the numer point that could be immedi come up with that contradic it . it is also prudent to consid the point which might disprov my stand , but it also will be falsifi in the last paragraph . the first reason for more car in twenti year is that the fuel that is necessari to run car i.e. gasolin , is not go to run out ani time soon . a common misconcept is that the world 's fuel suppli will dri up in fifti year to come . actual , there are huge deposit of oil in develop and under develop countri which are unexploit . there are also huge reserv deposit in develop countri , like the reserv in siberia and arctic sea region of russia . with gasolin , the most conveni mode of transport for peopl , atleast right now and probabl for atleast twenti year to come , would be car . secondli , the develop countri gener consid develop nation as role model in commun , econom and industri develop . thi , combin with the fact that most of the peopl in develop countri would want to drive their own car , prove that the number of car in develop countri would definit increas . nowaday car are introduc in a wide spectrum of model which appeal to all . apart from thi , the technolog and instrument to make car are gtting cheaper which make car avail to everyon . thi can be support by the fact that tata motor is on the verg of introduct of a car for just one lakh rupe in india . thi would enabl more peopl to buy car . car sport like ralli and the world famou formula one make car even more popular . not that anyon is go to buy a formula one for citi use , but the craze is enough for some peopl to convinc themselv to buy some of the meanest machin avail . the famou comput game `` need for speed '' is one exampl of media popularis car . in the game , car are avail in the weirdest design and can be customis . these idea promot peopl to buy car . the onli reason which might contradict the theme of thi passag is fuel cost . ye , they are go high . despit thi , figur suggest that car number are increasin in the world .
