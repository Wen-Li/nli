i do agre with the previou statement , for i am convinc that peopl who tri new thing are abl to innov and discov new train of thought that would otherwis not be discov . if these peopl onli did what they alreadi alreadi know how to do well , they would alway experi the same result , feel that they do not bring much ad valu to the societi they live in . moreov , by take risk and dare to go where no other individu have gone , success peopl are not onli drive forc of their commun , but also leader that motiv other peopl to achiev their own goal . i will further support my view with the follow approach : - psycholog consider . - my own experi . as an industri engin from the mexican institut of technolog , i acquir a thorough quantit and analyt ground . fortun , my coursework also includ studi behaviour financ , subject that enabl me to find an interest in psycholog , social scienc i found complement my understand of effici and the human factor particularli well . through read extens on the subject , i began feel a particular appeal for the work of t.j. walker , an outstand social research who ha focus on the practic aspect of psycho-sociolog particularli well . in one of hi book , `` riddl of the human mind '' , he explicitli entail the topic of innov and risk take . he mention that peopl who are abl to innov and take risk in order to achiv their goal are usual much more self-fulfil individu . they are also much more goal orient and abl to motiv peopl more effect . in my countri there is an old say that say that `` what one ha eaten , travel and danc is one 's to keep and can never be taken away .
