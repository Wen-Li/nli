i definetli agre with thi statement . most advertis make product seem much bett than they realli are . peopl who do those advetis , just do their job , in fact they must make the product seem far better than it 's , becqus of the concur . inde , now in our societi , firm ha to be the best , whatev the way they to be . there to much choic whatev is the product you wnt to buy , for instanc , there veri big of shampoo , when you go to the super maket you can even not know what to buy . and then advertis ha a veri important role . an adevrtis have to show that thr product that it 's present is the best one , and that you realli need that one particulari . besid , peopl are veri influenc by that , and that normal , if you don ' like an advertis , you would not buy the product , becaus you will think it 's a bad one , even though in realiti it 's much better than you think . well accord to my own experi , advertis realli make product seem bettr , for exampl just last week , i wa about to buy a new perfum , i wa think that it wa good , and the bottl wa veri cute , and it wa a veri famou perfum , but in spite of all , want to tast , so i did , and it wa simpli a catastroph . what we should remerb , it 's that the advertis is just busi , it 's peopl who want to make money , and as a result they do their best to present their product on the best way . in conclus , you should alway tast befor to believ .
