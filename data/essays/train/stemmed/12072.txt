some peopl say that broad knowledg is better , but i believ tha to special in one specif subject is better for human live . first of all , new thing are innov or discov onli by special knowledg in one specif subject . the cut edg technolog or art can bring about develop of human live . for exampl , robot which aid handicap peopl were not invent without special research in a robot thechnolog . in the field of art , the comput graphic which entertain mani peopl in film or tv can not invent without comput . thi exampl clearli show how the special knowledg contribut to the societi . in addit , a worri that the societi with onli special peopl is bias and hard to live with is not true . it is becaus that variou kind of peopl with special knowkedg can complement each other . for exampl , mani manufactur compani employ special peopl and make them research in special field . sometim those specialist produc strang thing , but the specialist in other divis can point out problem of the product . even if the odd product go out to a market , they do n't sell . consequ , specialist realiz they are wrong and improv their product , which lead to further innov . thi exampl clearli show that special knowledg doe not alway make bias societi . thu , peopl do not worri about that . for the reason point abov , i am sure that special knowledg lead to better human life and should be respect more than broad knowledg .
