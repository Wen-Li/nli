it is of cours crucial that student understand first of all idea and concept ; one can not build a genuin knowledg of literatur for exampl , if one doe not understand notion like romantic , modern , post-modern , etc . .. these notion are a great help to understand and defin similar between writer ( or their differ ) , and it allow the student to categor them , and to see if these categori realli fit them or if they can be challeng . the purpos of these big concept is to creat categori , type , which provid landmark for the student . if we think of histori , it is imposs to understand the histori of the xxth centuri without be abl to defin and understand major concept such as facism , commun , capit , or femin , sinc all these concept are signific of a certain era , and of certain way of think . howev , understand concept and idea is useless if the student is unabl to relat them to actual fact ; inde , it is difficult to write an essay on the evolut of the feminist movement in a given time period if the onli thing the student rememb is the definit of femin . one need fact to support one 's point , and what is more , the student will not be abl to handl the notion easili if he ha no actual fact to relat them to , and to clarifi hi or her point . fact are often veri use to understand better the concept , and they also allow us to illustr our point . in thi perspect , a teacher will reli on fact to illustr or prove hi or her point ; it is easier to convey the mean of a given concept through an illustr , and it is also easier to rememb for the student , especi if the exampl given is shock , or amus . a mere knowledg of the gener concept and idea would be too restrict , and would result in a superfici knowledg , which is not veri use in the end . on the other hand , a good masteri of both concept and fact will allow the student to have in-depth knowledg , which is the most import . in that sens , it is imposs to focu onli on the gener idea and to leav out the fact .
