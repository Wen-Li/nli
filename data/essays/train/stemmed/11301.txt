in thi world of never end technolog and demand for it , it is highli unlik to predict the shift from the convent mean of transport to rather slow and unconvent mean . befor go twenti year deeper in to the futur let us review the past five year . there ha been an increas of about a drastic 150 % in the number of car manufactur and the number sold in the market . thi aptli explain the sate of mind of today man kind . the increas in the number of automobil would increas the pollut level but man is not abl to switch on to a less dustruct mean . popul is also a major draw back . thi can be explain by the simpl logic `` more the peopl , more the mean of transport requir '' . as the number of vehicl increas by about 150 % in five year a declin in it is nearli imposs in thi parasit human world . though mani of the educ institut are not allow vehicl in their campu the effect on the public is decim . a person would alway choos a faster way of transport rather than a slow mean like a bi-cycl . it may also be possibl that some day man made fuel with no pollut effect could be invent and the number of vehicl may increas as need is alway the sourc for invent . but if such a marvel is not achiev then the world will have to face an inevit natur catastrophi . henc accord to the thing stand as on today and the reason state it can be said that the number of automobil would increas in the come twenti year and man kind can not tri to stop the increas but should and ha to tri to decreas the neg effect of the increas .
