it is true that most of us now use car as most use vehicl . car have a great advantag for their interact . differ from other vehicl , such as airplan and public bu , car are more interact vehicl becaus we could handl own car wherev and whenev we want to move . howev , i strongli agre with the opinion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year for the follow reason . first , to drive the car ha sever big risk such as the car accid . in my countri , japan , the rate of the car accid which lead peopl death becam higher in the recent year . it is becaus that to drive the car requir peopl to know and practic complex skill so it is hard to drive car for elderli and young peopl . second , if we drive the car , actual we automat produc lot of co2 which affect badli for the environ . nowaday so mani peopl claim that if we continu to drive the car we would lost the place where we could live safe . we should know that co2 which produc by car would go rise up and yield some seriou problem , such as the destruct of ozone-lay and greenhous effect . from these reason , now so mani peopl in my countri tri to develop subway as more conveni vehicl instead of car . iactual , subway is greater than car in term of safeti . the driver of train are well train and onli goe on railway construct under the ground so there is no possibl for train to kill ani peopl . we could say that the vehicl goe onli under the ground make the world on the ground more safe place . moreov , we could make the station almost anywher we want under the ground . on the ground we have so mani build and hous so sometim it is so hard to go to the place where we exactli want on the ground . therefor i believ that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . i think the subway would be develop more than there are today in twenti year . i can say that more peopl would use subway instead of car becaus our perman desir is to make thi world more safe and conveni place for all peopl on the earth .
