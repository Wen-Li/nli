becaus of the import of advertis in our modern societi , thi question seem quit interest and could be also written thi way : do advertis lie to us ? it alway seem to us that the good we see on tv or in magazin are perfect , or far better than they actual are , and we are often disappoint by the real product onc we have bought it . but could an advertis work if he told us that what he want us to buy is onli quit good or not that bad ? advertis are closer to propaganda than inform and it ca n't be help . on an other hand , some advertis are will to give some result or mark that their product were given by differ organis , associ or consum and we 're eager to believ that , most of the time . we must n't forget that custom are usual well protect by law which punish lie in advertis but here is n't the problem . inde , the problem is that peopl usual do n't make ani differ between the pictur and the thing itself , and are too eager to think that what they see just in front of them is real and ideal . they alway look for someth perfect but ca n't realis that perfect doe n't exist , moreov low-cost perfect . advertis show us the best side of what they want to be baught and it could n't be an other way , we ca n't blame it for that and furthermor we should face our own respons by train to be more critic and care in our decis . the fact is that advertis do n't make product seem far better than they realli are becaus onli the consum see what is beauti , it 's a kind of game with the consum who stay the onli one to decid if he actual like , need or want .
