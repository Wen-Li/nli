i agre with an idea it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus if peopl know about one thing that the person studi , but the person do not know about the other thing may the person doe not understand the other thing what the person doe not learn and if educ special in one specif subject mani peopl waht to lean easi subject . we can make jenou from learn one specif subject , but ani one can not be like that . also we have mani thing to learn to live in human such as , we have to learn about social , p.e , music , hiatori , and we have to learn from each other . that is whi we have learn knowledg of mani academ subject . it effect to peopl what is bad thing and what is good thing . if peopl learn onli one specif subject , the peopl can make problem becaus they do not know how to do the otherth , mayb they are good at what they have had learn , but it is not enough to live with peopl . the peopl can not live alon in sociti peopl have to help each other and peopl have to know how to help the other peopl , also how to surviv from social and they lean those thing from differ academ subject . they can not get those mani idea from learn onli one special in one specif subject . in my oppinion peopl better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . peopl learn mani academ subject , and peopl can usewhat they have learn in mani way . also we have to share the idea from what they have learn and we can talk about that and make that idea better . thi is a part of learn differ academ subject . peopl can not share and talk about their idea if they studi in specif subject becaus they are studi differ subject . so we better to learn mani academ subject
