from my person point of view thi matter is a veri hard issu to agre or disagre with . becaus we can not predict the futur . i think that car are someth that caus a lot of problem nowaday . for exampl , in big citi such as : madrid . pari , london or new york the traffic is horribl and thi caus a lot of problem . peopl are late most of the time becaus of traffic , have a lot of problem , such as , accid becaus of traffic , some peopl even have bad temper becaus of the traffic jam . and all of thi is caus becaus we have too mani car on the street . i know that have your own car ha a lot of advantag . becaus if you have your own car you can go wherev you want and whenev you feel like it . but in my opinion peopl should not be so selfish and think in all the disadvantag . for exampl i think that car caus a lot of pollut that damag our envior and damag our health too ! i can not agre with thi statement , at least at thi point . becaus i think that peopl is veri lazi and preffer spend their money in a car than spendig it on public transport . peopl preffer do thi for mani differ reason not onli becaus they are lazi , i think that public transport is not good enough to trust in it one-hundr per cent . becuas public transport sometim ha a lot of problem : ( it break down , or it delay . .. etc ) i think if public transport improv within twenti year we might have less car on the street than now . but is that posibl ? i do not think so . in conclus i do not agre with thi statement for all thi reason .
