it is often said that introduc product 's advertis make product seem much more better than they are . some peopl might agre with the statement becaus recent know product alway make peopl think it is the best without full understand of inner part of product . howev , i disagre with the statement becaus of requir of high qualiti of product , and rare bad product from compani . to begin with , ani product associ requir the compani 's high qualiti of product so it actual seem better when peopl get their product and see what their product ha special thing on the surfac of it than just watch it through advertis . for exampl , when i wa watch braum 's milk advertis , it doe n't realli chang my mind from not buy to buy their product but when i went to the braum 's and look up their product 's nutridit sign and other , it realli make me their product is a good and healthi for me . thu , advertis doe not seem better than it is . in addit , compani 's bad product prove that advertis is not better than it realli is . we all watch advertis onc a week then order their product but sometim you get wors product than you realli think when you are watch their product on televis . for instanc , accord to the articl , peopl found out rat in kfc chicken then they got seriou diseas for a year . howev , their advertis show us that they onli get their chicken from the perfectli clear farm . futhermor , most advertis make product 's qualiti wors than what realli are . in brief , i firmli believ that the product own itself is better than it 's advertis becaus of two exampl of requir of high qualiti of product and rare bad product from compani . henc , these import fact can not be underestim to purchas compani 's product .
