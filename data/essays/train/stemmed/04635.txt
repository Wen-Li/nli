it is true that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i do agre with thi statement . to make commurci is one of the most invest for concern . they have to show their product from the best side for sell it easili . you can do that with make advertis . it is depend on the qualiti how you make it . you have to reach the style of the commun . it ha to be an eyecatch when you look at it so that you can say '' i want to buy that ! '' for exampl , i make an advertis for a drink . first of all i have to think about it how could i make it so , that the peopl would buy it immediatli . one criteria could be the size of the advertis . anoth one could be the color . the style and the locat is also import . it ha to speak on the commun . so then when i am done with the advertis and it realli look tasti , actual no one realli know the tast in it . so it could be veri sweet or to sour or so on . nobodi know the tast befor they tri it . so it is a kick for the peopl to buy the product and to tast it becaus on the advertis it seem good and it make you to buy it . that is actual the danger on advertis . of cours thi exampl doe not show a big danger but what about a holiday advertis ? advertis make everyth that the trip sound perfektli and the price is also okay so peopl book the trip and when you go there you see the realiti about the hotel or the locat or what ever , which is not true with the advertis . that could be a danger . anyway without advertis the economi would be get down and no one could sell their product anymor . conclus : advertis should not make product seem much better than they realli are .
