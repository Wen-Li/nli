accord to my point of view , sucess peopl tri new thing and are like to take more risk . the main reason would be the fact that when a person manag to achiev a goal , he want to have someth new and more difficult to do . human be are hardli satisfi and i ca n't help think that when somebodi ha suc in someth , he will alway want more . alpinist , for exempl , do n't usal stop climb after they manag to reach their first summit . they alway want to climb an other montain , harder and higher . napoleon 's bonapart , the french emperor and conquer did n't stop go on war and face battl until he wa finali defeat . and i think becaus he wa sucess in a first time , he could n't get rid of hi will of power . an other reason would be the fact that sucess peopl can start be bore by what they do , even if their activ match success . so to avoid thi phenomenon , they just start a new thing . we can find thi kind of behaviour in sport . we can take the exempl of a great champion such as valentino rossi , who had won dozen of world championship . well , he is now look forward to becom a forula one driver . becaus he want someth new . someth that give him the opportun to achiv a other great goal . a last import factor is , accord to me , the fact that when somebodi manag to win someth , or to earn someth , he would probabl want to get more of it . no matter if it is money , glori or power . the joy of win might even be more import than the profit whitch came with thi success . a good exempl would be a poker player or a gambler . after win some money , they would probabl bet more of it . and it is actuali dificult to get rid of thi circl .
