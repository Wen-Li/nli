understand idea and concept suggest understand a way of think or understand how idea are connect and concept can develop . to me , that is more import than learn fact alon for the simpl reason that you can appli a way of think to mani differ situat . learn fact onli is limit one 's knowledg to a specif area or subject and doe not even impli that one understand how these fact are connect . howev , i still do believ that a balanc between both is necessari and depend on what a student 's intend job is , one skill might becom more import than the other . let 's consid a historian for exampl . can a historian special in roman histori and who doe not know the fact of the rise and fall of the roman empir for exampl still be consid a historian ? probabl not . a historian might inde need to know more fact than a market execut for instanc but he or she will also probabl be a much better historian if he or she also understand how all fact are connect . on the other hand , i believ that it is more import for a market execut to better understand concept and idea than it is to know all fact about a given undustri or product . first of all , a market execut doe not need to be as special as a historian , inde , he or she should be abl to appli hi or her skill to ani industri . second , not know all fact about a specif field might actual foster creativ and new concept develop by remov ani `` limit '' of the mind . third , a market execut who understand concept and idea might be abl to see better synergi between them and appli them in innov way . howev , as i state abov , i still maintain that some sort of a balanc is need to achiev excel . a market execut would be that much stronger if he or she could draw some pattern from past fact for instanc or if he or she demonstr a more precis knowledg of the product or servic and it relat competit scene that he or she is work on .
