i think have knowledg of mani academ subeject is better than special in one specif subject . there are two reason and exampl whi i agre with thi statement . if you have knowleg of gener inform , it would be use in your life . for exampl , if you work at the offic and your boss ask you to write report , your knowledg would help you . becaus you have differ kind of knowledg , you can think from differ view . if you onli have specif knowledg , you can onli focu from one view which would make your report pretti poor . know about mani differ thing would help you at the school as well . for exampl , becaus you have broad knowledg of mani academ subeject , it would be use at mani situat , such as the examin and the interview . at the examin , sure you would get good grade becaus you have a lot of differ knowledg , even though it doe not special in one specif subject . also at the interview , becaus you have differ type of knowledg , you can answer the question widli and you can appeal how you understand gener today 's event and your clever as well . if you have knowledg which focus on onli one subject , it would be useless at mani situat . for exampl , at the school , even if you would get full mark at the math test , perhap you would fail with other subject becaus you onli have specif knowledg on mathmat . in my opinion , becaus have differ type and kind of knowledg , it would help you to live much better . becaus of those reason that i said befor , i agre with the statement which is it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
