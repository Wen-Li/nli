i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are two reason whi i agre that most advertis make product seem much better than realli are . first , we alway choos same product at the supermarket . for exampl , my friend alway goe to supermarket everi sunday , and he alway buy a same snack . one day , i ask him about , `` whi do you choos same snack '' . he answer that , `` i alway watch thi snack 's commerci at televis , then i think that thi snack is tast good , so i alway chose thi one . '' i think that hi favorit snack 's tast is not good but he influenc by televis commerci , so he alway choos same snack . second , we alway beliv the content of commerci . for exampl , two year ago , my sister bought an expens natur food . my fater ask my sister about , `` whi do you buy an expens natur food ? '' my sister answer that , `` accord to thi book , thi food is good for us , so i buy thi food . '' howev , her natur food wa n't special natur food . her book said that there are a lot of valu in her natur food , but it wa as same as normal food . she influens by the advertis that includ her book . recent , there are mani advertis in the televis commerci , radio commerci , magazin , book , newspap , and so on . howev , advertis do n't alway show a correct inform . the mean of advertis is to sell a lot of good , so when we buy ani good , we should reserch a lot of inform , and we should ask opinion to famili or friend . if we can collect a lot of inform , we can choos correct good . i think that correct inform is more import than influenc by advertis . befor we chose good , we should rememb thi thing .
