it is not easi say whether an advertis make a product seem better than it actual is or not , sinc at first sight , few of us could realli be abl to find ani possibl differ between what is propos to us on televis and what it is . anyway i will tri to answer the question and to give you some exampl in order to have it clearer . in my point of view , it could be possibl that most of advertis tri to mislead the final consum . thi is due mainli to a few reason , such as the strong impact of televis on the audienc and the increas commerci interest which play a key role in nowaday societi . the former motiv , could be easili demonstr take into consider ad regard toy or anyth aim to children and younger group , which are the most vulner attend . it might be enough launch some new product through advertis dure the cartoon time in order to convinc children to buy it , be awar that a children is not abl to know whether that ad faith reproduc the desir toy . the other reason , could be refer to a wide rang of other item , which can be relat to hous keep , car , insur and so on . as a matter of fact the commerci aim hiden in about most of activ , push produc to use as mani mean as possibl in order to reach a huge number of custom . thi can be achiev by compani use a strategi such as show a product in a way which could be believ but not total true , take advantag of weak both of the weak of peopl and of the strong of televis . in conclus , even if there is no certainti about thi topic and even if i tri to set it out just from a televis angl , without take into consider newspap , i say that i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than realiti .
