mani peopl travel alon or get a help from a guid . i like to say that if we travel by travel guid , then we can not go to the place that we want to go . if we use the servic , we have to follow the schedul of tourist . i believ that the tour that are led by guid is more expens than the tour alon . so i strongli disagre that we had better travel certain place by alon rather than travel by travel in a group . first , if we travel by travel guid , we can not go the the place that we want . suppos you want to visit to the place that ha a arcad and fun stuff . but the travel guid alreadi plan to go to the templ or mountain . you might do n't want to go those place . accord to the idea , you have to go to the place that 's proper to your interest or hobbi . you can not fit your interest into the tourist schedul . second , travel alon is go to be more cheap than travel in a group . the guid compani might charg extra money for the servic . becaus of that , you might spend more money from a tour that is not in your interest . so i would say that you definit go to save money and get to the place that you want to go by travel alon . in conclut , i discuss about travel . on that topic i disagre with the fact that we should travel in a group led by a tour guid . but travel by tour guid would be not fun , it 's depend on your interest . the place that go should be decid by your interest . and it is veri hard to match your interest with tourist schedul . and travel by traval guid would cost you more than travel alon . you can save a lot of money from that . becaus of those opinion i strongli disagre with travel ina group led by a tour guid .
