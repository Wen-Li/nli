knowledg is devin and is a must to everyon in ani form it may be present . but most of us consid that knowledg of onli certain limit thing or subject around us enough . the knowledg in those limit thing may be deep and secial but it doe requir the knowledg of certain other thing also . so , i go with the thought that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . thi can be prove in a number of way . if we consid feild of biotechnolog as an exampl we can find mani deciplin in it like cell biolog , microbiolog , genet , bio chemistri , bio organ chemistri , thermodynam , instrument process , bio process engin , bio informat , genom and proteom , molecular biolog , genet engin , etc. if a person take a subject as biotechnolog as hi major and tri to confin himself toward the special of a certain subject rather than aquir knowledg in all hi academ subject it 'll be veri difficult for him to do anyth . if we consid a person want to special in genet engin he just can not do that without the knowledg of cell ciolog , molecular biolog , genet map , instrument to be use , etc. so it is a must for him to know all these subject from hi academ in order to master genet engin . now a day all the diciplin have becom inter relat and it is veri much difficult to say that a person can master in a specif subject without the knowledg of the other subject . if we consid garden as our next exampl we need to a littl of botani a littl of chemistri and a littl of math too . we can explain thi as such , firstli the person intrest in garden should know what type of plant he want for hi garden and are those plant abl to surviv in those climat condit and next he ha to know a littl bit of chemistri to know with which chemic the plant is to be treat if infect by ani knid of diseas or pest and final math to know how much quantiti of chemic is need to get the requir amount of the treatment effect . so , in thi way if a person want to maintain a proper garden he ha to know a littl of the abov deciplin . like thi almost all the feild are inter relat and no feild is specif to itself . thu i can strongli conclud that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject is alway better .
