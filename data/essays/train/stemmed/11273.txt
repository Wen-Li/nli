in the old time , peopl belong to the commun . when they live in the villeg or town , everyon knew each other . but , pepol move to citi nowaday so that their life style chang . in my opinion , young peopl do not give enough time to help thier commun becaus they have to studi hard , interest chang for play , and do not have aquaint in the commun . first of all , young person have to studi hard so they can not have a abund time to take part in the commun activ . recent mani peopl go to highschool or univers . compar for one hundr year ago , they must studi much more time . if they do no go to higher educ school , they afford to particip comun activ . howev , they do not have a time so they can not help them . second , young gener interest in play than hepl commun . for exampl , play sport , music , and danc fascin them . they feel commun meet are bore and not excit . moreov , nowaday mani young person are look for more interest event . they think commun are not import so refus attend . final , citi life chang the commun ideal . as usual mani peopl move from rural to urban place so they do not know each other . if you do not have a relationship around your hous , nobodi join the commun . in addit , citi life ha a bad human relationship . they are not interest in one anoth . in the conclus , modern civil afffect the social relat as well as technolog develop . young gener would chang a lot of aspect . they got a varieti of possibl . thu young peopl do not need to help their commun becaus they have to studi hard , interest chang for play , and do not have aquaint in the commun . therefor i do t agre the statement .
