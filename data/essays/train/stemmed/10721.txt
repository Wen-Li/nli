some peopl believ that young peopl nowday do not give enough time to help their commun . it seem to me , howev , they get to be spend their time to support their commun . there are three reason for thi . first of all , increasingli , in these day , the school introduc the social commun class in the program , and young student especi student in junior hight school and high school join their commun by clean their town , help senior and so on . it might be a compulsori educ in the first place ; howev becaus of thi educ system , young peopl are awar of the import of thi activ , and gradual intend to join it afterward . secondli , it seem that young peopl are get the leader posit in a lot of commun to contribut in these day . in some area in our countri , japan , there are some activ which put the the age limit ( 25-30 year old ) to be a member of social commun . moreov in order to attract the young peopl , some commun offer the special reward , such as pay the salari or provid land . thank to these activ , young peopl are more get involv and help their commun by teach sport , their cultur , and so on . final , in these day , it is frequent mention that now is the time of chang gener in japan . as you may see the elect of prime ministor in japan , mr. shinzo abe , who is the youngest prime ministor , wa just elect few week ago . thank to thi trend , it seem that young peopl posit get to feel that they have more chanc and power to join their commun to achiev and help someth more , even though they are too busi to spend their time to do thi kind of volunti work . in conclus , use these abov reason as a basi , i would mention that young peopl nowday have posit intent to help their commun .
