from what i learn , knew and heard and told throughout thi life . it is much more importnat for a person or a student in thi situat to understand idear and concept than to learn fact . to learn fact you have to understan the concept and the idea of what you are learn . therefor as an exampl : a person can learn a fact from a book about the world war two but not understand whi the war start from the beginig . everi person have brain therefor , it should be use . logic and commen senc are all mater for understand idea and cocept . a person can memor a book but that doent mean that the person understood it . peopl should use their brain to understand thing . for exampl : newton law of motion , `` for everi action there is a reaction '' . a person doesnt need to learn thi method and no it fact , but a person can use hi brain and a littel bit of commen senc and understand the idea rather than search for it fact . howev learn fact is import for a person to do , but not as import as understandin the idea and learn the concept . fact are import for exampl when a person right a paper , he or she need fact to prove what they are say . while a person can teach someth if he didnt understand the idea of what he is teach even if he fact about what he teach that is not good enough . as i said befor a person need hi brain , logic , and commen senc . therfor understand idea and learn concept are much import than learn fact .
