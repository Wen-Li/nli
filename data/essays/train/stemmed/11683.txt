i think that i will have to partial agre and partial disagre with the statement that young peopl tend to not give enough time help their commun . to answer the question accuratley though , and to fulli explain my person opinion on the topic , first of all we need to defin the word ` commun ' . a commun is not onli the place where you are live . it might just as well be a certain group of peopl you spend a lot of time with , like your sport team , your school , polit parti , your church or a local band . all these are commun . sure there are young peopl who just like to hang out with their friend at home , watch televis or play videogam . but teenag are start to wake up again , they have begun to be more activ and particip in group activ , in commun . there are festiv and street market organ by teenag , they sing in their church or help rais fund for chariti project . it is the young peopl - and not big compani or mighti politician - who are struggl for a job and a futur and therefor go through a lot of effort like organ confer or meet with those in charg to chang someth about the situat . clearli they can not do all thi on their own and need help from adult like parent , teacher , mayor and compani boss . but young peopl are up on their feet again , they are tri to make a chang for the better . of cours it is veri easi to get the impress that in our societi everyon onli think of hi - or herself anymor and is not will to volunt for a higher purpos , especi when you think of teenag . howev , thi impress can onli be right if you look at individu . mani young peopl are onli concern with their own futur and their own well-b , excatli like mani adult do . but there are just as mani great teenag i know that spend a lot of time help their commun and the peopl surround them .
