i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . i am sure that the onli way to learn is to tri new thing . peopl have to learn their whole life to be success . we start learn on the day that we are born and after univers thi process should not stop . in the modern busi world there are alway mani competitor who want to have the same posit . so you have to have some skill which make you special and these skill you can not get if you are afraid of new thing . if peopl want to be success they need to be brave and take respons for their action . in addit , they need to have the power and strenght to fail and stand up again . in my opinion , the reason whi so mani peopl do not want to chang a situat or to tri someth new lie in their mental . i think that mani peopl are afraid of tri new thing becaus they do not want to fail . they think that it is easier , more comfort and better for their imag to stay in one job posit than to tri someth they are not an expert in . i think that peopl sometim are rather lazi and do not see a reason in chang a comfort situat . in my opinion , the onli way to reach higher posit and success is to leav thi comfort behind for a certain period of time and to be brave enough to accept the possibl of failur . otherwis you alway stay in the same posit . nevertheless , there are more aspect of success . i think that luck , network , social skill , the abil to work in team and continu are extrem neccessari factor for success .
