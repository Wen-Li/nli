in wealthi region of the world , it is common that a typic famili ha more than a car per person . sometim , especi when i am stuck in the traffic , i wonder if thi situat will ever chang . i strongli believ that in twenti year the number of car will decreas deepli . and there are mainli two reason that convic me contend that . firstli , enviroment protect is becom a topic of paramount import in govern polici . mani peopl 's health ha alreadi been neg impact by the pollut effect of a too heavi circul . therefor peopl are a lot more concern in the prevent and limit of thi problem . public transport is gener consid to be the most effect solut and car user seem more and more will to take advantag of it . then , it is evid that have a car ( or more than one ) mean wast a larg amount of money . it is part of our daili routin read that oil price ha increas onc again dure the night . not to mention the huge insur cost and the sever and varou type of fee relat to the use of a car . last but not least , it ha to be taken in account that mani municip , in order to reduc traffic in the citi center , usual come out with special permit to park in certain area . such permit are gener perceiv extrem expens by the the major of the popul . in conclus , enviroment protect and incres cost should convinc all of us that a more limit use of car would be a better solut for everyon . of cours , also govern and educ system should help , and it appear that they are on the way to sensibil peopl to that effect . these are the reason whi i am posit that in twenti year it will not happen to me to be stuck in traffic as often as it occur to me now .
