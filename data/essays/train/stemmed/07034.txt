i agre with the opinion that peopl success more often when they tri new thing and take risk , rather than onli do what they are alreadi farmiliar with . there are two reason for thi : motiv and chanc . first , when peopl tri someth that can be challeng to them , they are motiv . in fact , they tri their best . when peopl tri their best , they have more chanc of succeed . howev , when peopl do someth that they know how to do well , they do not tri their best becaus they alreadi know what the limit is and what they can do with it . howev , when peopl tri new thing , they are motiv to learn more about it . also , they do not yet know how far they can go with it , so they are motiv to know whay they can do . second , when peopl tri new thing , they have more chanc to encount someth that is in their interest but did not know the exist of . what they alreadi know how to do well is probablli someth that other peopl alreadi know and is farmiliar to all of them . if they take risk , they are more like to encount someth that is challeng , but is interest to them at the same time . if peopl tri thing that are uncommon , they are more like to be succes becaus peopl have not yet explor that territori yet . peopl can feel that they are do someth special . i believ peopl should take risk and tri new thing rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . it is challeng to take risk , but take them lead to success . peopl have more chanc of encount someth peopl can be success on , which bring up their motiv .
