in my point of view understand idea and concept is veri import . the subject like a java , we can know the knowledg of java by understand the idea and concept . concept is more import than fact . by studi the fact like sun microsystem invent the java , we ca n't understand the featur of the java . we can also learn by someth hear and studi the fact . fact can also improv the knowledg . by studi the fact like independens we should know about the great leader of our countri , and we should know about the how they will work hard for the independens . histori will tell about thi . so learn the fact were import . by stude the fact the children can learn about the honesti , relibl , and histori of the countri . everyon must should know about the histori of the countri . by learn the fact we can prevent the war like second world war and the first world war . by learn the fact we can know about our previou cultur and method , it wa veri intrrest . last week some of the person found the dwaraka under the sea , so by hear thi fact we can conclud that there were dwaraka in the past . by understand the concept and idea we can improv the knowledg of the subject and we can improv our perform and profound knowledg in the subject . we ca n't understand the concept like polymorph and abstracton while learn about the fact . all the student can understand by understand the concept and idea of the subject . conceot were veri import and idea were also import . for understand subject the student could know about the idea and concept . there would be necerr fact for the student becaus for know about the past . in thi day , understand the concept is veri import for futur import .
