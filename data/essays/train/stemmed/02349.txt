nowaday it 's verri common to travel in a group . it 's possibl to travel all over the world in mani differ group . for mani peopl it 's the best way to travel . they mean it 's more interest and it 's also easier to organ . you just have to go to a travel agent and sign up for the trip . for me it 's not the right way to travel . i like to go my own way may be togeth with a friend . i do n't like to travel in a big group . togeth with a friend you have more freedom to organ your own rout . on the other hand , it 's normali much cheaper . the first reason i prefer to travel for myself is the freedom . i had the expiri in a group . we just saw that what the guid want to show . all the place we saw were verri crowd with other tourist . when you organ a trip togeth with a friend you can choos your own rout , you can decid what you will see . you also can choos some hidden place , but thi place are sometim much more interest . you can choos place they are not so crowd with mani other peopl . you can say when you will arriv and when you will go . you are more independ when you travel for yourself . the second reason is becaus it 's normali cheaper to travel for yourself . i prefer to sleep in a hostel . i wa last week in hawaii . i slept in a hostel . one night wa just twenti dollar . to travel with a group in hawaii is verri expens . i could afford thi trip to hawaii just becaus i selpt in a hostel . otherwis the trip would be to expens . when you sleep in a hostel you can normali use a kitchen there . the food is thi way also much cheaper . normali you spend an abund amount of money just to feed yourself . when you cook for yourself it 's cheaper and you can cook what ever you like . you can take also a public bu to travel . thi way is much cheaper than a expens tourbu . in conclus i prefer to travel for myself becaus i can go my own way . i 'm not depend form a whole group and a guid . it 's also afford for my wallet . travel is verri nice and everi person sould do .
