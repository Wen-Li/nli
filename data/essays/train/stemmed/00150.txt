in gener , i agre with the statement becaus i think that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more preciou to peopl when it come to their everi daili life and surround acquaint . in other word , i believ that a knowledg on sever subject give peopl the possibl to better understand mani matter which are face everi day like hystor and polit situat , foreign cultur and countri , scientif aspect and and physic fact . a broad knowledg can realli help all of us in better understand the world we live in and get use to that ; thi is whi , in my opinion , mani primari and seconday school tach basic of sever academ subject instead of reduc the rang of taught matter and special student on some of them onli . howev , i also believ that , when it come to work and busi , thi opinion is not longer applic becaus special becom a must . i think infact that a special worker ha often to focu on few matter onli and can not keep pursu a broad knowledg on differ subject . be focus and special , worker can gain advantag in their job , becom more competit versu peer and colleagu , get more valuabl to employ and deliv stronger and higher perform . an exampl is given by my person experi . at the primari and seconday school i have been studi sever subject from art to physic , from hystori to math , etc. and so i receiv a veri broad knowledg on mani matter . after achiev my `` diploma '' af the end of the secondari school , i special in mechan engin and then , after graduat , i start to work as mechan engin on some veri focu matter , keep develop my skill over and over and , at the same time , special in some veri narrow subject . after 5 year of work experi and at the age of 30 , i can say that i chose the right way becaus i am veri consciou of my everyday life and veri reward and appreci at work .
