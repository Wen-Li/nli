there are some peopl who like to go with tour guid in a big group when they travel oversea and even in domest tour . it is not the case for me . i like travel by my self . there are three reason whi i like travel by myself and i disagre with the statement abov , the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , becaus it would be imposs in group to go place that i want , delay the flight , and not buy lot of suvenior . first , it will be imposs to drop by the place that i want to go . if i go in a tour guid group , group ca n't go wherev i want to go but where peopl in group agre to go . it is imposs to get out of tour guid ' itinerari too becaus of the safeti reason what they call . for exampl , i will be realli sad not drop by at the most famou cholat store in san francisco when other might think it is wast of time . second , it is imposs to delay my flight . group move by itinerari that have assign long befor by tour compani . the tour guid would want to go as mani place as they think in a short time . what if i want to stay in tour area for a while for a nice , bronz tan i want to get in franc ? what if i fall in love which hot italian guy who is realli good at kiss ? i would want to delay my flight for a week or so . is that possibl for tour in goup ? no way . some peopl might say , `` i miss korea , i want kimchi ! '' when other do n't . third , tour guid tend to take tour group to ton of suvenior shop . just like leash dog off from owner , tour guid spare mani hour in suvenior shop think that peopl might want to buy lot 's of them and take it home . i do n't go travel to buy suvenior . it would be wast of time , spend three hour in duti free shop . in conclus , travel in group is not attract to me becaus , if i go travel , i want to spare more time know and lean the place that i go by will to spare more time and effort on tri to know what i want . so , it is not the best idea to travel in group led by a tour guid .
