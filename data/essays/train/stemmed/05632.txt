the massiv develop of advertis strategi repres one of the most relev characterist of the `` consumpt societi '' we live in . the goal of the market is not necessarili to make the product seem much better than it realli is , but rather to attract the consum 's attent on the product . first , in mani case , emphasi is put on one special featur of a certain product , rather than on overal qualiti . we will illustr such claim with an exampl . advertis of soap to clean the kitchen board have been some of the most common commerci on tv at least for the last twenti year . produc know that , in spite of minor differ , all the compet product are veri similar . market target are like to be awar of thi , too . therefor , these commerci usual do not tri to convey the messag that product a is better than b , c , d , but rather they aim to stress a particular featur . for exampl , one advertis might put the emphasi on the nice smell produc by the soap , anoth on how fast it is to use . in thi way , each produc aim to differenti her product from the other along a particular dimens and to becom attract for a particular target of consum , thu creat a special market nich . second , advertis usual reli on a specif eye-catch imag that stay impress in the consum 's mind . referrign again to the exampl illustr in the previou paragraph , compani often hire a movi or tv star who act as housekeep in the commerci . such tactic ha noth to do with emphas how good the product is . howev , it creat a refer point for the housekeep who is about to go to do the groceri . it is a somewhat sublimin messag that convey the messag : `` if i use thi product , i coudl be like her one day ! '' . anoth good exampl refer to the commerci for car . most of them show the car cross desert or magnifici coast road in exot place . there is probabl no consum who realli care about whether or not the car can realli cross a desert . yet , such imag stay impress , and the consum will inadvert associ that model of car with an idea of freedom , long travel , adventur . in addit , there are some commerci that are just deliber stupid . they reli on some joke or messag that provok the same reaction in everybodi : `` who the hell creat such a stupid commerci ! ? '' . well , if potenti consum wonder about thi , the goal ha been achiev . the product ha a place in the consum 's mind . and mayb that brand name will come out when he or she goe to the commerci center the day after . in conclus we want to stress how it is of cours import that consum perceiv the product as a good one , not as a `` lemon '' . howev , thi is probabl a secondari point in the mind of a creator of advertis : the emphasi is not on the exagger of the qualiti of the product , but rather on the way it is possibl to attract consum ' attent on the promot product , through the usag of particular creativ messagg .
