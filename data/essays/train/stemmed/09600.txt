it is definit import for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact becaus fact are base on idea and concept . there alway is some concept in the process to reach for a particular fact . so if a student is not clear in his/her idea or concept he will definit have some problem in find a particular fact about someth . let us take an exampl . suppos that there is a student work on some physic paper . now he come across a point of `` work '' . and he notic that the formula for forc is work = forc * displac ( forc multipli by displac ) now if the student doe not know anyth about `` displac '' , i.e. whether a posit or a neg displac , he will be confus . anoth import thing is that the `` fact and figur '' , that we make use of while understand the `` idea or concept '' , are also base on some concept . work on a concept with some fact lead to a new `` fact '' . we sometim take an exampl of newton third law of motion in our everyday life . the law state that `` everi action ha an equal and opposit reaction '' . suppos we hit the wall with our hand , it definit hurt . the reason for thi is that when we appli forc on a bodi it react to it at the same moment the forc is appli . we never wonder whi we are hurt . thi also ha mani reason . first of ll the third law of motion prompt the wall to react back . secondli the densiti of the wall is more than our hand . becaus if we hit a bag of cotton with the same forc it wont hurt here we have made use of fact and concept both . we see that `` fact '' and `` concept '' are interrel but it is veri import to understand the concept and idea befor we tri to learn or arriv at ani fact . moreov if we dont understand ani idea or concept we just keep on work on the known fact . but if we concentr on the concept or idea about a particular thing , it may be that we develop a new fact about it .
