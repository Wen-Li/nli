young and old peopl have differ way of live . yet they both enjoy life . on the first hand i will see whi it is often said that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . on the other hand i will show that the statement is not alway true . first , young peopl are more ealthi and it easier for them to have a lot of activ . for exampl , student are more like to hang out at night and wake up earli in the morn . yet , it is their way of enjoy life . then , student life such as live on campu help parti , have meet and do sport . young peopl enjoy life more than older becaus they are alway discov thing for exampl they learn new thing everi day in class . final , young peopl are not as consciou of the danger as older peopl and so they just live without take care of the troubl they may meet . for an exampl we alway say that children are innoc becaus they just live their life by play , eat and sleep . we could go as far as to say that they enjoy more life becaus they have less troubl than older peopl who still enjoy life but differ . first , we must bear in mind that enjoy life is an import part of our intellecut develop and that we need to be happi in order to live well . older peopl have differ activ , they may prefer stay at home read a book instead of hang out with friend . that do not mean that they enjoy life less than young peopl . then , if older peopl seem to be more calm amd to enjoy less life than young peopl it is probabl becaus they have alreadi been young , and everyth youth are do now they have done it a long time ago ! actual , adult who have to take care of a familli may have less time to enjoy their life in the same way that they did befor but that doe not mean that they do not enjoy life , becaus familli life for them may be more enjoy than student life . to conclud , as far as i am concern i would say that peopl enjoy their life differ wether they are young or old but they still enjoy their life . to my mind onli a person is abl to say if he is enjoy is life or not , and it is difficult to compar becaus it depend on everyon tast .
