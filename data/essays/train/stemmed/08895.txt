most of peopl sort some bia aganist travel , some consid it is more fun to travel alon , but other choos to traval in agroup led by a tour guid . in my opinion i would prefer to travel in a group led support by a tour guid for the follow reason . first , when you travel for a trip or a journey abroad and you do not know anyth about that countrey , so it will be veri hard for you to figur out the most interst place in that countri beaus you do not have ani a tour guid , who can help you alot to save your time and to enjoy the most beauti place around . i think a tour guid can assist in that matter , sinc he is more experi about the place and he have more inform that can help you to understand certain thing in ani place or ani countri you go . second , it is veri hard for anyon who doe not speak a certain kind of lanauga , for exampl if u want to go india and you dont speak indian what you can do in that situat , becaus not everyon speak english , therfor you should have a tour guid who can speak indian , who will help you in anyth you need . third , the soul of the group is veri good thing . they give you accompani in your trip and make it easi if the trip take long time , you can share stori with each other and you can have a realli a great time . a tour guid can make the trip more orgnis and in that matter you can save time , so you can spend it in anoth thing . in concus , i agre with that statement becaus the group led and the tour guid realli can make it differ if you want to make your travel alon
