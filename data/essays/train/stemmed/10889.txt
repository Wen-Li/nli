i agre with thi sentenc , becaus if i do onli the thing that i know to do well , i do n't understand noth of new , and i never grow up . in my person experi , i took a veri hard carreer for me . in fact , studi is not my passion , but i think that today , in the world , and in particular in itali , the success of a person begin with a high level carreer of studi . in thi way i began seven year ago a univers 's cours of mechan engin . i found veri much difficult dure these year , but search to pass these problem i becom stronger than when i began the univers . but the risk in the life is to be too happi for the thing obtain , and to think `` to be arriv '' , and consegu do n't see the world around us . i think that is import to never `` seat down '' , and continu to do thing that we do not well , in the way to understand alwai new thing and to make a better person to themselv .
