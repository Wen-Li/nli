in earlier time school and school itself had an excess straight forward concept , to dump inform in form of fact onto the student without consid them as individu . howev thi concept is outdat and thank most necessari adjust to a modern way of learn have been made . of cours it is much more effici to understand idea and concept to eventu be abl to put them to use in realiti than to just learn fact by heart without understand them . have sever gener in my own famili i can experi the inful of an older , less modern educ . in those time the motto often wa `` just accept it '' . veri often unmotiv teacher still use thi concept with their student today , they just are n't interest in their educ . compar to that a passion , motiv teacher will alway take the time to explain the fact he just put in the student ' head and turn them into comprehens concept . the best exampl would be a complict look mathemat formula with three variabl . if a teacher just throw that formula on a student 's desk while tell him to adapt it to the number 2 , 5 and 9 the student will most like respond with a blank stare . howev if the teacher approach hi student with the given formula and sit down with him and explain whi thi and that is in it , the student will probabl be abl to use it soon . or if one learn a certain book by heart , will he understand it ? no , in that case it would not even be a given that the particular person will know ani of the content , he will simpli be abl to repeat the word , like a robot . howev if thi person concious read that book and overthink the variou concept , he will learn from it . it is logic that the understand of a given idea or concept is more product and thu more import than to just learn the dri fact . fact do not have to equal knowledg , and onli knowledg will get you somewher .
