last week while i wa drive to gallar , a town near the univers i attend , i met my granmoth , so i stop and ask her were she wa go . surprisingli she said that she wa go to an elderli hous in order to help the volunt that work there . i have to admit that i strongli felt guilti > i wa go to a shop mall to do some shop ! thu , you can understand that i sure agre with thi statement . person i think that nowaday young peopl * like me ( don-t spend enought time help thier commun . there are mani reason for thi behavior . first i-m afraid that young peopl aren-t sure as gener as they ancestor . they are much more commit to thier own interest and necess so they don-t see the need of other peopl . what- more they are not use to live away from their famili and grandpar so they don-t understand how import is for elderli peopl to spend some time with the youngest , just listen to their problem and love stori . furthermor they usual stay at univers campus all the day/long , they don-t go off until the even so they don-t even know what the problem of the commun off the campu can be or where they can work as volunt . thi fact must not be entir seen as a lack of young peopl . the work that must be done to receiv high grade is veri hard . student don-t have onli to attend the lesson , but they must review the note taken in class , meet other student in order to compar these note , do group research in the laboratori . .. thu , veri short time remaind for them and dure these free time they probabl want to enjoy theirselv . so , even if it is true that young peopl don-t spend enought time help their commun , in my point of view it is not complet they fault . thu , you can understand whi last week i actual went to the shop mall . but you can also understand whi i phone my granmoth later and ask her if she need some help at the elderli hous .
