i agre in part with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg on mani academ subject than have special onli in one specif subject . i give my view and opinion to my decis . firstli , have broad knowledg in everi field of academ is essenti to know the differ aspect of our day to day life . like have a knowledg about biolog is essenti even to a mathematician in hi daili life . silmilarli , have knowledg about buisi , art , technologhi is also essenti to him . these appli to all the field of peopl , a botanist or zoologist need math for hi statist analysi and geographi to studi the distribut of life . a buisinessman should be awar of the softwar program to use in hi buisi life . a softwar engin also requir knowledg regard chang cost and about the financ . on the contrari spend so much of time in studi all the field make hi time less to master hi own subject . societi need specialist in everi field of academ from doctor , engin and in everi field of life . take exampl of a doctor , he need to studi all the subject in medicin to a basic extent . later if he specialis in a particular subject like cardiolog , pediatr or gyneacolog . he should have awar of the complaint and diseas all kind of peopl suffer from . becaus if a women come to a see a cardiologist and he find she also ha a gynaecolog problem he should immedi refer her to a gynaecologist . thi show the respect and smart of a doctor in deal her overal health statu . but he is a specialist and he can correct her cardiac problem alon which a nonspecialist doctor could not do . so specialis is requir in everi academ subject to show maximum result of the studi and master the field one is in . on the other hand basic knowledg about all the other subject should be incur in everi individu which is requir in thi current era .
