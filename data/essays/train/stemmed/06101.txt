i do not agre with thi statement that in twenti year there will be fewer usag of car than there are today . i dont agre with thi becaus , firstli , when the technolog is increas there will be more car in use than they are today . with the increas technolog we can have car which seem same as be in our home . now-a-day we are get formula1 car which are the fastest car in the world . as the say goe `` increas in technolog will increas the world in mani way '' .car are also in the same way , with the increas in technolog the technolog of car will also be increas rather than becom fewer in come year . secondli , now-a-day each and everi person is prefer to have a car becaus it is a best as well as convini way to go in a car rather than go in buse and train . becaus they may consum a lot of time wait for all the peopl who are travel at that time to come . but when thi is compar to car we dont need to wait becaus we have our own car to travel . thirdli , as petroleum is decreas day-by-day , we may say that car will becom fewer in use than they are today , but technolog is now invent car which run by gase for exampl , gase which we use for cook etc , . by thi we can say that car can also be run without petroleum and can be run with gase either . so thi will also not affect for car becom fewer in the upcom year . so i conclud by say that car will not becom fewer in use than they are today with the abov state reason . the usag of car will increas rather than decreas in the come year .
