to studi sever academ subject in the univers is not bad at all . her , the student will learn and discov mani fact and inform about mani thing in the life . now thay may learn about thing that they never though about which-in my opinion-wil add to thier knowledg alot . there are mani studi done recent to know if other subject be taken by the student outsid their special area may upgrad their gener scor in the exam and improv their understand in the gener scinc . it wa found that those student who took sever subject outsid their special area they do better in their final exam . howev , we should not be veri opitimist about thi . there are still mani academ research beliv the opposit . some of them think-from their experinc - that take subject from outsid the special area bring undesir effect . it wa report that some student who took subject that are directli relat to their sepciliati are not give enough attent to their major cours and actuali they are not concentr and , therfor , they wast their time and abov all extra subject add nothinhg to their knowledg . moreov , some academ principl are current revis thi issu in the univers and tri to come to a sort of strategi whether to keep the door open for ani student to take broaden his/her knowledg or put some restrict on it . in my opinion , if the student take what ewver subject outsid his/her special thi wo n't bring bad at ani how . in fact thi will increas the the gener inform about mani thing in the life . in conclus - and base on my own experinc - student should be alway encourag to take subject from in and outsid their area of special , but i also feel that more studi should be conduct to know the exact effect of take mani subject on the final perfom and knowledg of the student .
