when we talk about travel a lot of thing come to our mind like price , place to visit , time to expend in such place and if is good to be led by a tour guid or not . i think the best way to travel is by oneself , without a tour guid . there are mani reason that support my idea . for exampl oneself could visit other place not offer in the tour , design their own schedul , and skip non interest place . in a tour the guid take their group of tourist to an especif place , alreadi plan by the travel agenc . in contrast , without a tour guid oneself could go wherev he/sh want . for instanc , i travel to toronto and i found interest travel to place by myself . i had the chanc to talk to peopl from the citi and ask them the best place to visit from their point of view , they know better than tour guid . in a plan tour , the tourist have an schedul to follow . i prefer to plan my own schedul , accord to my interest and neces . for exampl , what if i want to go and relax all day on the beach . if i have the chanc to elabor my schedul . i can adjust my plan to visit other place in order to get what i want . final , some tour agenc have tour plan to visit place that are import to certain type of peopl . i went to visit florida for my vacat and i had bad luck becaus i travel with a group of old peopl . they were not interest in visit place like busch garden or exit theme park like univers studio . they just want to stay at the beach , or go to quiet place . if i would travel by myself without a tour guid , i would visit theme park with those exit roller coaster , or visit beach full of young women . in gener , i consid a better option to travel without a tour guid . the experi is more exit and suit to oneself interest . therefor , oneself could visit place interest for the person instead of place interest for the tour agenc , creat their own schedul and skip `` bore '' place to other more interest .
