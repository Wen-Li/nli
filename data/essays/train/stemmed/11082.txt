i believ that the issu of whether or not you should have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject instead of special in one subject depend on your plan for your futur career . if you plan to studi a subject and gain as much academ degre as possibl in it , you may think of becom yourself a part of the faculti staff , mayb an academ teacher or even a professor . in such posit you should have a broad knowledg in your specif field of studi so that you are abl to provid the student bodi with an excel educ . you also have to repres your depart and thu seem veri compet and confid concern your `` special '' . on the other hand , i think that thi field of employ is rather limit and much more student will appli for job in enterpris or other firm . we live in a world which is character by grow global and a tendenc to chang faster and faster . in such time you should be abl to adapt to an ever chang environ , for you can never be too sure of your posit . you may be ask to do addit work which ha noth to do with the subject you studi at univers . it is expect that a modern employe is abl to improvis and to be open to chang . as in these time of modern media the time we need to acquir certain inform is much less than some year ago , we are expect to have a broader knowledg of the world , especi in the field of histori , polit and cultur . the world is a melt and meet pot of cultur and countri which struggl to keep updat and remain or becom a lead nation in thi world . for that reason everi citizen ha to play hi part in economi , and he play it best if he is flexibl and abl to solv ani problem he face whether it is part of the subject he special in or not . in my opinion you should tri to gather as much knowledg as possibl and the best way to do that is to studi mani academ subject and everyth that you are interest in as well .
