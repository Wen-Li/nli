travel in a group rather than alon is most of the time a difficult decis to take and it involv mani person and extern factor : the place you intend to visit , your social prefer , your toler for be with other peopl for long laps of time , the type of peopl that will come along for thi long trip . .. and mani other . i do agre that travel in a group led by a guid is a good experi in most circumst . when i intend to visit a larg citi , an histor site or a countri of which i do not speak the languag , be led by an experienc guid and toghet with some travel friend is essenti for me . i have the opportun to learn more about the cultur of the citi or the countri that i am visit , while discov pleasur ( i.e. nice restaur or nice locat ) that i probabl could not find with my littl written guid . for exampl , when i wa in montreal with my husband we drag our friend to a `` not prici and excel : '' restaur follow direct of our use littl guid . sure the food wa good , but the not prici part need to be discuss ( and our friend offer to pay prior to se the bill ) . in visit histor place the role of a guid is even more import . live in venic for mani year , i have alway been impress by the amount of inform i did n't know about the local church , and , despit be a local , i enjoy to join guid group while walk through the church . even when travel in remot place , be in a `` protect '' group with a guid that is abl to help you with the essenti need is wise . my aunt wa in mongolia for 3 week , live with nomad in a tent and drink acid milk with all her travel companion , and , onc back , she assur me that she would not repeat the same trip without a guid . sometim howev travel in a group may be frustrat . it requir concili need and desir of differ peopl , while toler organiz and travel issu . probabl a good travel `` social '' attitud is the best way to face ani trip and to enjoy a good guid trip . and , as a last point , have a good guid make all the differ !
