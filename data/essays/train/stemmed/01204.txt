there are some out there who think that the fact are more import than the idea or differ concept . other think in completli opposit manner . as far as i concer the i have alway been follow of the true fact that is practic stuff . i have some exampl to support my statement . firstli , the import of fact should be understood in more broader manner , the idea and concept are deriv by fact . so if one can not understand the fact , it would be diffcult to understand the idea and concept behind certain fact . i have one astonish exampl of einstin . i have read in the magazin ( reader 's digest ) that he alway understood the concept and idea by experienc fact . the theori of graviti is perfect exampl of the , fact come first and then the concept and idea . secondli , the fact repres the overal idea behind it . so whi not learn fact first then the idea ? in fact , if you consid or hold veri much import of the fact , you are bound to understand the concept behind it . most of scientist deriv their thoeri by understand the certain fact in most perfect manner . so i think it is realli import to fouc of te lear differ fact . thirdli , student should focu of the pratic knowledg , which hold tremead import in realli life . i , myself , is perfect exampl , be a civil engin , the fact behind everi condit hold a import . in some condit , we obiv requir the understand for concept . but most of the time the learn fact is key . in the end , the point i like to conclud is the student as far as possibl should foucu lear and understand the critic fact of ani subject .
