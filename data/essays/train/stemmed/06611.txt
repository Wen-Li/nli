i think young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . there are three reason whi i can say so . first , the connect between peopl in our societi ha been get weaker these day in japan . therefor , it doe not seem that we have to pay attent to the commun ani more . about 40 or 50 year ago , the connect between peopl in the commun wa veri strong . becaus there are less peopl in one commun , almost all the member of commun knew each other . children wa scold by other child 's parent if they behav badli . so , young peopl thought they were nurtr and educ by the commun . therefor they tend to think that they had to return someth for the commun . howev , we do not even know the member of our commun , becaus there are too mani peopl in one commun . we do not even greet each other . so young peopl can not think `` we are here becaus of the good commun '' . thi is the first reason whi young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . the second reason is that young peopl spend more time for themselv than they use to do . we have a lot of entertain and attract thing in the world nowaday . some want to see rock musician , other want to see basebal game . in addit , we can do most of thing without anybodi 's help in the commun . althogh some young peopl are help their commun by volunt . howev , now it ha been work for their own purpos . mani univers and compani admit student ' volunt experi as their `` evid of good person and social skill '' so , these volunt work are done for their own rather than the commun . most of young peopl may not do volunt work after they enter the univers or compani . thi is whi i think young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun .
