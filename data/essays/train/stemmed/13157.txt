i strongli disagre with the best way to travel with tour guid . when i wa a kid , i went to sight with my parent , rel , and tour guid . it wa the worst experi which i have ever had . here are sever reason whi travel led by guid is so bad . in begin with , travel with guid is form tightli becaus it is alreadi plan befor the start . it can not give you a free time . not onli that , but you can not afford to break even though you can not buy onli one present for your friend . i think that one of the purpos which have a tour is relax without busi life . if you go with guid , you will not get ani fresh air . second , travel in a group make peopl angri . it can be illustr that some want to stay to focu on what they are interest , other have a desir to move anoth place becaus they do not need to observ anymor . in thi case , they have to decid what they will do . but ani group in thi situat would be disappoint . final , there is a famou maxim - if you travel alon , you are not alon . it mean that go trip alon allow you make frine . for instanc , i went to japan when i wa a freshman in the univers . i had a travel for a month . i can not speak japanes fluentli in that tour , i can make friend - nakasaki , murama , and yorisimo . it wa an unfogett experi . when you are with your fellow , you can not have chanc to have new foreign friend . as i mention abov , i do n't like travel in a group led by guid . fix tour plan make me exhausetd . group tour make person dissatisfi . and if you can go somewher alon , you can get friend . on the contrari , if you are veri old , you can like a group tour with a guid . it make sens that if you are satisfi with that , you are too old to feel free .
