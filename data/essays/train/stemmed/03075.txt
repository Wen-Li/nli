mani peopl might find ` special ' a convinc and advanc posit especi in the modern busi world . it appear to me , howev , that those who have broader knowledg of mani academ subject , who might be call ` generalist ' , will be get more and more import . i work in one of the biggest bank group in japan , which includ more than 30,000 perman employe and over 10,000 part-tim employe . gener speak , the product and servic that a bank provid requir high-level and special knowledg , particulari in the stage where those product and servic are develop and organis . howev , those are not provid not onli for profession within the same industri but also for ordinari peopl who do not have ani special know-how or skill of financi instrument . in thi market stage , the import of those who have broad knowleadg of mani academ subject can be clearli identifi , becaus such peopl have a varieti of perspect base on the academ background and can approach the possibl custom from variou angl . thi is one of the most import element in promot and enhanc busi . secondli , accord to my busi experi , i would like to stress that good manag in an organ often have variou academ background as well as a varieti of busi experi . i am not say that a specialist who concentr on one specif subject can not be a good manag . howev , in most case , it is the fact that senior manag need to cover extrem wide rang of busi area . in thi context , a compani is highli like to regard those who have broad knowledg base on mani academ subject as potenti candid for good maneg or , final , futur board member . in the reason state abov , i believ those who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject are more highli appreci than are those who special in one specif subject , especi in the futur busi world .
