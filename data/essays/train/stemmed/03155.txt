there is an arguement concern whether it is benefici for peopl to have broad knowledg of mani field or to special in one particular subject . although it is true that one specif knowledg can be more effici , i believ that broad knowledg ha mani advantag . in thi essay , i will briefli two reason support my idea . most of all , peopl who have broad knowledg of mani academ subject can studi their own field . in particular , in the scienc research , scientist who have a varieti of knowledg can be obtain idea about hi research from differ subject . for exampl , i read an articl of one physicist whom i do not rememb hi name . he said that he often gain hi idea about physic research from literatur . besid , the paradigm of subject are shift in 21st centri . in 21th centri , mani subject are combin with other subject which are not relat them . for instanc , physicist can adjust hi knowledg to the medic scienc or biolog , and economist can use scientif method to anal econom materi . in thi respect , know mani academ subject have mani benefit to studi . moreov , have broad knowledg can make life more plenti . particularli , person who have mani academ subject can talk and discuss with peopl who have differ job or major . therefor , he can enjoy variou kind of subject and make friend who is in differ field . thi make hi life more excit and plenti . besid , peopl who have differ subject with their major can applic thi knowledg hi level of live better . for exampl , my uncl is professor of biolog but he also know well about economi . he adjust hi knowledg about economi to invest stock , and he earn muci money . in conclus , have a wide rang of knowledg is better on account of reason that i mention abov : variou knowledg can contribut to not onli the reseach and studi in mani field , but also make more plenti life .
