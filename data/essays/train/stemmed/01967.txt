ye , i agre with the statement `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . how a person is success ? or you can ask whi a person is success ? the answer to thi question is that ` it is all about the innov ' , i.e. innov mind . if you tri do new thing , innov thing , definit one will succeed in the area in which he is tri new thing . it not thet you are not successful in one field than onli you can tri anoth field . peopl who are success in one field , also tri to be in anoth field and tri to succeed in that , those peopl are success peopl . their mind think differ , think innov and uniqu thing . also if a person is do a similar thing for longer period of time , he will get bore of it . so one should tri do differ thing not for the sake of success onli but for their own knowledg also . success peopl never stick to one thing which they know how to do well but they alway tri do differ thing . there are mani exampl of peopl who are veri innov . they are success in one field but then also they tri do differ thing in which they are new . and if hard work is done with dedic , noth is imposs . there are mani peopl who are veri success in their cinema career , sport etc but they tri polit also , and guess what , they are success in that field also . that peopl were also new to polit , but they tri to manag both the field simultan . so what i think that a person should alway tri differ thing and never stick to just one thing in life , not for success onli but also for a chang in life .
