i do believ that the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus the young peopl have more time and energi to enjoy in a day as compar to the older peopl who work throughout the day mostli to make end meet and henc are left with not much of a time and energi to enjoy at the end of the day . be young you have lot of thing to explor and look at as in school and then the colleg . all those differ field trip and the social and cultur program are just a few to mention when we say about how the young peopl enjoy more than the older peopl . for the older peopl , their job or busi do not have such field trip or cultur program to lighten up their spirit , as their schedul doe not permit with all such thing . a typic 9 to 5 job to take up the time of the day do pretti much the same job for year togeth . the older gener pay for the enjoy of the younger gener . and liter , it is so , as the older peopl spent most of their live make and build their asset , which is of cours for the younger gener of their . so the young peopl spend on their parent money and do not have to worri about how they will get the money tommorow as they know they have a monthli or the daili allow which is go to come their way anyway . as the older gener have more worri in think about their financ and budget and their hous hold requir which the younger gener doe not have to think of as it is been taken care of for them by the older peopl . so that again leav them more time and energi to enjoy . so i feel that young peopl sure do enjoy more than the older peopl do .
