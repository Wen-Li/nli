i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . i think profit is the most import for almost everi compani , so when they advertis their product to the custom , the product have to be look nice so that their custom would buy them . in addit , the compani should advertis the product nicer and i think thi is a part of their job . for exampl , when veget are advertis on the paper , they usual look fresh and clean but not with dirt . brcaus the compani think they would better to advertis the clean one so that mani custom might want to go to the shop and buy them . howev , as most peopl have alreadi experienc like thi situat . when you see the advertis of product that you want to buy , it seem nice to you . but when you actual see the product at the shop , it is not that nice as you were expect and start to complain . i think thi is natur and what you need to do is see befor you buy it . if compani advertis their product as exactli as it look , not mani peopl would buy them compar to the situat in the statement . becaus of these reason , i agre to the opinion that the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
