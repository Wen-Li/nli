mani compani spend a lot of money in advertis . also , they have special section and skill peopl for advertis . all these to market them product to custom . in my opinion , i total agre with statment that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are for three reason . first of all , ani product in the world have advantag and disadvantag . the best product is that ha mani advantag and few disadvantag . in all advertis , onli the advantag of product is seen but the disadvantag is not . if person see advertis , the product will seem much better than it realli is . second , most compani use multimedi - text , sound , pictur , vedio - in product advertis . these combin of technolog will put the product in the suitabl environ that will effect on the custom . for exampl , if you would like to buy a televis and you see adverti about two kind of televis . first one use multimedi that show the televis with high resolut and you best program and best actor on it . second advertis without use ani technolog . i think you will select the first one becaus you think is better even though if the first televis an dsecond televis are same in featur . final , mani compani contract with beauti men and women or with famou player or actor to present in advertis and use product . if you see product with your favorit player or actor , you will buy the product even though it is not good product . inconclus , i total think that product have less qualiti than they are appear in advertis for three reaso . onli advantag are present on advertis , compani use mutimedi in product advertis , and compani contract with famou peopl to present in product advertis . i think , we have to be accur befor buy ani product especi if we see it in advertis .
