i disagre with the statement . there will be moer car instead . the most import reason is the unstopp econom growth in the underdevelop world , china and indi in particula . when you consid the prospect of their economi and the quantiti of their popul , all the other neg factor seem to be overwhelm . of cours , there will be up and down in their econom growth . howev , even a small persentag of car ownership in the two countri mean emmens number of the car in the world . secondli , consid the duarabl of present car will allow larg portion of car in use now surviv in twenti year . you can see thi from the fact that in mani under-develop contri , mani use car are still use for peopl 's daili purpos . on top of these old car , more car will sure be produs . the third reason is the peopl tendensi to stick to the old habit . or way of live . onc you acquir the habit of drive a car around , unless you are forc to quit it legal or econom , you wo n't cahng the habit . in the develop contri where mani peopl arr now drive car . such regul or drastic econom diclin are unlikli . the forth point is rather tricki . the statement is not specif about the type of car it mean . therfor i would like to includ new type of car such as electr car or etanor-engind car . with these new technolog , the durat of `` car '' will surviv at least nore than twenti year .
