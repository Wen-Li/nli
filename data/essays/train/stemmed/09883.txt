everyon ha differ opinion on whether travel in a group that is led by a tour guid or by ownself . it depend on individu peopl 's variou point of view . howev in my perspect , travel in a group give more advantag to me . becaus , it is conveni and easi to understand the countri . first of all , peopl can visit all the place with out ani difficulti . of cours it would be more interest and advantur to be travel by ownself , howev travel in a group give more profit to peopl . in my person experi , when i tralv alon to australia , i had a troubl with the visit tourism place , becaus i lost my self in the middl of the town , so i face difficulti look for the place . moreov , i spend about two hour look for a inform center . if i had a tour guid , i would had a wonder vacat in australia visit mani fun place , instead of wast time on the road . secondli , peopl can understand and the countri easili . although , peopl travel without tour guid can also understand the cultur and countri , howev , i believ it is more benefici to have a tour guid . when my mother and father travel to the new zealand , they found so mani interest thing from there , becaus the guid translat all the inform that they visit and also , tell stori that is relev to the event or histori . therefor my parent could understand the cutur and also some tradit stori with out difficulti . thu , peopl , like my parent who can not speak the languag that they are visit , can also learnt about the countrey with out ani troubl . in conclus , for these reason that i have mention abov , eventhough , travel arund the countri with tourt guid might be more memor and more fun , i think howev lede guid i more advantag to me . no on can deni the import of these asset .
