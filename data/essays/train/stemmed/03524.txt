i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . the advantag is that when go on a trip , you are not familiar with the place , so be led by a tour guid is better than go around the place by yourself and get lost . the disadvantag is that you ca n't choos which place to go to , you also have to wake up veri earli and get prepar for the journey you are have that day . last year , i went to guilin , which is in china . my famili hire a tour guid . i rememb that we had to wake up at 7am and had to be readi by 7:30am . we went around the citi and my leg were veri sore by the time we return to the hotel . the tour guid wa not realli friendli and my famili wa not pleas with her . we also had to go in a group , which wa not such a pleasant experi . there wa anoth famili who wa alway late for arriv . and everybodi wa displeas with them . anoth experi wa that a few year ago in malaysia , my mother also hire a tour guid . the tour guid wa veri greedi and not veri polit . on anoth trip to bangkok , we did not hire a tour guid and we went around bangkok by ourselv . i think that my famili and i had a much more delight holiday and we had a lot of fun there . in my opinion , i think that hire a tour guid is not as good as go around by yourself . though you may not know the place veri well , you can alway ask the local peopl who live there , i am sure at least one of them is will to tell you the direct of the place . tour guid may not be veri profession and their manner may not be that polit . so i disagre that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
