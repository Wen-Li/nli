i deepli agre that undestand idea is veri much decis than learn fact . it mean that you understand the gener concept of a situat instead of a littl step in the middl of it . in other word , it is just like , what do you prefer ? to take a great view of the horizon from the peak of a mountain or simpli from the ground . first , it is import to teach thi kind of statement when we are kid . we are start to learn and understand . we are face a new process which ha noth from earli period in life . there is no rock in the way . as soon we understand thi pattern of behaviour , we will put that into practic . furthermor , onc you are use to appli that teach , you will see thing clearer . for exampl , you do not need to sit in the middl of the problem in order to solv it . step backward , get a huge view of the problem from differ angl and , now , tri to face it . we tend to base on our experi to behav in thi way . but , it is much better if we learn it as a child . anoth import thing associ with learn onli fact is that we still have to climb up a whole mountain in order to reach the idea . idea are high up there and we will not undestand how a clock work or a plain flight if we just mere think about fact . it is up where the whole knowledg is locat . again , there is alway the highest point in the citi . say , a skycrap . go there , climb up from the veri begin , start to see advantag and disadvantag and onc you get up there you will solv the whole problem . life will be much easier thi way .
