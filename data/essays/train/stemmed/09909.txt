in my person opinion it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus in a modern world where access to a larg amount of inform about nearli everi subject , problem , or iussu is quit easi to obtain via the internet it should be the main intent of everi learn process to gain the skill necessari to deal with thi mass of avail inform rather than simpli collect it . first off all , no one nowaday will be abl gather all the knowledg of the world . the attempt alon seem to be stupid . howev , in order to deal with all thi knowledg and opportun a student have to develop the abil to select inform , to destract the main idea of a sourc , and to handl all the useless inform . secondli , one might say that it is easi onli to focu on idea and concept while leav out the effort to gain all the inform provid relat to a certain theori or sourc . thi might be true , but the strike point is that onli the concept of a theori can be use again on the next sourc by the student . thirdli , a student is not capabl of endless learn . when sombodi onli store the fact rather than he focus on the concept and idea behind a theori or a sourc , than the space for other inofm is fill with all hi knowledg about onli thi sourc . learn is a process . you can stop it by obtain mass of useless inform . to summar , the first aim for a student should be to learn about the method , idea and concept which enabl him to deal with all kind of problem , sourc , and theori which may occur in hi futur c
