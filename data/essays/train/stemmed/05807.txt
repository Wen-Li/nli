i agre the idea that more import thing for student is to understand idea and concept . the first reason is that if the student can understand and follow the whole idea or concept of one thoeri , it make easili to learn fact . for exampl , imagin that you have to learn the histori of the 1960 . if you learn a lot of fact relat to the 1960 . in 1960 , there are enorm event and mani detail thing you have to rememb . at first , you can rememb the specif thing what you think signific thing , but you forget most of fact you learn the next day . howev , if you studi the whole structur of the histori in 1960 and then add the detail fact and organ well , you can rememb fact easili than just learn fact without understand concept and even you can understand the flow of the histori in 1960 without ani extra affort . furthermor , if you understand the entir idea and concept , it help you can solv the question on your midterm or final exam . thu , it give the opportun to understand anoth histor fact . most of the fact have connect with each other . for exampl , you alreadi studi some histor fact in 1960 . there are some fact which have relat with the other histor fact someth like some event in 1980 . if you know the entir concept of 1960 histori , you can learn addit fact relat to anoth histor time . the last reason , i agre the idea that understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact . is it is the true that you ca n't understand , learn and rememb all of the fact what you need . for instanc , i have a test tomorrow and the test is for type of art . it mean , i have to memor lot of type of art includ realit , romantic . if i did n't know the concept of the romantic , but i have to memor the fact of the romantic . so i start to memor everyth in the art of remantic includ the pictur , histori , artist . evenif i spend one week to prepar my test , i ca n't rememb everyth about romantic . there are a lot of fact in romantic , and it is imposs to memor or even understand without understand the idea and concept . the fact is small thing in one theori . if you want to draw and see the whole pictur of one theori , you have to understand idea and concept befor you learn the fact . understand idea and concept is the most import and basic step to learn fact .
