thi statement is not alway true . for exampl , if you talk with a young boy emargin by the other or with an older man that travel a lot you revalu the argument . anyway the sentenc is true in the major part of situat . for young peopl is easier to enjoy life . there are mani attract , place , event for them than for the older peopl . young can go to disco to danc , they have no problem of money , they can go on holiday and find new friend easier . they have not ani real problem or veri difficult situat . they do n't care about the futur and so they can live the present complet . the most import thing is that they are thoughtless and indipend . on the other hand older peopl have n't mani situat to enjoy life . peopl think that they fun onli with cards-gam or watch old movi but i disagre . old peopl have more problem than younger , most of them are healthi problem . but i think that they love life and enjoy it . younger often do not care about their feel and i think that thi is the most import reason for their sad . i know that they like walk in the park but they will be happier if they stay with their famili . they are not complet indipend and perhap they need the presenc of the other to enjoy . i can find these explan by my experi . first , i am a young boy and i know how i feel everyday . i think i realli enjoy my life more than other peopl - particulari the older one - but i know that it is not alway true . i have a friend that is often sad about life becaus he doe n't like to do what the other guy do , he love to studi a lot and he ha n't a girlfriend . i think older peopl fun much more than him . then , i have a great grandmoth . she is the strongest i have ever known . she love to travel and she visit mani place around the world . when i see her i do n't find sad , never . i think she enjoy her life veri much . the statement is appar true but it could be also fals to a deeper analys . everyth is rel .
