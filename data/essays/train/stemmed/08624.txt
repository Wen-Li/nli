i would say that i do not agre neither disagre with both of the statement . person i think that the truth is in the middl , as also the roman use to say . idea and concept in order to be well explain need some fact to be relat to . an idea could be difficoult to be explain , but with a fact , an exampl , the idea will be more clear to the student and also easier to be memor . as an exampl , i can speak about the french revolut . what wa the idea at the base of the french revolut ? accors to thi subject , in a class mani idea can be explain by the teacher ( i would add in a bore way ) . support idea with fact ( for exampl explain the idea that led to the kill of the king ) would be more interest for student and also more benefici for their learn . mani idea can be well explain , but to realli understand them , we need to surround idea with fact , interest fact , i would add . anoth exampl in which fact have to be strictli relat to idea is for exampl if you want to descrid a market concept to a student . of cours the idea is realli import becaus everytihg start from an idea , but also in thi case in order to support the idea we need to drawn some conclus speak about fact . of cours i am speak about old idea , becuas what i state befor clearli do not match with new idea . how is possibl speak about a subject theme like market and separ the idea at the base of a market campa from the result ( the fact ) . in conclus i would say that what i describ is my opinion the best way of how to teach . i do not believ neither in class full of idea , neither in class full of real fact . as alreadi state both are import , but also more interest is the connect between them .
