it is a common say that older peopl do n't have so much fun in life than younger peopl . or that you have to use the time when you are young , becaus the old age come veri fast and then there is noth left in life that you can enjoy . therefor , it is a veri controvers topic to be discuss if young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i disagre with thi statement , becaus there are mani reason that show the differ . there is a say tell that you are alway as young as you feel . i think that is perfectli right . my mother who is 52 year old doe n't behav like she is over 50 which is a veri old age for young peopl . she wear modern cloth like my sister and i and she listen to the same music . she doe what she want to do and enjoy life as much as possibl . anoth point is that you ca n't say to an old mayb also handicap person that he or she doe n't enjoy life . a friend of my grandmoth is about 76 year old and despit her leg injuri she enjoy life and ha a veri posit attitud . an exampl of how she enjoy life are her variou trip with a group of older peopl . twice a year thi group travel to place in europ by bu . they do n't go hike anymor , but they visit museum or famou build . in addit to that , they are togeth with mani peopl at the same age and with the same interest . everytim thi woman come home from one of those trip she is realli happi , becaus she ha enjoy it so much that she want to go on the next trip again . conclud i can say that by regard variou older peopl i 'm sure that older peopl enjoy life as much as young peopl do . the onli differ is that the activ and event which make peopl enjoy life might differ between young and old .
