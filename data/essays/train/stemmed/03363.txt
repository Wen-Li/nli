today , car are the easiest way to travel . the car is just one of the differ way to travel . it 's probabl the easiest one , but not the cheapest . in a first time i 'll explain the differ postiv point of the car , in a second time , i 'll describ the other way to travel , and in a third point compar both of them . today the car is the easiest way to travel . to go from a point a to a point b. even for short trip we take the car . the car get better and better day after day . most of the teenag are just wait for oin thing , a car . they are abl to go wherev they want , whenev they want and they do n't have to ask their parent , peopl feel that they are get more freedom with a car . we do n't have ani rush when we take our car , we leav whenev we want . the car is less stress than the other way to travel . the car is not the onli way to travel . there is the train , the plane , the bicycl , even by foot for the most courag of us . the train and the plane are a safe way to go from a point a to a point b. but the plane is pretti expens , but it 's get cheaper . but the train is not veri expens and it 's veri easi to take a train , you do n't even have the stress of the road or get an accid . and today , we want to get thing without ani effort . so the train is a veri good way . in twenti year , a lot of thing will chang . even right now thing are chang and they are go to have an impact on our futur as the price of gaz , safeti on the road . .. the train or the plane becom veri cheap , it 's not hard to find a plan ticket from pari to london for 20 $ . i think in twenti year it 's go to be better . so the car is go to be the most expens way to travel . i think , in the futur , we will still have a car . but we are not go to use it as mani time as we do . most of the big citi are get better in transport ( bu , metro , rental bike ) . so i 'm not agre with thi statement , we will still have a car but we will not use it veri often , so one car will probabl be enough for a famili .
