i knew what commun mean , it mean that i have convers with other and i should listen to other when they speak . but sometim i do n't listen to them , and just i talk to them what i want to say . i still confus what i should do when i commun with other , even though i know what it is . i guess i do n't fulli understand what is commun , but also i somehow misunderstand what it mean . in my opinion , understand idea is more import than what it is . i am pretti sure there are a lot of student like me . even though they know a lot of fact or definit , they realli do n't what it mean for themselv . so veri often student could misunderstand what it is . for exempl , even though i learn what is commun , i did n't tri to understand that concept and i just admit thi idea without think . after all , it lead me to misunderstand what commun is and i could n't use thi concept veri well in my life . i think all fact and definit should be adapt to peopl . if one doe n't mean anyth to them , it is realli noth . it can becom someth when it is use by peopl and adapt for their life . i learn a lot of thing when i wa young , but i could n't rememb all those , such as geolog , biolog , literatur . howev i still rememb what i need for my life and my career . i still rememb veri well econom , math , english . it is becaus i need latter more than former , not becaus former is not import . if student find the mean in what they learn , it is veri help for their understand . for these two reason , i believ that understand is more import than what it is . all peopl could learn what it is , but just some peopl could understand and use it for what they realli need .
