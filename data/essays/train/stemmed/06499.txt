i strongli disagre with the statement given . it is not good to have a broad knowledg about mani academ subject . a broad knowledg will not get you good grade in the examin at school . everyon ha heard the famou say `` jack of all trade but master of none '' . also littl knowledg is a danger thing . it can infact endang a person 's life . for exampl while do the cpr techniqu to resuscit a die person you need to have the complet knowledg about the procedur , otherwis you can put hi or her life in danger . anoth place where the special knowledg is use is the `` school of life '' . have a special knowledg can creat a great career oppurtun . thi can translat into a prosper and comfort life . anoth point to be consid is that peopl who have a broad knowledg about mani subject are gener restless peopl who can not concentr long enough on ani subject to master it . thi loss at concentr will result in failur at everi stage in their life . thi will make them a complet loser . also peopl who have special knowledg will make a posit impress on their kid . thi will result in highli inspir kid who will then becom abl and success adult . these kid will in turn produc anoth great gener . in fact special knowledg can transform a dismal or moder nation into a truli great one . thi is the stuff winner are made of . a broad knowledg will onli take you so much far , but to go that extra mile you need to have a someth `` extra '' . thi extra is special knowledg . in the end i would like to say that it is realli much better to have special knowledg about a subject than to have littl knowledg about everyth under the sun . go for special knowledg guy , it is certainli worth it .
