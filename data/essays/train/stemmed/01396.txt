the issu at hand is whether or not is necessari to take risk to succeed in life . i think thi is a veri import issu becaus it ha to do with our person behaviour and most of all with the way everybodi look at life in gener . i am convinc that the onli way to have success is to take risk and to tri to walk road that nobodi walk befor . my first reason to support my thought is my own experi . when i finish the univers in florenc , i decid to come to mexico becaus i wa convinc that i would have greater opportun to realiz my dream than if i had remain in itali . i took the risk to go to a new countri but today i can say that it worth . anoth reason whi i think risk is strictli correl to success is becaus i am convinc that all the way that take you to success must be difficult . as much your dream is bigger as much it will be more difficult to realiz . but difficulti natur impli risk , becaus without take ani risk thing are much easier to realiz , but also they give you less success . of cours not everybodi like to take risk . as i mention befor it depend on our person behaviour . on one hand there are some peopl that enjoy life without take ani risk , follow a routin that they alreadi know veri well . on the other hand there are some peopl that look at life as a contin chang , as take risk all the time . i think i belong to the second group of peopl as i get bore veri easi when i am do the same thing . for all these reason i conclud that peopl who think of success as the main goal of their life , must take risk and tri new thing as mani time as they can . the bigger the risk , the greater the success .
