there is a big differ between the concept of have an extra inform about one academ topic in term of have a enough inform and knowledg about more than one academ subject . accord to me i prefer to have exra inform about one topic instead of have knowledg about more than one topic . becaus of some reason as such ; be happi or earn more money . first of all ; have an extra and extra inform about a subject could make you a specialist about thi area . it is so import featur about make your job good . if you improv yourself realli extraordinarili about a specif subject , it also bring you success and powerti . for instanc ; you are a doctor and you are realli successful in your job . everyon could know you becaus of your abil to reach the goal , as a result you will be a person who is uniqu in your area . also thi success could bring you happiniess and money at the same time . you will be happi becaus you are do your job good and peopl are admir you about your high abil about thi subject . for exampl you are the doctor who will find a solut for the cancer . becaus you are just focus on the thi topic and there is noth to prevent your success . at the same time special will bring you a money . they all relat thing . for instanc again ; if you are a doctor and you are do your job and everyon know you , it mean that you will have lot of patient and you will gain much more money . on the other hand ; you are a doctor but at the same time you want to be a engin or historian . but unfortunatley it s not possibl to becom realli succesful for everi depart . becaus all these subject are differ from each other and the human could not have enough capac to achiev these goal at the same time . as a consequ : you could not reach the same power and respect unlik be a specialist consequnetli : accord to me be a success onli one are instead of more than one , is a realli goood and import thing . becaus it could give you extra adventag like earn more money or be happi .
