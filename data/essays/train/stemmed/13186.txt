sinc the middl of the 20th centuri the number of car on our earth ha been increas rapidli . but is thi trend go to last in the 21st centuri ( question mark !!! ) there are sever point whi i suppos that there will be fewer car in twenti year . take into account that the natur resours like oil will definitli come to an end within the next decad and consequ the price for fuel will increas drastic , i do n't think that normal peopl will be abl to afford a car . in addit , not onli the price for fule might increas , but also car tax and car insur . even today , it is hard for most peopl to afford a car . anoth point is that in my opinion the puplic transport in most citi will be more support by govern in the futur . just think of the billion of euro the governt put into the transrapid . have a look at our citi , the limit for car on the street must have been reach by now . i can not imagin that there is space for even more car , especi dure rush hour . traffic jam and endless wait is an everi day imag on germani road , the number of car must decreas by ani mean in the futur . best exampl for a car - abband polici can be wit in innsbruck , austria . there , the innerc ga pollut and noic pollut becam too much . after vote against innerc traffic , the resid of innsbruck now have the opportun to sit at the maria-theresien-strass and enjoy their innerc atmospher . in my opinion thi exampl should be a guidelin for germani and the rest of the western world as well . if politician go on to refus spend more money on the develop of more econom car and the discov of altern fuel , i 'm sure that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year . if not man is clever enough to do someth against wolrd pollut , environ will strike back some day .
