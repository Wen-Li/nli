i strongli disagre with the statement made that the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help the commun . i agre that the time have chang and peopl have becom more busi and mechan in their routin , but still peopl are take time out of their schedul to help the chariti , or the under-previleg commun . youth is a prime-tim in ani individu 's life , where he/sh ha to concentr on make a good career and pursu their interest at the same time . but i would also like to add that it is `` the '' time where one realiz his/her respons toward the societi . mani success sportsmen , musician , actor have start work toward the devlop of the societi when they realiz that it wa the time to give-back to the societi . in-fact the miss univers and miss world paegent also have the same theme `` beauti with purpos '' . young peopl across the world are activ particip in movement like wwf , green peac , unicef etc to make thi place better . i would like to add that mani success young peopl like bill gate , michael jackson , david beckham have donat huge amount of their fortun to the chariti . there are few peopl who do not care about the societi and are self-centr . but it is the way one is brought up , that make an individu more social respons . to help other around you give us the great feel of purpos and satisfact . peopl when they realiz it , they will sure help the commun in one way or the other . i would like to give the exampl of mother theresa who move out of her countri while she wa young and reach india to help the poverty-stricken and the under-previleg . she led a great life of exampl which i think everyon should rememb and give back to the societi , in our own possibl way .
