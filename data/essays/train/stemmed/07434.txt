i disagre with the idea that in about 20 year time frame there will be fewer car in use that there are today . the reason for my disagr follow . firstli , the popul , as alway , is on a high rise and will continu to do so . henc , there will be more peopl travel on the same and limit space on earth . further , the birth rate and life expect of the peopl ha been increas , with the help of medic advanc that are made everyday , and henc , there will be more number of peopl who will be in a posit to either drive the car by themselv or at least travel in the car . henc , there will be a definit need of more car as there will be more peopl for use the car . secondli , advanc in the machineri of the car and variou part of the car are be made everi pass day . such advenc are also direct toward cut down the cost of the car . if the cost of the car is reduc to great level , more peopl will be abl to afford a seper car for themselv . thirdli , the world is grow global with everi pass day and each member in most of the famili ha seper goal and differ daili routin . in order to achiev their goal and lead their differ daili routin , each member in the famili may need a seper car . henc , the idea that the number of car will be reduc in futur is not a realist one . although , i agre that with the increment in the number of car , more fuel will be need and we have limit sourc of energi and resourc of fuel . but with the research make continu effort for creat and find new sourc of energi , it is not far that we will stop use convent sourc of energi and will have newer sourc of energi . for exampl , it is not far that we will be abl to util the solar energi for drive our car , in fact , mani of the car that run on solar power are alreadi in the market . for all the reason list abov , i disagre with the idea that there will be fewer car in use after 20 year that there are today .
