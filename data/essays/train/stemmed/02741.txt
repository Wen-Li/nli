today , there are countless car on thi planet . but are there sufici resourc to maintain those car ? . i do n't think so . therefor i strongli disagre with the topic scentenc . first , let 's think about the resourc problem . even now , the price of the ga is increas by second . in my oppinion , it show how resourc are limit and how much we have spent . it is so simpl that everyon can assum that , if there are limit resourc and increas demand for the fuel would make the reasourc to be finish faster . so after twenti year , there will be fewer car . second , our tecnolog in advanc like flesh light of camera . i can imagin how long will we use car by , for exampl , i rememb there wa cummun system which can onli accept the phone call . but it wa disap after mobil phone wa invent eventhough it wa veri popular in my countri . therefor advanc tecnolog would not let car to remain after twenti year after . the last reason that i suppot my idea might be the pollut problem . car are creat pollut like air , nois . that refer to we need more advnc type of transport . in conclus , i claim that after twenti year there will be fewer car . in support passag , i said that scares of resourc and rapid advanc tecnolog and need for advanc transpot reason for pollut environ .
