i disagre with the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' . i think have a broad field of knowledg is as import as special in one particular subject . have a broad knowledg of mani academ field onli allow one to know the shallow part of each subject . one who doe not special in ani field can onli be deem as `` amateur '' , not `` profession '' . a person with broad knowledg in mani academ field but no deep insight in ani subject can never design gadget as well as profession engin do ; they can never navig plane as well as profession aviat do ; they can never compos music piec as remark as musician do . .. henc , we need peopl who special in one specif subject to make our world a better place and to run our societi smoothli . howev , special in one one particular subject ha drawback as well . for exampl , in singapor , the univers place too much emphasi on special knowledg . that lead to a work forc that is rather narrow-mind . as a result , singaporean tend to be less creativ and less like to think out of the box . also , peopl with differ academ field might have difficulti in commun with each other , make peopl more isol . on the contrari , the tertiari educ in the unit state emphas on both special and broad knowledg of the student . it make peopl more prepar to make sound dicis in complic circumst which involv differ academ field . for instanc , a politician who special in polit onli will not be abl to make sound sound polici in environment problem . it is also like that he might take the lobbist ' word blindli . henc , it is also import for one to have a broad rang of knowedg . in conclus , i think it is equal import for one to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject and to special in one specif subject .
