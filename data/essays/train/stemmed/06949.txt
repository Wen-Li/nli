some peopl say `` no risk , no fun '' and becaus of thi no profit and furthermor no success . i definit agre with these peopl and with the given statement . of cours there are wit exampl of success peopl who just copi idea in order to earn big profit . of cours mani peopl who do not run a busi in which risk and creativ are daili question , are abl to realiz a nice career as well as high wage . and of cours peopl who defin success in a complet differ way such as be a member of a kind of club mayb even the captain of a bowl team are success with a high degre of riskavers . but from my point of view peopl are onli success if they are abl to chang their environ significantli . i do not reffer to the direct environ as the person social context of an individu . i am talk about chang the whole societi or at least the busi sector you are concern with . what would our world look like without great reform and vison of few peopl ? person like m. l. king , adam smith or mahatma gandhi chang their societi with their invent , theori or opinion . but without take risk or think in new dimens , develop that occur as a result of their think would not have been possibl until now . to be success it demand a low level of riskavers , a geniou strategi ( that can be a simpl strategi as well ) and the abil to implement it . and fact you alreadi know might be the basic knowledg to explor sever idea but without risk and the willing to do someth complet new success can not be realiz . final i total agre with the given statement . i would like to strengthen my opinion again by repeat that from my point of view risk and success are strong partner that can not be chang .
