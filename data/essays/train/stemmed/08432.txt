thi question ask about `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' i agre with thi question becaus the understand idea and concept is more import than to know the fact . idea and concept have a lot of inform . and it can learn and concrud the inform to see the fact is more interest than just find out the result . understand idea and concept are like a untouch diamond . untactch diamond rock is a lot of materi in and not so beauti , but peopl separ the materi they do n't need to make pure diamond . thi is the metafor that i use to discrib the `` understand idea and concepts. '' understand the idea and concept are veri interest than just to learn fact . whi it becom fun becaus i do myself to find a good result or fact it is veri interest for me to learn the way to finish . i can learn the process of solv the question . that is the good part of learn and understand idea use the inform . if you do thi process you would understand how much fun to get a result with joy . learn fact are not a good idea . it like you face the question but you would get the answer right away . it is not fun just you get the answer and not the process . that is whi learn the basic process to understand the way to answer is great . the process of get the result is good for student becaus if they learn the enjoy of learn they would think hard and more concentr . learn fact is not a good thing becaus i can onli learn the sarfac of the fact . if i understand idea and concept i could find a great inform that hide in the sarfac . in my conclus is i agre the idea of the question . the first point is it would be fun to do the process in middl to get the fact . the second point is the student would learn about abustruct or hidden idea under the surfac .
