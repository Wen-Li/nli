some peopl may think special in one specif subject is better . howev , person , i believ it is better to have borad knowledg of mani academ subject . there are two reason for thi . the primari reason is that the new area of academ subject have been creat often by combin some subject . for exampl , portfolio magement theori which won novel prize wa creat by combin of mathmatics/statist and econom . if the reserch who won the prize wa engag onli in tradit econom , it wa imposs for him to develop thi epochmak theori . in gener , the evolut of the area of financ theori ha been depend on the combin of math , statist , econom , phycolog , and a lot of other subject . thi is quit good thing . anoth reason is that it is good for the futur conveni of both student and proffessor to have broad knowledg . in other word , broad knowledg increas the probabl that they can turn their academ area into good direct . for instanc , one of my proffessor in univers who ha been an expert of comput scienc deveop hi career in new area , the law of patent . while he ha studi comput scienc , he ha becom awar that the new technolog can not alway be money . the obstacl for him wa the law of patent . after be an expert of the law of patent , he is respect as an expert who can understand technolog and the law relat to patent . consid with all of the abov factor , i would like to claim that we should aquir borad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than special in just one specif subject . by aquir broad knowledg of mani academ subject , we can increas the probabl to creat new academ area and to develop our career flexibl .
