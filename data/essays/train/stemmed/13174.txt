i feel that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to speacial in one subject . the current era is chang and develop fast . it is grow at a rapid pace and in thi chang world , one need to have inform about everyth and almost everi field . i think that in thi chang era , one ha to have the knowledg of almost everi topic and field . human be is a social anim . he live in a societi where he meet sever peopl from differ stream . if he doesnt have ani idea about other field he cant even to talk to the person he meet . he need to have knowledg about the variou stream . for exampl mahatama gandhi , a lawyer by profess had a divers knowledg about variou subject . he wa an excel speaker , great dramatist and a great poet . he use all these skill to guid india to indep . without the knowledg of these subject he could not have guidd india to indep . one must have a broad knowledg of almost everi subject . thi is not onli help in profession work , but also import for person life . for exampl knowledg of geographi can help one plan a vacat to an exot locat . physic is use in our daili live . chemistri can be realli use to one . one can undersatnd the polit better . one can understand polit better if he ha a knowledg of it . i support thi opinion that knowledg of mani academ subject is better than knowledg of one special subject .
