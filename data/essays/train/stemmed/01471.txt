i agre with the statement that the import thing for student is to understand about the idea and concept rather than learn about the fact . sinc when we get an idea and concept about a particular lesson then we can easili solv ani problem in that lesson . thi type of learn will have greater benefit in student not onli in case of studi but also in our daili life . for exampl , in case of studi if we are studi about the drug mechan , in thi if we understand the idea and concept of drug mechan we can say it use and the side effect of that drug on the bodi . but where as if we learn about the fact about larg number of drug and it side effect then to rememb them it creat a greater problem but it is easier if we know the idea and concept i.e mechan of the drug . when we have greater understand of the idea and the concept we final achiev a better result but it is not possibl in case of learnig the fact . understand the idea and concept lead to more easier way for studi as well as in play , maintain health etc.in case of play we if have the concept of how to play then we can easili play the game but it is not true with that of learn the fact . inord tomaintain health the main import thing is to kano about the process to maintain a good health that it mean we should have a good idea . thu in ani of the subject whether it may be scienc , math . art , etc idea and the concept is realli an imporatnt thing that everi student should know . with thi idea and concept we should then practic as mani time as possibl . if a student ha a greater abil to understand the idea ant the concept he will certainli do good in the exam even if is unprepar for the exam where as the student who do not have the concept he ha more chanc of not do well in the exam . henc , i conclud that an idea and concept is the basic and fundament princip for student rather than learn the fact .
