understand idea and concept and learn fact are two complet differ approach of learn . both have advantag and disadvantag and serv more or less on differ subject . from my point of view it is more import to understand the idea and the concept than to know simpl fact . to understand the world , how it function and whi some thing are the way they are it need a lot of knowledg . there are so mani event and factor that shape and still shape the world and the peopl that the human brain is to small to now everyth in detail . that is whi it is much more import for student to get the skill to work with inform . the abil to analyz a subject and to bring it in order with the gener frame is much more import than to know a thousand fact . in some case learn fact might be the better solut for teacher to test how much their student work for the class and grade them easili but thi knowledg wo n't last veri long . it ha been prove that someth a person ha learn activ , like think about it and discuss it , last longer than thing that have onli be learn by read and hear . i think the best way is in the first year of educ of a child to give him the basic inform and teach him the skill . in the univers the student should onli be ask to understand idea and show that by work in an academ way .
