the demand for car is rapidli increas . but in twenti year time , i think there will be fewer car in use than today . i agre with the idea that the car number will increas in twenti year , and hasv some reason for agr . first , the fossil oil base energi sourc are dicreas . it is get expens and uneffic to use those resourc for the energi suppli of transport . electr , nuclear energi sourc , solar energi and even hydrogen is in consider for replac the fossil oil usag . there is also anoth reason for thi replac which is the air polut that is caus by the fossil oil usag . in order to reduc the polut govern are limit the gasolin type and qualiti use in car . that also rise the price . not onli the fossil oil reserv but also the iron , steel and other metal reserv are forc us to use our resourc more carefuli and more logic for our futur . we should understand that these natur resourc are limit . consid the popul growth , and the size the big citi 's reach , it is possibl to understand the need of a special way of transport : public transport . the trafic jam , the time consum ride are caus cao , trafic accid , polut in the citi . becaus of these result of person transport solut , annual expenditur of the economi are increas constantli . thi is not a weight everi economi could handl . i think the public transportain , especi the rail usag ha to increas to handl these problem . fossil oil energi sourc could be use more effici and harmless in differ area of the industri . more envior friendli and econom solut ha to be found and use for transportatin problem . the car compani are work on the altern energi usag for the futur to substain their compani . some big compani buy the other compani to reduc the competit and some other have merg . thi could be analyz to understand the sector 's futur characterist . i think the shrink market condit forc car compani to fight harder to surviv . with all these sign , i think in twenti year there will be less car in use than today .
