i ca n't agre with the statement . in my opinion . in the futur , there will be more car in the world even though there are some task to solv . at first , we need to concerntrait on the natur resourc . the human be are use it without a long term vision , so they will be almost use up in next 20 year . but , there are lot of studi which tri to find anoth energi sourc . for examol , gain oil from natur grain , use sun energi , and use the wind . the most interest thing is hydrogen . it 's sourc is water which is realli fruent in earth . ( actual , the hydrogen cell is onli meteri problem now . ) so , human be will find anoth energi resourc in twenti year , i sure . second , china , africa , and india will have lot of car in 20 year . as you know they did n't boot their real econom engin . as mani econom specialist say , they will have rapid grow . so , they will have a lot of new car . at last , like a hybrid technaligi there are mani method which can enhanc the effici of car . the more car mean the more happi in the world ? the more advanc in technaligi mean the more happi ? i ca n't answer the question . a import thing is we have to a master of technaligi , in my think . thank you for read . .
