in my opinion today it is more import to special in one specif subject . each field of scienc ha develop veri fast and branch out wide dure the last 100 year . today it is not even possibl to have knowledg about each part of a scientif area . for exampl the area of physic can be devid into hundr of differ part . there is the research of atom behaviour in contrast to the research of forc that influenc movement in our univers . each new invent that humanitiy make becom more and more complex so that even one singl person ca n't undestand all of it . so it is import to special in one subject . on the other side a point for a broad knowledg is that all thi specif knowledg ha to be combin to becom an effici solut . by remain in the scientif field of physic it can be mention that result that came up in atom research have big influenc to research on the whole univers . thu there ha to be a person who recogn relationship between to diffrent area of research . the problem occur with thi contradictionari idea is that there ha to be one part of peopl who have to special and anoth part that poss a broad knowledg to have an overview over all field of research . so by choos the major subject at a univers it is evid that the student know in which posit he want to work in hi or her later life . will he or she go veri far into detail of a subject or more have an overview about a subject . thu at the end i have to conclud that there ca n't be a `` ye '' or `` no '' on the statement . it depend on what the person who ha to decid like better . take a job with caractarist of leadership , then decid for broad knowledg . choos more scientif detail work then it is better to have a specif knowledg .
