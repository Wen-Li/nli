buy or be sure of a product ha becom a veri hard `` homework '' , in fact it offen appen that the pruduct that we choos are not so thrustabl as they are suppos to be . the problem , in my opinion , is the larg role of money in our societi , there are few veri power compani that own the pruducts'mark . their strong reflect itsself on all the mean use to promot more a product than anoth . they produc a lot of public and convinc tattic throght newspap , televion , stand and so on ; that , in ani way , influenc the tast of the listen . `` normal '' peopl think to feel surer on a product accord to how much thi product is known or broadcast . there are so mani exampl to say that thi topic is complit wrong , we have too mani time heard about big compani scandal and sometim about the collaps of one of them , but thought that , peopl seem not to chang their idea . we are too involv in the societi , where we live , not to can make good distinct on what thi societi offer to us . i could suggest the peopl , that are go to buy someth , to be abl to decid without outher condition , they must prove a product and decid if it 's a good product . thi chois is difficult to make becaus of our unawar of be influenc by everyth around us . peopl are offen afraid if a product is not veri common , they compar themselv to the other and that , i think , it 's the main mistak , we have to decid for ourselv , we have to listen to what the other say with an accur distanc , that let us to take our own decis . i think , that 's one good solut not to fall into missunderstand that everyday are around u
