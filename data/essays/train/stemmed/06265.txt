everi one on earth ha hi own idea that could impress or depress the the environ around him . the presenc of these idea doe not cancel the fact that fact are domin in our world . there is a huge differ between the two concept and most peopl get mix up between the two . idea are a special state of a person 's own inspir and thought like the idea of invent a time machin while fact are thing that remain unchang for the rest of life like the fact that sun revolv around earth . although the fact are what take the peopl 's concern , idea are more import than fact becaus from idea we can reach out fact . one good exampl of an idea develop into a fact is space rocket . first scientist had an idea of creat a method of transport that could link us to space . they had the pictur of a space rocket and they start to appli that inspir and thougt to the facil they had ntill they fullfil their satisfact and got the idea of invent a space rocket to realiti tha it becam a fact . now it is a fact that we have a method of transport to the outer space . anoth good exampl is the idea of make peac treati among differ countri . although not all countri are on good term with each other , some work realli hard and succeed in get the idea of make peac treati with other to realiti that it becam a fact . so that littl idea develop into a fact that everi one know about . in conclus those who realli think that fact are more valuabl than idea are mistaken becaus as present abov we can see that almost all fact we know on earth have develop from small idea . basic , for one to reach or develop an idea , he must first start with an idea ; he may or mmay not realis that idea but as a matter of fact he could not have reach thi fact without have an idea at first . that is mainli how ech minim fact ha reach us today .
