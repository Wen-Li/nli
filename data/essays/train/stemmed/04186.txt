there are mani success peopl around the world now and if we want to be a success person , we can learn some thing from them . i agre with thi statement which is `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . i think my father is a success person becaus he is a good sampl for me all the time . he is a doctor in taiwan and when he wa still a kid , he like to tri new thing and alway interest in the thing that he doe not know . my grandmoth told me a lot of hi stori when he is young . and when he studi in high school , he alreadi knew that he want to be a doctor in the futur . he alway got good mark on the test or homework so he did not worri about these thing . he start to go to some hostip and see what 's go on in a real place not just in school . he think thi would be use when he actual work in a hospit . after he graduat , he start to learn how to be a doctor and it wa much more difficult than studi in school . he tri mani nre thing such as help the patien . they onli did some practic in the school but not for real patien so it is veri hard for him at the first time . but after mani year , he can control everyth in hi hospit now . my father is a good exampl becaus he keep continu to learn new thing after he graduat and also take risk . if he onli did what he alreadi know in the school , he can not be a success doctor in the hospit now . therefor i agre with thi statement .
