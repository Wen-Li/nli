i disagre with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject , becaus for scientif work and for work in enterpris it is necessari to know much about specif topic . have a broad knowledg in differ subject is of cours not bad and some basic about differ topic should be known by everyon but it is not an ideal way of spend one time to studi mani differ subject . when you know much about a singl subject it can be astonish becaus you will notic mani thing which you would not notic while onli spend a littl bit of time with the subject . special on a singl subject mean to get deep insight into the subject and not onli learn some basic . thi open new possibl for exampl in scientif work . to work scientif on a topic more than some basic knowledg is necessari . deep insight into the subject and know the state of the art in scienc is need to receiv new scientif result . otherwis there would be a risk of receiv result which are alreadi publish , but thi wo n't happen becaus peopl who do not know more than the basic in a subject do not get research posit . but special knowledg is necessari not onli in scientif research but also in industri field . technolog increas in the past decad to a larg amount and special knowledg is need to develop new product or technolog . the knowleg in technolog concern is so huge that it is imposs for singl peopl to know everyth and regard to thi have a broad knowledg in differ field mean a lack of special knowledg about singl topic . thi mean that is is imposs to work in develop product and technolog with a broad knowledg . a broad knowledg may have been favor in the past but today it is necessari to have special knowledg in one specif subject . scientif research and develop of new product and technolog in enterpris are good exampl for thi .
