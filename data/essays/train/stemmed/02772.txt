`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . '' accord to thi sentenc i come up with mani idea , and i would like to say that i agre with thi statement . i have travel in mani countri , such as japan , america , canada , australia and korea . most of the time i visit other countri by a tour guid . the best thing about a tour guid is that they have been there befor , so they are veri familiar with there . they know all the best part of those countri , so they will show us in a order time . in addit , a tour guid will book everyth for you , for exampl , hotel , restaur , park , buse . .. they know all the time ! for exampl , when ha a big event or show , when the park are open , when the restaur close , and where the place the visitor have to go dure what time . they also know which hotel is cheaper , but still nice enough to let us sleep comfort , so we wo n't have to worri about where we are go to sleep tonight . furthermor , they will tell you how to get to the place you want to go , and tell you what you should buy down there becaus it 's cheap and can help you to keep memori . they also will tell you what kind of restar are around here , and which one is famou , so you do n't need to wast a lot of time on think what you should have for dinner . howev , becaus you are in a group , so if someon is late , you have to wait until all the peopl in your group togeth ; on the other hand , you wo n't spend too much time in one place becaus you do n't have much time and they still have mani place they are go to show you . in conclus , i think travel in a group led by a tour guid is a great thing if you do n't want to book everyth by yourself . it is also a good thing if you do n't know how to drive or never been to there befor becaus someon familiar with there will show you around so you do n't need to worri about it . therefor , i like to travel with a tour guid veri much .
