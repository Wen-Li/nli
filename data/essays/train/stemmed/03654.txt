thi question is not easi to answer . on the one hand , i think understand idea and concept is veri import . on the other hand , i think learn fact is also veri necessari . understand idea and concept , mainli determin or belong to evolv a good sound knowledg . a good understand of such idea and concept is alway a basic compon of a sound knowledg . idea and concept may be taught in a veri casual way , so that student can rememb such idea and concept easier . perhap they 're use quizz or game , for exampl . learn should not consist of just learn fact by heart . of cours , pupil and student have to learn some import fact , for instanc , geograph or histor fact . it is prove that pupil who have to learn onli fact may have good or even excel result in exam , but they also tend to forget thing faster . if pupil understand idea and concept , of what they have been taught , they can reproduc it more quickli . they see basic relat between differ idea , concept and aspect . they probabl wo n't forget thing as fast as pupil do who onli learn fact . reproduct is a veri import part of the learn process . as long as you can reproduc idea and concept , you know or you are abl to understand what you have been taught so far . by way of conclus , i think student should have both , an understand of idea and concept and learn fact . the mixtur is import . emphasi should be on the understand . a basi must be design and thi basi must be complet with singl fact , which student have to learn . but , the fact can not be miss out . it would be unthink to know the idea of , for exampl , the french revolut , but not know when thi event took place . the same with geographi , it is good to know the custom and habit of , for instanc , japan , but you also have to know were it is situat . so , as mention befor there should be an approbri balanc between both , understand and learn .
