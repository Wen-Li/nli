thi is a problem , which can not be answer just with `` ye '' or `` no '' or in a few word . there sure are exampl for both : young peopl who help their commun and who do not . young peopl who do not give enough time to help their commun may not be integr strong enough in thi commun . mayb their parent have littl time due to their job or becaus they do not want to spend much time with their kid . so the kid onli do the thing they want , meet friend , have fun , but do not think about respons . often kid whose parent do not spend enough time for them feel more respons for their friend than for their parent and the commun they come from . a big problem that can occur relat to thi are gang . the kid believ that sole their friend are import and they do n't have ani respons against other part of the societi . but thi way they build up a new commun and spend much time to help thi commun . but other kid are more integr in the commun of the adult . they do much for their villag or region . for exampl they are in a sport club or train in the firefight 's youth-sect . i think the major problem is the behaviour of the adult , especi the parent , and how the kid are treat in their commun . if young peopl know that the adult need them and the adult show that they are proud of what the kid do for the commun , the young peopl will spend more time to help their commun . but if the adult do not spend enough time with the kid and mayb their commun too , the kid will act the same way .
