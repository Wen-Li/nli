there are mani characterist of success peopl such as intellig , knowledg , patienc , open and courag . in my opinion the most import one is be open to new thing and take risk . for thi reason , i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . there are sever reason for my choic and they are the follow . first of all , these peopl are success becaus they alway updat their knowledg in their area and also improv themselv contin . in addit , they do not alway stay in safe part they have reach in time but rather they look for other way of improv themselv and ask for more inform and more success by take risk . for exampl , the founder of our republ , ataturk wa a veri success soldier in ottoman empir but in time he took risk and left hi posit in ottoman militari in order to make leadership to turkish citizen in the independ war . as a result , he had lot of enemi , howev , he serv for turkish public , play an import role in independ war and final establish the modern turkish republ . secondli , even if you are found success at a point , it should be bore to maintain your knowledg at the same level for year , not tri new thing and not take risk . the peopl who are found success , in fact do not care about be success and they do not hesit to take risk that may result in a failur . by thi way , their experi and knowledg develop overtim and they take failur as an import part of their futur success . for exampl , mani of the invent made in the past were invalu result of the new point of view of these success peopl like einstein and the return of the risk taken chang our live all around the world . in conclus , i believ that be alway curiou about new thing , take risk , tri new thing make a person success and they are also crucial for me in my life .
