be succes person is the dream of nearli everyon . sinc we have start go to school , our famili and our teacher advis us to be success peopl and they show us mani differ tecniqu for be success . i believ that be succes can not be done with the tecniqu that peopl show us . i agre wit the idea that `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' . just as stare abov , for me be succes mean be innov person . i believ repeat someth that ha alreadi done doe not make peopl success . but of cours for be a success person should know what peopl have done befor . for exampl a sociologist alreadi know what other theorist have said . so it is so easi for a sociologist to repeat what other teorist have said in hi articl . but i think thi is not a success . success peopl should bring new idea and even sometim should take risk and challeng the exist idea . without challeng exist idea or bring new perspect a sociologist can not be a success person . when we look at the histori we see mani name who originatd new idea . but nobodi know the other name , onli their name are known . it is obviou that , tri new idea alway take some risk but do you think , we would be familiar with the einstein if he did not take that risk ? of cours no , einstein wa perceiv as a crazi man when he origin hi famou theori but the time show that he wa right and time prove that he wa a geniou . of cours he face with mani difficulti becaus of tri new idea and if he onli appli the thing that he alreadi knew , nobodi would rememb hi name today . it is obviou that make the thing that you know veri well is the easiest way . you can be happi by do that , you can also be rich and famou for a short time howev , thi doe not make you success . the key of be success is produc new idea .
