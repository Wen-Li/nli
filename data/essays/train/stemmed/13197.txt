most of the peopl believ that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better . they think that whether they know everyh about a subject or not is n't import . in contrast to these , i believ that special in one specif subject is better than have knowledg of mani academ subject . i alway give import to complet a job that i work on . it is n't enough for me to do onli some part of it . i think , for get a success it is veri import to complet the job . eveybodi want to have broad knowledg but there is an import point , do you special on it or do you know onli a part of it . in daili life , there is lot of peopl who are tri to talk about a subject whether they have a knowledg about it or not . i do n't agre with it . if i do n't have a knowledg about a subject , i wo n't talk on it , i will onli listen peopl to get their idea and learn someth about thi subject . if i want to special in thi subject , i begin to research about it . and for day i studi on it for have the true knowledg . on the other hand , i alway tri to add knowledg to my knowledg day by day dy . becaus i know that for get a success , a person should be adapt to chang . i do n't forget a discuss about thi situat with my best friend . we are talk about tenni . i have been play tenni sinc 1991 . i know everi detail about tenni . howev , my friend never play tenni . she ask me a question about a racket and i g'ce inform about her question but she said she know better than me . and she began to give wrong inform to my frien . and after thi experinc , i decid not to talk on a subject that i do n't know or onli know a part of it . in conlus , i alway think that foir get success it is not better to have broad knowled than special
