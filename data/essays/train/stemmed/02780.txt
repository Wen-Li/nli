i believ that travel in a group lead by a tour guid can be veri funni , but say is the best way to travel may not be sure in my point of view . there are other way to travel which can bring more fun and more joy . first of all , i think that travel with a tour guid can be veri good to learn some thing about the place where you are go becaus the tour guid usual know mani thing about the place you visit with them . but , i also think that travel with them remov you the possibl of discov thing on yourself and for me that is quit better . secondli , you can also travel alon . thi is most for peopl who like adventur , it is a good way of travel also becaus you are go to meet some new peopl . you will sure more learn of the cultur and habit of the place where you are go but for me it can be veri sad to travel alon . and final you can also travel with a group of friend or member of your famili which is not led by a tour guid . it can be weird becaus you are go somewher with peopl you might see all the time but i realli think you can have more fun and enjoy more your journey , becaus the peopl you are move with are peopl you know and peopl who know you . to conclud , i like the idea of travel alon or in a group led by a tour guid but i realli think that me i prefer travel with peopl who share some thing with me befor than travel with peopl i do n't know .
