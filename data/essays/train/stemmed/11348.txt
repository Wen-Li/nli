i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . it is the stage i think , is more comfort to enjoy our live . i feel so becaus it is practic notic that young one 's have lot of zeal in them which make them more activ . the young peopl work hard for heir futur and at time never let their enjoy go down . for exampl consid a student who plan to pass in distinct in the annual examin . for achiv thi the student work hard the whole year , apart from thi the student doe n't miss ani other activ that involv enjoy . young stage is the onli stage where we can do anyth as we can , no matter wheather it is right or wrong . it is the period where thing which cant be done when we becom older can be done without ani hesit . they do what ever they want to do so that they can enjoy up to the maximum . for exampl they can danc , swim , play with the friend , roam here and there , can eat all the stuff which they want to , go for race , can go for a challeng , involv themselv in entertain program etc . on the other part they can enjoy do what ever their interest is in . like in research field , softwar , where they can makeup their mind set accordingli . last but not the least i deal with the fact that everyon know that the young stage is the most prefer stage where everyon find it interest when compar to other stage in our life . lastli i conclud say that the young peopl enjoy life more than older do .
