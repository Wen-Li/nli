i strongli disagre with thi statement which say that , `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . '' there are some some reason so that i disagre with it . the main reason is , it is law that , you have to tell everyth whether it is pron or con of the product to custom . as i talk about the law , it is the respons of the employ to give the right inform to the custom . if they break the law and not give the right inform about the product , and hide someth ( defect ) to custom , custom can sue on it . if it proof in the court , they lose their licenc perman . anoth reason is that they lose the peopl 's trust and it will be more import for them . so they never cheat the peopl whether it is advertis or somth els . by advertis wrong inform , they make a big mistak and may be they lose thier buis too . take a good exampl of ani electron compani , which produc differ type of electron equip . suppos compani advertis the comput system . if they do n't mention the limit with it advantag , and someon buy that comput without know it limit then compani ha to take back , if custom not satisfi with it . sometim some compani do these kind of mistak but it is out of law . so everi compani advertis their product without give ani fals inform , and thi way custom make trust on the compani , and they sell more and more product , and make big profit .
