i agre with the say that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . as in mani case i have seen product are gener low qualiti product , particulari in the case of eatabl and face cream or hair gell . the compani simpli make fool of peopl by show there product as the ultim product you are look for . it make fals promis to peopl about it qualiti and it effect . i rememb one instanc what happen in india few year ago , a lot of pesticid were found in coca cola and pepsi drink . these drink were found unsuit and unfit for drink purpos but still they were sold in indian market without control those pesticid in them . i think they weresel just becaus of there huge brand name which i think is realli uneth on part of bussi . i rememb one more instanc , i brought one fair cream , it advertis show a person get fairer and fairer day by day by use that product so i thaught of buy that and final when i brought it and use it it caus some rash on my skin so final i had to consult doctor who reccomend not to use that cream anymor . so thi is how thing work . in my opinion compani should not make ani fals promis or those promis which will not come true to there custom . in that way they are decreas there long run profit and peopl faith on them . howev advertis is the best way tointoduc and launch new product in the market and make peopl awar of differ substitut avail for the product in the market . thu creat healthi competit in the market for the companiesand allow new entri in market .
