my grandfath wa 90 year old when he pass away . while hi life had end , mine still continu . howev , i could in no way say that he did not enjoy life . he wa one of the most charismat peopl i ever knew and if someon had had ani experi about life , it wa him . one ha to admit that younger peopl are abl to move much faster , and learn much faster , but the truth of the matter is that older peopl have alreadi learn their lesson , and thu are more abl to enjoy life . nowaday , youth ha the possibl of use technolog , which ha made life so much more fun , and provid variou way of entertain such as movi or the internet . also , the fact that we are young in the 21st centuri allow us to experi much more than our elder experi dure their youth . as i wa tell my friend mike the other day , there is no way enjoy life without youth . precis the fact that we have not learn our lesson yet , open up the possibl of discov new world and have new experi , which our elder simpli do n't have at the moment . while youth doe have the ad bonu of more time left , older peopl have the ad bonu of their experi . with time , a person can learn to do new thing , find new thing , which will simpli benefit hi or her life . for exampl , the fact that my dad ha travel to pari and know all the good place there allow him to visit them again and again , someth a young person with no travel experi will not be abl to do . also , an older person is more like not to depend on someon econom or legal , which allow them to be freer , than their counterpart : the young peopl . in conclus , i would say that while older peopl are mayb not as capabl of move as fast as younger peopl , age doe not prevent anyon from enjoy life to the maximum point . i will alway rememb my grandfath , anxiou to show hi experi and color life to hi niec and nephew while continu to live hi live to the fullest .
