it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academicsubject than to special in one specif subject , have a complet knowledg about one subject will not promot to appli the concept of other subject , so in order to bulid up perfect in our studi it better to have a thorogh in depth knowledg of all the academ subject , . i strongli agre with the statement , to bolster my opinion i shall present few exampl . turnin to the statement threshould claim , one inform exampl is docter , have a complet knowledg of the all academ subject such as anatomi and mani more , will improv the jr.docter to perform the oper to the human bodi , becaus all the peopl go to docter will have complet credibl on them that the docter cure their ill , there is no exager that if adoct perform a eye oper he such be well perfect in all the organ funtion such as brain , nerver etc. so docter should be well practic with hi academ subject . anoth inform exampl is in engin section where , the student learn in the first two year the concept of the few subject will be help full them in their final semist , such as mater and energi balanc will help full to them to appli in their transport phenomena subject , such that all the basic principl from one subject will be relat to other subject . soo it will like thi , aperson goe to a tv shop to buy a tv , the shopkeep tell about the type of tv 's present in hi shop , tel that one tv is have sound qualiti of 50 % and screen qualiti of 80 % and onther tv is of sound qualiti 80 % and screen qualiti of 100 % we choos the second one for better qualiti thu everi student be perfect in all academ subject in sum , from my perspect it better to have a in depth knowledg of all the subject rather than have specialis in one specif subject ,
