i do total agre with the statement . for me , there is noth more import than understand idea and concept . it 's a shame that most school-system concentr more on learn by hard then understand idea . the school miss all import achiev of the last 50 year . they focu on learn fact , not on understand fact . in my eye , it 's possibl to pass school onli by learn fact without understand them . even in universt , in sever subject , for exampl in some economic-subject , it 's possibl to get along with learn fact . but for univers you shoud fullfil other requir . if you tri to pass live onli by learn fact , you have the wrong point of view . you can not repeat fact all the time , onc in your live you have to come to the point where you understand the link between sever topic and where you are abl to produc your own idea . on the other hand you can not achiev anyth onli by understand idea and concept . onc understood , you have to learn sever thing by hard . the best exampl is to learn a languag . you can understand all the grammar - but without vocabulari you wo n't be abl to have a convers in thi languag . i know a lot of smart student who are abl to understand idea veri fast . but when they understood the idea , the do not think about them anymor , they do n't learn them by hard , and , as fast as they understood the idea , they forget them . it 's a wast of talent , they do not recogn that you have to work hard for good result . they are not use to . and , no matter of my opinion , i did also realiz how import it is to learn fact , and how difficult it is . but learn fact must never be the more import point of studi . for onli learn fact , we do n't need human bee , comput are better in store inform without think of it . as long as we think of the fact we learn , we learn the right way , the way you need to learn to be a good student .
