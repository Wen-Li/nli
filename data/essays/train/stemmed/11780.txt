i have experienc both travel in a group led by a tour guid and travel by myself . some poepl think that travel in group with tour guid is better than travel without a tour guid . while , other have opposit idea . i agre with the follow statement that the best way to travel is in a gruop led by a tour guid . becaus thi is the most safe way and enjoy way for travel . the first reason that i agre thi statement is becaus we all want to have a safe travel . it is dengul that you do not realli underst the cultur or lendgrag where you travel . i read a news that some chiness travel to malysia without lede by a tour guid , they have been sent to jail becaus they play ganbo in the hotel room . some thing are not be a problem in our own controy doe not mean that is no problem in other either . therefor , i think that have a tour guid is the most safe way for travel . anoth reason that i think that travel in a group is better idea is becaus we do not have to worri about : ha the hotel book confirm ? or where i can take bu for the place that i want to go ? all you have to do is just follow the tour guid . becaus of they ecperi , i believ that they know better than i do about the citi that i visit . like where have good shippingmal or restaru . i like to follow the tour guid and listen to them explain the histori of the citi or other interest stori . thi is also a advertag that you do not have by travel along . although there are some advertag of travel by along such as not time limit or no shchedul need to follow . howev , the advertag of travel in a group are more obviou than travel along . in conculs , travel by follow some one who ha experi is the best way for travel . expeci the place that you have never been . so than we can ttotal enjoy our vacat .
