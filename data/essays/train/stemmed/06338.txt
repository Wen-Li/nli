unfortun i agre with the statement becaus young peopl are not effect so much help with their commun . actual the most of young peopl think that if you do someth in order to help your commun , such as go for a walk with elder peopl , you are not consid normal . the concept of normal is not use in thi case . in fact while it should be consid normal if you give an hand to person who need it , you are defin as normal onli if you show that your not interest in action like these which are more signific than do onli the thing that you want to do for yourself . the problem is that most of young peopl have an individualist way to live their life . they do not think that it is possibl to share time between fun and help action . person i have not met mani help peopl so far but one of thi is my girlfriend . she decid to work as a volunt in order to help peopl that can not do everi day action becaus of their age or their disabl . she goe each day to the same person . for thi reason she ha also built up good relationship with them and she assur me that it is an experi that she never felt in her life and it is not bore as most of the peopl think . they can transmit to you their volunti to live as they did when they were young . in the past i also thought to wirk as a volunt dure a few hour per week , but now i am attend the second year at bocconi univers and i face some difficulti to share my time between the school and thi possibl . for thi reason i hope i will be more help for my commun in the futur than i am now .
