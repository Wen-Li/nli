accord to my opinion , specil in one specif subject is better than the broad knowledg of mani academ subject . student need knowledg in one specil subject will give good and posit reault to him . he would get confid on that particular subject . specil subject give chanc to get more knowledg , grip and command on that particular subject . they mey get more chanc to focu on particular thing , it will help to reserch on that special subject . it lead to invent new product , it may help to moderen societi . also it may give good name and also chanc to improv econom posit . for exampl , i finish my special in pharmaceut divis . after that i did reaserch work on one particular molecul . that molecul given posit result against hiv diseas . i got a huge amount of prize money from my countri . and also they award in mani way . with thi prize money i start a one larg pharmaceut compani . in other way mani peopl are serviv with my medicin . thi result given good name in my career . anoth exampl is , one of my fri also specil in the comput programm . he invent a new programm , for that he award by the govern . due to that programm peopl are enjoy computar game and internet fecil . due to internt the world becom a small villag . final , my opinion is special in mani acdem subject will not foucu in one particular thing , he may not get satisfact with all subject . didnt get special recognis in societi . so special in one specif subject is better . mani scientiest are invent by special in one specif subject .
