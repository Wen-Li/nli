i think that thi is a gener of the young word , and so i think that it is not a true statement . might be true the fact that a part of young peopl doe not help the other person who need their help , or doe not put their abil or compet for a ` better word` , or simpli a ' better local community` , but is also true that there are so mani guy that everi day make their ` good action` , or work hard for a right ideal to find a sens in their life . for exampl there are so mani boy and girl that dedic their free time to help poor peopl , or to visit sick peopl , or simpli help an old woman to cross the street . is not that also an act of civil sens ? on the other hand i think that pherap nowaday it is difficult to help the commun , becaus the commun make see and think you what she want . to explain , if a young boy doe not respect some civic rule , or he doe not care the other , it is just becaus the commun doe not teach him to give import to thi import aspect , becaus the commun make see a winner model that is not a good model of person . but the young person have more than sometim the necessari strenght to go on , indipend by wrong scheme , to track hi ideal of life , that are realli good ideal of life . i think that it is the point : a young person is more encoureg to chang the societi by hi inexperiec , but at the end is societi that chang him , and corrupt him make of him an adult person . in fact thi is the main passag from the young age so my opinion is simpli that the societi might chang to help young to chang her .
