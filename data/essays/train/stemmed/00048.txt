i disagre with the statement which say the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid ; instead , i would like to travel alon or with my friend and famili without the tour guid . it 's true that sometim it 's more econom to travel in a group led by a tour guid . for exampl , for those peopl who are busi with their work and hardli can they spare their time to take a trip , find a travel agenc and with a tour guid is a great idea . becaus they do n't have ani time to plan their own trip . but they may not have so much fun as those peopl who travel alon . travel without a tour guid may be a challeng for me . becaus i am not a person who are afraid of challeng . as a teenag , i am fond of challeng myself and like to take advertru as well . as far as i am concern , travel without a tour guild can provid me with more pleasur . by travel alon , i can also learn how to take the respons and be independ of my parent . i had thi experi when i wa in elementari school , i along with my sister took a trip to hawaii without my parent 's compani . at first , i wa so scare to go to a total strang place . but after a few day , i found myself enjoy in it . i thought languag would be my biggest problem . to my astonish , i can chat with a foreign . moreov . i made progress by leap and bound . i also learn the histori their by read the book . i never knew travel alon allow me to learn so mani thing . i also had the experi travel in a group led by a tour guid . but i found it wa not an activ way to travel . in other word , they maneg everyth for you . besid , i almost had no free time . although i realli like those peopl who travel with me , by the time we arriv at the airport , everyon had had their own live to go on . in conclus , i disagre with the statement not onli becaus i find it 's much more fun without a tour guid but becaus i learn much more than a tour guid can teach me .
