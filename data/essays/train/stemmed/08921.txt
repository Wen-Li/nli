advertiss is on of the most import way for the compani to improv their benifet , and to sell more and more product . regardeless if it 's tv advertis or radio , or internet , it must be intrest and remark for the audienc in order to do hi job . unfortun some compani goe too far and make their product appear much better than they realli are , which make the consum upset after he buy the product . i still remeb mani toy and devic i bought when i wa young , actual i forc my parent to buy , becaus it wa realli amaz on the screen , but i wa realli shock , bacaus it wa diffrent from what i 've seen in the advertis . whi do they do that ? i think becaus of the strong competit with the other compani , they have no choic . they must make their product look perfect as much as they can , otherwis , no one will buy it , special with the kid stuff . the child doe n't have the abil to analys the advertis and figur out if it 's real or not , unlik the matur . i think the caompani found their selv in thi situat , and they hardli can chang it , becaus of simpl reason . the custom doe n't help them to chang it ! imagin your self watch a reasnobl advertis , show the advantag and the disadvantag of the product , will you be intrest in it ? or will you think thi way : if they could n't hide the disadvantag in the advertis they made by themselv , how can i trust their product ? advertis now is a veri big busi . huge compani work in thi field , it 's not easi to chang thi industri in order to have simpl , honest , reasnobl advertis , unless we work realli hard .
