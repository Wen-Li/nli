twenti year from now the popul of car would be much lesser than today . due to mani reason like most of the fuel use as today would extinguish , and if resourc avail they might be use for other purpos etc . well , when we compar the past and futur we can expect both to be similar . in past , there were fewer car and even in futur we could find few car , due to mani reason . in past when car wa discoverd the make use to take much time and in futur when make is easi and faster the presenc of fuel is less . as in present day we find differ kind of car , each have it own uniqu but all of them run with petrol or ga . but twenti year from now these resourc might be in scarc , or els use till the last drop . as in present we find the popul of car com in competet with human be we might expect that it in futur it would cross us . but onc the the resourc are gone all these car go in to scrap use for noth instead increas the pollut and caus problem to mankind . futur is full of unexpect thing ani thing might happen , for exampl instead of fuel car there might be electr car , [ no pollut car ] . these might complletli replac them or els peopl might use cycl as in past for transport and becom more eviron consiou . scientist are tri to develop a new kind of fuel which is made from plant known as bio-deisel , which also can be use in futur as fuel . but car they will make there way some how or the other . and so call car in present day might be call with a differ name . so i say that twenti year from now we will find car run with electr or other mean of fuel , but in minim popul camparit to now .
