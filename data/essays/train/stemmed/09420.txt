i dont believ that in twenti year from now there will be less car than there are today . as we can see around us that it seem there is a delug of car and other mode of vehicl . it seem that everybodi want to own a car as it ha becom a matter of statu symbol and a nessec . as the world economi is get stronger with each pass day and develp countri turn into develop one , the financi capabl of lay person ha improv a lot . so they can spend on thing of luxuri such as car . anoth reason to believ that number of car will onli increas from here on and not declin is that today it is not difficult to obtain loan to buy a car , all the lead bank are will to shell money out of there coffer to entic custom to get a car . although some peopl are driven by the thought that rise fuel price and deplet fuel stock will ultim appli brake on number of car as peopl will not be abl to buy fuel and in about next twenti year petroleum reserv will be exaust . but i do n't think thi will happen as scientist are work on prepr biofuel which will cost less and will last for greater time and i have a good exampl of thi studi as some of my friend prepar biofuel from jatropha plant and with the help of thi fuel they ran an engin . with each pass day the price of car are slash and new comfort are ad so peopl think that they should go for it and own a car . as in most of the countri the public transport system is veri tire and there is such a great rush of peopl that now peopl have start to use there own vehicl for commut and thi urg will lead to more car . henc i disagre that number of car will decreas from now onward . but accord to me it should increas .
