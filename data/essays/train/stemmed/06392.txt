in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today . that wa in my openian . i have some reasen for that . the first reason , befor more than twenti year ago there are car and dont find other to transfer our from one place to other in the same citi . so the car becom mare and more from the bast . in fact , there are other equpmet to transfer our from one plase to other in other citi , for exampl there are train , plane and subway , that wa faster from car but still the car are the importnat . in other hand to supos my openion the gover make more fasil for the rode and more safeti , for exampel , i prefer the travel by car becaus it is com fortabl for me , i can find the restur in the rode and rest area . so i stop to take relax in the time that i feel tire , but when i travel on the plane or tain i can not stop to take relax . there are othor reason , when i travel by car i see the difer viw and i learn my children about it , and we can viset more citi on the rode befor i reach the place that i want . in sumari the car are the most spesilati for the famili , we can not fewer car until find the other have all advantag .
