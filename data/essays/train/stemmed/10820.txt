i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' . firstli , we have a larg number of chariti where we there are consider number of youth who are help the need . we can also see the case where youngster are readi to give a part of their hard earn money to help the diseas , needi , etc. , thi all help is in order to improv the poor and get their need for their surviv . secondli , effect rule of the govern is need for the better make of the commun . the govern is vote to power by the peopl . the larg percentag of voter is the youth as given by stastic report given the differ countri . if thi stastic report are true then how can we deni that young peopl are not help for their commun . thirdli , now-a-day also we find that all the youngster have a common meet place dure the festiv . for exampl , chrisma the younster will given holiday start a month befor . on the day of the chrisma all will have prayer , parti etc. , thu , let their childern know about the tradit . fourthli , we observ that the young peopl are take up the respons of help the age and old . for exampl , onc i have seen a old person fall on the road becaus of some health problem . a lot number of young peopl who were storng enough took him to ho thu , by abov all the point it is clear that inspit of have strenuou work in their day to day life , the youngster are do a lot of thing in order to improv and help their societi .
