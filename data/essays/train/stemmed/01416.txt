i think the best way to travel for the first time to an unknown place is to be in a group lead by a tour guid becaus of their experi , their knowledg about all import turist site and how easilli he can move between the citi , place and small villag you are plan to visit and the facil to carri your suitcas all day in the truck with think that it may get lost . it is not the best way for all case but ye for the first time on a differ and far away place . when i first travel to europ , i did it with a friend and we went on a group that last more than a month . it wa great becaus we met a lot of friend on the trip , from ani age and nation . we felt secur becaus we were in good hand just be with honest and reliabl peopl who wake up everi morn , take care of our person stuff and reserv all exposit , destini and place with previou anticipact without thinkig if we will get ticket or not . the leader ha a lot of experi in these trip so he will be more inform of the most relev thing of each place . also , if we were on a tour if there is alot of peopl in the trip it will be more easili to obtain discount for exposit , also you dont need to worri if someon stole your money or if you pay for someth that you may never receiv or see . when you are travel on a bu trip all your luggag will be hand directli by the person staff and deliv directli to the bedroom you will be in . if you do that by yourself you may need to carri all your heavi person stuff and there will be no one who will lend you a hand carri them all day long . in conclus i think it is better to go on a tour special if it is the first time you have been there and the countri or place is quit differ as your . howev if i return to europ some day to visti the exact same place i did dure that month i will be travel backpack just visit the most interest place for me and just carri the necessari thing just to make my trip a pleasant one .
