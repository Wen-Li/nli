it is a well-known fact that most peopl 's purpos in life is to succeed , whether it be at the famili , academ or work level . now the question is whether or not we realli need to exceed our current abil to be consid a success person . in thi regard , i think that it would be particularli interest and relev to deal with the busi world . on the one hand , i tend to think that an employe deserv the right to be consid as a success person to the extent that they previous had to prove educ and motiv enough to meet the employ 's requir for a specif posit within a compani . as a matter of fact , given the level of select regard a posit of teacher in macroeconom , i argu that the statu of success person is not to be neglect . howev , i want to highlight the fact that the applic is all the more grant recognit in the way that their knowledg is not suffici in these situat ; inde , not onli is the applic 's academ background import in the hire process , but the abil to teach to a given categori of student is also to be consid . on the other hand , i also think that we could consid the concept of be succes from a differ point of view . inde , i also agre with the argument accord to which success peopl tri new thing and take risk . for instanc , the latter qualiti could enabl peopl to evolv in a compani ; whi would we have to restrain ourselv while we could take advantag of extern opportun to improv in particular field . as far as i am concern , the onli risk would be to fail . and it is a well-known fact that everyon learn from their past experi and mistak . as a conclus , it is worth-ment that the definit of a success person is subject in so far as thi concept impli to first defin our current abil and then our object in life . success can be consid accord to differ level .
