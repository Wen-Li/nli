peopl , especi student , often discuss whether have some specif knowledg about one sucject is better than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . howev , i strongli believ that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more use . thi ration behind thi that it allow peopl to have more chanc to get a job . furthermor , student can learn well-balanc educ . in korea , most big compani want to recruit someon who ha broad knowledg . that is becaus these kind of peopl are more help to them to make a larg amount of money . as everyon know , as a matter of fact , have broad knowledg of mani subject ha a disadvatag which lead to shallow knowledg . howev , thi advantag can eclips thi disadvantag . from my own experi , when i wa a univers student , i took a lot of academ cours such as biolog , comput and spanish . so , i got some advantag when i got into my compani , sam-sung . on top of that , student can get well-balanc educ . basic , the purpos of school is educ their student about mani subject . that is becaus have specif knowledg about some cours is like picki . i mean when children eat their meal , they usual pick up what they want such as meat . so , it lead to health problem , obes , which caus variou health problem . i bet that have specif knowledg is definetli harm for their person or their futur . take all of these into account , i have no doubt in my mind that have a lot of knowledg of mani academ subject is help for peopl in our futur to reach our goal .
