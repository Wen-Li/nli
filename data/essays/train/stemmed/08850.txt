is it gener accept that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ? in my opinion , i total agre about the statement . i believ that young peopl realli do n't give enough time to help their commun . i will argu the statement for some follw reason . first of all , parent nowaday expect their children can get high educ , so children 's activ alway studi not commun . becaus the societi becom more and more wealthi , parent have much time to take care of their child for their perform in class . for exampl , in order to achiev their expect of educ , parent usual take their child to cram school , that realli occupi much time for young peopl . secondli , becaus of the develop game produc , young peopl nowaday usual stay home for play game not go out to commun with other . for instanc , it is fashion to play ps2 nowaday , young peopl in order to get high grade in the game , they have no interest to go out or make more friend , and they even do n't have ani time to commuci with other peopl . to sum up , becaus of the high educ expect and the fascin game , young peopl nowaday focu on book or game instead of commun . therefor , it is my prefer that young peopl do n't give enough time to help thire comun nowaday . and i think that is not a good phenonmenon for the futur , so we should find some resolut to improv thi .
