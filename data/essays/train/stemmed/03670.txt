some peopl claim that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . howev , i hold a oppos view due to the follow reson : first , gain in-deth knowledg on mani academ subject would be extrem time consum . studi mani differ kind of subject requir the student to spend a lot of time and effort in it . in thi way , the student can onli learn some superfici knowledg about each subject but can not realli have a veri in-depth understand of the subject . on the other hand , studi one specif subject can allow you to special in it and acquir thorough and in-depth knowledg about the subject . in addit , mani career are specialist and thu requir the specif knowledg of that particular subject . for exampl , be a lawyer you need to have specif knowledg about the law term , the judiciari system and the judiciari situat of the place you want to work in . you can not enter those specif career unless you special and acquir in-depth knowlegd about that academ subject . last but not least , have special in one specif subject can offer you chanc to investig the field which is not touch by peopl befor . you can hardli discov new thing or find in your studi unless you have in-death and specif knowledg in that particular subject . for exampl , if you want to pose a revolut in astronomi studi , you need to special yourself in it , spend lot of time and effort in it or els it would be imposs for you to make ani revolutionari find . one can see that the previou scientist who trigger off scientif revolut are those who spent their life time in the studi of scienc . to conclud , i believ that special in one specif subject is better than have broad knowledg on mani differ subject but with superfici knowledg onli .
