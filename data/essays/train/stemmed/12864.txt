whi do we see soo mani advertis on tv or in magazin ? mani peopl buy or even recomand thing becaus they saw it on a commerci or in a newspap . the system work like `` brain wash '' . what you see or anybodi tell you is good and if you are go to hear it over and over again you are go to believ it some day . i absolut agre with the statement that `` mani product seem much better than they realli are '' . if you look at the packag of an orang juic with a sepcif brand name like `` happi day '' you will see a nice green cover with an orang on there . when you are thursti and you go into a supermarcet , i guess that i will pick exactli thi product becaus the cover of it look awesom . later you are go to open the dring and you will be disappoint . you will find out that it is onli sweet and what the produc promis with a commerci slogan like `` 100 % orang juic '' , can not be a true thing . anoth exampl to underlin what i mean would be the commerci of a product which mani peopl alreadi ate at least one time in their life . `` pringl - chip '' . they have all the same form and they tast good ( in my point of view ) , but a slogan say that they will never becom hard becaus you can close it again with `` una tappa di plastica '' . if you are go to open a product it doe not matter if it is a yoghurt or a packag of chip they will be not fresh after a time . what will happen if you are go to pay in the supermarcet a lot for a simpl shaver becaus everybodi bought it and it should be so smooth and soft and there wo n't be ani possibl that you are go to cut yourself with it . a famous brand name would be `` venu '' . after three time the venu shaver is also not go to cut as good as it did at the first day . in my point of view peopl should not invest so much money in advertisemt . peopl and mani children around the world need financi aid and we should support them and should not support product which we are go to buy anyway .
