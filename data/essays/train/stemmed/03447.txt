from my point of view , a successful person is someon who succeed in hi life , someon who hit hi goal , hi object . for my concern , i vote for the safeti , that is to say that to if you alway do what you alreadi know how to do well , you will get more and more experi in the sector you 're work on . you 'll special yourself , becom an expert , and so as a matter of fact , will be successful . let 's take an exempl , someon who ha just start to work , he 's just start hi profession life , gener he is go to do what he alreadi know , so , if he keep work in hi domain , he 'll becom an expert . but on the contrari , if he start tri new job , special in someth he doe n't know anyth about , he 's take too much risk , and he may not succeed as well as if he would have stay in hi domain and special himself . thi previou exempl impli someon who 's just start to work , but let 's talk about someon who had alreadi a wealthi life and a good job . he decid to vari hi occup by tri new thing , thing which he is completli unfamiliar with . suppos that he manag to succeed in all of hi new occup , we ca n't deni the fact that among all of hi activ , if one day there is ani problem that pop and that he ca n't find ani solut . from one littl problem he could lose lot of money by tri to save hi affair , or even sell it . so , through those two exempl , i disagre complet with thi statement . the onli situat where i could agre , is that the person concern , can afford itself take those risk by tri new activ . i mean if he ha a realli good busi and a safeti bank account that ca n't be go down . but the safeti is my prioriti for a success person .
