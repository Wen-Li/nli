i defintli agre that the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . and we have to admit that part of the problem is that we believ in it , the peopl in the market market is pretti smart they make us feel we need someth when we actual do n't , just becaus we saw our favorit pair of jean on a famou person we need them , they made us feel that necess just becaus we like that actor ( actress ) , he/sh look good in them but that doens't mean that you 'll look the same with them on . it 's pretti amaz they just get the perfect enviro in a commerci , everyth is so well plan that even if it did n't seem good enough for you , they are go to make it seem in other commerci , poster , etc . the perfect way of present a product better than it realli is in thi new age of the market , where you can buy stuff you see on tv or just onlin . usual what we see on tv , is not worth the price , or what it doe but it seem to us as such a good idea , and then again , they make you feel you need it , and when you have it the materi they are made of are not good , or it brake , and all the magic and the wonder idea goe in the garbag can . you can get cheat the mayor of the time and that 's abuss from the peopl that sell the product and know what they are show is not even half of what you are get . it all will depend in what are you buy , who are you buy it to , and what are the condit of the purchas . usual the stuff that are reliabl have good condit of purchas , they have flexibl return polici , i think everi time we have to be care and counciou with the stuff we 're buy , becaus nobodi is go to return the money back into our wallet .
