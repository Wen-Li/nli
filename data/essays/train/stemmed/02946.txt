when i went to univers i had to decid if attend a gener major or a specilist one and i have chossen the second one . i think it 's an import decis for life of peolpl . in fact if you decid to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject you can have a big knowledg about a lot of thing . you can deal with a lot of thing in veri differ situat and also you can do the rigth thing in differ situat . in exampl you can talk with peopl that do n't attend your same class and have a gener discuss of everi subject . howev thi kind of knowledg ca n't be veri specif . therefor you can do a job that need gener knowledg but not a specialist job . instead if you decid to special in a specif subject you do n't have ani problem . in fact you can studi one subject and know almost everyth about it . i think thi is the best way to find a good job , beacaus you know someth that other peopl not special do n't know and there is alway someon that pay you for thi specialist knowledg . therefor i choos a specialist major and i disagre with the given stament . in addit if you special in one specif subject you can reach the best result in what you studi . in exampl i like to studi the chemic composit of the materi and i can special in what i like instead of stude a lot of subject that i do n't like . accord to thi , the best thing of special in one specif subject is that you can concentr your effort in just one thing and you have not to diverg your attenct in differ subject . therefor thi is whi i think it 's better for someon that want to do good thing in hi life to special in one specif subject and not in mani of them .
