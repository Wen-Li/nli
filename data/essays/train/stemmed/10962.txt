although some veri popul countri such as china or india are go to becom modern industri countri in the next few year , and then increas their demand of car , i do n't think that the suppli will stay as high as today . sever reason support my opinion . first , the pollut issu is an obstacl to an increas of the car number . even though these countri can produc and build by themselv their own car , there are more and more law in order to reduc pollut , includ car pollut . second , gaz oil ressourc are becom rare , and some reaserch state that in less than fifti year all of them will be end . besid , the organis of arabian countri that produc oil ( opep ) stilll put up the price of the baril . then it becom veri expens to provid oil . so , on the one hand there is the will of mani countri in the world of lead a western way of life , which the feel of liberti that impli car drivng is an import part . but on the other hand it is an order for human to reduc global pollut . nevertheless mayb scientist will find new place where oil is avala . howev the global warmer climat is still a big issu due to car pollut in a part . mayb that is whi polici concern drive licens are becom so strict in western countri . .. anyway , i would conclud by write that i believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today
