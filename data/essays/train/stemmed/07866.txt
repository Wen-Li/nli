i agre thi statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . here are my reason . first , the time of the young peopl is alway not enough . result from the wealth , almost everi student can studi in school , so they all have opportun to make friend with peer in school . henc , in their leisur time , they alway have date with their friend . in addit , the competit of yound peopl is larg , everi student have to not onli go to school but also go to cram school to prepar exam . therefor , it is almost possibl for them to have time help other peopl . second , all peopl , not onli young peopl , all becom colder and colder . for instanc , i have seen a young man just sit on hi seat near a stand pregnent woman without help her . if we do n't help a person who is just surround us , how can we help our commun possibl ? in addit , our educ alway teach us to studi hard to get a famou colleg and compet with other . therefor , we are not friendli with other becaus everyon is possibl to be our enemi . so , we becom never kind to other from our heart . third , we are alway unfamiliar with our heighbor . becaus everyon is busi to search for hi wealthi life , he ha to work hard to get high salari or studi hard to prepar to find a good job . we never have time to drink a cup of coffe with our neighbor . in addit , we all live in flat , so it is veri hard for us to meet the peopl in the commun . to sum up , abov s
