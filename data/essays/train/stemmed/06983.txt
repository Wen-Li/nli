the teacher teach us alof of differ thing . they alway teach us that to understand the idea and the concept of each articl is more import than to learn the fact . even thought we are the student or the teacher . first , understand to idea and the concept is to make sure that you know everyth of thi stori or articl . if you do not understand what it talk about , you would never get the the fact of it . my english teacher alway say that way to me . if we want to learn the good english , we should read it more than one time to understand the idea . it like the chacat , set , plot , and the background . when we can get all of the abov , we would understand the idea and the concept . tri to read it more than one time , it would more easi to get what it say in the read . i alway do that way , becaus i want to get higher mark of everi test or quiz . when we do that , we will learn more when we read . lean the fact is not realli a bad thing to lean . it depend on differ peopl to learn . everyon also ha it 's own way to learn . we wo n't learn or follow the other step . everyon is differ . no one is the same . learn the fact is anoth way for learn . actual , learn the fact is almost at the end of the learn step . if we spread it out , we would know that the first step of read is to understand the idea , and then it should be to learn the concept . after thi two step , it 's to learn the fact . although there ha a lot of differ way to learn , i still would think the most import for the student to understand idea and the concept . that 's becaus that 's the onli way that my teacher teach me sinc i have been studi .
