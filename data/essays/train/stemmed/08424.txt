i truli convinc that the relat between `` idea '' and `` fact '' is so strict that it doe not make sens to discuss wheter it is more import for student to understand concept or fact . i am engin and dure my own experi i can provid some exampl to explain better what i think about thi issu . one of the most difficult cours is optic commun , there are thousand equat to explain the trasmiss of an optic signal from one point to anoth , i read the book and pay attent to all the lesson but althought all the mathemat implic were clear to me , i wa not abl to appli them and in that semest i fail to pass the exam , i did not understand the reason for my failur after all i knew all the concept . i decid to ask my problem to the professor who took me immidiatli to the commun lab , show all the applic of what i suppos to know . thought that experi , learn `` fact '' i deepli understand the main point of the cours and pass exam in a rel simpli way . in thi case the concept could not provid me all the necessari inform to a full understand . sometim could happen the countrari , we can start from theori to understand a fact . everyon know the stori of newton , one red appl on hi head repres and import fact : newton learnt thi fact and start from that he introduc the concept of `` gravit '' settin up idea and concept in order to explain that fact . galileo galilei , one of the most famou scientist in the histori , deal with the import to support idea and concept with fact and experi that could be replic sever time in order to veri and prove the valid of a theori . in conclus i think that idea and fact are two aspect of the same `` world '' and one can not claim that one aspect is more import than the other , but inde they live toghter . in my opinion a good student ha to pay attent to both of these two aspect if he or she want to have a full underst of an event .
