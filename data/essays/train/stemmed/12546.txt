i think that both thing are import for a student , to now fact and conceopt and also to understand idea . first of all i think that it 's import for peopl to now fact becous if you onli now idia your nouleg would not be complet . for exampl i use to onli have idia about what art wa and what hapen in gener threw out the centuri in art histori . i allso new gener idea about how art evolv in my home countri . but senc i dident have especif fact it wa quit difiult to coper what wa happen in peru when some thing els wa happen in anoth countri . with fact i can compear more acuretli and see thi influenc that one had tour the other . i also thik that idea are import becous it help a person make there oun thote obout what they are learn . thi is mostli limport in clase or subject like sociolog , histori , filosofi , and other that even though there are some fact that have to be leren , if you dont understand gener concept and idia thi nalig would not be of much use ani were but in clase . a student is prepar himself for the world , for work , and for life in gener . the world is made of strick roul , fact that we should now but be nead to understand way the roul are there for , and who doe the fact afect us . a bis man for exampl need to now the pice of product as much as how to treat hi client , what is the best way to reach them , what give beter resalt . in conclut i think that bouth understand concept and idia is as import as learn fact becous we need bouth for aur prepar as good profet .
