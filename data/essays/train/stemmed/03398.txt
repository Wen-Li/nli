'' it is realli hurt to keep do my situat . to support my futur life and my famili , i am definit suppos to work veri hard and to get a job for my life . usual , in korea , almost all young colleg student would like to hang around and to enjoy with their freind when they are colleg student . howev , they never spend their time ineffici in campu becaus all of peopl want to get a job more than they expect their job due to prepar their futur . at the end , when young peopl studi veri hard to get a their job and work their compani their futur , older peopl enjoy their life with their ern money when they were young such as to play golf , tenni , ski and travel so on . my parent are also spend their time to travel , to play golf and to get a their hobbi . they are enjoy their life more than me . therefor , i want that situat as my parent who prepar their futur when they were young .
