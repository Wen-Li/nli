i disagre with that statement . nowaday , a lot of highschool student look for summer job as soon as their academ year end . those job consist of help out in variou store in a shop mall , perform simpl task in a clinic , or cater in a restaur , or host an event and there are lot more . it also depend on the what type of young peopl the statement is refer to . if it is refer to spoil , rich teenag then i would understand , sinc all they have been taught to do is to just request whatev they wish for without earn it . although , there are sever other case which young peopl are normal student who reciev averag amount of pocket money everi month given by their parent . at a certain point , those young peopl soon realis that the pocket money most of the time will not be enough to get what they need or want . that is when they start work and look for job even at a hospit for the elderli . most of the job vacanc out there are be occupi by young teenag , and they are actual more enthuisiast than older peopl when they go through their job . most of my classmat in colleg alway volunt to help out with chariti work . the amount of student who actual show up to donat and help out with organis wa so shock that the older member were extrem impress . in my point of view , younger peopl are far more creativ at organis an event especi for younger peopl 's interest . for instanc , when it come to organis a music concert in order to collect the money for donat , it is alway done best by a young person in hi or her late teen , sinc they know what type of music and who the younger gener like to listen to nowaday . that way the concert will turn out to be success and they could earn a good amount of money for chariti .
