the issu on hand is contenti and of great import as it ha it relev to peopl in all rank of ani societi . i think that the young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there are mani factor which support thi view . societi is not static , it chang with time . the young peopl , the youth are an import part of the societi as they are the futur of the societi . their behaviour , action and idea defin the futur of the societi . compar to the old time , i think that youth are spend lesser and lesser time help their commun these day . coupl of gener back , the young in a famili too did some product work for the famili . help one famili is help his/her commun indirectli . nowaday the young are remain unproduct for longer period and are start to contibut anyt use to famili or commun veri late . for instanc , youth spend a lot of time play comput game , or chat over the internet , dicuss some tabloid articl with a friend for hour . not may spend time on commun activit , which could be as simpl as conduct or particip in awar program , regul traffic , help the poor kid get educ , etc . in the ester year the youth associ with their commun more , their commun wa an ident for them . with the media revolut , the youth of today associ themselv more with the hollywood movi and footbal star rather than their own commun . thi onli mean that there is motiv in the first place for the youth to spend time help their commun is miss . we can not put all the balm on the youth for thi chang . with the increas competet for job , youth are made to work harder and harder just to make their end meet . one realli may not have ani time to take off their busi schedul for help their commun directli . the young peopl of olden day did not have to live in such a fast pace world . they had a lot of time for lesuir , some time of which they alloc for help their commun . i conclud by say that due to a varieti of reason explain abov the young peopl nowaday do not give enouh time to help their commun .
