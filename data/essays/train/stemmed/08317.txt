today , there are mani way in that we can travel around the world , among other , buy a tour packag or prepar own trip . the first way , in gener , includ a trip in group with a tour guid , but in the second option is possibl travel alon without tour guid . each of thi method to travel have a lot advantag that i will describ . the first point i would like to state is the advantag to travel in a group led by a tour guid can be a fun experi , becous it is possibl know to new peopl in the trip , moreov , in thi kind of trip mani friend decid to buy the same tour , and thi is good reason to take it . other advantag is that the person that buy the tour are safer , sinc they are not alon in ani place that they are go to visit . for exampl , one time i travel to europ with a friend , we bouth a tour and we could to visit onli place that were insid the schedul of tour , obvious all these place were safe for tourist . by other hand , in spite of the compel advantag mention in the last paraghrap , i think that travel alon without tour guid is the best way to spend time on vacat . when a person travel alon , he or she can decid what time he will arriv , what place he will visit , where he will sleep and what he will eat , etc . for instanc , last vacat i went to brasil , i enjoy a lot my trip , i could move to differ hotel accord my own decis and no one gave me order about my time . overal , there are mani factor to consid when we must decid about how we travel , but accord to the strong advantag point out on travel alon without tour guid , i think that it is the best way . the first method to travel have the essenti advantag that there is someon that lead the trip and it is safer for peopl that take it , but the most import advantag the second method is that the person is more free .
