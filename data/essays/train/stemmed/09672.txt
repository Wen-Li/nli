i do not agre with the statement . the reason are three which are written below . first reason of disagr is not to be abl to choos place where i visit . place where we want to visit might be differ by each person . howev , we have to dicid one place if we are led by a tour guid and travel as a group . in addit , a tour guid explain about somet i am not interest in at all . i want to travel wherev i want and i want know that i realli interest in . i can ask to peopl who are familiar with the place instead of a tour guid . second reason is respons . in a group we have reaspons as a group member . we can not do someth selfish and have to follow a tour guid . howev i can go aroud freeli if i travel by my self . the respons is onli for me . when i went to washington d.c. , i want to visit some ghetto place . we should go out in a group . howev i can not take respons for my friend if my friend and i go some ghetto place and bad thing happen . therefor i went around by myself . third reason is about time . when we travel in a group led by tour guid , our travel will be schedul like `` 6:00 p.m. visit musium '' or '' 9:00 p.m. eat dinner . '' howev , how much time we want spend will chang by each person . becaus of those three reason which are choos place , respons and time . the idea of statem is not confort for me and i do not agre with the statement .
