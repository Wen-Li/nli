i disagre with the statement becaus it is not allway true . infact there are mani young peopl that do not know the real mean of `` enjoy life '' . they like drink alchool and smoke or take drug . thi two thing are all that they would like to enjoy their life . but i know mani old peopl that know what it is the felic . firstli they appreci the slowli of life , the kind and the import of friend . they know the mean of drink a tea whit friend . also they can danc an walk like nobodi know . lastli they know the mean of life , but if it is not true anyway they will know how enjoy their life ! accord to a magazin in the futur there will more old peopl than young peopl . i think that it will be good becaus if the old peopl know how enjoy life , all the world will be happi . there are , also , a lot of cultur differ between peopl . for thi reason it is imposs to know how the world will be . if you have a zero cultur backgound and you live in a countri you will know the felic , but if you have a kind knowledg that it is not complet you will unhappi . in both of thi two exampl you do not know your grade of happy
