befor discuss thi statement , we have to think about what `` enjoy life '' mean . it could be simpli `` have fun . '' if it is the case , we have to say that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . but i want to say that `` enjoy life '' can be attain after we recogn `` the mean of life . '' when we follow my own definit of `` enjoy life , '' then we can say that old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do . young peopl may have fun dure their school life by discuss topic that they newli discov , travel foreign countri or simpli go out with friend . howev i want to say that these experi would be mere `` fun '' rather than enjoy life . becaus `` life '' is such a seriou thing , it will take time for young peopl to recogn the mean of life . also , young peopl are busi and poor . they have too much thing to do to prepar for the futur . they do n't have enough money to spend to enjoy . older peopl , on the other hand , through their abund experi , would get their own idea of `` life . '' onli after they have some idea of life , they will think about what would enjoy their live mean . it could be help other , read book and discuss about , or travel to diffen countri . but their experi would not mere fun . we could say these experi are `` enjoy live . '' facin thing for older peopl would be that they have time and money to spend for enjoy their live . as a conclus , i would like to say that old peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do . so i disagre with the statement .
