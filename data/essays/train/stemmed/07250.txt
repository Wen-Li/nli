it is reasnobl to me that it is import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , idea and cocept make a new fact in futur . whi do student studi ? i think that studi stand for make new thing in futur . if we learn fact , we will be abl to onli regrect or stop the failur and repeat success . fact can not make a birth new idea and concept . but idea and conept can make unlimit new fact . second , fact is sometim sad thing for student . student have tremend possibl to make new idea and concept for fact . young student is veri sensit about emotin matter which happend in the real world . bad fact sometim affect for young student . becaus young student ha big curiou . they wanna make sure the fact is true or not . third , fact sometim easili make misunderstand of to stand for the fact . if we learn onli fact , we ca n't understand the idea and concept of the fact . for exampl , human be have made a lot of sad war in our histori . it is fact and we need to accept it as real and understand the reason which it 's happend in order to not make failur again . the import thig of war is not fact . it is the process contain idea and concept . we ca n't learn anyth to stop failur repeat from onli fact . in the worth , fact make a lot of misunderstandig that war can make it solut . thu i recommend that young student should understand idea and concept befor to leran fact .
