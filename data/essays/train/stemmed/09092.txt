while mani peopl think that it is more import for student to undertand idea and concept that it is to learn fact , i think that a stronger case can be made by point out that learn about fact and real case of life can give the student the opportin to re-liv toghet with the peopl invlov in those case the situat which they went through . it is import to undert well the concept but noth as studi a real case . learn case method lead the student to a group of posibl solut and teach them how those solut affect the final result . howev to get involv in the fact and real life case , need a previou prepar obtain not onli by the well understand of idea relat to the fact , but also by the studi of all the materi concern the case . in mani univers program , the profesor make a well balanc combin of both method and they obtain veri good result . first they prepar the idea and materi to be learn by the student and after they present the real fact . it permit the student to appli their recent acquir knoledg and give their best result in order to reach a solut . not onli the result give by the student , but the final solut is then compar with what realli happend . it allow student to know wich solut to the problem wa right and wich one wa wrong . a survey made by peopl magan by the end of the year 2002 , shown that the learn real fact method had a better approach of the right solut to a specif problem that had the tradit method of just understand the idea without applic . there also exist thoudand of studi that support thi topic . for that reason i think that undertand idea alon without applic in real life , is not much a good method as it is the applic in alreadi live case .
