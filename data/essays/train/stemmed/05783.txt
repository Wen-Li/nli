first of all i do not agre with the statement which say that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peolpl . i think that the way to enjoy life is differ but thi not impli what the statement say . today young peopl can enjoy in sever way , respect one or two gener ago becaus is permit almost everyth : for exampl have the car veri earli , to go out everi weekend and spend a lot of money to take drink and to go to the disco with some friend . they can also enjoy themself organ some parti between compain of school or univers . a friend of mine told me that he went to danmark as erasmu student and he descib me that experi as a beauti thing . everi day he enjoy hi life go to erasmu parti that took place almost everi even in the univers place . he told me also that the mainli enjoy it wa the beer and the disco . in stead , the fact that the older person do not do the same thing it doe not mean that they enjoy less : they have onli other interest . the major part of older person are marri and for thi reason the prefer enjoy their free time go , for exampl , to the cinema to watch a particular film , or to go to the restaur for a romant dinner . of cours mani older peopl could have son or daughter and thi impli that they do not have the same time respect the young peopl , to spend for enjoy themself . the have to do a lot of thing into hous and at the work .
