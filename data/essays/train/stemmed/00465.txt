today , there is a gener opinion about the way young peopl enjoy their life , and thi opinion tend to say that the young enjoy life more than older peopl do . i would say that i entir agre thi opinion , for , the fact that , young peopl are young , give them an advantag , becaus they have the strength , vital and capabl to do thing that older peopl can not . for exampl a young man or girl can stay up all the nigth danc and drink in a night club ; thi is someth an old man could hardli do . moreov , the age of thi young peopl repres an advantag , for they are ambiti , they can set themselv futur purpos , in the hope to fulfil these object . on the contrari , the old are alway fill with the feel that they have alreadi make their life ; they are constantli think about the day of their death , and that is whi , in mani case , they do not pospond themselv in the futur , and adopt a deject attitud toward life . for all these evid , i do persist in believ that the young enjoy life more than the old do , though the fact that you may encount some old peopl who take life as it is and live it dayli , and therefor , who enjoy it more than some young peopl .
