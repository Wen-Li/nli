i strongli disagre with thi statement as the need for person transport will be even more in next twenti year than what it today is . rise in the live standard of the peopl and faster life style would be the possibl reason behind thi predict . peopl are becom more and more independ and solitari in their life style so the need for person car is go to be more . there are certain thing wich may resist increas of the number of car in futur and one of those is the fuel problem . the major fuel for car these day is petrol or other chemic deriv from petroleum . the amount of fuel we have under ocean etc is expect to last for anoth 100 year . so there will be enough fuel for the car in next twenti year . but even then other type of fuel such as c.n.g and hydrogen etc are also use by car manufactur now a day so it would not let the extinct of car happen . car are definet go to increas in number on road in next twenti year becas they have been made safer now a day than they were befor . with all thi technic advanc and safeti experiment carri out at a war front level new model of car come out of the factori in futur are go to be veri veri safe for the driver . last but not the least , with all the abov reason , the reason which might be the biggest and the most power reason behind increas in car 's popul on the road will be afford , the mass product and competit in the market is work toward cut down the price of the car so down that the day is not far when even a common man would be abl to buy a car of hi choie . the freedom of mobil , safeti and afford would increas the number of car on the road in next twenti year .
