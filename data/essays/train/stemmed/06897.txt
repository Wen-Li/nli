i do n't agre at all with the idea that a young gener enjoy life more than older peopl do . we usual think about youth as a golden period of our life where we experi mani unforgett moment while we tend to consid the final period of our exist as the most pain one . nevertheless we have to consid also the other side of the coin as a young person usual face mani difficulti an older person doe n't deal with anymor . there are in my opinion three differ kind of problem you face in when you are young . first of all , everyth is brand new to a you . you pass through a lot of experi you do n't know how to deal with becaus you lack the requir experi about it . thi often creat fear and doubt that is quit difficult to cope with unless you get the help of an older knowledg person . for instanc the doubt face for the choic of a univers , a crucial step in life , can be live in a veri neg way and can creat a big sens of lack of direct . secondli there are mani situat that dure your life you experi sever time thu get use to them . but when you are young and you experi these situat for the first time you are much more sensibl to them than a older person would be . a typic exampl is love . a young person usual suffer much more than a older one becaus of love relationship becaus they are not yet use to them while get older you acquir the experi that allow you to suffer less . in the end , when you are young you do n't know yourself veri well sinc you are not awar of your strength and weak . thi can caus a seriou lack of self-confid that creat veri unpleas feel and thought in ayoung person . when you get older , instead , you are awar of your success and failur and you get no more disappoint by them .
