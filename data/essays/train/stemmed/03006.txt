i believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know to do well . one of the reason i adovact is that we can learn more technolog . i can learn some new thing when i wa tri new thing . for exampl , i did n't know how to do powerpoint , and we had a small speech in next month last quater . i could choic ani type of way to show my speech , i could use poster or just talk , both of these two way that i alreadi know and can do veri well . but i want to make my speech more interest , i wa think of use the powerpoint which i have never use befor ; howev , it could show all of my idea in it . therefor , i start to learn it . although it took me a lot of time to learn it , but the result i got wa better than i thought . morov , i can use it in other speech in futur , it will help me so much . in addit , i can learn how to make plan . even i should take risk of lose someth or fault . howev it can improv my abil of have the vision and make olan . let us see an instanc , i plan to go to some place for visit , i have been there sever time ; nonetheless , i alway go with tour guid and never go by myself . i make a clear plane to decid wher to go and where to live , i need to consid how much money i will spend , and if i meet some problem how to deal with , etc. , there will a lot of situat i need to think befor . i can collect inform for book , internet , and other experi . if i have a good travel , than i learn how to make good plan for travel by myself . in brief , i agre that success peopl come from tri new thing and take risk . becaus it realli can improv me a lot in mani place .
