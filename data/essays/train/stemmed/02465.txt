with a broad knowledg you can understand the world and with a special in a subject you may be the most recur person in the whole world . which path should one take ? that 's a topic that mani young peopl deal with . let 's discuss some relev point . have a broad knowledg of mani essenti subject , such as histori , mathemat , biolog and languag is not onli import in order to climb the latter of educ but also for the develop of one 's idea , person and toler toward other . you can be abl to understand the world , draw conclus and interrel the differ subject , and therefor have a deeper and more coher view of thing . for exampl , if you have learnd about darwin and hi theori about the `` surviv oh the fittest '' and have a knowledg in histori you would know how thi biolog theori appli in societi , in which power and wealthi peopl rule most of the time . on the other hand , be special in one specif subject could mean be the most known person in that area and peopl will recurr to you more than to anyon els who doe not have the knowledg you have on a specif matter . you may not understand the whole world , but have answer to question and are abl to analys thing that no one els could . for exampl , if you have a uniqu diseas , a bacteri infect , you would recurr to a specialist in that area and not tho your grandfath that ha a veri broad cultur knowledg . in my opinion you should n't choos one path but both . throughout your whole life you should be interest to expand your broad knowledg , let it be by studi or travel . it is indispens to know about mani subject in order to understand each of one , sinc everyth interrel in one world . broad knowledg is the basi of your futher area of studi that you may want to pursu if you are interest in a specif matter .
