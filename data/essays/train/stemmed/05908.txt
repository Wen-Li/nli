the argument of peopl 's view about have broad knowledg or specif knowledg deserv care consider becaus it 's such a complex one . some peopl hold the opinion that broad knowledg of academ subject will have more advantag than specif subject . in my point of view , i prefer have specif knowledg rather than broad one . there are numer reason whi i think specif subject is good and i would in here explor a few of the most import one . first of all , we come from a collabor societi , therefor , we need lot of differ specilaist to improv our problem . it 's even a tough job for a genium to invent or solv everyth we need . we also know that everi peopl ha it adventag no matter he is clever or not , therefor , it 's better to special in one specif subject . if we do that , it will explor more specialist to contribut their capac to our societi . anoth essenti reason whi i advoc thi point is that we can establish our countri ' econom posit by cultiv such specialist . for exampl , in the past , taiwan , my countri , is an agricultur countri . later , our ex-precid , in order to make resid live better , tri to find out the better way to improv our economi . final , he found that comput , internet would be the most popular product in the follow centuri . therefor , he plane a polici which about train specialist , encourag them go aboad to learn the skill . under such improv , we transfer our econom system success . there is an argument to be made by the oppos posit . they might say that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject will enrich peopl 's view . but the statement i have present abov , i do believ it 's the most valid .
