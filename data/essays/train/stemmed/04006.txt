find the success who is success nowaday ? what doe success mean to me ? who is more success , a person who take risk or a person who doe not ? in my opinion , if you are success in your job , in your career , in you social life is becaus you have been develop some skill and situat that you alreadi control and you know that they work . in my person experi , i am a gener dental practition , or a normal dentist . i know how to do my work in order to obtain good result . i would never tri someth new or riski in order to be more brave if i do not know for sure it will end success . those who take risk to `` tri '' to find success is becaus they have noth to loos . for instanc , imagin i had a busi and for ani reason it just fail . i would loos all my invest and i would be in bankrupci . i have lost eveyth . in thi case if someon told me that he/sh had an exept opportun for me to start a busi from the veri begin i would take the risk becuas i have noth to loos . let 's see anoth exampl in my profession life . a patient come into my surgeri complain of pain in the central incisor . i take an x-ray and ha a veri big infect in the root . i have never done an apiceptomi ( open the gum and cut the root ) and i would never tri to do one without the appropi train as it can be danger for the patient . i would never take thi risk to be success in thi case . in sum , i complet disagre with the statement as i believ success is someth you can find in your day by day life without take ani risk . look for it !
