the issu at hand is that whether knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in ani one particular subject . i believ that special in a particular subject is a better than have knowledg about mani subject . i believ so becaus special form of knowledg lead to complet knowledg about the subject at hand . firstli , i beleiv that special in a particular subject is a better option becaus it involv greater in depth analysi of variou detail and it influenc on other thing as well . for exampl , consid a heart specialist doctor who ha special in heart surgeri . such a doctor is better than other gener physician when it come to heart relat ailment . such a specialist is in a better state to advis thing relat to heart problem . addit , special in a subject is better becaus a specialist can do the research work relat to a particular special field more effect and effici . a research done by a specialist is more credibl than a research done by a non-specialist . for exampl , newton wa a specialist in hi field , so hi research and discoveri are still consid great work in hi field . ani one can not do such a research and lead to great discoveri , but onli a specialist like newton can . final , in my view , a person with special knowledg about a particular subject is better abl to commun thing and impart knowledg to other . to bolster thi , consid the point that all our professor and lectur in our school and colleg are specialist in their field . a physic professor will be abl to teach physic more effect than ani a scienc teacher who ha superfici knowledg about that subject . so , by state all these point i conclud that special form of subject knowledg is better than superfici knowledg about mani differ academ subject . a specialist is the onli person whose ha great in depth knowledg about the subject at hand .
