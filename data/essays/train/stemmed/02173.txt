do the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl ? my answer is exactli no beacus of two reason ; one of the reason is that the life is so hard to understand to young peopl becaus of their lack of experi and educ . and the understand the life can rais the tast that you take from it . the other reason is that you can know about yourself much when you get older , and if a person know about himself/herself enough , thi matur give him/her a chanc to rule on him/her life in a more correct way , so they can enjoy their life more than the other . knowledg about life and about ourselv . i think that they are the key of happini . socrat , the famou greek philosoph , say that `` know him/herself '' . i think thi advis is explain the most import thing in human life .
