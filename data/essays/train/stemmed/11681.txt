the issu at hand is whether success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . thi issu is import becaus it discuss the mental of success peopl and what they did to earn their success . i agre that success peopl tri new thing rather than do what they alreadi know becaus that is the basic theme of sucess . accord to me succ mani a time mean to be just different-a class apart . mani scientist would have not succed if they would have not thought differ than other . mani businessmen would have not succed had they adopt the same product and market polici . becaus of the abov mention point i think success peopl do new thing . secondli do new thing also help differ other peopl who were not help befor , make the initi succes . for exampl , mahatma gandhi tri a new thing call satyagraha and and non-voil and help indian to come out of the clucth of the british regim . he becam success becaus he tri a new practic in the histori of indian independ instead of watch in silenc , a thing which an ordinari person would have done . henc at time help peopl in a new way also make a person success . lastli a person who take risk and tri new thing get an immens sens of fulfil . in thi way he becom success in hi own eye . do thing which alreadi one know make him bore and the job monoton . sometim one tend to lose interest in everyday routin work , so tri new thing or new method would often make even a lay man success in hi own small way . in conclus i would again assert that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . thi is becaus onli do new and better thing help them becom succes and differ from other .
