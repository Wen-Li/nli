i often watch advertis on tv commerci or magazin . when i watch these advertis , i alway think that these advertis are too much perform . the reason that i think such thing is that i have experi that there are big differ between advertis and real one . therefor i agre with thi statement . first of all , i watch advertis on tv everyday . actual that advertis are attract me . and then i have experienc that i boght degit camera on tv shop program . howev when i got thi camera , i wa realli disappoint it . becaus the camera wa n't good . on the tv shop program , i thought that the camera wa good . howev , after get it , i realiz that that salesperson on the tv program explan it too much . the person on the tv said that it is easi to use thi camera , in fact i thought that thi camera 's oper wa so complic . in addit , when i work for a bank , we were sell some stock . and then our bank wa use advertis on tv . that advertis said onli good aspect . howev not onli me but also my cowork thoght that that stock have also risk . i thought that our advertis should announc about high risk and high return , and i thought that some costom must be misunderstand about thi invest . in fact some custom who watch our advertis on tv misunderstood . they did n't know risk on thi invest . i have bad experi about advertis , when i wa custom , in addtion , i felt that our bank 's advertis where i wa work for wa much better than real one . i understand that advertis are strategi of sale . howev i realli think that it should n't do too much perform . becaus mani custom might misunderstand . howev , in fact there are mani too much perform advertis in the world . therfor i agre with the idea that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are .
