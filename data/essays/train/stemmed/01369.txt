i strongli agre with the statement say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have two reason for thi . first of all , travel in group is far more excit than travel alon which may be quit bore . moreov , experi show that peopl are more excit to go see new place when they travel in group than when they travel alon just as the experi that show that peolpl eat more when they eat in group . one member of the group can motiv the curios of other and vice versa . the second reason whi i have thi opinion is that when you travel , of cours , you want to know and see new place , but where are you go to see those new place if you do not have someon to guid you . of cours , you can use a map but how use will be the map to you when you want to see as mani place as you can see ? instead of spend time read a map you would be on your way to see a veri excit geyser , for exanpl . furthermor , there may be a languag barrier . if you travel alon , even though you could hire a guid , but where are you go to find him or her and how good will that person be in guid your through the citi and place you want to know ? in my opinion travel in group led by a tour guid is the best way to travel becaus it bring you all what you need dure a trip in just one place . in other word you have everyth at your armreach .
