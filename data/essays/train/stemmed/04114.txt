in order to understand someth student should have a basic idea about it . i agre with the statement that it is more signific for the student to understand idea and conept becaus in order for have a vast knowledg about ani thing we should have a idea or concept which can be appli later in the practic life . one reason for my belief is that in order to have a overal knowledg about ani equip or ani subject , it take time therefor student should learn idea and concept . suppos we take a case of a person who want to becom a pilot , so inord to becom a pilot , he should have to understand idea and concept about the variou mechan in the aeroplan instead of drive it . he can drive it better if he can have a better understand about the concept and idea then he can appli these in drive the aeroplan . second reason for my belief is that inord for the accur knowledg for the subject it is better for the student to have a clear understand about idea in their class room becaus i feel that for a flawless knowledg we should have our concept clear in classroom . suppos a student want to work on a comput aid machin which is a veri expens machin and quit vulner to fault if not handl properli , then in these case without have a knowledg of concept and idea to handl it , student can caus a problem to the machin result in failur . final , i feel that in the student life there are too much concept which are to learn , they had less time to complet their subject syllabu , therefor they should firstli complet the cours in their school otherwis less time will harm their academ career . howev for the proper studi of the a subject , student should have a hand to hand knowledg of fact also these will help in acquir profound knowleg of the subject . in conclus , i agre with the statement that the student should understand idea and concept which will be more benef for them .
