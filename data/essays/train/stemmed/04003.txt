everi bodi know jetson the cartoon where you dont find ani car peopl travel in jet but then that may not an hypothet situat in the near futur . in twenti year there can be a lot of develop that can even be dare to think of . now if you look back at the start of the centuri we you have the feel that we sail a lot . i take the stand that there will be fewer car in the next twenti year than now , the replacememt of the car can take the follow cours . first , as there is huge surg in number of car in all the countri 's they tend to expand there infrastructur but after reach the satur point you just do n't have ani land left out to fulfil your residenti and infrastrucut need . besid , the pollut caus due to the emmis from car need to be cut down as we have the impend threat of ozon layer deplet . thu , we arriv at situat where car are neccessari evil . then to nullifi the pollut effect we go for car that are hybrid , eco-friendli , electr charg , water oper . but we still have the infrastructur problem , so to have effect commut in busi traffic region peopl will go for bike or bicycl we see that today in china , we also see hybrid model of car be launch . we also have a situat where mass commut is becom popular day by day and is prove to be more effect than have a own car . second step is when even with the hybrid car doe n't serv your purpos they do n't help you in get ani faster to your place . so , you natur tend to look at the other option we have lot of air space . there is a research go on how to effect use ion combin for transport thi process is less harm to the environ and is effect to have air born vehicl . thi slowli but sure replac the car in the next 20 or odd year . where natur first the upper class peopl get hold of it then it reach the common man later . if i 'm not over exagger recent denmark scientist have a break thtough in teletransport of materi for a few meter there might be a day we can use the fruit of thi when even the air traffic is also difficult to handl but it 's certainli not in the near futur as it is in bud state . thu , i conclud that car will be lesser than there are today becaus of the abov mention reason .
