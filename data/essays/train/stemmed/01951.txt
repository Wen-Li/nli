i complet disagre with thi statement that there would be fall in the car usag in next twenti year when the number of car be own by the peopl is increas day by day . there is no reason to expect the reduct in thi rate in come futur , or atleast in the span twenti year from now . all of us are so depend on the car that it is veri difficult to think about make smooth movement from one place to other without our own mean of transport . so rather than a luxuri car have turn out the need of common man . and we all know that the nessecc ' ussag never declin , so is the case of car now . they will probabl increas . also if we see the current newspap , the detail about the increas rate of number of car on the road doesnot at all allow us to agre with the point that the car usag will decreas in near futur . rather it is trueli convinc to say that thi number would shoot up to an indetermin valu . also there are sever new model hit on the road everi season . thi make the younger gener to get attract toward them and enjoy newer or advanc technolog car . also the latest model provid drive comfort make them catch attent of sensibl car owner make them ultimatelypurchas it . but at the same time these peopl just sell off their old car to anyon who will can use it . thi lead to new car ad on to the road rather than a replac . the second . would thi prove that the car ussag will go down ? not at all . there can be no predict made atleast after review the abov exampl that can give a conclus that there would be lesser number of car use by peopl . the need and depend of peopl on car as there mean of transport will lead to rais there number and not declin it .
