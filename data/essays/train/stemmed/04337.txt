nowaday , young peopl have veri busi life and it can be thought that they do not spend enough time help their commun . in fact i disagre with that point of view and i think young peopl do a lot for human in the daylif of their commun . first of all , young peopl are veri implic in educ of younger . i have a lot of friend who give mathemat support lesson to children after class or who help younger student to prepar for their exam . in my view , help in educ is veri import and thi kind of help is veri valuabl for the societi . secondli i have notic on sever occas that young peopl are veri helpful to elderli peopl . some student help elderli to do shop ; other go for a walk with disabl peopl . these exampl show that young peopl are veri implic and feel concern about the elderli in their commun . final younger citizen are usual the most implic in humanitari project in their citi . mani organis help disabl peopl like patient who suffer from toxicomania or unemploy peopl were rais by young leader who were veri involv in find fund to realiz their project . moreov when there is a natur disast in a town , we usual see that the younger are the first on the field . in conclus , i trulli think that young peopl are veri concern by the condit of live in their commun . despit their lack of time and money , they are realli motiv to help peopl in need and are often more implic in help their commun than the elderli . their differ action are veri encourag for the futur of our commun .
