product seem much better than they realli are ? in my opinion i agre . in thi day the best seem product is the best seller . for me they are three reason of whi these happen . firt the price of the product . second the way of the owner present the product to the societi . last but not least the quantiti of money that the produc will spend on make the product . let 's talk about price . the money is he one that move the world . in unit state the most biggest societi class is the middl one , that mean the worker class . most of the popul will be look for the cheap product . the advertis make look the product good and if the price is good peopl will buy the product . the fist impres of the product , is waht we first look at . the promot is veri import , if the advertis convinc the person thatth product is good they will buy it . also peopl do not have to much time to look the difer between of the product and if in the promot say 's that is the best seller you will buy it without notic that dose n't mean that is the best one . the compani cost for make the producti the most import thing fot them . alot of compani 's preffer to safe money , than sale to the peopl a good product . a good exampl of that are the food , natur food is better but j artificiali flavor is most cheap , so flavor mayb it will be better but is not becaus is not natur . in conclut produc will be make them product seem better than other becaus is market competit . my advis is to alway look the contain of the product if is foot , medicin or ani supplemet . if is a traport like car , equip , etc ; look the materi of what are compos that will help you to know wich one is better . mo importan look for second opinio or compar product so you by your own self determin wich one is better fro you .
