in my opinion it is import for student to understand idea and concept beacaus without them they will never understand the fact . i can expalin it much more better with an esampl : if you understand the concept of graviti you can understand whi we can ' t fli , but if you onli know the fact that we ca n't fli you do n't know the concept of graviti . you can understand that there is someth more but without some further fact you can ' t find the concept . but at the same time fact are veri import for a student . we live in a soceti that it forget the past in a veri easi way , the more we go on the more we forget and school are not good in give us the inform . i also konw it is difficult to give us all the inform becaus there is so few time but the few argument that they had chosen for us are not enought . in italian school , for esampl , we studi for mani year the preistor period , tha acient , tha middl age . .. the stori ! but when we final arriv to studi , at latest year of school , recent stori of the world and of our countri we run and at least we arriv at the first period after the ii warld war ; now we are in 2007 and there are fifti year of fact that we don ' t know well and for thi we have a not cultur class of peopl that it will govern us . .. thi is onli an esampl to show how fact , in my idea are much more import to understand than idea and concept also becaus if you learn much more better the fact , from them , you will reiceiv also the idea and concept that are unifi to them .
