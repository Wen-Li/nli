i strongli disagre with the statement made and believ that the number of car would certainli increas in the come twenti year . the reason and exampl for my stand are includ herewith . firstli , let me consid the ten year back scenario , when have or possess a car wa consid to be a big asset and peopl use to consid it as a properti which distinguish the peopl own car and the one who do not . to exemplifi , i bring into pictur my own experi , five year back , when i wa go to the school , i use to feel that some of my friend 's parent who had car were on a higher econom scale than our famili . but two year back my father who is a scientist bought a luxuri car , even though he wa not given ani promot in hi job . the answer that my father gave when i ask him regard thi wa simpli a straight one . my father told me that the rate of the car had come down rapidli and everyon of our calib can afford a car . i wa amus to hear thi , becaus of the fact that just in three year , the whole scenario ha chang . not onli my father but a lot of peopl start buy the luxuri car becaus of their avail and reduct in cost . the advanc in technolog that are be made support my point . the latest technic advanc that we have today in automobil industri ha drastic reduc the cost of the car and even made them more attract . the growth of competit between the lead car manufactur like toyota , maruti , suzuki etc. also solidifi my point . statist show that , in some of the citi in india , for exampl hyderabad , chennai and delhi , the sale of latest car have increas by 25 % from the year 2004 to 2006 . the percentag increas in the number of car all over the countri ( india ) wa about 15 % from the year 2002 to 2005 ( the statist are from the best of my knowledg ) . the onli problem that come into our mind is the avail of power , which come in form of diesel or petrol . becaus of the unavail of oil , the cost of petrol and diesel have gone up drastic dure the past few year in india and thi might even hinder the peopl from buy automobil but mani research and develop divis of automobil industri all over the world are concentr on thi issu and they are tri to find altern mean in order to make the car run , like the use of cng cylind , which ha been now commertialis in new delhi and slowli is shift toward the southern part of the countri . research are also tri to find mean by which car can run on water , a recent team of 12 student from iit-delhi and dce locat in delhi have come up with an idea where a car run at 30kmph use water . peopl use car basic for a faster mean of transport and also to assur themselv of a comfort journey . most of the teenag are also nowaday start to learn how to ride a car , so that they can particip in drive whenev parent feel tire and thi even help them in develop new skill . henc with the advent of technolog advanc it can be said that the number of car would continu to increas and provid peopl with a cheaper , faster , comfort and an easier way of transport .
