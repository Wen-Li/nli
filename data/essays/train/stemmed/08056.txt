from my point of view have broad knowledg of mani academ subject might sound to mani peopl bore and at some point useless . whi would someon studi more when you can just special in one specif subject and be readi for the world in a shorter period of time ? i kind of disagre with the statement present . i believ that the more you know , the more you are prepar for life . have broad knowledg of mani academ subject might help you to develop yourself more as a person and as a profesion . when you special in one specif subject , you might be miss the chanc of learn more and be more complet . you limit yourself to not to go forward , not to learn more about thing that might interest you and to not be even more prepar at a profesion scale . i do not mean that special in one specif subject is the biggest mistak you could possibl ever make in your life , but i do think that we have a lot to learn and that we never stop learn . know more doe not harm anyon and may bring you piec of mind . it feel great when you realiz how much you know about some subject which at some point you found useless to know about befor , but when the time come you realiz how wrong you would have been if you would not have made the decis of amplifi your horizon and learn as much as you can learn . for exampl , learn anoth languag is a realli good thing to do . you never realli know when could you actual be need that second languag until you find yourself in the need of it . mani compani want that their employe could talk at least one or two more languag than the one which is their mother languag , but unfortun not everybodi is prepar . be prepar is about have the enough knowledg that could guid you through life .
