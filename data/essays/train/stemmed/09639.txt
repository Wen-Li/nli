i disagre with the statement that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , even though mani factor would suggest thi posit . even though for us the fact that car exist is the most normal thing , we should not forget that they have actual not been around for such a long time yet . peopl start use car in the earli twentieth centuri , less than one hundr year ago . but what did they drive befor car were invent ? hors carriag of cours . those have been use not for one hundr year , but for thousand of year ! so how could we possibl expect drive someth els than car in twenti year alreadi ? howev , mayb there will not be a new invent in twenti year , but peopl will just use their car less than they do now . perhap some sort of revolutionari mean of public transport will be creat in the near futur , which will make the use of a car unnecessari . anoth possibl is that oil price will rise incontrol due to a lack of resourc therefor caus peopl to think twice befor use their car or buy new car . scientist and research expect the access of crude oil to decreas rapidli in the come decad , caus peopl to come up with altern way of transport . some car produc tri to build vehicl that can use a differ sourc of energi than oil . so perhap there might be fewer car in twenti year due to a lack of resourc . howev , other scientist say that oil reserv constantli renew themselv , thu prevent their ceas . in my opinion thi theori sound somewhat more accur , caus me to reject the idea that the number of peopl use car will decreas so rapidli . anoth reason for me to support thi opinion is that peopl simpli need and like their car . some own car for fun , but for some they are extrem import . for exampl , my brother live in a suburban area of new jersey and ha to drive at least fifteen minut just to reach the next supermarket . thi situat is not uncommon in the unit state , where most peopl have live condit similar to those of my brother . in big famili , sometim even more than one car is need . perhap the parent both need their own car to get to work and the children one to get to school with . in a time when famili choos to live in suburban area more and more , a decreas in the number car use seem pretti utopian to me . some peopl also own car becaus they like drive them . a friend of mine live in a metropolitan area , which ha an excel mean of public transport , but nevertheless use hi car more often , becaus he enjoy drive . in conclus , the possibl of a shrink number of car in use certainli exist , but in my opinion car will stay popular and in use for a veri long time , unless someon invent someth complet new and better .
