i beliv that there will be more car in twenti year . what form my oppinion are differ point . the first is caus by the individ need for transport . thi mea that everi one of us want to reach a destin at everi time in the shortest possibl way . thi mean , probabl the car will not be like the car we have today , but there will alway be automobil for an individu journey form one place to anoth . a transport in a train or bu can never replac thi , just becaus a train or a bu need to be profit , so it need to transport as mani peopl at onc and thi lead us to a scedul for a depart . thi mean it is no more a leav a place at one time i wish and it will not bring me exactli to the place i wish . our need for a rest time more and more need that we work in a place far away from the place we work . i can say thi of my own , that i prefer to live in an littl town away from the citi where i work . it mean that when i come home to my littl town the world is not as busi and stress . thi daili journey lead me to a drive of some kilomet i am do everi day by car . my wife doe the same just in the other direct . so thi lead us to have two car and when i compar thi to my parent they just onli had one car , what wa enough for them . for us , compar to my parent is ha becom normal to work and live in differ citi . thi automat lead to more car in a famili . of cours we could use a train or a bu , but in my case it would be cheaper just about a fifth of the cost i pay for go by car and the other aspect , the far more import , is , that it would take me about half an hour more everi day , what mean that thi is an hour i can spend less with my famili . so all in all i beliv that it will be normal in twenti year that everi adult person will own a car just for the daili movement . it will be less and less that you work and live in the same citi . i hope i am wrong becaus my wife allway tell me how long or short the oil recourc will be availablz
