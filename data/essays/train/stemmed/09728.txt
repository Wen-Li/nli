gener speak , the purpos of an academ educ is twofold . firstli , it prepar student for the labor market in a particular area . sinc most student pursu career outsid academia , thi is not a trivial purpos . secondli , it should prepar student to conduct effect research appli the state of the art research methodolog . thu , both purpos of academ educ should be taken into account when discuss thi subject . in effect , a broader knowledg of mani subject will necessarili requir student to focu on the broader concept instead of the detail . on the other hand , studi subject more in depth will allow a student to absorb a significantli higher amount of detail , at the expens of knowledg outsid the area of special . it ha often been argu that such in-depth knowledg of a subject area and it detail is not benefici , becaus of a phenomenon colloqui call `` brain overflow '' . as we acquir new detail , we forget the detail we have learn in the past . howev , research ha shown that the brain is not a contain with a fix size that can onli contain a limit amount of knowledg . rather , the process of learn and rememb itself expand the capac of the brain . thu , there is no clear cut limit to the amount ani one person can learn and rememb . look at the labor market implic of thi issu , it is import to note that especi in knowledg base profession servic , the degre of specialis is increas . therefor , generalist tend to be in less demand than specialist that are abl to cover one subject area in depth . similarli , contrari to popular belief , it is still factual knowledg which allow peopl to put new inform in context . onli those who have a suffici amount of factual inform and a thorough understand of a subject will be abl to process new inform . on the other hand , most peopl would agre that while the exact limit of the brain 's capac might be unknown , there must be some limit to the number of data one can rememb . in earlier time intellectu like j.w. goeth had actual read all or almost all book publish in the three main languag at that time . thi is drastic differ today . sinc the knowledg in mani academ subject doubl everi ten year or so , it is imposs to keep up with thi pace by go into subject specif detail . scientist thu are condemn to becom generalist to some extent . it is also import to understand that it is the veri abil to learn that might be the most import result of an academ educ . acquir the abil to quickli identifi the most import question and then to absorb new knowledg is more import than accumul larg amount of `` dead data '' . it is not onli the knowledg that differenti graduat from non-gradu . it is also their abil to learn and process new knowledg faster . all thi would favor a more gener knowledg of mani subject . in addit to thi , on today 's labor market , most job requir constant adapt to new develop . the speed with which we are abl to adapt to new develop might therefor be more import than the mass of knowledg acquir in the past . i would therefor favor a stronger focu on gener knowledg of mani subject rather than an in depth focu on one subject .
