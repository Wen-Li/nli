although not perfectli , i agre with that statement , becaus it is obvious that young peopl , of cours includ me , do not help our comun . i think the biggest reason whi is that the connect with each other becam veri weak . 30 or 40 year ago , when my parent were in our age , there were veri strong connect with neighbor . sometim they took care of their neighbor 's babi , or made the dinner and share with neighbor . they often help each other , so it wa usual to help their comun . howev , now , there are mani apart hous , and mani peopl live in anoth citi which they did not grow up . then , the connect is becom weak and weak , and sometim we do not know who is the neighbor . if we do not know the peopl in our comun , probabl we do not have the feel to spend the time to help our comun . in addit that , we have few time to help our comun . we have school , part time job , work everi day . and also the most of us leav home eari in the morn and come back home late in the night . in such a lifestyl , we have no time to help other peopl . but , on the other hand , there are some young peopl to have enough time to help their comun . for exampl , the peopl from the famili who live the same comun sinch the gener of their parent or grandpar . such young peopl understand the comun , so they can help them easili if they have someth to do . in conclus , i agre with that statement , but not perfectli . as i mention abov , i know some peopl have enough time to help their comun even if they are veri busi . so , if they have the connect with their commun , they can help their comun and also , they would make the time to do that .
