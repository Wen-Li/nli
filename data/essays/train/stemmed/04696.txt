in the follow i will tri to discuss the statement and show exampl in addit to my argument . first of all , we got to make sure that advertis product is a veri import factor in today econom competit . the advertis ha to advertis the product , becaus in the competit of the market there will be a lot of similar product and much more that are alik . the better the product is advertis , the more peopl will buy it . the advertis ha to be as funni , as invent , as surpris , as basic as possibl depend on the target group . usual the advertis tri to focuss the peopl 's interest on the product . of cours the product is allway present in the best light and the weak are hidden , but the peopl now have the possibl to get inform on the product and in today media there are mani way . there are paper on allmost everi topic , from car to plant in your garden . the internet provid an amount of product test and mostli the product is just a better form of a former product , that should alreadi known . becaus of these possibl of inform oneself , i think it is not the fault of the advertis if someon is disappoint about a product . but sometim you get the feel that the produc ha spent more time on the advertis than on the product itself . onli at thi point , i think i can agre with the statement . but develop a bad product and onli focuss on the advertis will be discov soon by the user and affect the sale of the product badli . therefor i think it 's not in the interest of the compani to bring bad product on the market and cut there own skin . lastli , it is veri import to be awar that advertis is a necessari part of a product circl and in that context i can not agre with thi statement .
