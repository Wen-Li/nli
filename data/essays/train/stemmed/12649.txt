i do not agre with thi statement . i think it is better to special in one specif subject rather than have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . thi is becaus if a person ha a broad knowledg of mani academ subject and if he doe not special in ani of them then he would be a best exampl of `` jack of all trade but specialist of none . '' thi would definetli not prove use for him and for the societi as a whole . he will not be in a posit to contribut anyth , becaus he doe not know ani subject in-dept . if he just ha a broad view of mani subject , then in the later stage of hi life , that is after hi graduat , he would remain in a confus state of mind , and he will not be in a posit to settl on one particular field . i am say thi confident becaus i face a similar situat in my own life . when i wa in my colleg studi b-tech ( biotechnolog ) , i use to give equal import to all my subject . so after my graduat i wa in dilemma , and i wa final confus with my profess . i wa not abl to settl down on one particular subject . so i would suggest that it would be better that we choos one particular subject in which we are highli interest , and then put our soul and mind into it , to learn the subject thoroughli and perfectli . in thi way we will have a greater in-sight into the subject and we will be in a posit to contribut someth from our side for the better of the subject .
