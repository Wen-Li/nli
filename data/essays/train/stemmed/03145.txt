in our societi , educ is a main issu . on the one hand , peopl think that the educ should promot a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . on the other hand , peopl think that societi need more specialist . howev i believ that we should special in one specif subject . one reason for my belief is that we are all generalist . we have all a knowledg on everyth . thi knowledg is more or less accur , it depend on the person . for exampl , when i have an headach , i never go to the doctor , i onli take an aspirin . i have a whole knowledg on medicin care . anoth reason for my belief is that the societi need to increas it knowledg . specialist are the onli peopl who are abl to entertain to the develop of the societi . other copi what they have learn form the specialist . for instanc when i am ill i need the doctor , for hi advic . but after , when i have the same ill i just need to take the medicin drug . final , specialist are the actor of the develop of the societi . with their sharp knowledg in onli one field , they are the onli peopl who are at the border between what ha been discov and what ha not yet been discov , in thi field . to illustr a research in develop of a product for a firm . he ha no concret idea of what he will creat becaus there are noth similar uim societi . but he is sure that is new product had never exist befor . thi product repres a new thing to add in the human cultur . societi have a lot of generalist , but few specialist . becaus societi need more specialist and becaus i prefer to be use for the societi , i would rather to be a specialist .
