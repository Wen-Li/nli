i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . these day , mani young peopl are just play around and some of them are even be obstacl to other . in my countri , japan , the unemploy young peopl is be a seriou problem . they are the peopl who never goe outsid and work . they often get food suppli and hobbi good from their parent . these peopl are sure not help their commun , sinc they just spend most of the time play comput game . i have a friend that use to play a lot in childhood , but now that friend is stay in hi hous for all the day and do noth . that friend 's mother wa say that it would be great if he get out from hi room and start search for job , sinc the famili 's incom is not suffici . there is other case too . some young peopl in japan spend their time just run around their neighbourhood with their motorcycl , usual with a veri noisi sound of that motorcycl . they can be veri hostil and caus a lot of fight . by those fight , public properti could be destroy , or other peopl might get injur too . i got injur by those peopl last week . i wa just stand in the park , wait for my friend , and those peopl came say that the park is their place , so never enter . they punc me in face , and i wa badli injur . young peopl should be the one who help and develop their commun , but it is not yet achiev in my countri . i think those peopl who are be obstacl to other should stop harm other peopl or destroy public properti at first . then gradual , they can be help their commun and could make it better .
