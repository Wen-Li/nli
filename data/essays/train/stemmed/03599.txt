as far as iam concern , i agre thi statement . becaus understand idea and concept are the basic step to know more about fact . howev fact also have some import for student . follow are the reason to support my choic . firstli , understand idea give a basic step to think about the object . if you understand clearli then it easi to estim the qualiti and theori of that object . henc we need a extra concentr on understand idea and concept . mostli everi fact will have it own concept and idea . inaddit , if student concentr well on understad idea and concept they can easili recogn the fact . some research studi indic that student who have more concept will show highli recogn natur than other . for exampl will give mutch impot to understand idea and fact , i realli got sound knowledg in subject . also i can easili estim the fact in a subject . futhermor , lot of the student will give mutch import to concept , becaus if you learn concept it will take long time to forget . by show extra concentr on idea and fact lot of student were written well on exam . most of the lectur will also give import to concept becaus onc a student learn concept veri well than it easi to teach them . howev there is a need to understand fact , these are the conclus to most idea and concept . sever research say that if a student have capabl to recogn the fact than he is veri sound in perticular subject . as far as iam concern , idea and concept can play a major role in determinig fact . i can strongli support that idea and fact are more import to student than fact . lot of research are also say tha same . by base on abov reason and support point i can safe conclud that conceprt is more import than fact for student .
