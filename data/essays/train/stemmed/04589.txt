in my point of view , i beleiv that tour itself are for a purpos . in order to make them worth , guidanc is necessari . overrid reason for my beleiv is that , tour teach us more than the book . most of the tour are base either on learn someth , which is unknown or simpli an histor purpos . some place of interest may contain differ kind of monument and articl in the meusum 's that have last from our ancestor period . in such a visit , the tour guid help us understand the import of it . they make us deepli learn the fact of each of the articl that were preserv and tha reason behind it . moreov , the tour guid also creat an environ of fun and joy . in tour that are for an offici purpos , they help us in direct the best way to reach on time . later , they take us to the famou place in the citi like shop mall and multicuisin restaur etc . apart from all thi , tour of educ purpos like for instanc , studi on bird , tree etc , in forest they guid us about the safe and the unsaf locat , so that we can caution ourself while move around . final , i assum that by travel with a guid would help us a lot , becaus they spend their valuabl time for us . and not the least , travel in a group give lot of fun and entertain and
