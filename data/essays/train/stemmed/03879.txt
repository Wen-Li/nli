young peopl seem have everyth becous they are young and they have energi for do anyth , so it seem like older peopl have finish to enjoy their life along thier age . also , it sound that young peopl have much more ambiti than older peopl , in fact , it must be misunderstand . it can not say that young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl becous both age have advantag and disadvantag , also older peopl might enjoy life more than young peopl do . first , as i mentiond befor , an advantadg of young peopl is their age . they have a lot of time and long distanc for the end of their life . it is certainli the advantag of young peopl which older peopl do not have . howevv , young peopl do not have enough money even if they had time and ambiti for their plan for enjoy life . therefor , young peopl should not onli think about enjoy life with plan also need to work on their job for get money . second , although older peopl actual have less time than young peopl , it mean that old peopl have been work for get money . henc , they have enough money for enjoy their plan . they have almost same ambiti as young peopl have . besid , they have a great experi of enjoy life through their work life . there have not been onli interest experi , also some bad or miser experi . howev , it can be a part of enjoy their life as well . here is the biggest difer between young peopl and older peopl . so , i think that older peopl are enjoy much more than younger . in conclus , enjoy of life is relat to it age , and i disagre with the statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . '' . both young and older peopl have the advantag and disadvantag .
