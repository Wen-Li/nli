through an academ train , you usual get broad knowledg of variou topic . but you can also decid to special on a subject that you may be keen on studi . to my mind , i think it 's better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to have a special . you can have an overview of mani topic and have a generalist train . also , you do n't get bore by such a divers of subject . firstli , have broad knowledg give the opportun to learn thing about an unkown subject . for exampl , i studi for one year in grenobl ecol de manag . thi first year wa veri generalist and i could learn the basic principl of mani subject . i studi account , financ , market . i reckon that a futur manag must have a knowledg on each of these subject and master them . it ' a condit if he want to succeed . thu , i believ have broad knowledg is an opportun to learn more thing . abov all thi diversifi knowledg will be use in the futur life . secondli , i think that if you studi onli one specif subject , you can get bore and becam fed up with it . inde , have a special mean studi the same subject for long hour in the same day or week . even if it can be a subject you find realli attract and interest , the fact to focu on it can have neg effect . the interest can decreas so as the attent paid to the subject . after long hour spend on the same issu , you enjoy tackl anoth subject and consequ anoth interest aris . thu , in my opinion i think have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is more benefici . it allow to have a generalist train and to get the basic principl on subject , use for daili life . moreov , with such a divers you are more involv in each subject and do n't get bore with the train .
