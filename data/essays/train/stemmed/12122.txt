i do n't agre with the idea that there will be fewer car in twenti year . first reason is that car are current most conveni transport with high technolog . it is conveni becaus we do not have to wait to drive a car without worri about the weather and can easili get to the point where we would like to go unlik commerci train or bu . the technolog is still develop which make car run more fast and safe , provid user the confort room insid the car . onc peopl gain the conveni , we will not be abl to go back to inconveni world . second reason is that there will be more car that are good for environ . mani car compani have been develovep their technolog and skill , and contribut to the environ . the price is yet high , but they were abl to produc electon car . therefor , the car will meet peopl 's desir that technolog will eventu go with it .
