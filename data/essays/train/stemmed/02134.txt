now aday , technolog play main role in our life , as it facilit commun through out the whole world . some of the aspect of these technolog may now be consid normal , but few year ago it would have been thought of as magic ; two or three centuri ago car would have been though of as merical and not common as these day . i guess that we have to consid thi rapid chang in technolog , befor judg the next twenti year . i think that in the next few year ; man will discov a better and less dangour way to transport ; he will notic how pollut these car are , and that they alreadi have damag most of the earth 's atmospher , then he will invent someth new that will replac the car exist in our street , and i imagin that the main issu of the era will be how to save the earth from the damag that happen through the last centuri . he will also find faster mean , that he will find it to be more convini than car , and thi is expect as car will not be enough to suppli hi need in fast transport . some peopl might consid the whole issu as imaginari subbject and that it imposs to make such a chang in few year , but let look at car histori . car were invent and becam in use in less than ten year ; lot of compani were race to produc it in sever shape and with distincit facilit . as exampl ford compani wa convinc with the idea , that car can replac all the exist method of transport , and have a primari role in the market , so they made great product that the owner wa said to be mad , but it came up that he wa right , and the whole product wa sold and the compnay becam a major one . look through out the histori will make us see it clear that no technolog , no matter how larg or common , will last , so i guess that thi is an enough reason to think that car will disappear in the next twenti year .
