i disagre with what the statement say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i have three differ point of view between travel in a group and travel individu . first , if you travel in a group led by a tour guid , of cours you do n't have to plan for anyth becaus tour guid know everyth what to do or where to go . it save you time and you do n't have to get stress from plan for trip . howev , when i go somewher i do n't know veri much , i 'd like to research first and studi about the place i will go and the languag they speak there . in thi process , i will decid where to go and what i want to see dure my own research . also if you studi the languag of the countri you will go , you do n't have to reli on one tour guid to buy someth or to order food . while you are plan for trip , you alreadi earn so mani thing and experi . second , if you are with the group , you have no choic for what to eat . you have to eat certain food the tour guid alreadi set up for the group . when you travel , you want to eat the tradit food from local restaur previou travel recommend . i am sure tour guid will take you to some nice place to eat , but you have no choic eat someth els . even for the food , i want to research what is the most popular food in that countri and i will figur whether i can eat thi food or not . if not , of cours i will look for anoth place to go . for the last , travel is all about the experi the new thing from new world at least i think . i do n't want to have a same experi what other peopl have . with group tour , you have to go same place and take a pictur from certain place like other . whole group will have same memori from the trip . i want to build my own memori from expereinc the new world .
