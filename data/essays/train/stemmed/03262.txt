accord to the statement it is difficult to decid it is rue or not . for my opinion there are student who spend most of their time in commun and on the other hand it give peopl who did not spend ani time for help them . first i disuss the posit thing to help commun . for exampl you are in a group of mani peopl you have to listen to them and answer , you can talk about differ topic . that is import for your futur life , becaus in the job you need to talk in a group or highlight your person . in the carrer life it is import for te boss that he know someth from you . anoth thing is that help our commun is a social aspect . a veri good exampl is in our famili . when we help for exampl our mother in the kitchen , she can help us in other thing may be on do our homework . when we do other thing for somebodi mostli we get an good advic back . that help us also in our later life . but on the other hand there are lot of peopl in our societi that have no time and no attent of our commun . may be they work too long and than they can not meet an commun . or some peopl mostli the younger one did not help them becaus they think that is too bore . i think when they read the statement they think onli about old peopl to help them . but more and more younger one join in a group to talk togeth about differ problem or thing . in my opinion i think that are too mani peopl have less time to join and help peopl . but it is for their own help and for their own life . when they tri it i think they are find the thing good . final it is good in our societi that it give peopl whe ; like thi and other one .
