i disagre with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . in thi essay i will state the reason whi i am against thi idea . more often than not , peopl choos to travel in a goup led by a tour guid becaus they are either not familiar with the place where they are trvael or not familiar with the langauag . therefor , they are afraid of have troubl and have no way to ask for help . with the advanc technolog , it can not be easier to find inform about the place you plan to visit . you can book air ticket and hotel and rent car onlin . you can download map of the citi you are visit and carri them with you so that you are less like to get lost . as for the languag problem , with more and more peopl travel around the world , local peopl more or less learn to speak sever languag relat to their main sourc of tourism . moreov , how much languag will be requir to travel a place ? not much , i think . when you are do sightse , you do not talk . when you are shop , you just need to know the price and you just simpli look at price tag . when you are order food , you just need to know what is on the menu . even though you can not read , there are alway pictur . i prefer to travel with friend without a tour guid . i enjoy more freedom by do so . there is no tight schedul to meet . plan are alway flexibl . most import of all , i am not alway in a rush . i can stay in a place as long as i wish . by travel alon or with friend , i have more opportun to experi local cultur and to observ the way local peopl live . i am not in a hurri to run from thi place to anoth . when i find someth interest , i can stay longer to find out more . thi in turn contribut more to my memori than just storm from place to place take pictur . to sum up , travel by oneself not with a group benefit travel more . even though there might be more prepar work to do befor set out , you learn and gain more after come back from the trip . in my point of view , peopl learn to be independ by travel alon to a foreign countri . take myself as an exampl , i alway travel alon and i find myself grow up a bit after everi trip .
