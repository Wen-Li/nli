there are some peopl think that understand idea and concept are improt , you can use the idea of concept to relat the other thing , but i disagre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in my opinion , to learn fact are more import in our life . first of all , learn fact can make better dicis in our life . sometim , idea or concept are just keypoint , we can gain some inform from them , but we can not make good dicis becaus of them . for exampl , when we decid to choos a career , we should defint know what it is , what you will do . if you just know the concept , you may be confus , you can not seper what is econom , what is financ , what is account . therefor , learn fact are more import and more use in our life . in addit , learn fact can make us get high grade in the school . as our experi , we are usual confus about detail question in the test , sometim we can not seper the simlilar concept , thi is becus we just undetstand idea and concept , we do not actual understand fact . in the studi , if we can go futher after we studi concept , i think we can get high grade and more easili finish the test . in our life , sometim we alway just undertand idea and concept of the thing , we easili think it is enough , but in some case , becus of our poor knowledg , we will feel bad and we will lose some chanc , so if we have time , we should learn someth deepli , at that time , you ture get that thing .
