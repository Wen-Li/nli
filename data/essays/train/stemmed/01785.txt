i agre with the view that in futur there will be fewer car than there are now . on the one hand , the car are one of the most conveni mode of transport and also the most popular one . on the other hand , the factor such as growth in popul , scarciti of land and concentr of popul in the urban center indic toward a futur situat where we might actual see a reduct of car in futur . in the final analysi , there are more and stronger indic for decreas in the number of car in futur . first , due to the rise popul and overcrowd in the citi , it ha becom extrem difficult to travel in car as there are frequent traffic jam and lack of park space . the other mode of transport such as buse and train are more conveni and faster . further , sinc most of the car are own by peopl in citi the number of car will deceras due to the abov factor in the come time . second , the problem of pollut and overcrowd in the citi due to the increas in the number of car have forc govern in countri like singapor impos high tax on purchas of vehicl . they have also impos toll charg for enter in the main citi area . thu , the govern regul can also discourag peopl from purchas more car and thi will contribut to an overal reduct of car in futur . third , the probelm of the scarciti of non-renew fuel is push up the fuel price everyday , make it more and more difficult to travel in car . it ha alreadi led to the increas in popular of the cheaper public transport , thi ha been the case with train in mumbai ( india ) , where mani peopl who use to travel in car have shift to travel in train and for these peopl new air condit train have also been start . final , the develop of the altern mean of transport like improv buse servic , better network of train , etc can again lead to a reduct in the number of car purchas by peopl and contribut to a reduct of the total number of car in time to come . thu , for the reason given abov i believ that in futur car will be fewer in number than they are now .
