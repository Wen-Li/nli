i complet disagre with the wiew that young peopl do not spend enough time help their communiy . in fact i believ that the most activ member of commun are young peopl . commun need are vari , and not are not just limit to help out elderli peopl , or servic in hospit , or other typic welfar duti . nonetheless mani of the young peopl i know spend much of their spare time volunt on ambul , or perform play and music for elderli , thu contribut significantli to the total amount of time spent by the communti in gener on these task , and often be the promot of such activ . on top of thi i am firmli convinc that commun need space and occas on which to gather , in order to strenghten their mutual tie , to get to know each other better , thu exchang cultur and knowledg . it is my experi that young peopl are the best and the more commit to organ such event . in fact mani of the art display in my commun are organ , and kept run by peopl in their twenti ; and often the work display are also made by young peopl . thi show that young peopl are help to their commun in two differ way : they both organ cultur event and are the main cultur point of refer and innov in the commun . i also know a lot of youngster involv in polit , both trhough polit parti and polit associ . i have been in a polit associ for mani year too . in the meet that were frequent held , import topic regard our citi and provinc were usual discuss and debat , and often innov and revolutionari idea were develop , some of which were later success implement by the local author . moreov an advanc in polit and social belief will not be possibl without the fundament partecip of young peopl to public life . it is my opinion that thi misconcept of young peopl not help their commun is mainli spread by old conserv , who fear what new the young gener can bring , and alway have their head turn back , rememb how life wa much better when they were young .
