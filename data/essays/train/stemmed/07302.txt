i disagre with the statement . i think it is more import to focu o one specif subject which you are interest in and make it to your major skill . you have to be the best on the subject you chose to gain success . there are some exampl to prove that one good specif subject is much help than broad knowledg of mani acadam subject . i have two uncl . one wa veri good at busi and anoth wa just normal good at all the subject . later on , an uncl who wa veri good at busi chose hi major skill to busi and studi deepli in busi . final , he graduat veri good busi univers and got a good posit in a compani . on the other hand , an uncl who wa adequ good at all the subject could n't make good choic to decid hi major skill . he major english but hi english wa not as good as those peopl who focus on onli english . therefor , he is now just a normal teacher in an english acadami . as a result , the uncl who wa good at onli one specif subject seem to have better life in the futur . anoth exampl is about a famou soccer player call ronaldo who is the best soccer player . ronaldo is onli good at soccer . he is n't good at math , busi and other thing . he onli practic soccer from when he wa young . as he tri to do best on hi job and focus on onli soccer , he final becam best of it . sinc he becam best of well known sport , he got wealth and fame at the same time . if he tri to do other sport also , he sure wo n't be in the posit he have in present time . as a result , to be a best on the subject you chose is veri import . peopl will alway look for the person who is best at their subject becaus they are sure the person is good at the subject . when you becom the best at a certain subject , you will gain wealth and fame at the same time as ronaldo did . therefor , tri to find someth that interest you and do your best to make it your major .
