advertis is nowaday everywher , and tri to make us buy everi sort of product with alway new way . lot of peopl think that they are manipul by advertis compani and that in advertis the most import thing is to make the product seem much better that they realli are . we can firstli think that as they use way of persuas that we understand we can alway have our opinion . it 's a problem with chidren and advertis , but adult may be abl to have their own opinion . even if the advertis tell us that is the best product of the world , we must be abl to think about it and tri to have our own opinion . advertis are not oblig us , they give us the choic but tri to convinc us . in a veri differ way , we can think that their advertis is not just argument . they often use what we like , our dream and problem to make us think that we have a real need of thi product . for exempl they often use our problem to sell us product , they give to a fat woman a solut that she can refus , as she doe n't like herself , so as to becom thin like model in advertis . in front of children , if an advertis say that hi super hero eat thi sort of ice-cream , he will tell to hi mother that eat thi sort of ice-cream can make him be happi . we have to think about what it can be and if we realli need thi but it may be difficult in some situat where advertis repres all we want to have or be . in my opinion advertis is a veri complex market strategi , but it can not make the product seem much better than it realli is . it just make the product be as we want it to be . product are creat accord to our need but we have to choos and be critic about advertis . i think that parent have to understand that children do n't understand advertis like an adult , and adult have to alway think about what he realli need , what he realli can buy and what is realli new in the product . if they do n't lie in advertis it is possibl to buy just what we realli want .
