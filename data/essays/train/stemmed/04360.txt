for student to becom success in the futur when they graduat from school and pursu their career in differ field , i beleiv understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . the fact relat to histori and polit tell us what happen in the past and we can use those fact to compar the new situat to those that happen in the in the past . similarli the scientif fact such as quantum theori help scientist build up their work base on these fact . howev , be abl to use idea and concept are much more import when we face new situat . especi in today 's competit environ , we need to make decis that will help us becom success in tough busi area . most of the time our abil to make judgement for a situat come from our knowledg about differ idea and concept . learn these thing in school will give us the tool we need to use in the busi world when we graduat . the fact wo n't help us much when we face a situat where we need to make a decis . we need to understand what consequ may occur as a result of our decis and how our decis will affect the futur . to be abl to understand thi we need to be abl to have analyt skill so that we have a good decis make process . i believ that thi is accomplish onli by understand idea and concept . in my home countri , the educ system is base mostli on fact not on concept . we learn the fact with detail in colleg but i do not think thi prepar young individu to use their judgement in the busi environ where decis make play an import role . especi in today 's competit environ i beleiv that make the student readi for busi life is much more import than just teach them the fact .
