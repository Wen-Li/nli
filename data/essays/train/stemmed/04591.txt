there are mani reason that make me think that the number of car would be reduc in twenti year , for exampl the improv in the public transport , the increas of the comun like telephon and internet that could reduc the util of a car becaus we could work from home , the increas in the contamin and therefor the polici of the gover , and also the increas of the price of petrol and ga . but i do not think that there will be fewer car than today . dure the last fifteen year we have seen a big improv in public transport but it ha not reduc the number of car , as everybodi can see there is more traffic , more car per hous , so the experi say that better public transport doe not mean less car , at least until now . obvious the price of the petrol and ga will be a problem , but sinc mani year ago there ha been research for new kind of sourc . now we have not discov ani better sourc than petrol , but is more than possibl that we can find solut in electr and nuclear field than can satisfi our need , and with a good price . other reason that make me think that the number of car will not decreas but increas is our style of life . in a rich countri like ireland we can see how is import the appear , and in thi countri where the road are not good , you can see big and expens car and peopl do not need them , whi they have it ? onli becaus when you have a big car , peopl respect you more becaus you look more import . anoth reason is the independ that i have with a car . i can go wherev i want for my own , and thi point is veri import for me and i think that for everybodi , and is someth that the public transport can not give us .
