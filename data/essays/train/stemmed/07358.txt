the issu state by the topic is whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to be special in one specif subject . i beliv that rather than have broad knowledg about mani of our academ subject it is more better to have more knowledg about the one we special in . i would prefer thi becaus have a littl knowledg on mani academ subject doesnt lead to success in our life . so it is better to special in one major subject . i will prefer to special in one subject rather than have broad knowledg of mani academ becaus of the follow reason . the reason will be that now - a - day most of the compani offer the job to the student who are more specailz accord to the requir of the compani ie. , compani are more intrest in the student who are `` special '' . anoth reason which drag me to prefer to be special in one specif subject is that when we are tri to have broad knowledg about all the academ subject we cant abl to learn the basic in detail ie. , we are not abl get the overal inforamt about the all the subject which turn to be useless of lear all those . a famou english professor made a quot relat to the abov topic which say that `` we should n't be jack of all and master of none '' . thi quot convey that we are use to learn all the subject in our academ year but master of none of these subject . mani famou scientist like newton , thoma alv edison doesnt had a much broader knowledg but in fact they are special in thier own subject which made them famou through out thi world . ultim , i feel that it would be better to be special in one subject rather than have knowledg about all the academ subject .
