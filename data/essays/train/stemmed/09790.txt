gener speak , young peopl are the most import role-play in ani commun ; as they are abl to give more . in my opinion , young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . for exampl , what a young man care about these day is where to find the newest and coolest video game , where he can download the latest mp3 and album , or where to get a parti held for fun . .. and the list never end ! young peopl in the middl age , unlik nowaday , had more pasion to work . for instanc , they use to work in farm so they earn their live which enabl them to get what they want and live their live . while young depend on their parent in everyth nowaday , young peopl had been respons befor . for exampl , young use to get marri when they were at the begin of their teen age . but on the other hand , by look in the record of what young provid to their commun nowaday , we just find few good exampl . some young peopl particip in humanitarian organ , which were veri import mean to help poor peopl around the world surviv and live . other exampl might be young scientist . have n't you heard about the 13 year old scientist who came up with a new method of calcul ? ye it true ! the method is now be taught in cambridg univers and mani professor admit that it is veri effeci . all what wa mention abov lead us to a point , which clearli show that young peopl are a treasur , and they are a double-edg weapon . commun ( parent in the first place ) should guid their kid and teach them to be give , not onli take , as no one can deni the fact that say `` the more you give , the more you get !
