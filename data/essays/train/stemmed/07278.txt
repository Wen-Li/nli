the question be ask is that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid is good or bad . thi topic is veri interest becaus i like travel veri much . in my opinion , it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guid and i am agre with thi topic . the first reason , whi i prefer thi is becaus if you are travel in a group along with the the tour guid , you are veri much in secur hand . i think thi becaus in a group , there are lot of peopl around you . they are alway there to take care of one anoth . but , when you are travel alon , it might be hard for someon . anoth reason is that you get more knowledg about the specif place . tour guid is there to explain the histori of some specif place that are import for the sight see point of view . other group member are there to give their idea about the place . the reason is that , which is veri import in my point of view is you enjoy veri much in group rather than individu . for exampl . if you are go for the long tour in group for like 1-2 month , that group becom like a famili and you have not to worri for the unusu situat . the tour guid explain everyth so well that you can get more inform about thet particular thing . when you are travel along , sometim you miss veri import place to visit especi when you are go to new place . in the conclus , i think i am correct in choos that topic .
