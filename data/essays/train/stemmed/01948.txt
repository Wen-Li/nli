i am now 23 year old and if you notic i am from an economi that ha held itself even after the nation fabric threaten to break down everi second day . someth or the other just keep happen in thi nation of million . what ha given birth to thi never say die attitud ? the normal conclus will be that it the new gener that hold in it hand the reign of a power and maject nation . the pertin answer to that will be ye the youngster are respons for it commun . i total disagre to the statement ` that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun ' . i am of the same genr that we talk about here . i would ask how have i not serv my commun ? i have taught in blind school that exist just beyond my colleg , who had forc me to do it ? , nobodi . the reason whi i did it is the fact that i think i am respons to keep everybodi priveledg or underpriveledg at the same level . infact i felt that thi is the least i could do to help those who are less fortun than me . as a rule i do n't believ in give alm , i feel strongli against the notion that ani abl bodi person should beg and not work . that is what i do , i work , i contribut to the economi , i work , i pay my tax on time , i have the will to see that my abil are use to the fullest so that i grow , in turn my agenc grow and that will in turn make my economi grow . if somebodi feel that i stiil have not contribut enough to my commun then i must add that my commun hold adult and children . i love and respect both . not onli do i spend time with them , i stimul other to spend time with them too . as an onset i would finish with the statement that i do contribut to my commun and i am still count amongst ` young peopl ' . i will continu do thi becaus i do n't have a point to prove but the fact that my conscienc ask thi out me and thi is the minimum i can do to make peopl who matter to me more special .
