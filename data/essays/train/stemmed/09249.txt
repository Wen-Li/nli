in my opinion it is better to have broad knowledg of mani subject . i believ thi , becaus with a broad knowledg it is easier to work in a team and you are abl to fulfil mani differ task . when work in a team , you have to commun with your team member and understand what they are talk about . becaus a team doe not consist of peopl who are all special in the same specif subject , it is necessari to be abl to talk to all of them about their problem . but to understand and solv these problem you have to have knowledg of other academ subject . for exampl a team in a compani work on the develop of a new product . thi team will at least consist of one person who figur out , how to sell the new product best and anoth one will do the technic part and invent new technic . but if the first one doe not understand what is possibl to produc , hi idea wo n't be possibl to build . the other one doe not understand how the product ha to be build to be sold veri good . hi new technic may be excel , but they wo n't be abl to sell to the consum . becaus of thi , the team will not be abl to achiev good result , becaus everyon doe onli have knowledg of one specif subject . the second import reason is , that you wo n't work on task in one specif subject all the time . when a task is finish there might not be anoth one in the same area avail so you have to do someth differ . after finish a physic research , instead of do the next research project , you might have to explain the result to other peopl and help them to implement your result into new product . both situat show , that a broad knowledg of more than one specif subject is veri import when it come to team work or chang respons .
