help commun is a great thing to do and there are mani peopl involv in thi `` job '' with the aim of substain and help as much as they can . usual thi help come from the curch and from the chariti associ as a volunt ' occup and it 's veri use and gratefi . but if we look with more accur we can see that the peopl that work there , are usual middl age - old peopl that thing that spend more time there is better than wate time . so it 's true that the young peopl do n't do enough for their communieti . instead of stay hour in front of the comput wait for someth more interest they should go out and do someth use and import for their communiet . it is n't an hard work . for exampl , it mean go to the church 's playfield and help the mother to control their children , help an old woman to buy her dinner at the supermarket or help an old man to take hi dog out . frankli it 's noth so difficult to do . person i think that work in chariti shop or help peopl in difficult it 's more gratefi than how they think . these stuation should help them to be more sensit in front of these peopl but especi to understand the import of their occup . thi way a young boy/girl is go to face the real problem and the real situat that could happen dure their live . and i think that there is noth better to be prepar about what could happen in the futur .
