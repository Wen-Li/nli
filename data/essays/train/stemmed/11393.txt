our educ system is alway be critic becaus of it non-analyt educ . for exampl student learn someth without even ask question about the fact and the idea of it . they just learn . howev , it 's import for student to understand idea and concept than learn fact . at first , i will tri to summar the advantag and the essenti part of understand idea . idea and concept are the first step of creation . give the idea of an event or a problem forc the student to think aboout it . as a result , the student not onli ask question about the event , but also take it further by tri to make an explan to the caus of the event . thi is what is call analyt reflect . for instanc , we can talk about the exam in turkey befor graduat from colleg . we studi for 2 year or more without understand the main idea . consequ our futur depend on one singl test . on the other hand , learn fact is also import but not as import than understand the essenti . if a student is onli learn fact , he ca n't get ani further than provid simpl relat between event or compar them . he just ca n't figur out whi . but a student wh understood the concept can ask question , `` whi ? , who ? , what ? , where ? '' . he can eventu answer them too . we can see thi as an escalad . the idea help us to get to the top , while the fact help us to see two step beyond . in conclus , both system are import . they help make progress to the student ' view of aspect . howev for me , understand the idea and concept are more import . they provid an analyt reflect .
