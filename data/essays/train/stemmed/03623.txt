i disagre with thoos who think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , becaus it is a cheap way to travel , car is veri comfort and with the car you can reach almost of all place in the world . first of all i think that travlel with car is cheaper than other way of travel like plane , train or boat . the reason is that if you want to travel with your car you have to spend money onli for the oil and for the highway . consequ the money that you will spend is lesser than the money that you will spend for a ticket for a boat or a plane or a train in thi way for exampl you can save some money for the journey or for other thing . second , in my opinion , travel with your car is more comfort that travel with other travel way , becaus modern car have all option like satellit navig , that is a modern devic that allow you to not lost yourself in citi or countri that you do n't know , comfort seat , comput on board and mani other . furthermor car is comfort becaus you can leav home and arriv to the place decid whenev you want . consequ you do n't have to wait in a station becaus of train or plane delay , for which you will arriv late for exampl to a date . third , i think , that with the car you can reach all locat around the world and you will have the liberti to choos to way that you prefer to reach it without ani limit . in conclus i think that for the reason that car is a cheap transport way that is comfort and use to reach almost of all place in world , the car will not be fewer in twenti year than today .
