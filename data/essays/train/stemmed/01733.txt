in the long run , understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact becasu understand main concept let student to adapt constant understand about new fact in the long period time , and becaus student can approach to the factor more intuit and effect . fisrt , understand concept will help the student adapt the new factor in the long run . for exampl , major busi principl learnd in school and inform from pop-bussi book ha differ valu . the principl may not be easi to use in the real word , but they are proven to be valuabl in the long preriod while pop-busi book usuali hit in veri shor time period . one of the papular movement call ` six sigma ' wa thought to be a perfact solut of the futur market , but it becam a caus of less inov of compani becaus it base on a particular fact in the short time period and ignor lot of key concept in busi principl . second , understand concept first will be more effect to understand fact . if a group of busi student are given lot of raw data such as new paper and statist without learn basic concept , then they will not be abl to understand what the data actual mean and their misunderstand can be greater . thi type of learn will be a lot slower than understand main concept first . in conclut , i believ that understand concept first is better in the long run , becaus it will let student adapt to variou problem , and the student will be abl to learn more effect in the limit time .
