i do believ that it is not about agre or disagre . i do believ that it depend on the peopl themselv . there are two kind of peopl and let us listen to there opinion . first group say that it is a good idea to be led by a tour guid . they say that the guid know better than us and he is capabl to answer all kind of question that we have ; therefor , we will be abl to know everyth about the thing that we are visit . second group say that it is a bad idea becaus we have to consid the time factor . for exampl , if we like somth and we want to spend more time on it we would n't be abl to do it becuas we are not alon . beign without a guid will give us the opporton and the flixibl to do what we want whenev we want . both of the group agre that be with a tour would give them more inform about the thing that they are visit . again it depend on the peopl . if you ask me which you did , i would go with one . i do n't like to be rush and i do n't like to be tie . be free is a good thing special when when i am visit new site .
