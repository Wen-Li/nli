i like listen to my father 's stori about hi friend . he ha own compani and succeed , but i think hi person is kind of strang , in other word , he is an adventour person . he like to go differ place and buy new thing . i thought he is a just rich person and wast hi money for fun ; howev , my thought wa wrong . he is experienc new thing and plan what is next hi project . from my experi , i believ that success peopl tri new thing and take risk . tri new thing give new idea while they are do . if peopl don not tri new thing , they can not have creativ or interst idea . i think that from sever experi we can extend our knowledeg and perspect wildli . success peopl go to a lot of differ place and experinc ; therefor , they can inspir new idea . take risk might be big dameg , but from risk , peopl can learn what is a problem or weak . somethim peopl need to fail from someth becaus they can notic what is it wrong , but if they keep their rotuin and not tri anyth , they even can not see new solut or idea . for exampl , reserch cost a larg amount of money , especi abroad , but thi can be big asset after they success . so , peopl should not to afraid so much to take risk . success peopl have interest person . if peopl are do the same thing , their brain would be hard and can not see other possibl like stubborn . in conclus , i think that when peopl are success , they are interest and intellig peopl becaus of their challeng : tri new thing , not be afraid of take risk . so , i think that thier careea reflect their person like enjoy and rich person .
