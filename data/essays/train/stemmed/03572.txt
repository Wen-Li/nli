i agre that success peopl tend to have the attitud of tri new thing and take on risk , becaus i believ thi is essenti what defin success peopl from ordinari peopl . more specif , i agre becaus of the follow reason : first , success peopl take risk becaus they know that risk take differenti themselv from the rest of the herd . they realiz that peopl are natur risk-avers and tend to continu what they are do . success peopl take risk , not onli becaus thi veri action differenti themselv , but also becaus they know that there will be a learn experi offer through their risk take . they know that even with failur , so long as they maintain the will and the energi to continu , they can come back stronger with the experi they will gain . second , success peopl work on improv their weak . whether it be a profession major leagu basebal player or a ceo of a mutli-billion compani , success peopl tri new thing to improv their perform . they break their statu quo and leap to the next level , becaus they can identifi what they are good at and what they are not , and therebi work on the weak area with a new approach . third , success peopl tri new thing becaus they are curiou and eager to learn . they also know that there are a ton of thing they do n't know out there in the world . further , their curios lead to the synergi of their knowledg base . for exampl , an engieer may better address hi current issu in the long-term , if he gain more knowledg about busi and other driver that may be caus hi problem . in summari , i believ that success peopl are will to take risk and are eager to tri new thing becaus of their natur characterst of self-improv and from the knowledg of the benefit of such action .
