with the develop of the human societi , the amount of knowledg explos . knowledg is power , but i do n't think one singl person could handl too much of the power . i think that one should special in one specif subject , rather than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . it is not necessari to have broad knowledg . in the lifetim , it will be veri veri lucki do have one great contribut to a specif subject . mani peopl are rememb by us just becaus they did a veri good job in their specif subject . for exampl , nash , who major in mathemat . he master noth but to calcul in paper and think about hi math problem . even wors , he got nearli mad for 20 year of hi life dure which he could not work as a normal person . but he is well-known and rememb by us just for hi contribut to the math . besid , human 's energi and time is limit . one can not spend hi or her time on too mani field , especi when he or she live at today the time the amount of knowledg explos . in contrari , if somebodi tri to studi extreamli well in mani field , he will feel exaust but still can not handl them . moreov , to studi in mani subject may lead to a veri bad result that he can not studi well in ani of the subject . howev , i must confess that it is good the have broad knowledg if you could . knowledg in one field sometim affect that in anoth field . there are inde some peopl succeed in mani academ subject . the question is they are the minor and it is not realist to expect mani peopl could be like them . so i think it is better , and what 's more , more realist to special in one subject .
