the statement is ambig and could have more then one interpret . what i do beliv is that both of the tecnniqu for learn are necessay for student to acquir enough knowledg in the field they are studi . a gener way of studi is the basi for good learn skill . the understand of idea and concept is import for the student becaus not onli it give them the opportun to be interest in what they are studi and to learn more and more profound inform on the topic , but it also allow the student to open hi mind to new idea and therefor have hi own opinion on the topic he is studi . thi is import for the lern process becaus it give more profound knowledg to the student and prepar him for debat and essay which might ask for hi opinion or might ask him to sustain theori previous studi . on the other hand allow the student to learn the fact is obvious necessari to achiev the understand of the materi studi . thi is becaus without the basic fact of the topic the student might not be abl to draw conjectur on the topic and might lack sever knowledg that would result import then in give hi own opinion , give lectur and debat . for exampl a student that ha to give a present infront of the class and ha not onli to show hi fellow student what he learn from the variou lesson but even how he use the knowledg he own to formult hi own hypothesi need to know all the basic fact on the topic or hi present might result full of conceptu hole and lack import concept that in the end would impair the student to construct hi own opinion and to give a thorough present . in conclus it can be said that the statement is right in the sens that understand idea is veri import but is wrong in the sens that to achiev the understand of sever topic it ca n't lack the basic fact and materi or the understand will be imposs for ani student .
