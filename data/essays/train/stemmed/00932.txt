the traffic , the huge amount of car in the way or street and the problem of road travel is be discuss for mani year . it is want to be solv and to solv thi mani solut are develop . i do n't think thi problem will be solv in twneti year and i do n't think there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are two reason whi i think like thi . first reason i think the manufactur never stop . i mean the manufactur of the vehicl such as car buse which carri peopl one place to anoth and occupi the road . the firm produc mani mani vehicl everi year and there is an absenc of the rule about the older car . furthermor , older car can be the main problem about traffic . the newer one fill the road everi year , everi month and even everi day . in contrast , the solut is be thought that underway , undersea travel , metro , railway and sea travel may be consid to reduc the traffic jam and so do the number of car in use . but i do n't think it is enough . secondli , peopl usual choos their own vehicl to travel beacus of mani reason , for exampl they may want more comfort travel by their own vehicl and moreov it may be cheaper than the other . besid , the train , for instanc , carri mani mani passang in a day , howev these mani peopl can disturb each other when they are in the train . therefor , there may be littl decreas in the number of the car . to sum up , there are two reaon i mention abov that it ca n't be possibl that there will be fewer car in use in twenti year with today technolog . besid , the firm have to produc more and more car to exist and the peopl will alway like comfort and their own car . on the contrari ; may be fli car can chang my mind if it is possibl to manufactur .
