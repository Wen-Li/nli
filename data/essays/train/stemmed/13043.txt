i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . though i think that the choic should be made depend on each person 's individaul personanl and prefer , there are more disadvantag of tavel in a group than travel alon . for one thing , i believ that some peopl do not like be in a group . for those peopl . travel in agroup will be veri uncomfort . i have mani friend who do not want to be in a group . they may need more free time to relax and medit by themselv . second , travel group peopl can not decid where to go or what to eat on their own . they should cooper with other member and somtim they should give up their choic for the schedul of group . i have an exampl from my own person experi . i wa travel in itali in a group with a guid . the guid ask which restaur peopl want to enter for lunch . malor of peopl want to have italian pizza while i want to have stake . i should have to give up stake becuas i wa the onli person who want it . if i had travel alon , thi kind of thing would never have happend . third , move in group can not as fast and effici as move alon . for exampl , peopl should wait until all the member get togeth and it is not easi to find space for mani peopl in restaur or theater . one of friend told me her terribl experienc of travel . when she traveld china in a group , one of the member wa lost in the great wall and all the other peopl wast time find the person and they gave up rest of schedul . but i also admit that travel in a group led by guid have some advantag . for exampl , i do not have to studi how to travel or what to prepar becaus the guid will do it for me . i do not have to worri what if i am lost , either . but more research on the travel countri will give me more sens of achiev after finish travel . travel in a group led by a tour guid involv a lot of disadvantag , less free time , less option to chose and less effici of movement . though it can be more conveni to be led by a guid , one should sacrific those thing for conveni . lastli , i believ that complet travel by oneself will give him or her more sens of achiev with more exposur to the countri they travel . so , i can not agre with the satement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid .
