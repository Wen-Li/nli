the develop of competit between compani have creat a war in the area of advertis . nowaday , more and more advertis have develop new strategi to catch the custom 's attent , although they are not as they appear ; in other word , produc of advertis have had to improv their strategi be more and more creativ and origin , and even , tri to sell product that seem to be better than they realli are , but they are not good enpugh . and that is becaus , in my opinion , there are n't regul that help the custom to valid their right and to select the proper product without the influenc of adverstis . i think , gover have to creat , not onli new regul to the compani , but also new instanc where peopl who have purchas someth wrong can demand for their right . that mean , gover have to creat polit that regul what advertis compani are do and how they have to respond to thier custom . on the other hand , not onli advertis are culpabl in thi topic , custom have the respons to buy thing that we realli want , and realiz that the last purpos of the adverstis is to sell as much as they can , and not to think in the realli need of peopl , or in the capac of custom to pay for that . so , if you want to buy someth , it is your respons to see and select the correct product . although , advertis can show you differ product with their advantag and occult disadvantag , you have to be sbut at the end you are who have to select and buy what you realli want and need . final , if you want ot buy a product , tri to think about what you realli need and do n't pay attent of what advertis give to you , becaus most of the time you do n't realli need the product . i also will be better to see what you are buy , compar the advertis and the real look or weight , textur or tast .
