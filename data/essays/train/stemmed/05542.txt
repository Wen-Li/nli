i total agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do familiar thing . in my opinion , success peopl , especi in a busi world , usual can imagin thing that will happen in the futur . they can also see the trend of life therefor they can prepar for the chang of life and tri new thing that may lead them to success . on the other hand , peopl who onli do what they are familiar with do not have thi kind of sight and abil to creat thing . to be a success peopl , you have to be a pioneer to tri new thing . in the busi world , `` time is money '' . peopl do not onli compet with other , they also fight for time . time is the factor that determin success or failur . therefor , tri new thing is the key to success . peopl who do not take thi kind of risk can never be success . they are just follow follow the trend that the success peopl creat , which make them alway a few step behind the success peopl . risk take is also an import part to achiev success . take risk doe not mean not care about the probabl to success . as i mention , success peopl have the sight to see futur thing . the risk take is base on what they see in the futur . some peopl just do not have thi kind of talent , if they do not think thing over befor take a step , they will never be succeed . therefor , risk take is blend with the abil to notic how the world is chang , not just take risk randomli . base on my knowledg , i total gree that the differ between success peopl and the peopl that will never succeed are the gut and knowledg to tri new thing and take risk . those are the key to success .
