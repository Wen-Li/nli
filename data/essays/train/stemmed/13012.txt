in order to answer thi question thouroughli , we first need to defin what we mean under the word `` understand '' and `` learn '' . a student ha understood an idea onc he is abl to explain it with hi or her own word , to provid exampl and to link the idea to other idea . he should also be abl to compar it or to constrast it with other idea . learn , on the other hand , refer to factual knowledg that can be acquir by mean of memori . given the definit abov , one can easili imagin that understand concept requir more skill than just knwing fact by heart . sutdent will need to think further , to analyz and to link oncept togeth when they understand them . for exampl , in order to understand the literari movem call `` natur '' , student will need to distinguish it from realism and to have an idea of what is determin . lear fact about natur would not allow student to realli grasp the main point about it . they would be abl to name naturalist writer such as stephen crane or jack london , eventu to provid a definit learnt by heart , but not to place the movement in it literari context . anoth import advantag of understand is that it creat a structur in the mind that can be reappli in mani differ domain . onc a student understand how a mechan featur of the car , he will be abl to understand the mechan featur of mani other car , even if they differ . it is basic the same principl . learn , on the other hand , alway need to be done again and again becaus it is specif to one thing . i agre that it is more import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . howev , a good student who doe not have ani factual knowledg is not a student . a student of swiss histori ha to know that switzerland wa found in 1291 . usual , a thourough , complet understand can not be separ from learn .
