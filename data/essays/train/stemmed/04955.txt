i disagre to thi statement , for few reason and especi when i am travel in a new countri or area : first of all , travel in a group led by a tour guid can be a veri limit way to discov a new place . most of the time everyth is schedul in advanc so no time to meet peopl , exchang , to realli be in contact with the popul . the best way to know a countri can onli be guarant by take hi time , decid to stay more time to a veri interest place . a travel with a tour guid doe n't give thi flexibl , . also , mani travel with a tour guid will result by visit veri commer area . i rememb do thi kind of trip in quebec , we visit a `` first nation '' site near quebec citi and by listen to the tour guid , thi site wa the onli place where peopl wa still live like a centuri ago . but i move in quebec 2 year later and talk about it to my co-work , and of cours i discov it wa just an area for the `` tourist '' . so what i am tri to explain by thi exempl , is the risk to be shown someth who is not the realiti and to whom the purpos is onli the money . final the last reason i disagre with thi statement , is that onli the fact to travel in a group of unknown peopl is a risk . it 's difficult to know how peopl will react between each other by spend time togeth for a minimum of a week .
