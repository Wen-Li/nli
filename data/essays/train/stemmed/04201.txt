i don ' t think most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . if that wa the case , consum would alway be disappoint after purchas the product . that would erod the confid that the consum have in that product maker and therefor would not allow the establish of a longterm relaltionship between the consum and the product . advertis would have to constantli be appeal to new consum . wherea , what is import is the brand . adverstis are look into promot the product brand as much as the product itself . onc the consum have adopt a brand , they will be more inclin to buy all the product from that brand . and thi is what the product maker need : more faith consum who are go to buy over and over product from that brand . therefor , advertis are work on a larger scope than just tri to make look the product as good as possibl . they work at creat a market , creat a need in the consum , creat a fashion . they have much more complex messag than just : `` that product is good '' . of cours have attract product is import , it contribut to the overal market messag . if the consum ha the percept that the advertis product seem better than it is , it mean that the advertis ha been poorli made and is not effect .
