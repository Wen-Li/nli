when peopl talk about travel , most peopl will want to join a group which will be led by a tour guid . i alway ponder on the reason whi they make such an ignor decis . with a tour guid , one can hardli have enough time to appreci the travel , with a tour guid , one can no longer be free , and with a tour guid , one ha to pay . in my life , my first travel wa to new york and i thought of it as a horribl trip , becaus i wa basic like a robot which wa control by the tour guid . even buy a icecream across the street need hi permiss . i knew that he did n't want ani of hi client be lost , but i wa total restrain under hi rule . i no longer felt that i wa on a trip which i wa suppos to enjoy . the first monument that i visit wa the liber bell which wa protect by some special glass . with that godlik tour guid , i can hardli read ani inform on thi bell . befor have read about it deriv , i wa `` told '' to leav , becaus the bu wa leav . if i did n't have that tour i would have learn so much about thi wonder bell whill enjoy the trip . when we arriv at the hotel which we were go to sleepov tonight , i wa `` told '' not to leav the hotel . i felt that i wa restain in thi `` jail '' . it wa so absurd to me that i wa not free on my own trip . it wa not that i could not speak english and would have languag barrier between the peopl . with thi limit freedom , i could bare do anyth . when i reach the end of thi `` wonder '' trip , i need to pay thi guid who spoil my trip money . the whole concept of have a tour guid is ridicul . peopl may feel unsecur without have a guid but that 's part of our life . nobodi goe to a strang place and immedi , he know everyth . trip without a tour guid is a true vacat . one can freeli walk on the street to view the wonder citi , new york . one can interact with the peopl on the street without ani worri of time limit , and one can trueli enjoy one 's vacat .
