it is a matter of fact that do onli what you alreadi know how to do it 's a safe ground to moov on . most peopl prefer to live a quiet life , without risk , and troubl , while tri new thing impli a certain degre of uncertainti . at the same time it is true that the contemporari world is extrem competit and be a successful person is everyth but easi . to be successful you need someon who notic you , and give you the opportun to show what you can do . special at the veri begin , it is hard to be notic among all the other . tri new thing is a good way to avoid easi comparison . how can someon judg you on someth which is complet new ? on the basi of which criteria you can be consid either better or wors han someon els ? sometim compet on a complit new groud ha a lot of adavnatg . i am deepli convinc that be successful everyday mean basic be abl to be differ , without fear of be far away from the avarag . a successful person need to be brave , in order to dare more than the rest of hi competitor . you need to have a great self confid in order to take the risk to fail . i think someon reach the real success when he ha no more fear to make mistak . everyon learn from mistak , it is a kind of natur rule . most mistak provid you with the right answer to anoth question , and thi is the way life goe on . in addit , i think do onli thing that you alreadi know how to do is an accept way of live for oldish peopl . sometim , when you get old , you are scare by all the new challeng of the world around you . old peol most time are weak . ill can affect the gener mental condit of peopl , push them to be scare by everyth around them . the problem is that the same attitud is gener widespread among young peopl as well . it is probabl come from modern cultur , and the contemporari view of waht life is . the main issu shoul be what life could be , instead . i do n't understand whi most young peopl live in big town alway seem to be so bore of live . thet do n't even tri to be successful peopl . they simpli accept to live an ordinari life , avoid the risk to fail .
