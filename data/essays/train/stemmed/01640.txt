i agre with the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun , but i believ that thi problem can not be limit to young peopl but extend to older gener as well . to begin with , from my experi , onli few young peopl are involv in their commun . peer pressur , the fear of seem ` uncool ' to their friend or just lack of interest might be the most common reason . thi is a veri sad develop , i believ , sinc commun work bring peopl of differ background togeth . commun work can , thu , contribut to strenthen peopl 's sens of respons and their open-minded . nevertheless , i do not believ that the problem is limit to young peopl . particlarli in larger citi , where life tend to be more anonym , onli few peopl dedic time to the commun . i do not think , howev , that thi develop is inevit . my experi is that you can get peopl involv if you are convinc of what you are do and you can transport thi excit to other . for exampl , i have been work in my univers 's amnesti intern group for four year now . in our work we also regularli visit school to tell student about what we do and to gain support for our group . the student ' reaction are alway veri posit in that they are usual readi to help and support our work . as a conclus , in my view , thi exampl show that the problem will not be solv on it own . in my opinion , the lack of sens of respons for the commun is not onli a problem among young peopl but extend to our societi as a whole . if we want younger and older peopl to get involv , we have a respons to offer opportun and to be role-model . chang in societi are hard to achiev . we should nonetheless make an effort - everi singl one of us .
