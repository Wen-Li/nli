i disagre with the follow statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus our world is pack with inform to learn and to understand . also to get an idea of someth like an anim we need fact and not idea . first main point is , that our world consist of inform and anyth is fill with inform . fact are easier to learn . on the other hand , sometim it is also an advantag to know the idea and concept behind a project or a war . to illustr , i like to know the fact and not to imagin whi and what the reason for the war wa . adit , the onli thing peopl and i have to know are the fact . i take the war as an exampl . mani peopl are talk about what the idea behind the war wa , but that is not interest , just when it start and how mani boat the american had and when the d-day realli wa . the idea behind all those thing i realli dont want to know . fact can also learn me to learn . for exampl , i sit at home and have to learn french . although the languag is difficult , i do not ask me the question how the languag could have had such a evolut , i just learn it . fact by fact . the second main point whi i disagre with the shown statement is , eventhought inform and concept are good or help , i never learn everyth right . to learn i need fact and not curio idea and silli answer . for exampl in school , all the teacher learn us fact and not idea . to know someth about a flour or a lake , a ocean or an anim i and all the other peopl need the fact to understand the topic of what we are sudi . in conclus , i think everyon need both like idea and concept and fact , but to step up in our life i need to learn and to learn you need fact . fact are the base for our knowledg . that the reason whi i disagre .
