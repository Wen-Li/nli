base on my experi , i do not agre with the statement , though i understand the import of have broad knowledg of mani academ subject for use academ skill properli . in particular , technolog without ethic is danger such as genet engin and nuclear power without deep consider of their effect on our societi . onc we special in one specif subject , we tend to be narrow mind and do not care about other thing happen in the world . in that senc , i agre with the idea that have broad academ knowledg is import . howev , if academ skill are requir for becom profession in ani area , to know deepli in one subject is much more import than to know broadli in mani subject . if i make an advis for high school student who enter a univers for academ skill , i would say `` it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject if you want to be a profession . '' to know someth is total differ from to do with someth , in gener . for exampl , skill to do research as a profession in one specif subject is veri much differ the skill to know mani subject as a hobbi . when we are young , we tend to tri to broaden our possibl and be interest in mani area . base on my experi , howev , our time is limit and too short to know mani academ knowledg deepli . we have to choos either way of know deepli or know broadli . they are trade off . therefor , after get enough knowledg of one specif subject as a profession , have a broad knowledg of other academ subject is the best way , i think . onc we are use to one academ subject , it is much easier to know other academ subject , becaus the structur of academ subject are similar , in gener . to summar , if we would like to do with the academ skill as a profession , i think it is better to special in one specif subject for sever year in a univers .
