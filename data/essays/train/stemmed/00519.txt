when i wa a student in high school in my countri , south korea which countri ha a lot of test in school system , i studi hard to get a good grade on my test in a short time . so , i had tutor to help my studi . the tutori wa a profession to lead her student to studi effici . her teach way wa to give an idea and key concept to her student . first of the half week , i wa the way far from the class that i wa n't sure about what point she want to point out . howev , after few lectur with her , i realli grasp the main point that contain the fact that we tri to reach . with my great experi , i agre with the opinion that understan idea and concept is more import than lean fact for the three fact . first of all , the fact that we learn is usual ha the some `` reason '' whi that fact occur . the `` reason '' is an idea and comcept . to recal of my school day , my professor wa alway teach the student about the main key idea to approach to the main problem , the fact . thi approach way to the fact wa realli help to think up the multi other fact . second of all , when we read a textbook , you will soon find out that it say a lot of the concept of the fact . thi fact show me that the author of that textbook pocu on the concept rather than just point out the fact . as we gener know , the textbook author alway tri to help reader understand . and the author way to write textbook is show as mani inform that could give the idea and concept . third of all , in the real lectur test , the professor do not onli ask about fact . professor usual ask about how the fact happen , or present . it mean that mani of professor believ that studi and understand idea and concept rather than studi onli fact is more effect to learn . in conclus , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
