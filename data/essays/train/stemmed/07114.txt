as i 'm italian , i can maintain that thi statement is probabilli wrong : actual , my person experi show that the trend is the opposit . when i wa a child , there were onli one car per famili and you could have seen the same situat when my parent were young . if you have live in the early-fourti of the last centuri , probabilli you could n't afford a car : onli rich peopl had one . now , let 's take a look at today situat , car are everywher ! i do n't want to condemn thi trend - i own a car too - but that 's a matter of fact and , i think , in the futur it will be one of the main issu in everi politician 's agenda . you can find mani reason to explain whi everyon want a car , nevertheless i 'm virtual sure that it is due to the difficult to travel around with train , buse and taxi - and the latter are veri expens here in itali . if you have a date , sure you do n't wish to be late , but if you take a train , you could never know when you arriv nor if you arriv in the right place . i think it 's time to introduc an exampl . today there is my toefl test , nonetheless public driver have made up their mind to strike . unless i would come here by feet , i wa oblig to drive my car . you have to consid that such a situat happen about twice a month for buse , twice a month for train , twice a month for plane ; sure it 's not surpris the fact that peopl prefer to go to work with thair own car . even if your famili is small , as my famili is , you need at least two car , becaus your father ha to go to work in time and you do n't want to be late for your univers cours . to summar , i do n't think that car will be fewer in the next year and sure we will have to cope with pollut . if politician want to stop thi trend , they are request to improv public transport , as buse , for exampl . but i-m sure that thi will not happen in a few year .
