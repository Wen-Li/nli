i would say , that societi definitli need to have a broden academ knowledg as much as possibl in differ subject . let 's take an architect as an exampl , to make my point . an architect should know a littl bit of literatur , art and biolog , in order to creat a better hous schema . becaus , he doe not build for himself , or for other architect , he built for peopl with total differ interest , and live way . in the other hand , i think that peopl should also special in onli one topic , but onli after they get a global view of the world 's chanc and opportun . what i think what the best method could be , is when you get an overview of the possibl of the academ ( and no academ ) subject , and after that , you can decid what fit you better , so in the futur , you can not onli improv your skill to the maximum , but as well be happi . in the spezials you get deeper knowledg , so your skill will potenti grow . let 's get back to the exampl of the architect , he ca n't definitli make the whole buildin by hi own , so after he search for the qualiti of the surround , research about the urban spatial situat , and get a good solut to plan , he would need , architect that are special in sort of thing , like construct , fassad , context , envior , etc. architect , which profund , in those program . but they could never work togheth , when they did n't have an overview of the situat . in my opinion , a doctor , or a music teacher , that doe n't know someth about geographi , or bussi admistr , is not abl to respond to our actual world , which is a global world , where you have to act promptli with grat idea to big problem an conflict , that are everywher . final , if a person just get insid a box without look forward in order to broaden hi horizon , is a person that doe n't have dream .
