it 's actual hard for me to take a firm posit about thi topic , as often happen to me when i am in front of thi type of absolut statement ; i will therefor tri to explain whi for me the statement is true and fals at the same time . consid first the physic aspect , it can not be deni that a lot of energi run through young and healthi subject vein and just for thi simpl reason they enjoy the thing of life more , liter . moreov we have to consid that young peopl vision of life is unlimit , mean with thi that they look at life as someth that is not go to end ; at least not soon . the latter provid them with more reason and energi to enjoy their exist . my young brother , age 7 , for exampl is abl to play all day long without rest enjoy everi singl moment and feel veri intens emot and , importantli , with not mani worri and respons . i envi him . on the other hand , while the qualiti of life is underestim by youngster , while elder peopl know ( or should know ) what is the valu of life , becaus they are not left with much of it . they apprici more conscious the gift of life . they can use their wisdom to make better choic . they do n't feel thing with the same intens of the time when they were young , which even mean that they do n't feel suffer so intens . the know exact what they want , and they feel less lost in ani kind of situat . my grandmoth for exampl is 97 and now she is in a facil hospit . she doe not move around so much as she 's on a wheel chair but . .. well , the way she smile when my mother or i go visit her , you can realli tell that she is valuat that littl episod in a way that a young and in a good shape person would n't be abl to do , becaus he | she would like be veri worri about the futur , the job , and mani other thing . in the end it depend on the person attitud , as alway .
