in my opinion it is more import to understand the main idea and principl of what you are suppos to learn than to learn some fact by heart . if you onli learn some procedur or fact by heart , you wo n't be abl to tailor your knowledg to a new task . and i think you will forget thi knowledg veri soon . for exampl i have learn veri much for the final exam in histori by heart , but after that exam i have forgotten all these fact veri rapidli . but on the other hand i have tri to understand everyth in math and i still can rememd most of the knowledg i need for the final exam . and the grade in math wa by far better than the grade in histori . that is the main point whi i think understand the idea and concept is more import than learn fact by heart . nevertheless , there are some thing you have to learn by heart , becaus without some key fact you can not understand some idea . one exampl is that you can not calcul a maximum of a function , that is to illustr profit figur , without have learn what the definit of profit is and without know how to find out where the maximum is . as one can see from the exampl given in my text , learn fact by heart ha a veri limit usabl for new problem but there are some occas in which one can not avoid learn key fact by heart , becaus otherwis one can not understand certain concept . nevertheless , i think it is clear that understand the principl and idea is superior to stupidli learn fact by heart . anoth import advantag of understand the idea behind a certain fact is that you can easili find a perfect solut for problem that are base on the same idea in notabl shorter time and that you do not have to learn everi scenario by heart , becaus you can deriv it from a `` basic '' scenario . so you have to keep less in mind .
