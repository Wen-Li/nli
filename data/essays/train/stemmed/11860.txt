i think it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all , if we do n't understand idea and concept , it is difficult to have good view about fact . that mean we ca n't have our own idea and opinion . therefor , even though we can rememb the fact at the time for test , it is easi to forget the fact . for exampl , when i wa a univers student , i major in chemic engin . there are a lot of concept and idea about principl of natur . it could be imposs to memor them . howev , i tri to memor them for test becaus i did n't studi hard . as a result , i do n't have ani knowledg about chemic engin now . but mani friend who tri to understand idea and concept still rememb mani principl of chemic engin and they are still use their knowledg to their job veri effici . whenev i see them , i envi them . i regret i just memor fact without understand idea and concept . second , if we onli learn fact without understand idea and concept , we are hard time adopt our knowledg to other area . in other word , learn fact is onli for test , not for real situat . if we face with same question that we have learn , we would solv them and manag them well . howev , if we face with differ question even though the concept of it is same , we could not solv those question becaus we have n't seen them befor . thi problem will happen becaus we do n't understand the fact correctli by onli learn fact , we do n't have our own idea and opinion about them . that 's whi we could n't solv them . in conclus , when we are in lectur , we will learn a lot of fact which are involv in the lectur and then we must understand the idea and concept about the lectur . it is import to have correct view of them .
