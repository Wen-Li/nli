accord to the statement , that it is better for student to understand what they learn , name the concept and the idea , rather than learn fact by heart , is convinc to me . in gener it is more effect to a student to learn idea and concept , as they will last longer in their memori . i can emphas thi by my own experi , as it s veri difficult to memor fact . learn date for instanc for a histori cours doe not help a lot in understand whi histor event happen or what effect they could have on our contemporari time . fact also doe not help the student in the futur , when they leav the univers . when enter the job world , it is much more help for a student to know the basic concept and idea , which he or she can appli in hi or her job . take the exampl of the histori cours again , it would be more logic , if the student learn the main differ between the epoch or the essenti research method , which historian need to accur do their work . the studi should provid a framework , within the student can work by their own . some lectur would argu that it is nevertheless import to know some fact . i agre with that , but learn fact should not be the main part of the class work . there should be rather more interchang action in the class , so that mayb old concept will be discuss critic and new idea can develop . understand the idea and concept provid the student with the abil to use them and work independ . thi should be the prior aim of everi univers , name to educ the student to an independ thinker .
