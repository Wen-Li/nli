ye i think it is much more import and easier for student to understand the idea than learn them becaus if you tri to understand someth it would stay in your mind but if you tri to learn it , it would take so much more time , so i think for student it much easier to understand than to learn . for exampl : i tri my best to studi thing and learn them and i tri to understand , but you feel it insid you when you understand it you can keep it in your mind you know it by heart but when uyou learn you read it onc and twice and three time but it would still be so much hard than understand it . so i sudjest that you first should understand if not tri to learn it and memor it by heart .
