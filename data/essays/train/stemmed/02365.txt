i feel that i do n't agre with thi statement . first , the number of develop countri is much larger than the number of develop countri in the earth . mang peopl in develop countri wil be richer and richer . so they will buy their own car in the furtur . j ust like china . becaus i am from china , i know much more about the peopl in develop countri . in china , the economi is much better than twenti year ago . the number of car is creas so fast in these year . more and more peopl are talk about the plan of buy a new car now . it ha alreadi been an import part in peopl 's life . second , in my opinion , the number of car in develop is full now . almost everybodi ha their own car , and some peopl even have two . but it do not mean that the number will decreas . in twenti year , peopl will updat their car more morden . but do not reduc the number of car . so it will lead that the number is no chang obvious . third , although mang countri 's govern begin to limit the number of car becaus of the pollut . but i believ that the produc of car can find anoth way to avoid it happen . they can find out anoth energi to instead of oil . just like ga , electr , and so on . mayb there will be more and more car use thi kind of energi in the road . i think thi is also our dream . finali , produc a car can improv the technolog in mani field . we have no right to stop it . have a beauti car is also my dream .
