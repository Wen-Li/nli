the number of car on our planet is a veri import problem but we are move on the right direct and i think in the next twenti year will be fewer car in use than there are today . the first point to support thi opinion is that the oil is go to finish in not a long time and still now there are n't other tecnolog as effic for car . therefor to use car will be more expens and less peopl would pay for that . anoth point is the air pollut caus by car . infact the environ is damnag by car and to solv thi problem the solut is to reduc the number of car on the earth . final the pubblic tranport are becom more effic and there are a lot of project to construct new metropolitan line , railway station and to increas the number of buse , so iwil be more easi and fast to use pubblic transport . also the flight by plane are go to becom more cheaper in the next twenti year and they will to cover more short distanc line , so an increas number of peopl are go to use often the plane instead than car . to conclud i think in twenti year there will be fewer car in car than today
