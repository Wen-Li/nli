learn the fact and understand the idea and concept are actual the most signific element for student but i agre with the given statement and think that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . i think there are some reason make student behav thi way . first of all , we are all in a veri competit school environ and we have to get high grade at school . in order to get high grade we have to studi veri hard . but while we are stude we see that the idea and concept are more in import in the exam than the fact . i maen the teacher ask us about the specif method , idea or the concept rather than the truth or fact . therefor in order to be success we deal with the import point of the exam and it is certain that idea and concept are more import in the exam . i can say that i do the same thing and i deal with the concept and idea more than i care about to learn fact . secondli i can frankli indic that today student are lazi . learn the fact need more skill like critic think , assess the issu and clarifi the differ aspect of them and etc. but on the other hand understand the method , ida or concept is someth more easier . to be abl to understand the idea or concept you do not have to think of it detailli , you can onli studi the cours materi and mayb memor them . thu i can suggest that understand the idea is more easier for student than learn the fact . that is whi they find it more import to understand the idea and concept than to learn fact . anoth element make student feel thi way is the educ system . i can give exampl from my countri . in turkey the educ system lead student to feel and behav thi way . for instanc in our histori cours they just make us to memor the idea and the concept instead of give us inform and background about the fact . we memor the date of the war or import event dure the reign of a sultan but unfortun we can not deal with the realiti . henc i can indic that educ system is a veri basic and signific element at thi issu . all in all , it is cartain that student find it more import to understand the idea and concept rather than learn the fact but i hope one day it will chang and we will start think of the fact more than we do today . i think thi will be a veri signific mileston in student educ life and more creativ and good skill young student will be train .
