young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , that is what mani peopl think , but i do not agre with it . old peopl can , and they do , enjoy life the same way that young peopl do , sometim even more . the reason i think thi way is becaus , actual i have seen it , i see it everyday of my life , everywher i look . everyday i see old peopl that go to work , to the movi , and to mani other place young peopl go and everytim i see a young one next to an old person i alway see a smile on the old person 's face . the reason they enjoy life as much as a young one is becaus they have live more , they have more experi and they are will to learn new thing , becaus the world we live now is quit differ that the one they knew when they were young , so they get surpris . a clear exampl : the other day at christma dinner i wa with my famili and my brother gave my grandmoth a cell phone with a camera and all the new technolog . my gradmoth wa happi and surpris , enjoy it , click in everi button tri to figur out how it work . in the other hand , my 16 year old cousin , also got a cell phone , but for him it wa a normal thing to use , he wa not surpris . thi is just an exampl of my daili life that convinc myself that old peopl do enjoy life , sometim even more . the key element whi i think thi is that old peopl know they do not know everyth so they like to learn new thing , a new languag , learn how to use a comput or even how to use a cell phone . they live one day at a time and they hold on to everi moment of joy and happi . that is someth that sometim young peopl forget , that sometim i forget . i forget to enjoy everi moment , to laugh at ani time i can , to take a chanc to learn someth new . so sometim i would like to be like and old person , like my grandmoth . i will like to be amaz by simpl thing , i will like to take one step at a time . so , no , young peopl do not enjoy life more than older peopl . to enjoy life we have to appreci everi moment . the import thing to enjoy life is not to do riski thing and feel the adrenalin , like a young person will do , but enjoy and learn from everi moment , like old peopl do .
