i would agre that the best way to travel would be to travel in a group led by a tour guid . it is veri necessari to have a good tour guid who take the group to all the place in the citi , which we are visit . there are variou advantag of take a good tour guid . firstli , if group is accompani by a good tour guid then we will be abl to see all place of the citi which we visit and it would be awesom to visit each and everi place of that region beacus one doe not plan trip to the same place again and again . so it would be a good idea to see all the place in on trip . if i went alon i might not be abl to see all the place due to lack of knowledg of that area . secondli , a tour guid will provid me lot of knowledg regard the art and architectur as well histori relat to monument and palac . without a tour guid it would be realli difficult to find all thi inform about ani place . sometim we might have difficulti in follow local languag of peopl but if we have a tour guid he / she can easliy undertstand the local languag and we can enjoy the local flavour of the place we visit . in today 's fast pace world peopl dont have much time . in thi case a tour guid can be help to complet the trip in veri less time as compar to what one might end up spend if one decid to explor the place himself/herself . to summar , it will definit be a veri good idea to take a tour guid , who can tell about the place in much more detail and show the place in less time as compar to self explor of the place .
