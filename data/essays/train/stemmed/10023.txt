`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . well i certainli think that is the best and most excit way to travel ! there are variou reason whi it is the best way . when you travel in a group you are among other peopl who are from differ countri and place and thi might be a new experi for them as it might be for you . as you visit differ place you may want to exchang your view and idea with the fellow member in the group which itself make the whole experi excit . for exampl , let say your visit a histor place or monument , the guid explain the histori and the stori behind the place and the way it origin . suddenli , one member of a group might throw up new and more inform about the place which he read it somewher or heard it , or saw it on the tv and thi will help the other group member get a better insight and make the experi of visit the new place more enrich and live . now , thi doe not mean that the tour guid is not do a good job , ( on the lighter side ) but , let admit , he is no god to know everi bit of everyth that he is show , and there mayb time he may miss out trivial detail not deliberatli but unknowingli or due to the time provid at hi dispos . also , when your among a bunch of peopl visit a new place it more fun , you get the chanc to meet new peopl from differ background and make friend dure the journey and share more experi of other place . you can share joke and there might be peopl who may share humor experi they had which make the tour a whole lot of fun and enjoy . you may even end up learn about a new place which may end up be your next trip for a vacat ! henc , i think travel with a group accompani by a tourist guid give one the advantag of exchang more knowledg and inform and meet new peopl which can make the overal experi fun and excit becaus you end up not onli visit new and differ place but also meet new and differ peopl !
