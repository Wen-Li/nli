the issu of educ is controversi due to lot of think and particulari we can ask ourselv if is it more import to teach idea and concept or onli fact ? some peopl think that it is more import to have a global view and to understand gener concept and idea in order to develop a better cultur and knowledg . but to believ that learn fact it 's more import and easier to understand can be also partli justifi . take into account all the aspect , i strongli feel that it 's more import to learn and rememb fact . there are sever reason that illustr my point of view . first of all i think that it 's veri import to learn and understand fact to can not forget the past event and to no remak the same mistak . for instanc , i think that the most import thing is not to learn to student the gener concept of the war but to explain them the real fact and event in order to sensibil them strongli and to show them the mistak to not reproduc . secondli , an other argument is the fact that it 's easier to understand and rememb fact then idea or concept . effectli i think that you can have more intent by given exampl to student . in an econom classroom for exampl the marx 's concept is veri import but we can not understand and rememb it if the profesor do not remind it in the context and give some exampl of it applic . last but not the least , i believ that a classroom is truli more interest if the teacher illustr hi purpos with fact . in a histori cours , the teacher who want to explain the organ concept dure the roman period , he would be more understand and hi cours would be more illustr if he give real fact . in a nutshel , my belief is that both statememt : learn fact or idea and concept are import and necessari . but the most import aspect to rememb a idea is to illustr it .
