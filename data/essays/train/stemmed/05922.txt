do young peopl enjoy life more than old peopl do ? thi is a veri difficult question to answer and to be honest , i wonder , too . but for sure i can give you a view out of a young person perspect . i sure can state that i alway want to enjoy life to the maximum . so now we have a differ viewpoint on thi question , respect on the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . mayb do young peopl have more and better opportun to enjoy life than older do ? i 'm ask myself what is need to enjoy life ? i start to think about what make me happi . time and money play an import factor to be happi . but also friendship , a reward job , familiy , sexual life , inner peac , live standart and peac in gener as impact on howmuch you enjoy life . let 's take the first two point i mention , time and money . i alreadi see a conflict here . when you young , you usual have time , but no money to fullfil your dream . there are certain point you can fullfil yourself which make you enjoy life at the time your young , but for sure not all of them . for exampl you wo n't have the money for spend beauti shope weekend in new york and sleep in a beauti hotel - okay , fair enouth , not everybodi is look for that , but as mention in the begin , i 'm writ from a person point of view . you start to studi hard to becom mayb an import person in futur so that you final could bring up hte money for do thi new york-shop trip . but then , well , you won-t find time anymor . so you alway will look forward till you get retair for final spend your over year earn money , but then you might not be in good health condit anymor . my point is , to conclud , that there in everi life-sect will be certain point you enjoy to the maximum but on the other hand point you ca n't fullfil - certainli for that special moment not . you alway will keep on dream .
