learn fact make the student to understand idea easili . fact act as a foundat to ani subject . ani subject lie in the boundari of fact . so i think that lean fact improv the abil of a student to understand the idea and learn the concept . water chang it state from one form to anoth form i.e water is a liquid state and ice is a solid state of water and thi is consid as a fact . if student are not awar with thi fact how can they understand the concept of transform the state of water and method use to transform . the student can not understand or develop the idea of chang the state of the water . when the foundat of the build is not laid properli then it collap as the time pass . in the same way if the student are not perfect in the basic concept of the theori they my face problem when they go deeper into their subject . understand idea and concept come into pictur if the student is perfect with their basic , those are fact . when the student want to develop new idea or concept they should check whether their concept obey the fact propos earlier in that feild . when a new concept or theori is propos , it is accept by the peopl onli if it obey the basic rule . the concept is verfi by test it at sever condit and is check whether the concept obey the basic fact at all condit . the concept is then accept if it satisfi the condit . fact are never mislead but idea have a chanc to mislead or can be prove wrong at differ condit , but fact can not be chang or mislead at ani cost . fact are as true as the earth is speric , but in ancient time a concept of earth be flat wa propos , later it prove wrong and a fact that the earth is speric wa state . thu learn fact play an import role in learn than understand idea and concept .
