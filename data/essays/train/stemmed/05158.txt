i like travel and i have travel mani time in my life . from my experi , although i understand the merit of travel alon , i agre with the statement : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . especi i do when the visit place is unfamiliar to me and the period is within a week . there are three reason for that . firstli , travel in a group led by a tour guid is much safer than travel alon . when the place is unfamiliar to you , it is veri danger and troublesom . if you travel alon , you should take all the respons for what you do ; eat , walk aroud , buy ticket , get a loss , transfer . howev , the tour guid can solv almost all of the problem and sometim the member of the group also can help you . when i wa travel europ last year in a group , i caught a cold and a member of the group gave me medicin at that time . secondli , travel in a group is cheaper than travel alon . for exampl , the cost of transport or entranc fee for museum are discount in a group . thirdli , travel in a group provid chanc to get close each other in the group and that is a lot of fun . but i have an experi that some peopl quarrel and battl in a group tour which i belong to . and i think that possibl happen when the travel continu more than a week . therefor i ad the premis that the travel ` within a week ' . accordingli , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid especi when i visit unfamiliar place within a week .
