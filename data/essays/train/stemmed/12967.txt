i agre with the statement : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . firstli i agre with it becaus a tour guid is a one who know exactli the in and out of the tour plan and where , when and how to go , it is thi tour guid who help us get awar of all the minut nuianc which are part of the tour and not be miss out , the import point be he is a profession train in that arena than a person who is ventur out himself . secondli i have a reason to support it as when i visit golconda fort which is in india , i ventur on my own into the fort without have a clue of how to and where to start off couldnt get to know mani of the fort corner where to get out and the histori and cultur of the place , i wa even con by few peopl there . next time i went with a tour guid and it wa fabul i knew the dynas the cultur and live of peopl and everi detail of the emperor , how they live and the way they rule the kingdom , minut to minut detail wa cover , which made the trip veri fulfil and inform . thirdli a group could be manag effect by a tour guid as one person would want to go to right other to left few of them wanna sit and relax , a tour guid would comprehend all the requir of the group and could suggest effect what need to be done and he is the one who could be reliabl for everi piec of inform . lastli we travel with an ulterior motiv to know the place and to enjoy in a group within the time frame . so if we tri to ventur on our own we could consum a lot of time and the possibl that the inform about the place you gain would be much more less compar to the the group who move around with a guid .
