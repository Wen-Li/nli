nowaday , the world is get closer and closer . peopl want to travel around in their holiday . though we can travel without tour guid at ani place , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . first , one of the reason whi we travel is to experi new circumst and environ . so , we can face some difficulti and danger while we are travel . if there is a tour guid around , we can escap those danger effect . second , tour guid are specialist who know well about the tourist attract and famou place of the area . so , we can see around as mani place as we can with the guid of the tour guid . usual we do not have enough time to travel the whole region . under the time limit , we can travel more effect with the tour guid . third , if we travel in group with mani peopl , we can share inform and talk togeth . if we are lucki , we can make friend and keep in touch with the person after the travel . as for me , i love to meet other peopl and share thought with them . thu , i would travel in a group led by a tour guid rather than travel alon . there are also mani good point of travel without tour guid . we can make the itinerari on our own and that could be a pleasur for us . also , we can get time to think about ourselv while travel alon and can get deep understand of ourselv . but , i would rather choos to travel with a profession tourguid becaus there are more strength point than travel without tourguid .
