in my opinion , i feel that the opinion is prefer that understand idea and concept are more signific than learn fact for student becaus of sever reason . first , it would not be interest to learn fact too much . by teach for student idea and concept , the student would be get interest in the subject which is fact more . for exampl , for my case , i did not like biolog becaus it seem so difficult for me . when i read about biolog textbook , i gave up read soon after i start to read the book . howev , dure the biolog class , my biolog teacher show us familiar exampl and some idea and concept . after the class , i could read the textbook onc i gave up befor without think that it is difficult . it wa quit interest . becaus of the teacher , now i like biolog and in the futur i would like to get job that is relat to biolog . due to thi case occur for me befor , i think it is more import to understand them rather than to learn fact . second , it is go to be veri debat if the student receiv an educ about idea and concept more than fact . it mean that both the teacher and the student enjoy the class becaus the student would suggest mani opinion against the idea and concept . i think it encourag the teacher to teach someth . it is becaus if the teacher teach fact too much and do n't teach concept , the student would not be abl to understand about fact , and they would not pay attent about the topic . for teacher , it should be avoid thing . third , the process to understand idea and concept are quit signific than understand fact . it let student to think about someth , so they can state their own opinion . it is realli import to have your own opinion today 's world , so i agre the idea . fact are import too , but you ca n't actual learn without understand idea and concept for anyth .
