there are mani reason whi peopl tend to think that younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl . the two follow main element can be consid : young peopl are more carefre and have less respons and young peopl enjoy a better health which enabl them to do engag in more physic activ . with the content of thi essay i intend to refut these two statement and explain whi i beliv older peopl can enjoy life just as much or even more than younger peopl . first of all , it is believ that younger peopl are a lot more carefre and have less responsabilit than older peopl . i believ that thi statement is offset by the fact that younger peopl are subject to mental convent and a lack of knowledg that doe not make it possibl for them to have complet freedom . the classic exampl is that of an averag high school in which there are the popular peopl , the peopl that want to be popular and the peopl who are differ from everyon els . in thi typic high school set teenag are tortur becaus they are made to believ that if they do not posess certain physic , monetari of person attribut they will never be popular and therefor , they will never be happi . when peopl becom adult and gain more intelig , they realiz that what they were worri and stress about is complet irrelev in term of achiev happi . thi mean that with that intelig older peopl actual have freedom of mind , not to mention financi freedom which is consider easier to obtain as an adult than as a student or young adult . furthermor , it is believ that younger peopl are abl to enjoy life more becaus they have better physic health . these day with all the medic and technolog advanc older peopl are not onli abl to consider increas their life expect , but to enjoy a better qualiti of life . for exampl in the unit state the life expect of a normal male in the 1950 's wa around 50 year old . nowaday the life expect of a normal male is around 75 year . on the other hand peopl can actual enjoy a better qualiti of life becaus of what is known about the bennefit of a healthi diet , moder excercis and keep away from exces behavior in the use of alcohol , tabacco , etc . with the combin of these factor health and age should not have to be an issu in weather a person is abl to enjoy hi life or not . to finish the essay i woud like to summar that i believ that freedom of mind , the gain intelig and experi that come with time , financi freedom and the medic advanc that are be achiev everyday are all factor that make it possibl for older peopl to enjoy life just as much or even more than younger peopl .
