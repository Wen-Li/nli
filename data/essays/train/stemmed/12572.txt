i believ it is better to special in one specif subject than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus i strongli believ that focu is a veri import element for anyon seek success . have broad knowledg of mani subject doe not make us expert in ani of these subject wherea focus on a singl subject help us fulli comprehend that subject and have more control over it . without focu , there is no direct or goal . special in one specif subject allow us to research everyth about that subject more thouroughli . it is easier not get distract by irrelev inform when one ha a singl issu to deal with than mani . i experienc thi six year ago when i start studi fine art in colleg and took class from everi depart includ paint , draw , sculptur , ceram , fashion and illustr . it wa exhaust to tri to practic all of them togeth , so i decid to focu on paint which wa the one i wa most interest in . now i am a painter , and i can say i know more about paint than anyth els and thi ha brought self fullfil to my life . no matter how some peopl might think that have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better , it is an undeni fact that we have limit time to spend on each of these subject . expertis onli come from practic and we obvious need time to practic . to put it in a simpler way ; who do you think would bake better cake : someon who bake cake , bread , croissant and cooki all at the same time or someon who doe noth els but bake cake ? i definit think that the second person would have a much more delici cake to offer .
