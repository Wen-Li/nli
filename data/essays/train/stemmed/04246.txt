i am agre with the statement . concept is noth but the theme of the topic . if your concept and idea about ani particular topic is clear then you can add number of fact for that concept . fact are noth but a type of exampl for ani concept . for exampl theori of gravit , newton ha invent the theori of gravit . if your idea and concept about the theroy of gravit is clear then you can think about number of fact base on thi theori . you can appli your concept wherev you find suitabl . but if your idea and concept is not clear then you would not be abl to convey your opinion and fact . student should have clear idea about the topic that they are studi and also the concept behind topic should be clear . if your concept is clear about ani topic then you can rememb the topic easili and forev in your mind . and if you learn someth base on fact rather then basic concept that will be harder to rememb . for exampl new is a simpl english word but if somebodi explain you about thi word i mean how the word new made , then it would be includ in your never-loss-memori section of your mind . the new word made base on the follow concept : new = north + east + west + south new word is the combin of first letter of four word ( north , east , west and south ) . so the word itself contain inforamt about all four direct and give you inform about all four direct . so thi is the concept behind the word new . conclus , as per as my opinion is concern about the statement , idea & concept behind ani topic or subject should be clear , so that you can use that knowldg ani time , ani where , and forev .
