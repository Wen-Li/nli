i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact - at least at univers level . have studi law in both england and in franc , i have had the chanc to compar two veri differ legal system and more importantli , two differ approach to educ , especi to the teach of law . studi law at univers in england typic take three year . after three year of undergradu studi , student obtain their `` ll.b. degre '' . it is also possibl for student who have studi someth els dure their undergradu studi to take a one-year-convers cours and obtain the equival of the ll.b. degre . the three-year period of time is rel short compar with the studi time that is requir of law student on the european contin , for instanc five year in belgium and spain , four year in franc etc . the one-year-convers cours also seem to be a tremed flexibl altern to the mani year of studi law that are requir on thi side of the channel . thi is a good illustr of diverg point of view on the question whether it is more import that student understand idea and concept or learn fact . inde , in british univers , emphasi is put on reason . professor and student gather to discuss differ topic , argu , give pro and con . .. all for the sake of discuss and develop a critic sens . it is believ that student will not be abl to learn all the fact and memor all the law and/or jurisprud so the focu remain on understand the reason and legal concept . on the contin howev , univers focu much more on teach student someth `` substanti '' and to that end , student need to memor a lot of materi which serv as the basi of their reason . to conclud , i would say that have experienc both system , i found the british approach more construct . it could be compar to teach a man how to fish instead of give him a fish .
