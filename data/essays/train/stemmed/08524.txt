i am agre with the point that there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus of so mani problem . now a day the petrol prise are veri high so that it is veri hard for everyon to afford a car and after twenti year situat will be more worst price will encreas more and i think it will be imposs for a person even to think about buy a car . peopl are use the car for save there time but the way the traffic is increas day by day i do not think a person can save time . today you see most of the peopl have a car and everi want to use that as much as possibl but if the traffic is veri bad you can not even reach on time then what is the use of it for exampl if you see the traffic or new york citi there are more car then even human everyon want to go to the offic by there own car but you see that the traffic is that bad you can not think of it you will stuck in trafic jam and it take hour to come out of that thi i am talk about today and after twenti year the popul will encreas and you will not even find a place to park your car , so peopl will prefer travel by a local train or by bu becaus that will be more convini for them . i think after twenti year we will see more bicycl than car becaus it is veri cheap you do not need a ga or petrol for that it is easi and a veri good excercis for anyon . a person will save money and as well as time . today the world is face petrolium problem there is not enough petrol or ga avail due to the war and other environmentl reason and after twenti year you might not find enough petrol to drive your car . at last i would love to say that no matter that today for few peopl car is necessari and for few it is a prastiag point they want to show other that they have the best car avail in the world but the time will come that the car will be just a show peic in few year . peopl will keep the pictur of the car but not the car onli few peopl will have the previladg to drive a car and we will see veri few car on the road .
