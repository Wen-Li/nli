from my point of view , i do not think that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . some peopl believ thi becasu they think that in twenti year , perhap , the world will have chang so much that we will use fli object to go from one place to anoth and that , moreov , we will transport thing by put them into a machin , press a button , and , suddenli , they will appear thousand of kilometr away from where they were . when i wa young everybodi said that in the year two thousand everyth wa go to be differ and that what i 've said abov would have alreadi happen , but these did n't becom true . nowaday thing are quit similar to what they were twenti year ago . car are so import in our life that we can not live without them . nowaday we need our car to transport thing , to go to mani place where public transport do n't go and to feel a bit more free . on the other hand , it 's true that if public transport becam cheaper and quicker , mani peopl would n't need their car , and they would take public transport , but , what about feel free ? our societi need to feel realli free , and to feel that they can go wherev they want , whenev they want . we are absolut under control in our citi and in our countri and , as i think , car give us thi bit of freedom that we do not have in mani other part of our life . for all thi reason i think that in twenti year , there wo n't be fewer car in use than there are today , although i do think that the number of car wo n't be grow so quickli as it is grow today .
