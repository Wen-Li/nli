in my oppinion product seem better than they actual are in advertisemet , so i agre with the statement . in order to make ani infer about the advertis we first have to consid whi and by whom they are be produc . adverstis are for firm that wish to increas the sale of a product . apart from a few except , the number one prioriti for the modern firm of our time is profit make . thu the advertis 's final object is to increas the profit of the firm by increas the number of good be sold . in that regard the firm want it product to look as good as possibl on the tv , newspap , billboard or ani other medium which advertis have infiltr . to that end the advertis maker is like to show onli the thing about the product that he think will increas it sale and as a result what the consum see is not the final product but rather an idealis version of it . let me give an exampl to better explain the previou paragraph . imagin diet coke and advertis about it . in those advertis what we alway see is good look peopl , drink diet coke and have fun . they almost alway look good , are extrem happi on the advertis . doe it reflect realiti ? obviosli what made them that good look is not diet coke , as ani person will admit , but hard train . or think of a man in an advertis who just bought hi brand new car . he is drive on the countrysid away from traffic jam and enjoy himself as most as possibl away from the real world . but in realiti he would be stuck in a trafic jam most probabl and not bu that happi . what the advertis are tri to do is not give inform about the product , but rather tri to depict it in an ideal set and make the consum want it .
