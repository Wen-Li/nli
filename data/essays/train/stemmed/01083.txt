i disagre with the statement which is `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' in my opinion nobodi can learn someth just by know what the subject is about . they need to know what they do , what they mean , what they symbolis ! to start with , how is it possibl to learn someth without know the fact ? just by understand the idea and concept , you basic summer the subject . if you call that more import than know the fact ; go head and good luck in life . if you do n't know what are the fact you wo n't be abl to pictur what is the real mean of that subject . do you think that we would be thi civil and thi technol if we did n't use and learn the fact that ha been done about a similar action that might be done in the histori ? histori is a great teacher itself . for exampl , mani leader have read about histori but they read them care and fulli . they didnt just read the summari becaus if they did n't just want to know the main idea . they also want to learn the fact . if you read them over and over again then you might be abl to understand the mistak that they did in the past , so you wo n't do them also . fact are alway reliabl , becaus you can not chanc them after they have been done . all our life , we live by fact . if the fact were n't that import do you think that govern would have law which punish you for some certain fact that you do ? when you are just a child , you fall and hurt yourself or burn yourself and so on , then you get the fact , the idea of whatev you do ha a fact . in thi world whatev a person doe ha a fact ! it 's just the way it is . we may not be abl to chanc it but ; it is for sure that we can tri to learn from the fact from what we did . we are all human and we all have to except the fact that we have a destini and to be succes in that line of destini we have to look at the fact not just the idea and the concept so that we can be success in life !
