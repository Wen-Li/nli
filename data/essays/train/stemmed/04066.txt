the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do is a fairli debat statement . my opinion on the same is not in favour of the statement . i am of the view that one can not measur how much life can be enjoy or life is be enjoy by ani one . some one appropri said `` enjoy is not a commod , it is the excit of life we all live for '' . enjoy mean differ thing to differ peopl , differ peaopl diriv enjoy out of differ thing . a younger person who is more outgo enjoy by go parti or meet peopl at social event . a sport fan enjoy by watch hi favourit team win a championship . a young girl enjoy shop for hour with her friend , wherea an older person deriv pleasur and enjoy by wathc his/her grandchildren play in his/her lap or talk to hi children about their successu or achiev . differ peopl have differ way to enjoy life and everyon is entitl to thi right . so we can not justifi that older peopl do n't enjoy as much as younger peopl do . older peopl have their on way to enjoy life equali as much as younger peopl . with age onli the speed of one life decreas but the spirit of life remain the same . with age onli the amount of activ decreas not the frequenc of joy moment . thi statement that `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' in my opinion is a superstit . one which should not be encourag . we should not forget that these veri old peopl were onc young themselv and enjoy life the same way as younger peopl today . the younger peopl of today will onli realiz that older peopl have differ way of enjoy when they are in their shoe . until we do n't experi the othersid ourselv we are can not make a fair judgement .
