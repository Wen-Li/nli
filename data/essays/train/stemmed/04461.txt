thi statement typic reflect the fight between idea and fact . as far as i am concern , learn idea and concept is much more use for a student than learn fact . if i take an experi of mine , that will examplifi what i mean . i am current a student in a great french busi school , and particularli focus on corpor financ . i attend score of theoret class , mainli about great financi concept . for 6 month , i have been a traine as financi analyst , in merger & acqusit , in hsbc . i have quickli come to the conclus that all the cours i attend were realli useful . i mean that , professionn , fact concret do not teach anyth , wherea idea and concept creat those fact and explain them . it is obvious more import to have learn how to valuat a compani than to have learen how much coca cola is valuat . moreov , idea and concept make one 's mind more open . they make one 's mental boundari broader . from a combin of idea may stem a lot of new idea , innov and creation . but hardli noth stem from fact , except fact and histori . fact are worth in themselv , wherea the worth of concept and idea result from the innov they allow . eventu , some fact are clearli import to know and understand thing . but to realli and fulli understand the french revolut in 1789 , for instanc , one must have previous learn all the idea and concept prevail in the revolut , such as the absolut monarchi or the emertg philosophi of `` le lumier '' . the revolut is not just a success of fact , and just learn the veri date of it is obmit the true essenc of the revolut , what it realli impli , the consequ it had for the life at that day , but also fur us , french peopl , today .
