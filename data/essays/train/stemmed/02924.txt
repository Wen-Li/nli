it is said that `` knowledg is power '' . but i believ that knowledg is power if it is use in an effici way . we acquir knowledg on differ subject around us . but most of us get interest in a particular subject and tri to learn more about that . i prefer to say that it is better to have broad knowledg on mani subject than to special in one specif subject . i feel so becaus with broad knowledg of mani subject we can becom multiskil . have broad knowledg of mani subject is alway help . everi scienc we deal is relat to other scienc . even the technolog that are get develop now a day are also demand knowledg of other subject to cope with the situat . for exampl an electron student need to have knowledg of comput , to analyz and make hi work easi on chip design . the world around us is made of mani thing which are relat to physic , biolog , mathemat and mani other subject . if we focu on a particular subject and leav other it will be difficult for us when we may suddenli have to face a situat that need knowledg of other subject other than our subject of special . for exampl one of my friend special in botani , he doesnot know anyth about electr . he onc kept hi hand in bucket of water in which a heat water coil wa place and when power wa pass . he got a sudden shock becaus of that and he took two day to recov from that experi . when i ask him about thi , he wa say he wa not awar of the fact that he will get shock if he place hi hand in bucket contain water heater . he is veri good at botani , but thi didnot help him out , to face the situat that dealt with electr . final consid all these issu and exampl , i prefer to say broad knowledg of subject is need . ofcours special in particular subject give us a proper career , make us learn deepli and have good knowledg of that subjectbut broad knowledg of subject help us to live in the societi comfort which is even more import .
