i will support the idea that young peopl are more happi than older peopl . the first reason is that peopl in their twenti for exampl usual have less health problem and more energi . they are at their physic height , strong , and beautiful ! they can go out late at night and wake up earli the next day without feel too much pain . anoth reason is that young peopl still have hope . hope in a brighter futur for the world , hope in a brighter futur for themselv . they beleiv , and they are theorit right , that everyth is still possibl in the world and in their life , and thi contribut greatli to their happi . everi day a new life can begin . as a counter exampl , i have a friend , 40 year old , who ha been a technician for the twenti first year of hi career , despit the fact that he didn n't realli like technic job . he alway thought hi job wa just for a live and that he would n't do that all hi life . but recent , when he want to final chang job and work in busi , he just could n't find a singl employe that aw interest in hi profil . he wa veri depress about the idea of spend the rest of hi life do someth he did n't realli like . wherea for young peopl , it is easier to chang job . final , young peopl have less repons than older peopl , therefor they are less like to suffer from stress than older peopl . their job , their familli life , and their belong are not as import as they will be in their futur . plu , their decis usual involv onli them , therfor increas the satisfact that they can get from life . they can more or less decid accord to whatev they feel is good for them , without have to find a compromis with a love one or children . for instanc , if they do not have a famili , they can decid to go and work abroad if they have a great opportun , which is not so easi to do for someon that live with hi wife or husband . as a conclus , even though there are mani benefit to grow old , young peopl enjoy more life than older peopl . but after all , be young is in peopl 's mind !
