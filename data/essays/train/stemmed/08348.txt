i disagre with it , becaus it 's also a sort of lie to their custom . i understand that they are tri to sell their product alot , but they have to think about their custom to not be disappoint . i realli enjoy watch tv , and there are lot of advertis dure the show break . watch those advertis make me laugh , becaus i know that thing will never happen . few year ago , i saw an advertis of a hair shampoo on tv , so i decid to tri that becaus i thought my hair would be like the model on tv . i bought that shampoo , and tri . on the first day , i did not see ani differ , so i though it take a while to be silki . i wait . noth happen . that shampoo wa same as the other product . not one thing wa differ or special except the nice smell . i 've been use it for few year now , but still , noth seem to happen . they are realli tri hard to grap peopl 's attent , but advertis to trick peopl is not good . some peopl will not care much , but some peopl can be seriou . when they advertis , they have to think about their custom ' feel , or make their product like it is on the advertis .
