if everyon had a car in thi world there will be no place for us to live in . i will agre with the statement . the world is make it harder for everyon to get a car or even own one . the improv public transport is anoth alternitav for transportaion . those are some sign car are go down . the car now are veri expens to buy one . a middl incom peoson will have to pay more than half hi incom to get a car . the expens wont stop there you will have to pay also for the ga . the maintanc of it . even to park your car you will have to pay for it . anothr hassl problem is the traffic on the road and no one is do anyth about it . in a coupl of year i think veri few peopl will afforad to buy ga sinc they oil pric are go up so fast . some good sign that the car will go away . first you have the improv public transport , train , metro , and buse . which will cover up the need for peopl transport . sinc almost eveyon live in a citi and everyth is close togther . also anoth thing that ha a sign car will go away is all these anti pollut group and the hard reglat in some countri regard the emssion . in conclus , it wil be nice if the number of car go down . that will mean less car accid and less injuir or dead peopl from reckless driver . the will be a littl cleaner not that much becas of the other factori . with all the technolog go around us and the good public transport . i would say there is a veri big chanc the number of car will go down dramctilli .
