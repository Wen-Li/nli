depend on person experi , person type and emot conern , we find that some peopl hold the idea of learn fact which are import . while other prefer to understand idea and concept . from my point of view , it is more advis to understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . the main reason for my propers for thi point is that concept is from human ' activ and object fact . for exampl , whi doe an appl fall down ? thi is a fact that everybodi know . if you understand the idea and concept which the earth ha graviti . not onli doe you understand easili the reason of an appl fall down , but also you can understand everyth relat problem . anoth reason can be seen by everi one for my point is that understand idea and concept have numer benefit to our life . for instanc , social is a concept that a process for a perso to learn from infant to child to adult . if you know thi concept , you can find mani agent of socal , such as your parent , your peer , and your teacher . you find these agent influenc your behavior . if you just know peopl need to join the social activ , you may not know who you should be learn from . third , in spite of there are some advantag to learn fact , such as it is earier and simpler , i feel that the advantag of understand idea and concept are more obviou . take into account of all these factor , we may reach the conclus that understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact .
