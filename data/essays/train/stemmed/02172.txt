i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn them . when a student is taught idea and concept it help him develop hi own understand and give him the power to analys differ in two given situat . a student who ha learnt the concept properli can appli these and thu come out with a solut on hi own . so what thi doe is , it promot and drive the student to grow as an individu intellectu . now consid the case that the student is given all the fact . he will have all the knowledg that he need to solv a particular problem or he will have all the answer to ani question that is thrown at him . sinc he ha learnt these fact , it easier for him to recal them whenev he need to . thi is where the comparas of the two practic is requir to ultim determin which is more desir or which one is more benefici to the student . while know all the fact can be consid an asset , not know how and where to use them to achiev the desir goal , mean that all the factual knowledg is wast . in such case the understand of idea and concept is more benefici as the student will know how to use the inform he ha or can comprehend from a given situat or exampl and still come up with a solut . for exampl i am taught in a phycholog class that an individu when scare , act in a particular way , i will learn that as a fact and the way i need to respond to that will also be learnt . now suppos the person for some reason , chose to act differ and take me by surpris , sinc a respons for thi ha not been learnt . so everi fact is not use , the understand of the concept of behaviour in thi kind of a situat is more advantag and can help effect deal with such a situat . so i feel it is more import for a student to understand rather than learn everyth he can becaus thing learnt may be forgotten but if the student still ha hi concept right , he can still deal with anyth .
