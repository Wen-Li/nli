i do not think that thi statement is right for all the young peopl nowaday . i would say that it is like it ever wa in histori . some peopl engag for their surround and some other are not interest in it . you can not say that all the young peopl do not give enough time to other . that would implin that for examppl 50 year ago they did . it is right that it would be good if young peopl would engag more for other , but that is not a specif problem of young peopl but of the societi . there are not onli the young who do not care about the need and problem of other peopl but also the grown-up . i know a lot of exampl where peopl had a big problem like an accid . they could not do their housework on their own , but nobodi out of the neighbourhood offer help to thi peopl . at the moment i am do a cours so thst i get educ to visit and help old person who can not get along on their own and there i here lot of terribl stori about the ignor of young and older peopl . but i think if there would be more offer for cours perhap more peopl would engag . lot of peopl want to help , but are afraid to do someth wrong . they think that for exampl by stay some hour with an old helpless ladi they could make a terribl mistak so that the woman fall down and break a leg or kind of that and in the worst case die . so they do not offer help for not get in such a situat . it is the task of the govern of a state to offer cours to the peopl so that the peopl get the confid in themselv to help other . it is not alway the point that peopl are not will to do someth but they do not feel abl to do it . if they would feel lot of them would be will to help other and spend time for them although you never should expect too much .
