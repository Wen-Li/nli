in thi morden world we can go to tri and studi everyth . so mani peol said thi is a `` young peopl world '' . but i do not think so . becaus thi chanc for everybodi is fair incloud old peol . my reason as follow . i have a good piano student . may be you can not imag her age is almost 65 . the first time she came to meet me and told me she hope i can teach her piano . at start i can not believ . becaus thi skill is fit the young peopl , and not easi to get it . but she realli like it . so i think i just to teach you , and latter you will give up youself . but until now she had studi about 2 year . and still enjoy it . at the end i know whi she can instit on . becaus thi insteres is from herself no bobi foce her . but whi mani young peopl can not go on . becaus they do not enjoy it . now have mani tourist organis the old peol to travel . mani old peopl would llike to join it . when they go to some famou histori place they can realli understand the backgroung and they can experi it . they wil more enjoy it . but for young peopl some time go to there just for play and dn not have ani mean . so i think it is to weast time and money . but i know as a young peopl in fact have mani good point . for exampl we have good health , good motion and so on . mani old peopl so admir us . but i think young peopl and old peopl all have advantag and disadvantag . so some game we can play togeth . we can help each other . so in thi world everi one can enjoy the life .
