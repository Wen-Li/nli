some peopl would think special knowledg is the most import , howev i prefer to choos the broad knowledg of mani academ subject . there are there reason for thi : to have mani inform , to have wide view point and to make own new field . first of all , the foundat of our knowledg wa decid be the quantiti of the imform . for instanc , i major bussi administr in my univers . if i do not studi about not onli foundament bussi theori but also other advertiz theori , i can not know deepli about market theori . likethi , bord knowledg is essentio . secondli , if a persson consentr on onli the specif field , they will not be abl to have wide view point . in jener speak , like these kind of peopl can not understand other peopl idea so they will have bia think way . ad to thi , these kind peopl like to be minor , so they will have difficult time in their life . final , in order to make own new field , it is better to have wide knowledg . noneless to say , new theori is made by the combain of the fandament knowledog which saomeon have . if a person special in a specif problem , there will be limit of them . becaus , new field is introduc by creativ think base on the wide inform . from these reason , i think if a person concentr on the specif field , there are more less potentio in their futur . truli , studi onli one subject which a person realli want to studi is import thing . yet , when we think about thi problem from long term . cleali , have vast knowledg of mani kind of academ subject is more good for the person 's futur .
