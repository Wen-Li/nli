student have their own way of learn and understand , but not all have the same way of do it . some peopl think that it is more import to understand the fact . other may think that undestand idea and concept is a better way of learn ; for me , it is better to undestand idea and concept . mani student say that learn fact is muh better becaus of mani reason . firstli becaus you are have more detail about a topic , by thi they say that you are learn more . also they say that by have more detail , tey are go to have more inform in their mind and probabl better mark . final , they think that they are better , but the question is : are you realli learn all those detail ? peopl onli learn it if they realli like the topic , otherwis , they learn it for some more knoledg that in the end may be gone . by the other hand , there are student that think that understand idea and concept is much better for undestand a topic . commonli it is much easier for them to have the idea of what they have learn . anoth reason whi they use to onli undestand the idea and concept is becaus you probabl learn for your hole life , for exampl thing that now may no exist more or histori that it is essenti import for peson knowledg . as a last reason , is that even though you do not have learn all the topic you are certain that you have learn someth . for me , it is better to understand the idea and the concept becaus you realli learn from it . i think that becaus of the reason given in the last paragraph . someth i alway said wa : whi are we learn so much fact if in the end we are go to use probabl onli the 10 % of it ? you tell me .
