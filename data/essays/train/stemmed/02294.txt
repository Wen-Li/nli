that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is certainli a highli unqualifi statement . one can almost never make such broad and sweep gener . have said that , howev , i do believ that younger peopl on averag tend to have an easier time enjoy life than older peopl do . i epmhas the word `` on averag '' , sinc there clearli are exampl of vivaci , joy elder that are much happier than glum , deject teenag . therefor , be old doe not necessarili mean be incap of enjoy life , wherea be young doe not guarante happi . howev , i have reason to believ that be young make it easier to enjoy life . the first and most obviou explan for thi is health . younger peopl are bound to be healthier than older one : their immun system tend to be stronger , the time that it take for younger peopl to recov from wound and diseas is shorter and their motor abil are stronger . young peopl can therefor engag in a varieti of activ that they character as fun , wherea the elderli are prevent by their aforment disadvant from do so . take my grandmoth ; she use to be an activ hiker . she would stop at noth , and even conquer one of the highest mountain in europ , the mont blanc . howev , with increas age ( she is 76 now ) her bone and joint would no longer support ani such activ : she decid , therefor , to abandon hike . of cours , thi did not plung her into a depress ; nonetheless , it repres a sacrific and depriv her of one sourc of pleasur . i can not overemphas , howev , the risk of jump to conclus base on thi exampl ; the statement `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' still remain unqualifi . to come back to my grandmoth : with her resourc , she manag to find sourc other than hike that give her enourm pleasur . she found out , for instanc , that she love play backgammon and even join a club . she rediscov her love of read , an activ that she ha n't pursu intens due to her mani distract . one could say that she as just as happi now , at age 76 , as she wa when she wa still young . it is clear from these exampl that one happi ultimatley depend oneself , rather than on one 's age . nonetheless , old age doe impos restrict that requir one to be resourc and vivaci if one seek to retain happi . not everyon can muster these thing . my conclus is , therefor , that young age doe make it easier to enjoy one 's life even though one 's individu charact is the ultim factor .
