in my opinion success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than simpli do work on thing that they alreadi known . in my opinion a success person is a one who never stop work and who ha a eager to discov new thing not just by stope after some success work becaus he know the import of success . a person is success when he set the goal and work for them to achiev . onc if he set the goal , he get organis . by talk about hi gaol with some other peopl whom he know he may get help like suggest and assur from them . in thi way he achiev hi goal by pute a lot of hard work in it . after achiv a goal he automaticali shift to new thing in order to continu hi success . i mean they are readi to take risk on there further work . by do like thi they can get grip on there goal or subject on which they are work . thi also make him to get prestag in sociti , he might becom popular on hi work . he might get money in the form of reward and award . success peopl never forget the step they were follow . thi make them to stragul in new thing and make them to risk . if they work on what they alreadi known instead of take risk and tri for new thing , they becom unpopular and they forget about goal and hard work , thi make them lazi . becaus of thi fear they alway work and take risk .
