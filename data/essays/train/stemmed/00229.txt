person i feel that it is better to special in one specif subject rather than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i feel so becaus , in the present world wherein competit is at it peak level , in order to excel in ani field we need to have complet knowledg about that particular field . for that we need to concentr a lot in that subject or field . for exampl for an elcectron engin in order to take veri larg scale integr circuit ( vlsi ) as the career we need to have the complet knowledg of chip design at the miniatur level . we need to be well equip with all the necessari tool and platform whcih are part of vlsi , els we cant be a success design . have broader knowledg in all the other field doe n't help us to do well in the present field . for exampl have ampl knowledg in oper system concept and comput network doesnt help a person intend vlsi as a career option . all he can do is that he utilis those concept to an extent but they are not go to help him perceiv a career in vlsi . one of the famou say also state that `` jack of all trade master of none '' . it mean that a person who intend to master all the field find the go veri difficult for him . if we intend to succeed in a particular field then we need to plan in such a way that we are also awar of the recent develop in that particular field i.e ... , we have to be upto date regard that particular subject or field . in ordr to sustain in the competit one need to be the winner and a winner never take chanc . moreov if we wish to have broader knowledg in mani acdem subject it will be difficult for us to concentr in each and everi aspect of everi subject . in cours of broaden our horizon in one subject we may not find suffici time or we may not pay attent to the other subject , which may lead to the failur of the individu as a whole . morov we may run into a state of situat wherein we may be confus to chose a career compris of which subject . one can not find a career which offer or appli all the subject he or she ha studi . final , i conclud that it is advis to be special in one specif subject rather than havingf broaden knowledg of mani subject .
