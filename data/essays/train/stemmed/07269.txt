i disagre with the state , in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are so mani car which are invent , as the year pass by there are more peopl who ha car , and in our societi we can not live without car . there are so mani car which are invent and will continu to invent for the futur becaus everi year peopl are born and that mean more car will be made . there are peopl who work for the car compani , such as sam sung in korea . sam sung is mainli produc car and everyday they are invent a new car with new color , design , and shape . each year peopl buy new car becaus it attract them and they do not keep their car for mani year . in certain time they all chang into new car . if there are no peopl buy car then the peopl who work for the car compani will all loos the job . as the year pass by there are more peopl who ha car becuas everyon want to have independ car . as peopl grow older they all want to have their own car , hous , and famili . these day , everyon is educ that mean they are smart , everyon ha a job and they can afford to buy a car . lastli in our societi we can not live wiout car becaus of our own social life and independ . most peopl use their car to job , school or for famili . most peopl want to have their own car to go to work or do person stuff rather than ride public transport becaus it is comfort ride their own car , they can go or do whatev they want , and what if their hous is far away form the citi and no public transport go to their own hous . these day peopl have anoth hous to relax and calm down which are far away form the citi . therefor , becaus of incris of popul , attract of car , and person life , car will still remain and more car will come after unless the earth doe not exsist .
