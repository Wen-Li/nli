as a graduat , i think it is better to special in one specif subject . special in one subject give you a chanc to read the subject in depth , give you ampl opportun to undertak research on the select subject and will also let you focu on learn specif skill that will compliment your chosen profess . by special in one subject , you can learn that subject in depth . for exampl , i have done my bachelor 's in physic therapi . i have a gener idea about all the special like orthoped , neurolog , cario-respiratori , pediatr to name a few . but my real interest is in geriatr which is just a part of a cours curriculum . it doe not deal the subject in depth . if i decid to studi thi subject , i will not onli learn the gener of it but also the uniqu featur of thi special . thing like what kind of exercis suit better , how frequent should the session be administerd , what are the special thing to be kept in mind dure the therapi session and also about the psycholog aspect . so as i said it give you an in-depth knowledg about a subject . secondli , you get enough time and also ampl opportun to work on a research . when you take up a singl subject , you concentr is center on the subject . you do n't have distract like lot of assaign to do , term paper to submit , multipl exam to give . so you have lot of time in your hand to concentr onli the select subject . you can also do some research work , like for exampl , what is the effect of ultra-sound therapi on back pain in older peopl . is it the same as in the adult ? final , the skill . you can learn new skill that will compliment your profess . for exampl , i know manipul of differ type , that will help in the treatment of joint problem . but will these manipul help the older peopl . will they be effect on them or caus more harm . if they are not use , then that mean that i have to learn some altern skill that will help them better . . thi is one such exampl . i may learn yoga , becaus it is veri safe and effect . i will learn those skill that more gentl and more effect , specif suit the old peopl . to conclud , i can say i like to specila in one subject becaus i am a graduat . thi doe not mean that studi mani academ subject is not good . it is the best if you are an undergradu . you get to know the differ subject and what they deal with . you can also decid as to which subject is more interest to you and suit you and decid upon your carrer . studi mani academ subject ha got it own advantag but they do n't suit my need as i have alreadi pass that part of my life and settl into a profess . all i need now is to studi the subject of my interst and special in it .
