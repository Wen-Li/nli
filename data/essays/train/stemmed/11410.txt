nowaday , there are sever differ way to travel . in my opinion , the easiest way to travel is for sure to travel with a group led by a tour guid . but the easiest is gener not the more interest ! in thi way of travel , everyth is plan for you in each level of the travel . the tour guid is here to bring you to the most famou place , finest restaur , museum . . as vacat rime with have rest , it 's a lazi way to discov a countri , without do ani prepar . it is also a way to meet new peopl and mayb new friend in the group . unfortun , the bad side of thi kind of travel is a lake of freedom . you have to respect the plan of visit , be with a group all the time . actual , it is a way to travel that i am not use to . i like to prepar my travel , to do some research about the place that i will go visit . in thi way , i feel free to do exactli the thing that i realli want to . i buy book and map , after a littl bit of lectur , the place becom mine . i feel more at eas do exactli what i wa look for . i like adventur a lot , i walk in place that tourist do n't usual go with a tour guid . i like to speak with peopl from the place to have advic on what i should do or see . i am not the kind of person who leav the control to someon els . as a conclus , i would say , that travel with a group led by a guid is certain a good way to travel . but i desagre in the fact that it is the best way . i personnali think , that a travel is person , and i prefer to be guid by my own feel , and my sen of adventur . i 'd rather be my own guid .
