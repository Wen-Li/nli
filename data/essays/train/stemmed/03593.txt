most of us feel overwhelm by advertis everi day . we see it everywher in town , even along the highway . mani peopl do not like it becaus it seem penetr and unhonest to them . but is it realli tri onli to fool consum ? advertis is inform , first of all , it inform us about a new product . and it is a comfort and easi way to get to know what 's new on the market . and no one can forc anybodi to buy the thing . in mani countri there are rule for compani - they are not allow to advert someth by lie about it . but it is evid that limit are not clear , when doe suggest end and lie start ? if a perfum compani engag a model to tell the consum that she or he feel attract and irresist by use the perfum thi might be true . there is no guarante that the consum will feel the same but it is suggest . advertis want to attract peopl by promis them a great and wonder product that will chang their live . ration thought it is clear that not everi new hamburg , perfum or shaver will chang our live . but advertis tri to attract the inconsci part of the brain . we often do not think about it ration and long time . mani compani promis the potenti consum to fulfil their deepest wish - if they just buy the product they will be beauti , intellig and love . i think that most advertis definit make product seem better than they realli are and i think that mani or most of the suggest made by advertis can not be fulfil . so it is necessari to handl advertisem with a certain attent and prudenc . i also like be inform about new product but it is essenti to think about it real use . of cours compani tri to influenc peopl onli becaus they want to make profit but on the other hand it 's the peopl 's decis to buy their product or not .
