it 's quit common to hear judgment about young peopl nowaday . it 's even quit popular the idea that they are poor in spirit and too selfish to spend time on someon els life . well , i think it 's the way adult use to solv some their intern problem , complet not tie with what the realiti is . the realiti is that young peopl nowaday spend much more time to help their commun than befor , and i think thi habit will increas in the futur . the modern life ha brougth us to stress our time in order to do as much as we can : or better , in order to earn as much as we can . thi behaviur entay an import aspect : the rise of a new concept of common cultur . what i want to say is that now everi young peopl is enough preper to understand that is better to work and to make effort for the commun instead of behav selfishli . ani good action can onli improv the common happy , but our happy is just insid thi commonwealth . it 's even more and more evid how young peopl are tri destroy old stereotyp of think about what is deffer . although until few year ago hostil behaviour among human race were deep radic in common think , new social dynam are strongli address young peopl to accept everi kind of differ . thu make easier and faster the grow of a new common sens of belong to a commun ; and it 's thi new sens of belong to make us spend more time with thi new famili . anyway the elev number of young peopl involv in volunt group , such as medic team in poor area of the word or even veri young peopl help in housekeep elder , is a confirm of what i 've state . in conclus , i can even well understand whi mani adult think that most of young peopl ar poor in sprit : are not them to teach us in univers class that yhe onli god we must pray is money ? and the onli way to earn money is n't time ?
