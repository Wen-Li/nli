some peopl believ that young peopl is help their commun nowaday . but i think those activ are fewer than befor . my primari reason is that our commun with neighbor are less frequent especi in the urban area . highli civil of citi allow us to live without neighbor . for instanc , when children get injur in the even , we are abl to get some medicin in a conveni store . there are no nesess to be help by the commun . also , the oppotun young peopl make convers with their commun member are gradual decreas . as they have to studi at privat school or in their own room , they do not have enough time to go outsid to make commun with their neibor . consid all the abov factor , i conclud that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . although help their commun are sometim strong in rural area , those activ are total get rare .
