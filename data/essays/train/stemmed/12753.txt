i think that enjoy life is not a matter of age . when we talk about young peopl we usual think of fun , happin and parti . on the other hand , when we talk about old peopl we think of , streess , work , famili and bore . first of all , i think that to enjoy life mean to do all the thing that can make you happi everyday of your life , accept thing as they come , and if we can , make thing better . what i 'm say is that not onli young peopl can enjoy life , not onli they have dream , not onli they can accomplish their goal . in fact some young peopl do n't enjoy their live at all , mayb becaus they have n't found yet their goal in life or mayb becaus they do n't have ani motiv to do so . second , i do n't think that someon is abl to enjoy life more than other . you can enjoy life or you do n't enjoy it at all . in fact enjoy life is a question of attitud , how you face the realiti , how you decid to carri your life , with all the problem and all the happi it could bring . young or old , i think that we all pursuit the same goal ^ to be happi ^ , and i am sure that if you want to be happi you will enjoy everi moment of your life , do the thing that you like and dislik , make your world a better place for yourself and the peopl you love , take care of the thing and the peopl you appreci . all those thing are a sing that you are enjoy your life . whatev you do , if you do it with pleasur , you are enjoy your life . in conclus , i think that everybodi , young , old , black or white , can choos how to enjoy life .
