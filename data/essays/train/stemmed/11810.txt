there are differ opinion among peopl concernig whether have broad knowledg of mani subject is more desir than special in one specif subject . although it is true that have broad knowledg can help peopl in variou problem , as far as i am concern , i conceiv that special in one specif subject is more prefer to have broad knowledg in our life . i will present briefli two reason support my idea . the first reason is that becaus the societi will chang more complic , the demand for the special knowledg or skill would increas . in fact , in ancient age , peopl should do everyth well to surviv , but now peopl do n't need to be capabl of everyth . for exampl , famou basebal star can earn enom amout of money onli becaus of hi abil of throw ball fast . the second reason is that in modern societi peopl can not obtain broad knowledg of mani specif subject . nowaday socioti new knowledg and skill are produc so fast and much that we ca n't keep up with the pace of the develop . if there is a person that is abl , the person 's faith is onli hi or her subject faith . for exampl , we could not even imagin the internet onli a thirti year ago . of cours , broad knowledg of mani subject can help peopl make their life balanc and rich . howev , the more import thing to do in modern societi is to special in one specif subject a person can do well and interest in . in conclus , i would rather special in one specif subject than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
