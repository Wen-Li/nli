in my opinion there 's someth true in thi statement but it 's not quit accur . succes peopl are regar to be veri rich , famou and wealthi . so if an famou actor decid to take the risk of quit the movi buis and to start a whole new career ( for exampl as profession footbal player ) he would n't be take ani risk at all . if he fail he would have enough money to surviv thi episod of `` new life find '' and the whole world would report about hi attempt to chang hi job . so everybodi would know about hi `` riski '' plan which is n't riski at all in fact becaus he 's got noth to lose . inspit of thi unsuccess peopl would have huge problem if they tri to chang their job becaus they would n't have ani save to life from if they did n't succeed . furthermor nobodi would know about thi riski attempt becaus no newspap or tv station would be interest in thi particular chang . i think the media give us the impress that success peopl are tri new thing more often than the common peopl becaus we are directli confront with their new idea . let 's give an exampl : david beckham ( a famou soccer player from great britain ) chang hi haircut everi few month and the whole world wa impress by hi new style and courag to do so . at the same time i dy my hairi everi week to anoth beauti color but nobodi execept my worri mum wa interest in thi . fame and success make it possibl to inform ( even without the intent to do so ) the huge mass about the new thing certain peopl are tri . anoth exempl : when arnold schwarzenegg decied to start a polit career everi newspap report about thi sensat event but when i won the elect to the new head of the sport club not even the local newspap wa interest in thi . to summar : success peopl are n't take more risk or tri new thing than the normal human be is , the onli differ is that the media report about them .
