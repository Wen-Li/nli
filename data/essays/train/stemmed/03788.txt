take risk and tri new thing out rather than do thing that have alreadi proven to work ha been the sourc of major invent and accomplish . i conlud that tri and take risk are the most import factor for peopl to be success . in most area there is a need to have a good educ and knowledg base to get a job done and to be succes in a certain file . to run a busi , for exampl , it is necessari to know everyth aboout your product , the market and the custom and onc you have gain the knowledg and experi and the product or servic are streamlin and are success in the market the busi owner could tri to just keep everyth `` as is '' to run the busi from that point on . the problem is that if the outsid factor chang the demand for the product might declin , competitor might have similar product , but lower product cost which all caus the busi to declin . thu , the busi owner need to constantli tri out new thing , do new invest , issu new product - take risk to ensur that hi product are success in the market . tri out new thing give the one who doe it the best experi and the best knowledgebas he could have ; insid knowledg of what work and what doe n't work . someon who onli stick with what he ha learn alreadi and wht he ha been do for year will never get the insight and cannto be success in that specif area . the same is true for take risk : chanc are alway associ with risk which mean , in conclus , that onli those who take risk are also abl take chanc . to start a new busi , to travel to an unkonwn territori , to do scientif experi alway contain risk ; but most of men 's major accomplish have been made by those peopl who start the new busi and travel to unkonwn territori . my conclus is that peopl even need to take risk and tri new thing
