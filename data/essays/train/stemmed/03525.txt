i think that young peopl nowaday are more interest in build their futur they have less interest in do servic for their citi or for their famili . nowaday the world is get veri littl , young peopl can travel around the world faster than the preced gener , they reciv inform faster becaus they can use comput internet , and the televis . they are more interest in the fact that happen in other citi or also in other countri , they don not solv the problem that their comun have becaus they think that they are less import than the other just becaus they are get addict and use to them . they hear about the problem of their comun everyday for that they need to listen to some news , somethig differet , and not the rutin that everyday live . i don not mean that should happen somethig of trerribl in their comun in order to make them know about the problem of their comun , but rel , parent and friend , better if older than them , should make them know , first , about of the problem thar are closer to them in order to impruv the futur gener 's and their way of live . they should understand that they can not solv the problem of the world like the war or the hungri in africa but they should help first their commun . i can not understand the peopl who leav their countri in order to solv problem in an othet , when their countri is go bad mayb for stupid thing . in itali is veri commun thi kind of behaviour : italian peopl and abov all itali its-self have a lot of problem , they think that they are a reach and modern countri , infact the italian govern ha muve hi armi in order to help other , they sacrif a lot of young peopl to help other countri and not to help their .
