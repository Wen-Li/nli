sever reason make me to agre with the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in the street than there are today . these reason are of variou kind . first of all , the natur ressourc of our planet may not be suffici to make it possibl to produc enough energi to maintain our traffic rate . or the price of energi will be to high for one to afford have or buy a car . ga is veri expens yet , becaus of the variou conflict in the world , especi in the product region of the globe . then , i believ than altern way of transport will have been develop and improv . collect transport may becom cheaper and lot of peopl may prefer them to their car . new mean of transport will be found becaus the world public opinion is becom awar of the danger of pollut . and the transport sector is the onli one where restrict can be made , sinc progress in industri can onli be made in the long term . chang in the transport sector can happen befor twenti year . campaign can promot the use of the buse or explain that bike can be a better solut than drive when live in a citi . final , new solut can also appear . one can have difficulti to find the link between the reduc car rate and the internet , but in fact it exist . the net make it possibl to do shop for exampl . one ha n't to take hi car anymor . if one emloye who deliv good at the internet user is on the road , it make the car rate divid by two . all these solut , even if i recogn that they sound quit unrealist , will necessarili be examin by the decis taker . actual , they will not have choic . i believ some global measur should be discuss , as an isol one may not be enough .
