most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . in fact , all over the world use thi process . here in my nativ countri lebanon , they show the product as a super thing and in fact , it is much less than it appear . first of all , i see wherev i go advertis that make the product veri good , and when i go to buy or see it , i find all the time that it is fake . the owner of the product alway exager in the advertis to attract the peopl . for exampl , i bought onc a bike on the internet , the bike look veri nice and big and when they deliv it to me i found that it is a small and ugli bike . from everi experi , i learn someth till i found in the end that u can not trust ani advertis and u have to see the product in front of you befor you buy it . furthermor , the product owner have to compet with each other , becaus there are a lot of factori that offer the same product . also , the advertis for the product have to look good to attract the eye . for exampl , onc i saw differ advertis for the same product and one of them wa realli good and attract , so i decid to go to the shop that made thi advertis and buy from it . therefor the advertis have to be good and the product should look much better than they realli are to attract the buyer like they attract me . in conclus , the market for the product is veri import , and the advertis should be attract . therefor , the product seem much better than they realli are . in addit to that , the buyer have to be matur enough to differenti between product to buy the right thing .
