i agre with the statement that success peopl tri new thing rather than repeat convent method . gener , a success is consid as a victori of ani kind of competit that achiev certain goal that peopl would regard highli . thu , in order to win a competit or achiev a goal by ani way , peopl need to have more strength of ani kind . thu , i think explor a new area or new thing would give peopl a better method to achiev a goal that would be highli competit against other peopl , while the explor might have risk to fail . bill gate , a founder of microsoft , is usual consid as one of the most success peopl . hi achiev start from a new idea : to produc a person comput . it wa obvious challeng and riski for him to do the busi , sinc a comput back then cost enorm money while take huge space . it wa not realli possibl to be own by a normal individu . howev , he succeed it , and now , he is one of the most success busi men in the world . anoth exampl of a success base on risk would be gabriel garcia marquez 's new style of write literatur . hi magic realism attempt to overcom the limit of a novel by util a total differ way of write . hi extrem descript and flow write style wa first not veri well-regard ; howev , he is not consid as one of the best writer in latin america , and numer writer actual imit hi write style that a new style of write call `` magic realism '' final wa creat . even in scienc , it is necessari to attempt to be creativ and tri new thing than other to be success . for exampl , german armi in the second world war had confront a problem that their missil could not reach america . their effort to improv the rang of missil wa great , but it kept fail due to lack of accuraci as the rang wa increas . howev , a scientist thought of a new idea to solv the problem . he thought that it wa not necessari to launch missil from europ ; if it wa too far , they can launch the missil from closer place . thu , the scientist invent a missil launcher that can be instal on a submarin , which appar could attack the main land of america with extrem accuraci . in gener , a new method that creativ provid grant peopl to be more competit . as if an arm person fight with an unarm person , it is certainli benefici for peopl to tri new thing . even though it usual ha a high possibl of failur , it is worth to tri to explor new idea , and gener success peopl are peopl who have obtain a solut by new thing without fail . it can be said that although there is a risk for a new thing , if it doe not fail , it will be a base of a success . therefor , it is worth tri new thing .
