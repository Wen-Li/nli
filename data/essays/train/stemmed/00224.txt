although mani peopl think older peopl can not enjoy life as much as younger , i think they can . often one think that old peopl are bore . almost everyon can talk about grandma look out of the window the whole day watch unknown peopl pass the street . of cours not all grandma do that . but what about the younger one ? is it not true that a lot of them sit in front of a tv half a day and watch unknown person discuss in a talk show . would not mani consid watch tv to be amus ? the grandma at the window might as well have fun and probabl she think the younger one are bore becaus they need to watch tv . mayb for her the man that pass by all day at 10:30 and is alway in a rush mean a big fascin . .. still it leav the point that not mani old person are observerd in disco , rock concert or in the movi . but the other way round not mani young peopl are seen in theater , hike in the natur or in the cinema when the old western movi from 1950 is shown . mayb drink a tea in a silent undisturb atmospher is great enjoy for the older , while younger prefer to drink a coke with loud rock music in the background . there are of cours mani more exampl , but those are rather depend on the lifestyl and person like and dislik peopl develop while get older , than to the total amount of enjoy they offer to differ age group . in my view it is a bit too gener to discuss just old and young , it just doe not take into account the mani varieti life ha to offer . each person is individu differ and gener view might fit for mani but not for everi singl human be . nevertheless as discuss abov i think that there are differ way of enjoy life and those are quit differ , if compar to peopl at differ age . but ultim the level of enjoy peopl get from life doe not depend on the age and is therefor equal for the old and young .
