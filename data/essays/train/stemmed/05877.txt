i do n't think that the best way to travel is in a group led by a guid becaus : first , the rout of the guid trip are gener standar . the visit and intinerari are alreadi studi and plan by the tour guid so there is a chanc you can miss an import site or place . i think the best way to make a trip is by buy guid publish by a well know brand like lone planet . thi guid are full with tip , fact , histori , hotel recommend , restaur , bar , etc . second , in most of the guid tour you will have limit free time sinc you need to follow a schedul . for exampl , after visit a church or templ , a museum . .. you will onli have 2 hour of free time . i believ that with thi much of free time you can slightli see the citi . in gener , all the hotel that tour trip reserv includ breakfast and gener you will have to wake up earli . what if i want to wake up late and have breakfast in a typic restaur recommend by the local ? by travel in a group you relli on other peopl tast . mayb one member ask the guid to visit a toy factori . what if i do n't want to go there ? other reason is that not all of the tour guid are well prepar . in my experienic with tour guid i had some good and some bad . ocassion some tour guid even lie or just make up fact to make the tour more appeal . and final , what if i do n't get along with somebodi in the group ? or mayb he ask too mani irrelev question that may delay the an activ i had travel in both way , in a tour group with a guid and with just my friend and a book as a guid . i find the second more enjoy sinc you mark your own pace , intinerari , and the best of all , you choos the peopl to go with .
