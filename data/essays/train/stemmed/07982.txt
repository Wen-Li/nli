the two concept of success and risk are they relat ? are we sure to achiev our goal when we 're will to take some risk ? a statement say that ` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well ' . we could repli to thi statement by anoth say ` the best is the ennemi of the good ' . it mean that success is alway appeal , but it over all need to be sustain . howev , i think the fact that we take a risk to tri to achiev our aim is excit . on one hand if we manag , if we inde suce , the achiev feel even better . the dimens of risk make it more uniqu . you appreci more someth when you have struggl for it . it also make you move forward , push your limit backward . on the other hand , if we fail to suce becaus we have dare commit in the project as the risk were present , then it make you revis your vision of the risk . are the risk taken worth the final goal ? to my opinion , i 'm will to take risk when i have a minimum of visibl . i mean , i do not take blind risk and i do not count onli on my luck . risk must be assess . and it is import enough to be underlin , when we are take risk , we shall not commit anyon els 's respons without he or she acknowledg and agre with it . so , i do agre with the initi statement . inde , i think success peopl are peopl will to move forward , who make prove of tenac to succeed . if you never tri anyth new , you do n't broad your scope .
