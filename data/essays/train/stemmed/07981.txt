if grow older involv the age of the mind along with the bodi , in that case , i would agre to the statement that ` young peopl enjopi life more than older peopl do . ' whether you enjoy life more at 60 than at 16 depend mostli on your state of mind . but ye , i would agre that with age on your side you have the certain advantag to live a more fun life than you probabl would ever do , as you grow older . as we age and our responsibilti in life start to increas under the ever grow pressur of work and famili life , we tend to forget to stop by to enjoy and appreci the littl but invalaubl moment of pleasur in life that are not easi to come by . as children with just school test and peer pressur are our greatest worri , our natur preserv innoc allow us to have more fun out of littler moment . a new pup in the hous seem like the most fun thing to have ever happen to us while we were not that grown up . with the brain not suck dri by the pressur of meet deadlin at work , the children have the enthusiam , energi and zeal to live everi moment as their last one , live everi moment of life to the fullest . also , the younger gener ha alway had advantag over the older one , in term of the number of option to choos from special , when it come to choos from differ way to have fun . i can often hear my father recount stori of hi grow up day , when there were not mani to have fun , it had to be the book or the playground unlik our gener that could n't decid between the hundr of videogam avail to choos from and along with the option to read or be out in the playground . with everi gener the list of option to choos from keep grow make the present the best time to be young at . but , like they say - age is all in the mind , you could be 40 live the life of a 14-year-old and have the best time of your life , just becaus you choos to !
