enjo life is not relat to the age of the person but on the interst of the person . mani young and old peopl enjoy their life but in differ way . now aday mani young and old poepl enjo their life becaus of the avali of mani facil like tran center , theater , golf cours , libari , shope center and ect which is locat everi where and it is open all the day . so regardless of the age peopl could schadual their time accord to their daili commet and enjoy these place . young poepl enjoy the new technolog more than the old poepl becaus they have more knowledeg and more intrest in thi kind of life style . for exampl , my children enjoy play vidio game and watch movi and tchate in the internet with their friend and when i discuss it with them they use to say that thi is our time and thi technolog develop dure our time and we have to enjoy it . on the other hand i dont enjoy play vedio game and watch movi everi week or even everi second week becaus i do not have the interst in these kind of thing . student in the univers and collag travel more than the old peopl and they want to explor mani thing . some time they stop their cours in the univers and travel to differ part of the world to enjoy their life . i think enjo of life have noth to do with age but it depend on the person 's interst and what life enjoen mean to him .
