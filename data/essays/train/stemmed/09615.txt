in my opinion you can not gener the statement that younger peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . you have to differ on what their pleasur is base on . inde there are certain activ , like sport for exampl , that receiv more intent by the youth rather than the older gener sinc they are veri like not be abl to particip in these particular activ anymor due to their current health condit . but we should not forget that everi older person onc ha been young too and enjoy the same . with the process of grow up , we chang and develop into anoth be that find new way of enjoy life . we might rather even more have to question the definit on the actual enjoy process . if joy lead us to happi , we can also conclud that an older person might enjoy be old , becaus he ha pretti much achiev everyth he ever want and now feel respons to lead the youth through the same process he ha been go through . regard the fact that there have alway been peopl that were n't necessarili abl to enjoy life , talk about certain disabl or circumst , one can conclud that we might have to offer these person a chanc to enjoy life on a differ base . i can imagin that enjoy life also ha a lot to do with healthi relationship that we take and depend on our entir life . in brief , thi statement ha onli a signific valu , if we compar the actual enjoy process between young and old on a particular activ , like sport , read , etc. , but can not be gener at all sinc everi person can find it own pleasur of joy throughout everi period of life we are face even under the most terrifi circumst , which exist for certain peopl but should be tri to taken by a commun as much as possibl .
