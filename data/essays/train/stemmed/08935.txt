without question , i disagre thi statement . there are two reason : dvelpop countri and the evorut of car . first , the peopl who need car becom more larger in these twenti year than today . becaus in most of the develop countri , the popul are becom larger and larger , and in such coutri peopl want to have car as they becom rich . for exampl , in china there were mani peopl who onli have bike in ten year ago , but today mani chines come to rich and bigin to buy car . thu , as develop countri grow in econom , need for car is increas . second , in these day , car becom more harmless for environ becaus of the evorut of their tecnolog . for exampl , soler car onli use sunlight and dose not contamin air . if these car becom more cheeper , peopl who care about environ could use car . thu in develop countori , the need for car may not declin . all in all , i can not agre with that in twenti year there willb fewer car in use . becaus thi opinion dose not concern about need in develop countri and evorut of tecnolog .
