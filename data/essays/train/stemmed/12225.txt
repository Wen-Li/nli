the start statement tell about the possibl that in the futur could be less car then today . thi point is veri difficult to explain becaus i think that everyth depend to the technolog develop of today . sinc ten year ago a lot of univers depart have tri to creat a new type of car that use a differ king of oil . the reason is that in thi moment the amount of oil is critic and there is the possibl that on the next year it will be imposs to suppli the oil quantiti that custom will need . but until now it is not appear a differ kind of car that use altern fuel . onli a strang electr car that use electr batteri to start motor . for thi reason , i think that if the compani which product car or the univers depart of technolog resourc do n't look for other solut , it will be possibl that in twenti year there will be fewer car than today .
