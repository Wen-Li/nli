i do not think that it is alway the case that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . for exampl teenag live at that age a veri traumat period of their live and normal they hate themselv , hate other , hate their live , hate everyth ! so i definit do not thing that they enjoy life more than other do . young peopl take risk , i think that is the differ , they want to explor , know , achiev thing and sometim they take their live for grant . ye , sometim it is true that young peopl know how to have more fun unlik some older individu but it doe not mean that it is alway like that . older peopl have experi , know more about some thing , about how life is and i think that the more you know , the more you have experienc life , the more you valu thing , you stop take thing for grant and give them the right valu , you appreci more becaus it ha taken a lot of effort in order for you to have what you have . they can enjoy life more simpli becaus they have more memori , either happi or sad but they have them , memori that enrich their everyday life , they have more peopl to love , more stori to tell , they have live more . how would you enjoy life at the most if you have not live enough ? if you do not realli know how life is ? of cours there are case in which older peopl are bitter , angri at life becaus they have suffer a lot but that doe not mean that more experienc peopl can not enjoy their live as much or even more than unexperienc person . it all depend on the way of life you have , how grate you are , how much love you have given and receiv , what you have learn in life , etc . it is definit not a matter of age , it is more like , i think , a matter of person and the circumst that surround or have surround your life .
