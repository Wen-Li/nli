i do not agre with the fact that `` young peopl enjoy more life than older peopl do '' . first of all , as a young person myself , i can state that we experi a lot of stress dure our teenag . we have to make all the choic on which will depend our futur , therefor we do not have time to fool around and enjoy life . from the age of five until the age of twenti , approxim as it depend on the countri we studi in , we spend our time learn , studi , think of our futur and it doe not leav a lot of time to enjoy much of what life is . secondli , when we get older , we have seen and experienc so much , that when the time for retir come , our head is full of idea of what we want to do or what we want to see . and the major fact is that old peopl have time to do what they want , moreov the life time have so much increas that nowaday when peopl retir , they have a full twenti year ahead of them in franc . in other countri , it might not be the same ; for exampl , in the unit - state , execut retir after the age of sixty-f . so , old peopl have more time to enjoy life than young peopl do . moreov , it is a common knowledg that as we get old we tend to be a child again . so much old peopl discov themselv new passion as sight-se . for exampl , onc i wa at the opera and the old woman sit next to me told me that go at the opera or to the theater were her new passion sinc she wa retir . she also told me that befor , it would have never occur her that she would becom passion by it . futhermor , how much old peopl do we see sight-se or in the museum compar to young peopl ? to conclud , old peopl enjoy more life than young peopl though the quotat `` carp diem '' .
