i partli agre with thi idea . i think that in twenti year , all technolog will be more improv and those will realiz the dream we are think imposs to do now . recent , the problem about car exhaust air are becom more and more seriou . the main reason about global warm which is broadli beliv is the useag of mani car . therefor , there are mani peopl involv to develop car to more harmless vehicl . howev , i think that shape or pricipl of it move will not be so chang . onc i watch the movi dispict the futur world . there were mani car . howev , they did not look like move by engin . they seem to be use someth like magnet field and cntrole by trafic center . also , i have seen that car were fli around in the sky and took us to the destin in mani sientif fiction . they resembl to the present car but the function are differ . warp can be the one that is gener regard to be a great method to move around place to place . it look realli convini and less tiresom . i remeb that i realli envi the hero in cartoon move so quickli by use warp . howev , when i becam a highschool student and learn physic , i found out it is imposs becaus it use real great amount of power to warp . furthermor , even if we combin all power exist in the univers , we can not warp a person to anoth place . i assum that car are the most sophist vehicl for transport and the necess will be still big in the futur . howev , the energi for use them might chang and mayb they will be float in the air so that they will be ableto go abov sea . i wonder if thi will still defin as a car but the appear is like a car so i shall call it a car .
