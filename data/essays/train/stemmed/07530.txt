i do n't agre it is better to have board knowledg of mani academ subject than to special one spesif subject becaus be special in mani academ subject mean your attent divid to mani academ subject . if everyon doe just hi or her work well then everi work would have a special person . be special in mani subject mean your brain and your attent divid mani adacemi subject . it harder to focu a lot of point than focu just one point . for exampl the student studi doubl major in universti and they have two exam for next day . they have to studi both . then they can not studi as much as their other friend . if they have enough potenti to get good grade from both think about to they studi just one exam . special one spesif subject is mean you have enough time and enrgi to studi about the think whick you are work on . but if you are triynig to studi more than one spesif subject then you do n't have enough time to special as much as the one who special one spesif subject . i think if everi one doe just their work well the world would be a better place to live . think about a person who is a engin can he or she make a better construct than an architect . no . but also an architect can not do the think as good as the engin doe . world ha a rule and everyon ha to do hi or her own work and have to tri to be special hi or her own work . be special in a subject is allway better than be special in mani subject becaus the one who special in mani subject can not know as much as the think that the one who is special just one subject .
