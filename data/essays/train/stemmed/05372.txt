technolog is in a fast progress . sinc the invent of the televis , peopl have been spend much more time in front of them . as a result , the research find out that advertis the product on tv or on billboard will catch so mani peopl 's eye . but i , person dont believ the gener idea of the commun . i dont think the better the product is advertis , the better it is . i want to share my experi . about a year or a year and a half ago , i bought a set of knive from a televis ad , assum that they are better than my regular knive . although , they were be advertis like even have the abil to cut a wood , it wa a total disappoint when i got them . they were not even differ from my old knive , and suppos to do the same job . afteral , i began to use them in ani case and after 6 month or so , they began to not to be trenchant and had to throw all of them away . they neither cut a piec of wood , nor a tomato at the end . my second experi is about believ or assum the ad product were better wa about a doll for my cousin . she want the toy , that wa sold in a store , and also advertis on the tv . as a matter of fact i bought the toy to her and it had broken in few day , while she wa play with it . as a conclus , howev , in the past i use to believ that the advertis make the product better , i learn that it is not a statement , appli to everi case . after all these experi , i learn to criticis more about the stuff that i am go to buy , and not pay attent to the advertis . they are not that use , as they are shown .
