well , i kinda disagre with the statement given becaus in my opinion you ca n't realli understand idea and concept if you do n't have a good knowledg about fact , and viceversa . so , i think they both are import for student . for exampl , if a teacher would clear concept such as social or comun in an histori class , he will of cours need to explain and let student understand idea and concept of these two import subject , but he would n't give hi student a complet prepar on that without take consider of the fact , like the fact that follow thi idea and concept the russian post warsaw-pact ( and all it satellit 's countri ' ) economi have fallen becaus it wa n't possibl to rule a countri with that kind of principl . i am sure that it is import for student to understand idea and concept , so that they can take their decis and follow or ignor some of them to final have their own idea and concept to grow their capabl to interact and agre or disagre with other peopl in a wide rang of field . but i would n't say that thi is more import than learn fact , becaus if you have your idea and concept but ca n't use them for they do n't fit with realiti nor with what histori tell us , you will never be abl to bring an interest point of view about ani topic given . so a good balanc prepar both in the `` idea and concepts-area '' and in the `` fact learning-area '' will give the student the best way to take decis , have their own idea to fight for , make up their mind ( whi not ? ! ) and final feel free to talk about ani subject without feel ignor or frustrat becaus of their lack of knowledg about idea and concept or becaus of a fact itself .
