there are two way of learn nowaday ; either student learn in book and understand some idea , or they learn thank to work experi and special fact which is more import and relev for me . personn , with my student format , i have had the chanc to experi both . in an engin school , you attend theoret cours dure a part of the year and then you have to perform an internship to go to the next level . the theoret cours explain the idea and concept use in differ compani and the internship give the possibl to work on special fact , which put togeth make your own experi . at first i would say that the experi in a compani , with some problem or special fact you have to face , is more relev that some cours . but after reflect , i would say that we need both . it is not possibl to learn and be abl to face problem if we just attent some cours in class for a few year . the real experi are essenti to learn the best way and get the best skill . one can use all the theoret cours we have had dure the student format and then make everyth in practis on a real case . learn just by studi special fact is also not complet enough becaus it doe not give the necessari skill to face other problem . the skill use to explain or solv some fact are onli for that fact in particuliar but they are differ with other problem . and it is imposs to studi all the fact that can possibl exist . that is whi the idea and concept learn in theoret cours are import . so i think there ha to be a balanc between what is learn in theoret cours and the experi live outsid the univers of school . they are both need to have a great format and great idea , but they can not work seper . each student ha to take idea and skill thank to hi teacher but also with hi own experi which give more human valu than theoret one .
