through my experi , i can say that thi statement is right . take a math for exampl , dure my high school day , i had to answer lot of question . a math teacher explain the concept first , and then made us answer question . if i could understand the concept , it wa not difficult to answer the question . so when i studi other subject such as a chemistri and physic etc . i appli same method , that is , understand the concepst , first . here is anoth exampl . in term of parent , especi money relat , i think good parent is not the person who can give big money to their children but teach how can make money . you might think thi is a differ stori , but it is relat to the topic , i think . all parent want their children to be succeed and rich . but ther are to type of parent . one is just tell their children how they made money , and instruct to do someth to make money wihout explan what it is the concept behind fact . anoth type want to explain what is impot and more eccenti . they know that fact will chang , yet if you can understand the concept behind the fact , you can improvis to ani circumst . mani young peopl inherit big money from thier parent , yet for those reason i mention abov , lot of peopl do n't maintain their wealth . thing is alway chang , and i think along with the chang surround the fact can be chage .
