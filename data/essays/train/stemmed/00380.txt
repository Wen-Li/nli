with the advanc of the technolog in the commun sector , the compani are now abl to market their product to an anorm number of peopl in a realli beauti way . for exampl , the advirtes on tv are so attract that peopl watch them as if they were watch movi . unfortun , they are mislead most of the time , as they make the product seem much better than they realli are . i think , an exampl from real life would make it clearer what i mean . .. a few year ago , we were consid to chang our famili car . therefor , we were research differ model of car , what their properti are , how much they cost , and so on . first , we tri to follow the tv advertis to get an idea . accord to these advertis , these car were so good that it wa hard to believ that they were actual not from futur . nevertheless , they did not give us much inform about the futur of the car . so , we decid to go to the agenc , where car would be sold , to talk to the salespeopl there and to get catalog with detail inform on everi singl aspect . of cours , the salesmen were realli sure in their statement that the car they sell were the best and capabl of do everyth . therefor , they were not veri inform . and neither were the catolog . .. the problem with the catalog wa that they were written in such a way that an averag person would not understand what they mean and how their car were differ from other model . after all these attempt , we were even more confus than we had been at the begin . so our choic wa noth but a random one . at the end , we had a car that would break quit often and creat problem all the time , although it seem to be the best car ever produc . now we know that , the advertis are not the most reliabl tool to refer when decid on what to buy . i guess , it is much better and inform to talk to peopl who have alreadi bought these product to figur out if they are good or not .
