i would like to begin my essay with prof. abert einstein ' s tell . he had said that understand of a problem is the half of the solv . we can not analyz concept and idea without not know what we have on our hand . therefor , i think to understand idea and concept is more import than to learn fact . a greater number of peopl , on the world , are now judg each other without understand each other 's idea and ideolog . and they learn fact without an infrastructur inform . thi rival make them merciless . becaus they do n't know how they should react . for instanc , we assum a man who help poor peopl without judg them get them dress , clear and satiat and assum hi neighbour ha n't ani idea what the man make . our man accept hi home all kind of peopl older , kid , women and men . if firstli , hi neighbour doesn ' t understand hi idea and then call polic to learn the fact , an inappropri event occur . but firstli , if he understand hi idea . no problem occur . as our knowledg grow regard variou diseas , we becom better equip with sens .
