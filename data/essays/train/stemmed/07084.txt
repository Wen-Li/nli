i do not agre with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . even though it will be much more conveni to depend on the tour guid and follow wherev the tour guid may lead as a group , the essenc of travel which sprout from experienc the sens of adventur , as well as the sens of be an explor while we travel can not be obtain if we had a tour guid and travel as a group . firstli , if we travel in group led by a tour guid , we may not have to research about the place we want to travel . thi is known as `` packag tour '' where tourist would go to the well-known tourist attract rather than plan the trip and get the first-hand account of explor the unfamiliar place . thi then will elimin the core of travel . we would follow the tour guid just as a flock of sheep and we will be limit to see onli what tour guid decid to take . in thi sens , travelv will not be abl to travel place where they would person like to go . thi then bring up anoth issu of travel as a group . if we travel as a group , we will not be abl to take break or have our own time of rest . rather , we would have to follow an auster , tight schedul that is alreadi set . of cours , if we had the tight schedul , then we will probabl be abl to cover the area that we were told to visit , howev , we will not be abl to take more time on a particular place of our own interest . thi mean that anoth essenc of travel , enjoy while know about the place in a relax atmospher , will be hinder if we traveld in a group led by a tour guid . furthermor , if the group of peopl that we travel with have noisi children , or if per chanc peopl do not get along , then i think thi will not be a travel that we want to cherish . therefor , i person think group travel follow a tour guid is not the best way to travel . i would rather travel with a coupl of my close friend or famili member where we can take time to enjoy everi aspect of go on a trip start from plan to explor on our own to the way we like the most .
