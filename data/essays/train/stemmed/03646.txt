a lot of peopl beliv that it is more import for student to learn fact . howev , i agre with that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept . here are some seficif reason to support my opinion . first of all , if peopl just learn fact they would think just result and they would care about onli fact besid ani process . when i wa in high school i wa that kind of person who just care about result and fact and i just studi and memor a lot of thing . it seem work coupl of time . i got good grade until i wa in freshman but i got realli bad score in histori class . i wa upset becaus i thought i knew pretti well about histori so i complain to histori teacher . at that time , my teacher said that i logic rememb everyth for exampl if she ask `` which year did it happen ? '' i could answer but if she ask `` which happen below that happend ? '' i could not answer . that is becaus i just rememb the fact i did not care about whi i happend . after that i chang a style of way to studi and tri to understand concept and idea not onli fact and i got higher score in histori class and even other class too . second of all , if student just studi fact it would also not good for their patient . they would learn what is the begin and result . theseday lot of peopl can not be patient they can not wait onli a few minut . in conclus , it is more import for student to understand idea and concept .
