there are peopl who suppot the idea which most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and the other not support thi idea . i would say that i agre with thi idea that most advertisemnt make product seem much better . in follow discussiton , i would like to explain the reason with some exampl . firstli , in japan , i have heard news that some peopl die becaus of use to reduc weight pill . recentlli , over weigt problrem is get bigger in japan too . mani propl want to reduc thier weight in easi way . thi compani inport thi pill from other countri and advertis it all over the countri . it say that some person could lose her weight 5 kg in two week or less than week . mani peopl bougt it and some of them had realli terribl result . i am not sure that pill wa main reason of their death , but i had heard that it work to blood pressur . so some of them effect badli . secondli , i like to go restrant or bar . i can choos sever kind of food from the menu . i decid food , becaus it look so delici and it also ha great amout in good price . howev , when i see the real one , sometim i am desapoint . these food are total deffer from menu , for exampl , amout of the food , tast and price . whenev i see it , i decid i will not come here agein . i understand compani need to have more profit from their product . they have to make peopl to want to buy . the advertis role import part of their profit . howev , if they show their product much better than realliti , they will lose thier trust from not onli custom but also their comoani assosiet . and they also lose their posit in their field . final , i would say that the advertis should not make product seem much better than they relli are . compani make thier busi in honest way . i think the more honest busi the more good profit .
