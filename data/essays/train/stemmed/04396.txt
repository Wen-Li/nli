i agre with the statement that , it is better to travel in a group and with a tour guid rather than be on our own . it is alway fun to go in group , so that we can enjoy more and get to know new peopl , their habit , hobbi and we might find some thing veri intrest to learn from other , for exampl drwing , paint or anyth which is intrest to us . when it come to travel , most of the time we tri to see new place and will be curiou to know each and everyth about that new place , but we know that we can onli hope when we are on our own but for sure we can do that when a guid is with us . first of all , a guid is the expert who will be know most of the thing and he would have certain plan for travel as well as sight see . so our time would be suffici to travel to the place where we want and see what we are look for . anoth import thing is , financi aspect . when we are on our own , we might spend on unnecessari thing and land up in ` empti hand ' . so , it is wise to have a deal with the tour guid and relax without bother about the financi aspect . the last and the most import aspect is'safeti ' . when we travel on our own , we may not be awar of how secur our visit place would be and also how safe the peopl are in that place ? . so a tour guid would be a best person to travel with , so that he know the best safeti procedur relat to place to be visit and we can relax that we will be safe . concid all these thing , i person prefer go in a group led by a tour guid which will save my time , money and i will be fulfil the purpos of my journey .
