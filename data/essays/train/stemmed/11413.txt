for me success mean profit from my do . for exampl when i take a final exam in a univers class i want to succeed . i normal choos cours refer to my interest and also to my abil . of cours i want to be challeng by the topic , i want to learn new thing in class but i also do n't want to be overchalleng . final i choos a `` medium path '' . some risk in combin with some fact that make me feel safe . i can choos the medium path with take in account two factor : the special situat and my well-b . to the first facor i think that the situat should decid whether i go for a risk or not becaus it tell me how much i can profit from a do and how much the do will be challeng . for exampl when i get the chanc to talk in front of an audianc about a for me veri unknown topic and i could win a sholarship with the talk , i would rather take the risk then stay at home . the talk then doe not onli mean a risk for me - it also mean a challeng in that situat . the second and veri import factor is my person charact and my trait profil . am i an axiou person ? how do i feel in unknown situat ? do i like riski and danger situat ? and how are my exoeri with risk ? if i onli have had good experi with risk i will be more self confid and will succeed with a higher probabl . but if i am forc to take a risk i won ' t feel good and the success wo n't be reachabl that easili . in summar i think success and risk depend on an interact of situat , person and experi . some success peopl may have often tri out riski thing . other probabl took a less riski way and succeed .
