in thi world you can find peopl who have a broad knoledg of mani academ subject which can do lot of veri basic thing and peopl who are special in one specif subject and can resolv veri complex problem about a subject . i do not agre with the statement becaus he follow reason > first of all in a labor enviro peopl special in one specif subject are more like to be hire , becaus they have a bigger knowledg about the job what are they go to do . for exampl > when you have a cardiac deseas you would prefer go to a cadiologist with a phd to go to a doctor who know just a littl of everi deseas becaus you do not know if he or she can help you . my second reason whi is that is easier to know a littl of lot of subject than have a special knowledg about one subject , what i mean with thi is that someon special in one subject can learn easier a littl of lot of subject than someon who ha a broad kwnoledg of lot of subject . for exampl > if i am special in a subject i can after start to read about difer thing and learn aout it a littl , while if i am someon who just know a littl about some thing i have to studi veri hard o have the special knowledg . in conclus becaus a special is more requir in a labor enviro than someon who just ha a basic knowledg and becaus is easier o becom in someon with a gener knowledg i disagre with the statement .
