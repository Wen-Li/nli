i would like to go against the statement that `` there will be fewer car in futur than they are today '' . i have mani fact to support my view . firstli , accord to the news promot by the news channel , the number of car that are be purchas is increas day by day . thi , clearli show that more and more peopl are will to by car . secondli , the number of new model of car that are be introduc in the market is rapidli increas . we have a new model of a car in everi month ( approxim ) . no compani will wast a huge amount of money for their reaserch and develop , in order to design new car , if they feel that the usag of car is go to decreas in the near futur . thirdli , the two-wheel can carri a maximum of three peopl , provid the third person is an infant , or is unusu thin . therefor , for famili with four or more member in it , there is no other mean of transport except for the car . ofcours , the trasport provid the the govern will do , but most of the peopl do not prefer to go in it , becau , have a vehicl of their own is a matter of prestig and to them , and is definit more comfort . forthli , the car are use in long journi , unlik the two-wheel . the other sourc of transport may be the aeroplan and the train which are more costli . therefor , by travel in car we will be comfort , and it is cost effect also . in the busi life of metropolitan citi , the car can be use not onli for ourselv , but they can also help an individu to make money for himself , by make it a taxi . he can drop peopl at differ place and make money for himself . unless and until an other vehicl is discov , which can satisfi all tha point mention abov , the demand for car will not reduc . sinc the probabl for such a vehicl to be discov is veri less , we can say that the number of car be use will not decreas in the next twenti year .
