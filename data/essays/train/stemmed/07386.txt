a commun can not stand up alon . the govern doe it best to improv it commun . those in charg do what they can inord to help their commun . but the question is : can the govern or those in charg improv a commun by themselv ? in other word , can they improv a commun without the help of young peopl ? some young adult think that they have noth to do with their commun . they think that it is not their responsibilti to help their commun . other believ that they have to help their commun , even if they do not have enough time . in my opinion , young peopl nowaday should devot time to help their commun . there are sever reason whi they should do thi . first , those in charg can not perform all their job or activ alon . they need support and help from the young peopl . for exampl , if the govern decid to build a healthi , clean club for the sake of young peopl , can thi happen if a young peopl enter thi club smoke a cigaratt or if h/she throw a wast paper ? moreov , the youth should help keep the river and street clean becaus thi would make their commun healthi and free of ani pollut . second , young peopl should help their commun by devot time and money to chariti 's activ . for exampl , they would visit an orphanag , play with orphan , buy them new cloth and toy , and so on . thi would help in build up a flourish , kind commun . in conclus , there are mani reason whi young adult should devot enough time to help their commun . they have to support the govern in new project by avoid do such bad habit as smoke or throw wate in the street or river . second , they may help the commun by perform chariti ' activ which would help the commun in lift up the spirit of the poor and the orphan . thu , i believ that it 'd be great if young peopl devot much of their time in helpinh their commun .
