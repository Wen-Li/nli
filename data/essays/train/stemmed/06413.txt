i strongli believ that , it better to have broad knowledg of sever acadam subject than to special in one specif subject . the primari reason of thi belief is balanc that a broad knowledg is student can develop hi interrelationship . if we have a onli one specif subject we can not speak or argu . whi the broad knowledg ? broad knowledg is most import on student aspect becaus a student ha to know about sever subject , becaus if he goe on ani where at ani seminar or some thing like that they might ask broad knowledg . firstli , broad knowledg is basic know about sever topic . we can know inform about sever subject . the main advantag of sever subject knowledg we can particip at ani seminar , quiz compitit at ani level . we can argu at ani topic watev they might ask type of question . and other advantag of broad knowledg is we can give ani type ig essay copit and also compitit exam . and mostli compitit exam need broad knowledg . here im expla a exampl , one of my cousin take onli art subjest in her cours . one day she attend a seminar regard her art . everi one in that seminar wa perfom there art . after perform an art there conduct a test . but she wa unabl to answer for those question becaus of her one subject knowledg . so , student need mani acadami subject . so final , im sure that broad knowledg is more help for be a good student .
