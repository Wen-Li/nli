in my opinion thi statement is true . i think thi is sinc young peopl are at the begin of there live and not in the middl or at the end of it . you can reccognis it if you start a new work . gener at the begin it is interest , becaus you have never done it befor , but after a few week or month you know how to do it and it is becom less interest . here are some exampl whi from my point of view , young peopl enjoy it more to live than old peopl . when you are young you have a lot of chang . you grow up , becom interest in the other sex and have to go to school . you have not to be concern about that you have enough money neither if you have a job or not . it doe not care you . on the other hand it realli depent on how peopl have plane there live . the most grown up peopl i know , have a hous or an appart somewher , children and a job . those peopl have realli not a lot of chang in there live . the time schedul is nearli everi week the same . howev i know some other peopl who have a completli differ way of live . for exampl one guy i know , he is 50 year old now , stop to work with fourti . he ha had the opinion that he own enough money to live on with for the rest of hi live . so he bought a sail boot to travel around the world . he work from time to time if he can at a bare in jamaica , but onli one ore two month in a year . i think in hi case the mention statement is wrong . he never stope to be young . i think that he enjoy everz daz like it would be hi first on thi planet . with thi sentenc i would like to say that the sentenc wich i am write about is not absolut true . howev gener i have the same impress .
