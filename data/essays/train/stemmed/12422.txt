i agre with the statement becaus i believ , that we would not live in the world of today if it were n't for men and women who had the courag to leav their old job behind and start someth new . to begin with , we all profit from those extraordinari men and women who have dedic their live to tri new thing and take risk rather then enjoy the merit they could have had by do their normal job . everi success woman or man today could not have been that success if it wa n't for the pioneer in the past . although it take a lot of courag to take a risk , the chanc of be realli success are much higher too . if one is dedic and put all hi passion into one idea or thought , the chanc that he might be succesful will increas a lot . thi point can be illustr by take an exampl from histori . in today world we all profit from the high mobil which is made possibl by car , and even more so , by plane . but it took two brother in 1903 all their courag and money to construct an absolut new type of vehicl and to test it themselv . their risk wa a high one , but their success wa even higher and can be seen everyday in today 's world . thi is onli one exampl of how we profit of those peopl who chose not to live a cozi and unspectacular life , but to dare someth . i am not say , that everybodi need to tri to invent someth new and be innov , but a certain percentag of those pioneer is need to strengthen the innov process which underli econom growth . in conclus we can see the enorm import of pioneer and how no countri can go without them . everybodi will profit from the advantag those innov will bring for a societi . thu , a govern should alway support those peopl who take risk sinc their innov are the basi for a better world tomorrow .
