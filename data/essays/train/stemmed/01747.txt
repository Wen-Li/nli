actual , i think that right . the person who tri new thing and take the risk is success most the time . i face some oppertun to enhanc my situat but that wa need risk . and most the time i blame my self but that no binefit me . last tri and risk to me is thi exam . i do n't have a trust with my self in the english languag but i knew that if i do n't take it today i will lost alot of time . that wa about my expiri but our life and with other expiri the humanti start from the tri and somehow with the risk . some of thier tri not for help them onli , but also to help the humanti . i read onc about the fli in the sky and i ask my self `` if there is no one have an encourag to tri fli , how we can travl ? '' . there is allway an answer and part of answer there is a risk . right 's brother had the money , time , scienc and most import wa the encourag to do that . they take the world everyday around the earth to rememb humanti that the risk part of our life but we must woke perfict to be success . i have a note . there is alot of peopl take the risk and success but also ther is peopl fail . that not mean `` we must rest and do n't tri '' . the experi born from the fail and also tri again . but we must ask our self `` whi faill ? '' . surelli there is wrong may in plan , instrumunt , not enough money and also becaus we not trust with our self . that will be differ from the success peopl and fail . in my religon all the peopl from all the world must take the reason ( scienc ) befor start to risk to have a result .
