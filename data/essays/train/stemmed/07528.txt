i agre with the idea that it is good for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are sever reason that i agre with the idea about thi . first of all , the fact is just one of the result of the idea and concept . without idea and concept , it would not gener a good solut -- fact . second , understand idea and concept will help to student to think critic and efficientlli . if student learn onli the fact , they will not be abl to anal whi that fact is gener and where the fact is come from . third , fact can not be chang becaus it is just a fact . the answer is all the same , so if student learn onli fact , they do not know what they should do when the troubl and problem are aris . if student understand idea and concept more than it is for them to learn fact , student will be abl to think more critic and product . if student just learn the fact , they will just the follow the rule and they can not find the other way to solv the problem . therefor , i agre with the idea that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
