differ peopl can have differ opinion about thi topic . some will go for understand the idea by kee their point of view as - learn can be made easier by understand the idea . but some consid learn fact are more import then understand the idea . consid from my point of view - i total conced with the statement `` it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept then it is for them to learn the fact '' . i endors my view by say that `` learnig in depth can result in more innov '' . it is veri import for a student to understand the basic fundament of the problem . suppos if a student is solv the problem relat to mathmat and he is do calculu , then it would be quit difficult for the student to solv the problem by just rememb the fact there , instead if he know the basic formula and method use those formula accord to the question it would be easier to solv the problem . in the second place `` to be practic '' it is necessari to have full flege knowledg about the subject and the concept behind that. , and scientist have prove that . they may not be abl to find new innov by just learnig fact . if we will run onli after fact and learn them how we will be abl to grow our mind to creat mental agil , to explor ourselv , to think beyond other 's point of view , it is veri import to have greater and deep knowledg of the concept . by know the idea afer the situt it becom easier to have a command over that . so i would say that student should learn the fundament behiend everi problem , becaus it will help in creat their mind , power of think , abilti to take quick decis , flexibl to adapt to differ situt , becaus the are the backbon of the nation and in their hand lie the fate of the nation
