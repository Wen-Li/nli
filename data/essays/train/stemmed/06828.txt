obvious , the aim of advertis is to make product seem much better than they realli are . i do n't see ani point to disagre with thi statement . if a certain advertis is fail to stimul thi impress , thi mean that thi advertis is simpli a bad advertis . howev , thi doe not mean that advertis is simpli a lie and advertis are wellcom to lie given advertis is the art of lie ! . advertis also ha to have it ethic . the posit impress in the mind of the consum is to be creat not by outright lie but by emphas the attract aspect of the product in question . if the product in question is an expens and good product , mani advertis wise omit to mention it price . if the product is cheap , the advertis would proudli emphas it exact price . thi kind of select speak is true not onli for commerci advertis but also true in our daili live . if we were to mention a certain man , one can onli mention hi posit side wherea anoth one can onli speak of hi neg side . both men would still be talk the realiti . as long as peopl speak about a third person and as along as the advertis while present hi product are honest , there is no ethic question . to lie outrightli and to speak select about realiti are two differ thing . in a commerci world , it is not realist to expect us to critic their own product ! the advertis also perfectli know the weak side of the consum . they know what attract them and what distract them . use the insight of pyscholog , they benefit from the temptat of consum . but thi is one side of the coin . the consum also know how advertisemnet are . they also learn that advertis polish the product and aim to creat a fairi tale imag . the consum use advertis for knowledg . they are not stupid enough to be deceiv by the advertis . they are educ by the advertis themselv of the characterist of the advertis . a typic consum is more or less abl to distinguish what is real and what is fiction in advertis . to conclud , although i agre with the statement , the statement ha to be qualifi . recogn the fact that advertis make the product look better than they realli are doe not mean that advertis are a bunch of crimin lie unashamedli to the whole peopl . they make the posit side of the product access to the consum . it is up to the consum to make their decis and to agre or disagre with the advertis .
