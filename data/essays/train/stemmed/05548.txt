i think that if one understand what is behind a fact , he ha learn more that the simgl fact itself . i agre with the statement propos , becaus i believ that it is more use to understand the idea and the concept behind a fact that the fact itself . for exampl if a student understand the idea and the concept of a physic law , if he is abl to understand what the law explain , then he will be abl to explain whi some fact happen and which are the realtion between them . in that way , if they migth be abl to understantd than a principl is a mathemat model to discret and repres an aspect of the life , than they will be abl to appreci differ appear af uniqu natur principl in the each common aspect of the life . by learn onli the singl fact , the student not necesser migth to make interconnect or infer between two fact deal with the same principl . moreov , with high propabl , he migth forgot the fact after some time , wherea if he had understood the idea and the concept at the basi of the physic principl he would be abl to retriv the reason , recognis and classifi a fact into a group instead of anoth .
