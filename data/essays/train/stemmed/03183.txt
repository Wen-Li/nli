i partial agre with the statement . the human race is full of divers & complex , especi the human mind `` no two peopl think alik '' & thi is a major caus of conflict between individu in everyday life . think about the proverb : `` success peopl dont do differ thing , they do thing differ '' . be abl to tri new thing , without ponder over the risk of failur , is inde courag , infact an innov might seem precari , but be abl to work on it & tri to prove it to other , be abl pursu peopl to accept it , is in itself a painstak & tediou job . it would definit consum a lot of time , becaus , be abl to convinc other , when everyon think differ , is in itself a cumbersom task . ye , one might be success in the long run , becaus no effort goe wast , but one need to have a lot of patienc & persever . for exampl : tri to introduc a new drug in to the pharmaceut industri is possibl for a veri dilig & patient person who is will to carri out research , anim studi , clinic trial , approv from the fda , then final introduc the drug in the market , thi can take up to sever long year . in the mean time sever small industri might manufactur exist drug after their patent expir , which is quicker , entail less risk , and ofcours suriti of the product sale , low cost . do onli what one alreadi know is definit easier . do thing `` differ '' might involv an enterpreneur who come up with an extrem lucr market strategi , but about market the same product , which were not do too well initi , but suddenli have start do great . here the person is veri success by not do someth differ , but do thing `` differ '' . success is not limit to few thought & strategi , but is a combin of variou construct thought & effort , put forward by an individu or variou individu , to make thing work in a construct & product way . the definit of a success person might not alway be the one who is will to tri new thing & take risk , but may also be the one who think of do thing he alreadi know in a more `` innov way '' & still be a huge success , for exampl : donald trump , who ventur in to real estat busi , which is not someth new , but not everyon who ventur in to real estat goe even close to donald trump , becaus `` he doe thing differ '' . ofcours , the who know how to take a `` calcul risk '' by make sure he doesnt suffer if the risk doesnt work in hi favour , can definit be success . so i partial agre with the abov mention statement .
