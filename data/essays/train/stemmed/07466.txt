today , educ is a veri import factor for the person develop and as a concequ , mani peopl have a wide knowledg in differ subject . for my person , i agre and also disagre with the statement due to the follow reason . one one side , a student should concentr himself on one specif topic . today , there is so much to learn about on subject , you do not have the time to studi an other subject . imagin the subject biolog . there are so mani invent in the technolog for biolog and thi invent result in new discoveri in the subject . as a concequ , student and also graduat person alway have to updat their knowledg and that would not provid the time which is need to studi a differ subject . therefor , a specialis absolutli necessari to be good at hi subject . but in my opinion , there exist also a differt view . influenc like globalis and environment pollut have chang the world . everth is connect togeth . further , societi deepli depend one natur . and in thi framework , it is realli import the we know how the world is connect . a broad knowledg of mani academ subject can provid thi knowledg . for exampl , a chemist in a big chemistri compani can onli do hi job well , when he also know what consequ can occur in the environ and even in the societi . in conclus , in my opinion there are some reason whi i should support the statement of specialis and also some reason whi i shoud support the broad knowledg of academ subject .
