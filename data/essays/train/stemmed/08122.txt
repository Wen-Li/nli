i am now 20 year old . older peopl would say i am veri young to understand the societi as an adult . younger peopl would say i am enough old to go out of famili and experi the world . in the year 2006 , mani thing happen to me . i went to the unit state of america for the first time , and have been a student in a colleg . i had to experi everyth in a foreign languag , english . imagin , it still might have been hard if i wa a student in my countri , but i had to do in a foreign countri . it gave me new experi in my life . i had to make my decis by my own . my famili and my friend were too far from me to give advis . it wa a hard year for me . so younger peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do . young peopl might feel the world and think in their own way but they still stay in a particular place like hous , school or by their friend . they would also do n't know exatli what is happen in the world , what they do everyday is play , hang out with their friend and do their duti as children in their famili . when they grow up and becom old peopl , they might have mani thing to consid in their life . they have to consid about money problem , have to consid about their children , have to think about their futur and so on . also they will find out that the world is not so easi to live than they were expect when they were children . in conclus , younger peopl will enjoy more their life than older peopl do , becaus they have less thing to care about and doe not know how hard the world is to live as a human be .
