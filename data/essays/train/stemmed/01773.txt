some univers teach the student with broad knowledg of mani academ subject and other concentr on specif subject . in my opinon , if i can choos , i would rather studi one specif subject . fisrt , i can studi deeper in same amont of time . if i have more knowleg in one subject i can use it more . also i think if i had the experi studi deep enough in one subject , studi other sbuject is much easier than befor . howev , if i never had that experi i can onli go as far as the first subject with the second subject or hard to studi deeper becaus i do not have experi . second , these day , the compani want the peopl who ha a great knowledg about one specif subject . in our sociti we work togeath . most of the compani ha part of the work and expect them to do their own job not the other person job . if each of the employe can finish their job perfectli there will be no problem of the sove the task . last , you can share the inform about what you know well . if there is an issu that need to discuss about your major , you can explain to other peopl becaus you know it well . howev you know it vaguelli the inform that you would explain would not helpful , in worst situat that could give more confus to the peopl who are listen to your explan . as i talk about the advantag of lean a specif subject , i support the idea . i want to have one specif knowledg and i think it help me and the sociti at the same time .
