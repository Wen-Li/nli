i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first , most advertis tell us the adventag of the product and do not mention the disadvantad . advertis are general short . in order to inpress peopl advertis have to say the most inport advantag and do not have time to tell peopl the shortcom . so peopl will consid the product better than they realli are . second , some product have differ effect to differ peopl . it is good to you , mayb it is no effect on me . the advertis onli give us the good exampl , such as the drug for loss weight . my friend use mani kind of product to loss weight . everi time she told me that she have seen the result of use thi product from advertis , but she disppoint everi time . third , some advertis use inaccrut word . for exampl , a advertis said that the drug for loss weight is veri , veri effect . but what mean `` veri , veri effect '' ? everi person ha his/her own oppoinon . some peopl think it mean that thi will decreas 10 % of weight , but other peopl think it mean to decreas 20 % of weight . to the factori of thi good , `` veri , veri effect '' mayb mean decreas 5 % . so i think i can not beleiv all of what the advertis said .
