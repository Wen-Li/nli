nowaday the advertis are veri import for a product in commerc . advertis make the product be known and they have to help the product to be sell . so factori and societi that product someth tri to present their product the best they can . so that an advertis make a product seem much better than it realli is often happen . for exampl , i love go to the cinema and obvious to do that i have to know what is on in the day i want to go ; i must have an idea of which film i 'm go to watch . there are mani advertis on tv , for exampl , that describ these film , and these advertis are call trailer . in thi case the most of the time the film whose trailer i watch seem wonder and i often decid to go and see them ; but when i am in the cinema i understand that the trailer , dure it sixti second , present to me a collag of the best scene of the film , but the other dozen of scene are bad ! in thi way and in thi case an advertis make a product seem much better than it realli is . and thi can happen also with food or drink . so i essenti agre with the statement , but also i think that after some time , after the product wa known by the popul , peopl start to speak each other about it and each other they clarifi all the aspect , posit and neg , of the product . after that there is an evolut in watch or listen advertis ; after that peopl recogn the tipic way societi use to make a product seem better than it realli is . in thi way , now i am partial abl , for exampl , to understand watch their trailer if film are bad of cours or if i can tri and see them . in conclus , i agre that most adveris make product seem better than they realli are , but i think that sometim peopl are abl to understand that .
