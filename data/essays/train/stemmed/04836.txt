a person that is educ is highli regard while , an uneduc person might sometim be seen down upon . knowledg is a way of know that mani peopl should prais upon and take thi advantag to their own good . i do agre that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to have of one onli . thi way a person would know a great deal of thing in more than one thing and he/sh would normali share their knowledg with other peopl and get also inform about other subject themselv . an exampl might be , a person that special in a particular field of studi such as chemistri and anoth person that ha abroad knowledg of a lot of subject includ chemistri meet up . the first person might onli discuss chemistri while the other , person discuss more than one subject . to me in thi situat the person with the broad knowledg is infact , smarter and more experienc than that person that special in chemistri . becaus that person might not answer or feel lost when the other person talk about other topic . anoth reason , might be that the person with the broad knowledg of mani academ subject migh find it easier to understand and learn about variou topic . on the other hand the person that is special in a singl subject might find it difficult to cope with the other topic that might be introduc to him/her . an exampl would be if he busi major student wa in a contest with the other student that take busi and other subject . he/sh might win or gain point in answer question that deel about busi but , when it come to answer other question he/sh might have a hard time answer it . again i do stand by my opinion that , a person should have great understand in mani academ subject rather in one . who know when that person need to persuad anoth person in an area other than his/her own . it might be help if they know inform in more than one topic .
