eventhough a tour guid can provid the travel detail and addit inform about a place , i believ that the best way of travel is in a group of peopl that self manag themselv . to me , travel repres one of the finest and happiest moment of my life . it allow me to free my mind from the everyday routin through the discoveri of a new countri , differ peopl , social custom and behavior . for thi reason , i like to organ my journey by myself , leav open a lot of possibl dure the travel instead of plan the packag `` ex ant '' with a tour guid . furthermor , nowaday it is veri easi to obtain relev inform about a specif journey . travel guid and the incred amount of inform contain in the internet can defint help fill the inform gap of a travel without hire a specif person from the place . in my opinion travel is a constant process of discoveri the realiti that sorround me . thi is a learn by do process in which everi mistak lead to a potenti unexpect and posit situat that otherwis would n't had occur . on the other hand , the presenc of a tour guid would inevit make the journey veri precis and strictli schedul without allow for the possibl of error and unexpect situat . thi combin of failur and success make me feel part of the place i am visit and , at the same time , it give me the incredibil opportun to get in touch and talk with mani peopl . the contact with local is crucial in the discoveri process of the travel and the presenc of a tour guid would undermin a lot the abil to interact with other peopl . for all these reason i strongli believ that travel alon or with a group of good friend led by themselv is the best way of enjoy and take advantag of the full potenti of a journey .
