i do not agre with the idea that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstli , techonolog will not advanc that faster that the role of car will be replac by the more advanc technolog such as plane or ultra fast train . secondli , develop world will someday will reach to the point that their major transport becom car . to begin with , it seem imposs that the more advanc trasport technolog such as plane or ultra fast train replac the role that current car ha . it is true that in twenti year time , the techonolog will be much more develpo . howev , it draw some skeptic that twenti year later , everyon ha access of plane at their home like almost everyon ha a car in their hous today . for exampl , south korea , in 1986 , alreadi consider number of peopl own car . in 2006 , there are still numer number of peopl who are not abl to get a car becaus they are too expens to afford . it wa imposs to even manag car for everyon in twenti year time for the countri , then how would it be possibl to peopl to manag some other advanc technolog in twenti year time ? it is just too hard to imagin . antoh significan point is that there are more develpo countri than develop countri in the world . it will be a bit easier for the peopl who live in develop countir to imagin the world in twenti year with fewer car , whether it is for the environment reason or they dream about the better techonolog , nonetheless , develop coutnri such as mani african countri , eash-asia countri still need to take a step to the sociey that everi peopl in their nation own a car . that basic stage even ha not come to them yet . even though peopl in develop countri use fewer car in twenti year time , there will be more number of car overal in the world becaus the peopl from the develop countri would be abl to manag car by then . for exampl , if china , india or russia grow the pace the they are grow at the moment , in twenti year of time , peopl from the nation will use more than million car . it might be possibl that fewer car will be use in twenti year time , howev , i think there are far too mani problem that unabl thi statement firstli as the technolog will not develop that fast and there are too mani develp countir which need to catch up the current technolog . therefor , it would be imposs to manag less car in twenti year time .
