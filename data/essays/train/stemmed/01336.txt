pereson , i disagre with the statement that young peopl engjoy life more than older peopl do . of cours , it is not true to say that young peopl do not enjoy life . they engoy life . for instanc , they play some sport or studi variou thing and so on . but , gener speak , old peopl can do same thing , too . therefor we can not say that young peopl enjoy life more than older pepl do . i think older pepol can enjoy life more . there are two reason . first of all , they do the thing that young peopl ara not abl to do easili . for exampl , they can do luxuari thing such as cluse or travel all over the world , becaus they are more rich than yonger peopl . second of all , they know the way to enjoy more than young pepl . older peopl have much experiens than yonger peopl and they have more favorit thing . for exampl , my grandmoth take part in variou activ such as flower arrang and play teni . that mean they can enjoy life in variou way . in conclus , i think older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl , becaus of their money and experiens .
