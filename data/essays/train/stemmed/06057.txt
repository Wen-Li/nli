in school we are been though to understand idea and concept but there are some student who lean the fact and take it the easi way out . most of the school teach how it is done and whi but there are some except where school teach to learn by heart . firstli , these school just make them know that thi is the inform and they are suppos to learn it . so such sitaut just make the student rememb the fact and not know what it mean and whi is it like that . the student should be tought the reason of the subject and they should understand . by thi if for exampl , someon come up and ask the student do they know the mean of thi or whi it is like thi , they all should be abl to repli them back instead of say no it just suppos to be that way . secondli , by learn the fact when the student is young it help them as they grow up . there are some thing which have to be know as fact and not have mean to it . when they learn the teachnic to learn the fact when they are some , as they grow up the learn process increas and they can then learn fact aswel know the concept and understand the idea . overal , i feel that the it is import for student to understand idea and concept aswel as learn the fact . so by thi the student will experi both and gain more inform , which shall benfit later on in higher studi or after studi .
