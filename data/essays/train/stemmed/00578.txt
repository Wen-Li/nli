today , the method of teach is mainli discuss in all around world . i think understand idea and concept are more import than learn fact becaus of two reason ; effect to anoth proplem , and make a consider person . first , if we understand idea that on the book , or the profeesor explain we can easili get a solut from similar situat or problem . for exampl , we have learn ` 1 + 1 = 2 ' . we know not onli thi answer but also it sequenc to solv . unless we underatand the method . ` 1 + 1 = 2 ' is just fact . not mine . secondli , we can be more consider person . by access solut , we could face variou kind of obstacl . then , we take a time to review about waht wa wrong and are there ani otherway to solv the problem in conclus , there is a say that `` teach him ` how to get fish ' , do n't teach him ` how to eat fish ' '' . thi show what i exactli mean . ignor all of the sequenc is caus unhumanti soceiti and unconsider societi . therefor i think to understand idea and concept are more import than to learn fact .
