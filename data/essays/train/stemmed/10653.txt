everyon in the world wish to have a car . so will the car be less after twenti year from now ? . well in my opinion i do n't think that the number of car will be less . becaus peopl need car to travel , to work , visit there famili or friend , use it as a home if it wa a van and it is cheap compear to the other transport . so i dissagre for sever reason : firstli no one in the world ha the abil to o to there work use there leg everi morn in there life . becaus if that happen everyon will be tire at work and suffur of leg pain . and that mean peopl will preser to stay at home . anoth reason is that as a buis person for sure car will be there best way to let the way of the buis go well . for exampl when i wa in the citi of my countri . the main thing to travel is to use a car rather than walk . and if the roud is close just for one hour that mean that the buis will stop or atleast the market will be low . second come that car nowday are at everywher in the world . so how it will be fewer than it is now ? . i do n't think that it will be easi to distroy the car and find a place to burri them under the earth . howev , most of the peopl need car ( van ) to use them as their home . that will be a travel home . they can take their home when ever they need to do that . at the end as an ower of as car i hardli beleiv that car will not be fewer in futur unless there is a anoth wirld to throw all the car in is .
