it is common to think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . for instanc , it is obviou that young peopl parti a lot more than older peopl , that 's whi they seem to enjoy life a lot more . but , if we take a closer look , is it realli true ? i 'd tend to disagre with thi well broad idea , and as far as i am concern , i 'd say first that older peopl ceiz the day a lot more than young peopl do , and then i 'd like to underlin the fact that the age doe n't matter , that it is the person 's person which lead him to enjoy life more or less . first , it seem obviou to me that older peopl enjoy life a lot more than younger peopl do , precis becaus they have noth to loos . they are consciou that they are go to die one day , therefor they are live in the present , they are enjoy everi moment of their life . young peopl , on the opposit , are alway make plan , think about what they want for their futur and how they are go to obtain it . they consid themselv as immort , thu they are not realli enjoy the present time . older peopl experienc a lot of good and bad thing and are now awar of what make life worth live to them , consequ they are abl to realli enjoy their life . but abov all , my opinion is that enjoy life is n't a matter of age . some peopl , no matter if they 're young or old , will alway live in the past , mourn about what happen to them , or spend time think about their good memori , and as a result , they will never enjoy life , the real life that 's go on befor their eye . that 's whi i consid be abl to enjoy life as a trait of personn , which doe n't depend on the age of the person but on it abil to be satisfi with what he ha got .
