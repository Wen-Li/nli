mani old peopl think that they do not enjoy life as the did when they were younger and they gener thi opinion to hold that young peopl ejoy life more . i do not complet disagre with thi statement . particularli , i think it is not that young peopl enjoy life more , but they enjoy it in a differ way . usual , young peopl do not know much about adult respons yet . thi is whi they can feel more secur and to feel they have a lot of time to modifi thing and attitut . besid , a featur of young peopl , especi teenag , is the way feel are taken to exager extrem ; they love or hate , but there is no in between . as they do love , it is a fact that teenag can also suffer a lot . it is well known how easili problem come up when we are young . tini problem can be a complet tragedi in minut . on the contrari , older peopl can see these problem ju as superfici , and they are more like to enjoy of basic thing of life . for exampl , a bad experi in a new group of peopl such a class can make a young person quit and to think that he or she will not join thi group never again . from anoth perspect , someon that had experi that thi kind of situat can happen ( and will happen ) mani time in life , will accept it to summar , i think we need to consid that young and old peopl have differ perspect of life , due to differ experi , which lead them to see life in a differ manner . when peopl state that youger peopl enjoy life more , it is base on the feel that their attitud toward life is more calm and not as passion as when they were younger .
