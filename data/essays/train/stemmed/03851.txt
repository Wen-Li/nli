for nearli everi product some kind of advertis can be found . today there are so mani differ kind of advertis , that the question is hard to answer . i think one should distinguish between the most common form of advertis which are tv - and radio spot , advertis in magazin , advertis on poster in the street , productplac in movi and direct advertis by the salesman . all these form have one thing in common : onli the favor aspect of the product will present . from that point of view one could admit to the given statement . tv-spot for exampl also have the possibl to evok sever emot reaction by use touch pictur in combin with music . in a less effect way print - and radio - advertis can be use for that effect , too . thi is a veri subtil aspect of advertis . product placement and tv-spot can also tempt the consum to associ sever properti with the product which are not mention directli but associ with the person , use the product . with respect to all these fact one still ha to consid , that a consum usual never obtain wrong inform . one should alway be awar of these emot instrument in advertis . we alway have the option to consult other sourc for more inform about a product . advertis will onli show us the posit aspect of the product . consid the argument abov i do not agre with the statement , that advertis make product seem much better than they realli are ! in fact advertis is an not complet inform . onli by assum that the product ha no disadvantag the consum may consid a product to be better than it actual is . but thi is the consum fault , who evalu a product although have incomplet inform about it . the purpos of advertis alway is to demonstr the benefit a product provid never to provid complet inform . we should keep that in mind and rememb it next time we watch tv or read a magazin !
