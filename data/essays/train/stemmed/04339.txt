i do n't agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , i believ the opposit statement which express that older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl do . becaus i believ there are sever reason that prevent younger to be more effect in their own live which can be base on the fact that the young peopl should spend much time by studi for exam or by have stress becaus of the uncertain of what they will confront in their futur . time that pass too fast , ha a strong pressur on younger which prevent to enjoy from their live . but when we think of a 60 year old adult who had earn enough money till that age of her life and prepar a good opportun to be abl to suppli a good educ to their children , ha her peac and she ha no more challeng with life ani longer . therefor , she ha a huge time to have fun , and noth to loos except money . besid , becaus of the fact that time pass so fast , a 60 year old adult doe n't think of anyth els except have a great time till her death . as the person feel that death is sooner come , there wo n't be ani other struggl or ani fight with life whatev the reason is . as i give my mother as an exampl , she is a typic retir teacher who ha enough money to live , and ha no respons for look after a child . for that reason she feel free to live without think of ani doubth or fear . she is go to trip with her friend and have great time with self satisfact . she live her own by the power of not have huge respons such as earn money or look after a child . consequnetli i can express that when i look forward futur , i would rather to be more older just in case to be abl to be more effect in life , by not just tri to do what life requir and also to do thing for myself either .
