thi world we live in ha alway manag to find it way of a chang such as what we have today : the common usag of car everi where . to be honest i would never suspect that there will be a fewer number of car ever , becaus the world isnt made to help peopl find anoth mean of transport . unless mankind succes achiev the prospect of spaceship or in other word float car , then there will be absoloutli no dought that i will be think differ . what im say is that it will take a much longer period of time for mankind to move on and give up on the car we use , probabl allot more than a hundr year if not more . ofcours im hope that a new type of transport mean would be achiev becaus car can be such a bother , for exampl car accid and park and most importantli car oil or fuel . our world preserv are die and it resorc are vanish into thin air , and whi do you think that is , just becaus we want to drive our car . im sure it mankind need for surviv but that doesnt make it ani less harm toward natur . in twenti year we will have lot of new idea and invent that for sure but we are go to face an absoloutli big problem with the anorm number of car be use and produc , the way i see it is that if we go on like thi we might not manag to last for long . i think that the car industri is at it peak these day i mean how much better can car get to be they alreadi manag to creat built in facil in car , some peopl can live comfort in a car . car are an amaz invent but it can be a doubl edg weapon if the number encreas through the next two decad .
