well i think it 's veri difficult to claim that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . the first quesiton is , what are old peopl , and what are young peopl ? it mainli depend on the person . let us say young peopl are between 18 and 30 and elderi peopl are about 60 year old . in thi case , young peopl have other interest than elderi peopl have . for exampl , young peopl are visit disco or concert with loud music , wherea elderi peopl are enjo a good dinner in a calm and relax atmospher with classic music in the backround . but i have to mention , that i also know peopl who are about 60 who still attend concert with loud music . for exampl the gener who grow up with rollingstons or acdc still goe to their concert . the onli differ is , that young peopl normali are in better shape then elderi peopl are . the older you are the more problem your are get with your physic condit . for exampl , young peopl can make more sport . elderi peopl have to care more about themselv . mayb young peopl are often more flexibel but thi is also a stereotyp . after my opinion thi is not veri import to enjoy life . usual , elderi peopl can do the same thing like younger peopl can do if they are care . they even have one import advantag , becaus they usual have more time and more money to enjoy their life than younger peopl have . if they have enough money , they can fli or travel to each place where they want to , wherea the younger one have to go to school , to univers or to work . the young peopl either have n't enough money to do thing or they have n't enough time . like i have written at the begin of thi text , how you enjoy life depend on your pesonaltiy and on your flexabl . if you stay in life and if you stil have fun , the age is n't so importan for enjo life .
