i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do them well . in my opinion they tri new thing to make themselev more interest peopl or just to show the intent from the other . those peopl alway want to go further new thing which isnt a good idea . take risk is a veri danger thing to do becaus they know what consequ they could get by do someth wrong . for exampl mani famou actor are veri popular for they good act or they beauti but we alway hear that there take risk such as tri drug which they know it veri bad , instead of not take those risk and do thing wich are more intelig . everyday we hear in the news paper about those success peopl who are do bad thing and alway talk rish instead of take care of themself , look after there family or enjoy life with happi . most of them doesnt think that life is veri short all they whant is to tri new thing wich dosnt help them onli for danger risk . i never understand those peopl whi do they have to take those ridicul risk and they dont know that it can bring them to veri seriou consequ like death , and some of them have a famili with children and that may effect the children behavour . they alreadi know how to do thing well so they should be intelling in not tri risk and give good exampl to everyon so that peopl alway had a good thought of them .
