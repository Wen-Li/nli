i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , peopl in japan studi a lot of fact , such as histori and math instead of idea and concept class when they were in elementari school , junior high school and high school . it is too much time to learn fact . they should studi class which understand idea and concept . second , almost peopl have pc , tv , tv game and cell phone , so they do n't like think someth . children often play the tv game in their hous , instead of go out with their friend .
