knowledg is made of two basic compon : the fact , that we can describ as the empir evid that our sens , or machin , provid us about realiti ; and the abil we have to extract actual inform out of thi unord data , which we may refer to as `` idea '' or better , as interpret . ani use knowledg stock must be made of thi two compon strongli integr . but even if both of the compon are foundament , they have n't the same level of usuful : while fact can be look up in book or ani other reliabl sourc , a strong conceptu foundat on a subject , which allow for rapid and effect extract of inform , can not be built overnight . specif in technic and scientif subject , it 's utterli stupid to tri to learn by memori the huge amount of formula , number , rule of thumb necessari for exampl in engin . it is far better to build up the technic and practic skill requir in such a field and then go back to the detail whenev they are need , and if possibl memor them over time and exercis , so that they will be stuck in our memori for year onc master , instead that for day or week . our memori can be easili parallel with an archiv : an empti archiv with a ration structur and the right label alreadi in place can be fill in no time , an archiv which is full of paper but where organiz mayhem reign , is go to be almost useless , or requir an excess effort to get anyth valuabl out of it . thu student should valu care everi side of the subject they 're stude , but put a stronger effort on build a conceptu foundat that will allow them to effect exploit what they have learn trough the year : they should nonetheless be veri care to `` fill the archiv '' to have someth to exploit in futur year !
