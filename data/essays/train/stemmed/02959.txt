i agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . although i agre with thi , i think there is a differ of the mean of `` enjoy '' between young peopl and older peopl . at ani time , we have a larg gener gap between young and older peopl . and i think nowaday that gap is increas more and more . i want to show the exampl of the convers between my mother and i , when we were watch `` gohst in the sell '' , which is japanes tv anim about the futur world that peopl live with robot . in the stori , almost all peopl have a comput brain in thier head instead of real brain , and they can process the inform or the data that they see through thier eye , like a comput now we are use . in that world `` ture human '' which are like us , are decreas . even they have a real brain in thier head , which is just tini part of it for live . after watch thi anim , i excit about the concept of the sotri . for me the comput is a realli familiar thing . everyday i use my comput for the assign which are given by my high school teacher . also i stoarg my favorit pictur , music , and movi in my comput . so when i watch `` gohst in the sell '' i even thought that i want the comput brain in my head ! but my mother wa deffer . firstli she could't understand ani concept about thi stori . she could't underst whi the comput brain in peopl 's brain , whi they are not robot and so on . final she said `` it is so bore . '' in truth , there are lot of dificult word about comput system , and also confus time passeg wa in the stori . but i realli supris at the fact that she did n't enjoy the stori . and i realis that what i enjoy is not alway what my mother enjoy . the mean of `` enjoy '' is differ between young peopl and older peopl . howev as i said abov , these day , technolog is everyday improv . new thing such as comput are sometim difficult for older peopl . but i know that there are mani way of enjoy life . i understand that everyon enjoy thier own life veri much .
