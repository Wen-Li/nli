in my opinion it is true that teenag and young adult do not provid enough time of their recreat time to contribut activ to their commun . there are three point to look at whi thi develop ha taken place in the last year . first of all , it is obviou that the young peopl are face a overwhelm select of acit and entertain platform . wherea our parent had no other choic than help their commun becaus it wa tradit and moral impos by the societi and also there wa noth els to do rather than thi , young peopl have a great rang of possibilti how to spend their recreat time . they can choos between a wide rang of physic , artisitc and cultur activ . most young peopl do not onli limit themselv to onli one activ , they even attend to sever . henc they do not have ani time left to provid to their commun . secondli , the societi ha been chang over the year and the develop tend to lean toward individu rather than commun . it is of utmost import to be outstand and perform extraordinari in order to stick out of the mass . it is not import to look after each other or to help each other , it is more import to ensur one 's own life and well-b . you can find thi phenomen of indiviu throughout differ social class . sinc the young peopl grow up in thi kind of enviro where it is essenti to perform indiviu , they do not experi the benefit of be part of a commun which can back you up in ani circumst . for them , help their commun seem like a burden . therefor , they are not will anymor to contribut anyth to the commun . furthermor , there is anoth point which ha to be consid whi teenag do not particip at their local commun anymor . mani commun are outdat and do not know how to promot themselv in a appeal way . if the commun would possibl agre on rejuven their imag and improv their program
