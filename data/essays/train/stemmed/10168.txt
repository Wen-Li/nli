i disagre it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . fact have more veriou phononem and interest for student to understand . it is more interest to see the fact than just memor the idea and the concept . peopl are more like to see the phononem than to read a book . for exampl , in a chemistri class , if the teacher intend to show the reaction in front of the students. , what will they do ? they prefer to do the experi more than just talk about it and let the student to imag . it is the easil way to show the process of the reaction , like the color , sound , smell . also , it ha the variati of the fact which can attract the student attent . if a teacher do not use the fact in class , the student maight feel tediou and bore to listen . at that time , they will move their attet to anoth thing . thay will caus bad effect to undetstand the knowledg . in conclus , it is interest to use fact more than memor . it is also a good way to help the student to rememb the mathod by prove it through the fact . sometim peopl maight not understand what the teacher are talk about in class . they need a better inprov to improv them understand . for exampl , the student may not understand what is the wave like . becaus of wave is not seen by peopl , it do not have the color , smelt and sound . at thi time , if the teacher use a fact which is like put the method into a experi . the teacher can show the wave by press the water and the student can see what is the water wave like . that is whi the fact have the better way to make the student understand . in conslus , use more fact are not onli interest but more easier to help the student to understand than just read idea and concept .
