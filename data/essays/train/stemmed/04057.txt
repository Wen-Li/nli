whether it is more import for student to unders idea and comcept than it is for them to learn fact ? when face with thi question , differ peopl may have differ opinion . in my opinion , to understand idea and comcept sometim is more import for student than to learn fact . my reason for thi are as follow . firstli , mani knowledg in our world are the idea and concept of thing . sometim it is difficult for us to reach to the fact becaus the technolog we 've got today doe not have the abil to do it . for exampl , when we studi biolog , there are mani thing about our human 's bodi that we ca n't explain how do they work , such us the memori system in our brain . we can onli guess it accord to the limit consequ . so most of the time we onli have idea and concept on these thing . student who can understand the idea and concept can help them develop their way of think and proceed their reserch . secondli , the knowledg in some scientif area are veri abstract . it is veri difficult or sometim even imposs to learn the fact . the art , for instant need us to feel . the idea and concept of an artist work is the onli thing we can use to understand it . they do n't tell us the fact . in addit , to understand idea and concept help us to poss the abil of use the knowledg . if a student onli know to follow the fact and never think about it , he or she probabl do n't know how to use it . their mind will be stuck with no person opinion and wide imagin . to sum up , nowaday , the most import tallent for a student i think is the creation . and if we alway think of the idea and concept of the thing and tri to understand them will help you a lot .
