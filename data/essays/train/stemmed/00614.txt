when we are young we spend a lot of time follow amus and keep enjoy , but when we grow we begin to leav these kind of entertain . the youngest peopl are less of problem or respons and so they can spend time onli to enjoy themselv . in my humbl experi when i wa young , my life consist in have fun . i keep meet with my friend and i wa not interest in think about my futur . but while the time pass , i would keep grow and also my idea and my kind of life . in fact now i have mani respons and i must have the just matur to decid when i can enjoy myself or not . for instanc , i 'm stude fashion design and i want to becam an import fashion design so sometim i must make some renunci to obtain my goal . in accord to my experi i agre with the statement that is , `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . but there are other case in which also old peopl enjoy their life like child . i disagre with these type of live becaus i think that when we are old we must reach a certain matur . we can not enjoy ourselv forev .
