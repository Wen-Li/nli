go on a nice vacat with a rel and without a tour guid is the most relax vacat . travel in a group ha it postiv and neg side . one of the neg side is that peopl have to compromis to other peopl 's suggest . if a tourist travel alon or with a partner , they have the opportun to go wherev they want and to do wantev they want . to see a forgein countri and it origin cultur , tourist have to step out of the box and leav the tour guid behind . go into a tini villag far away from tourism in which no tourist have been , is an adventur that speak for itself . who want 's to see a place that ha been seen by million of other tourist ? my famili and i went to kenya , south africa , and visit the tini villag along the river . we were the onli tourist they had seen in year . we saw the `` real '' life they are live and realiz how great we should be for a life like our . thi experi show that not onli will a vacat be memor by see the hotel pool and hotel buffet but also by do someth excit - someth out of the box . consid the statement , i have to admit that it depend on age wheather tourist choos to travel in a group led by a tour guid . it would be more amus and excit for older peopl to join a group sinc they like the compani of other older peopl . older peopl would also enjoy the freedom of let somebodi els do the work - like a tour guid - and relax and enjoy their vacat . at the end , it is a person choic rather peopl want to travel alon , with a partner , or with a group . everi choic ha it posit and neg aspect .
