some of the student tri to understand the idea and concept rather than in learn the fact . and some of them feel that fact are import than the idea and concept . the idea ha import in hi own way as they are import when you are in a dilama and the concept of idea is o.k.and when come to the fact it tell the truth that had happen in the past . idea and concept are import to the student where they can react to the situat in a few minut and overcom to solv the problem which we are in . the idea and concept they tri to improv our abil of think and help in the research process which is the main thing that is cosid one of the import thing that ha to be rememb . fact these tell about the thing that are goi happen and is go to be happen in the futur . thi also is import for the student to learn . i agre with the idea and the concept than learn the fact . it help in develop the student individu in think and decis make as we observ in today societi the thing are chang rapidli , so inord to over come the idea and the concept play a veri much import in student carrer . sharp idea and the concept make a student to settl in a better posit rather than fact . i conclud that from the abov disscuss that both are import in there own way . some think that idea are import where some think fact are import for the student .
