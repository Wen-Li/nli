although some peopl consid that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , i disagre with thi statement . there are mainli two reason that make me think it is fals . fisrst of all : what doe ` enjoy ' mean ? i think that thi term is too often associ with parti , and all these kind of thing that young peopl do . usual , young peopl enjoy go on holiday with friend , to the sea , to the mountain and so on . or they can have fun by organ some big parti , or by go to music show . that is the way the most of young peopl ` larg it up ' . but i think ` enjoy ' life is more than that . mayb that older peopl have not the same expect concern their even and their life . for exampl , they meet friend to discuss or to play card instead of danc all night long . they may also be happi becaus they have children and they see them grow , and becaus they form a famili . to conclud i think that enjoy life depend on what you mean by ` enjoy ' , and that the criteria of enjoy vari with the age of peopl . that is whi i wrote that it is possibl to enjoy life at an equal level , if you are a young person or an older person .
