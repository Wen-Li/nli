nowaday , in our societi , we have two import problem that make me agre with the statement given . the first of that problem is the pollut . human be are gener a lot of pollut , and one of the most pollut element is the car . mani expert explain that problem like the climat chang and the problem with the atmospher is caus by the smoke of car and factori , special factori relat wtih the product of fuel for the car . the second problem is that it is thought that energi sourc like petrol will disapear in few year becous of hi great demand , so mayb in few year there are not go to be car becaus of the fact that they do not have petrol , so they wil not abl to work . on the other hand if someon could discov a new energi sourc , like for exampl the water , the second problem told befor would disapear . instead of that i believ that in a few year some new invent will be discov , a new transport way will be design and so the car will be an old fashion transport . i think that someth will be invent for two reason , the first one is that in the era we live now , the technolog is in constant develop so the discov of a new invent is onli a question of time . the second reason is that becous of the problem of pollut , if we want to preserv our enviro it is neccesari the discov of a clean and safe tranport . in conclus , i agre with the fact that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than now , with the help of the technolog we will apreci thi in few time .
