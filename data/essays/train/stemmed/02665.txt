it is wide said that young peopl do not consid their commun and tend to do whatev they want to without think how peopl are annoy by them . if you watch some program for middl age on televis , you may hear thi kind of comment frequent . howev , i disagre with the opinion . young peopl , especi univ siti student have enough time and , in fact , help thier commun . univers student are encourag to help thier commun in and out of class . first of all , univers student tend to have much more time to use thier time for help thier commun . it may be true that young peopl like highschool student do not have much time to use freeli becaus of the entranc examin of univers . in some societi , especi in korea and japan , young peopl are stress to go to better univers and be employ by walthi compani . howev , student in univers less worri about examin ani more though , ofcours , there still be term examin . second of all , some univers even encourag student to help thier commun . in fact , some univers have servic learn cours which let student to do volunt work and learn it import and difficulti . some student may prefer to go to work for commun which is far from their own , the other do for their own , which is much easier than go to futher area . final , some student do help thier commun as an off campu activ . talk about my own experi , i wa a member of the music club which held mussic or other thiatric perfom for small children and elder peopl at kindergarten and commun center as volunt . the off campu activ can not be limit on thaeatric performac but be vari . student can enjoy thier activ and , at the same time , help thier commun . univers student have enough time than other and do help thier commun in class and also out of class as activ . in conclus , i further disagre with the opinion that young peopl do not help peopl becaus of no time to do .
