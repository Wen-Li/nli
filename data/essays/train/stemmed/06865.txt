i have a simpl idea about thi question , becaus there is not a subject more import than other . i think that a person must know mani academ subject becaus it is a import for all life . for exampl in my school i studi mainli lecteratur , matemat and scienc . probabl in my futur life i will do not use the lecteratur or the scienc but i will use more matemat becaus i want to do a architect . thi doe not mean that i do not studi lecteratur or scienc . it mean that , of thi two materi i can not know specif subject but it is quit a gener knowledg . to differ , probabl i will use more matemat in my futur work and of thi materi i must know more specif subject . my idea is thi , it is more import knowledg of mani academ subject but it is not import ( mayb imposs ( know all of all in specif . it is import have a gener know of all and know the specif materi and aspect of own intrest . the special is a import aspect for the futur work but it is imposs whitout a primari gener knowledg . mani materi are correl and more aspect are interrel , so it is import have a gener know of thi . it is veri erract think at gener knowlwdg or at speific subject , both are import . in my specif , i like know mani academ subject becaus i have mani and differ intrest . for exampl i like studi botani and pop music . natur i can not studi thi in specif way but i tri to do it . in conclus i think that the peapl must know all in gener and some aspect in specif subject . the import is studi veri hard and
