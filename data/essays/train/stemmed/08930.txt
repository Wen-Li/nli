to special in one specif subject is realli veri use , but in my opinion it is alway better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject in thi competet world to excel in life , i.e `` jack of all trade master of none '' . specialist are peopl who special in one specif subject and have a veri detail inform of that subject , so he can excel in field which is onli concern with hi subject moreov have a detail knowledg of the subject will provid him with and extra advantag of do research in hi subject . wherea a person who have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject will be unabl to go ahead and work in detail in ani particular subject . but in thi highli develop world , where develop are go at a veri fast pace it alway happen that to invent someth it requir peopl who have knowledg of variou subject rather than be a specialist . e.g i am a student of of mechnic engin veri much interest in my subject and look forward to pursu a career in mechan engeer . but in an industri mani thing goe on , mani mechan process are combin wiyh electr process to get some result so it will benefici for myself to have the knowledg of the electr process to have a complet understand of the complet proce . secondli it is also an advantag of a person with a broad knowledg of mani subject that he can select hi career from a wide varieti of choic and not just confin himself to a particular subject or field . so summar the point i would like to favour the point that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani subject than to special in one specif subject , becaus knowledg of mani subject is reqiur to get the total inform .
