now a day , the media is flood with advertis . from medicn to sport , form food to car , the media comun to the world new and sophist product everi day . howev , mani of these new product seem to be idealist and fantast to be true , thu question it reliabilti . for exampl a medic drink for fat peopl that doe not involv diet or do sport . i beliv that modern advertis is in fact the new type of propaganda , the media is flood our mind with half truth and half lie at the same time . the new machin for indoor sport are a typic exampl of thi . new machin that are suppos to work magnifici over a small period of time , are not onli expens , but also innefici . on the other hand , the poor reliabl of adverstis wa impos by ourselv . the consumer societi we live in is constantli demand for perfect , so that is whi adverstis tend to alter or bend the truth to some extend . for exampl , if i see an advertis about a restaur , it is not enough for me to see the qualiti of the food they sell as their product , but it is more interest if they tell me about the qualiti of their product , like how good their meat is , or how tasteful the bread is . therefor , thi need of flare in comun way ha creat , for me , a differ idea of the product offer in a certain piec of adversits . although thi may be true , occasion some piec of advertis are realli reflect the true imag of the product they are sell . for exampl , machin and technolog to make our daili live easier , like new blender machin or washer , trulli perform to the level the advertisemt say it doe . howev , for oneself , it may no be the case but the reason for thi is that the machin is misus or it purpos misunderstood . in conclus , i believ advertis sometim exagerr product , but also , sometim it is us that can not use them appropi . therefor i beliv that although advertis do make product better , we must also be careful on how we judg these advertis an if we truli understand how the product work or to waht end .
