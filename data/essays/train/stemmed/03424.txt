i am agre with the statement that sucess peopl tri new thing and take a risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus if you do not do mistak you will never learn . peopl should tri and learn new thing even if they do not like to do it . some peopl do not like to do someth strang at least in their eye becaus they do not have ani experi about it . otherwis , how they could write and read if they do not tri . everyth will becom hard and imposs if you do not tri sever time to get it correctli . my experi with that when i wa in high school , i wa so outsid and i do not want to lear a new thing especi lear kind of sport as an exampl . when i decid to play tinn , i fail sever time in that time and then i gave up . after i graduat from high school i becam a nimbl when i play thi sport befor it wa my bore sport . then , i tought peopl in the club how to play thi sport . learn a new thing let peopl avoid their previou mistak that they had alreadi did in the past . when peopl attempt to do a new thing , it will be hard and bore at the first time but it is not imposs . albeit , human discov lot of thing like space , ice age , and they also make lot of industri thing like car , machin , and ... etc and becam popular becaus of that , so , whi not you . keep someth in the mind that lot of exper that the scientiest did , they alreadi had mistak with it but they tri it again and again . eventulli , they got accuret becaus they did not gave up or they said it is difficult . peopl should pay attent to what is go on around them in thi world . lot of famou peopl did mistak but they are success . they are success becaus they made a mistak and they also learn from the mistak . when i wa in high school , i did not get a good grade . so , i wa so sad becaus i could not be success man in my school . then , i decid to learn from my mistak and correct them in the next semest of school .
