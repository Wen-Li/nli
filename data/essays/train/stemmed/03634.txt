i strongli agre with the idea that twenti year from now there will be fewer car on road than there are now . first of all , as the petroleum becom expens becaus of ever increas demand , deplet of current easili access and cheapli drill well not to mention the increas cost associ with find new sourc of petroleum , the peopl will becom more reluctanct to spend huge money on ga and henc might feel motiv to use car-pool or public transit system . secondli , such huge rise in price will also motiv govern to increas invest on public transit system such as subway and metro . invest will also be made in reserach and develop of faster mean of convey with more secur featur than a car can provid . if the car on road grow on increas at current rate , it is highli like that so will accid . a safer and faster way of convey , if develop , is bound to attract peopl and henc fewer number of car on road . anoth consider is the traffic jam if the number of car keep on increas . the infrastructur is limit in ani countri and it can not match the pressur public is put on it by bring up new car on road . eventu , there might be no room for infrastrctur improv in most countri and henc one will not be abl to avoid daili ritual of traffic congest . thi situat is bound to make peopl give a second thought on use public transit or car-pool than travel in one car all alon . in fact , if ani of the reason i mention abov - the price of ga , the accid , the traffic congest , no room to expand infrastructur - becom veri wors , the govern of that countri might have to regul the product of car or creat special permit to buy car . such regul might seem to breach human right in the first place , but they will do greater good to public at larg in long run than harm . to conclud , the fact that natur resourc such as petroleum and the possibl of infrastructur expans are limit , it is certain that in twenti year from now , the number of car in use will be fewer .
