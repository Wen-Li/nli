advertsi ha been one of the foremost discuss issu in my countri as in mani part of the world in the last few decad . altough some peopl do not think advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , domin peopl think vice versa . accord to the domin peopl compani think their own budget , so their advertisemnt do not show true product . and i also think like domin peopl . one of the crucial reason for my belief is compani behav selffishli and they do not think the custom price . compani show their product more attract . that is whi peopl want to buy thi thing . and as the time pass peopl are abl to understand thi product are not use and beauti as much as shown in the advertis . anoth reason for my belief is , peopl alway want to have much more attract product . especi nowaday peopl do not think their need instead they almost think atract . in addit to thi , compani know thi situataion beacus of thi they advertis their product much better than they realli are . thu , thi situat is good for both side , compani and custom , nobodi complan from thi situat . the last but least reason is that , compani alway compet with each other for have much more reput . due to thi reason they alway want to show their product more use and more qualti as well as more attract . henc , they want to advertis their product more effici . moreov , sometim product are not relat with real one . take the point i have mention abov into consider , it would be appropri to say that compani use advertis to have a bigger pforit . in addit to thi , they use custom to acchiev their aim . compani think selffishli , and they use peopl 's feel which about the have more attract product as well as they reflect their competit to custom . all of these reason i strongli hold the idea of advertis make product seem much better than realli are .
