to begin with , i do not agre with the statement which is expos . to my mind , i think that student must understand idea and concept ( absolut ) becaus it 's a way for them to matur , and also learn fact . on the one hand , when they understand idea they can afford expos their opinion . the best solut to it is to attend school becaus it 's a good way to attend differ type of class and to understand differ thing from each one . the fact of speak with student can make one 's view . go to school allow you to ask question to professor if you do n't know someth or do n't understand someth . for exampl a student who use to believ that doctor kelli commit suicid and whose profesor explain him the real caus of hi death will be more effici after becaus he understand someth . on the other hand it 's realli import on a student 's life to learn fact . inde , the best solut to learn fact is to be confront by . you can read magazin , watch televis , surf on the internet , in a word to put forward with time . when the unbeliev war in iraq wa declar and when peopl seen all that happen in thi countri , they learn someth : violenc is not the best solut to solv a problem . besid , someon who is close to hi parent and doe n't cope with the exterior will not be abl to face situat and to leav the famili nest , he will not stand on hi own two feet . that 's whi he had to read , listen or everyth els that can help him to know what happen in the world and in that way learn fact . anyway it 's better if you are open-mind and not narrow-mind with the world 's fact . to sum up understand idea and concept are as import as learn fact becaus it not ban you of have a differ vision and opinion of thing , and it allow you to creat your own personn .
