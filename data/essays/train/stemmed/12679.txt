i agre with the statement that `` young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun '' . becaus in thi modern world there are mani thing to concern with to them and the young peopl donot find time to help their commun . the young peopl are most enthusiast when they are do some thing . easpeci when they are spend their time for a varieti of aspect , they may includ studi , play , watch the new vesion of film , listen music and to be say honestli they much inclin to enjoy themselv . most of the young peopl are student . they do not find much time to think about commun , their life goe through their studi . most of the young peopl are ignor the commun due to their compet among themselv . at thi era of their life they put more concentr for develop their futur . they donot spend their time for think about commun , also it is not possibl for them to help the commun at that time . becaus everi student is rule by hi or her parant . one may think that he or she can serv the peopl when they stand success in the sociti . thi may be the best time for ani young person to think and serv there commun . there are mani young peopl who are mainli face the problem of poverti , thay even can not efford for their educ , in such a way they are in capabl of help societi . accord to my opinion final i can conclud that the age of the young peopl is the mainli and onli caus that put them to ignor their commun .
