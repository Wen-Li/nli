i disagre with the statement . becaus i think that , do someth we are known is more easlier to handl . success peopl have done someth that he good at , and thi thing make him success . use disney for exampl . everi year , they will have new cartoon to show us . mani peopl all over the world must watch them . becau disney is good at creativ cartoon . these cartoon make disney famou , success and wonder . disney also ha their own disneyland . it is a famou stori that everyon know . howev , if disney tri to do someth they have n't done befor , such as they go to have a fashion store to sell some high fashion cloth . i think it may be not work . becau they are not good at creativ fashion thing , they ca n't use the same way to creativ fashion from creativ cartoon . may be they can success at the end . but i have no idea about the date they can do it . befor they are success in the fashion are , they must lose mani time and money . peopl can not know about whi disney want to creativ fashion . becaus all peopl just know their cartoon is fantast . no one will beliv that they can do it at the began . peopl will have some brand of fashion to buy cloth . becau these brand are good at fashion . they will not tri to creativ cartoon . so , i think wherev sucess peopl or noraml peopl . they just want to do their best thing of what they good at .
