the number of car is a problem , a problem for the planet , a problem for a citi . we need to reduc thi number to pollut less and increas the atract of the big citi . all thi thing are evid but , if the question is : do you think there will be fewer car in twenti year , i aswer with no hesit : no , and for two reason . first i think that fewer car can come from a revolut in poepl mind . to me , we are no readi to abandon the concept of : a famili , a hous , a car . in spite of all the good argument ecologist can give , everybodi will feel the need to hqave got hi oun car . of cours citi are develop bu system and metro line but it will never be enouth to accept to to by a car . i admit that mayb it can provoqu some chang about how often poepl use the car . onli for the week end or in vacat . then , we have to chang the level of analysi . car question is a global issu and we have to consid the problel on the intern level . if we can admit that we will see less car in the big citi of develop countri , it is difficult to imagin the reaction if somebodi explain to china citizen that they did not have the right to buy car . today thing are not go so bab but can we imagin the situat when asian poepl will be rich enouth to buy a car ? to some extent , we could say that global develop forc us to integr the idea : no , it is imposs to think a world with fewer car awar of the consequ of globalis . to conclud we can say that , if we can imagin less car for europ , it is impossil at the planet level .
