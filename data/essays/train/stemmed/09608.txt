i think the issu pose here is actual a combin of two extrem . the veri purpous of all the human activ is the quest for knowledg . right from the ancient time , man 's quest for knowledg ha taken him to mani ` until-then-undiscov ' realm of priceless inform or knowledg . so `` knowledg '' as the word indic can be interpret as know till the edg . but gather inform or collect detail of everi aspect and work of thi world is no less than a ` herculean ' task . everi person ha a particular field of interest or an area of interest where in , the more he studi about it the more he enjoy . so one can explor joy in know more about what he like or what interest him . thi is noth but specialis . it actual satisfi the inner desir of a person to know more about the thing or concept he like to it complet . on the other hand , have a deep understand of onli one subject or one concept without know anyth about the other area might crippl a person in thi ` oh-so-tough ' competit world . everi person ha to have a basic knowledg about vast subject area and field . let take a simpl exampl of a modern day scienc professor . let say that he teach physic to the fullest he know and surprisingli if he hate the subject mathemat he might be lose the race over the other . becaus . mathemat is the languag in which physic principl are express and if he doe not keep hi mind open to the new theori or principl be invent or discov in the area of mathemat he will be miss a chanc to express hi physic principl in a more effect way to the student . so have a broad knowledg of mani subject area than special in one subject will definit give an edg to everi person in today world . ` knowledg is wealth and it is good to have mani varieti of wealth ''
