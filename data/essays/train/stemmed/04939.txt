today it is veri difficult to invent new thing or find new way to be succes . but what is the best way to be success ? should you take risk ? and for which person it is easier to take risk ? in my opinion it is not easi for an unsuccess person to take a risk . becauso there must by ani reason becaus thi person is unsuccess . so perhap an unsuccess person alreadi took some risk which were not success . so they are in a kind afraid of take new risk . if the new idea is wrong they will lost again . and thi is differ at success peopl . they have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risk . they are not afraid . if the risk wa wrong there is a base under them and nearli noth could happen to them . but one reason whi success peopl are success is that they take risk . for thi i will give an exampl . you have to imagin you are the ceo at a big compani and at the moment the number one with your product in the world . but there are sever smaller compani which are come closer and closer . one day a custom want you to creat a new product , but with your machin thi is not possibl to take the order . the custom sai that he will go to the other compani if you do not built or creat the necessari machien . take the order will cost a lot of money and the success is not sure . what would you do ? i think it is much easier to take the order for a compani with veri much success . they know they can take risk becaus if the order will not be good it will not be all over . it is differ for a ceo who 's compani doe not work right . on the one hand the compani need the order but on the other hand it is the end of the compani if the order will not be success . anoth reason is that success peopl alway want more . so they do not think about as much as unsuccess peopl . so i think it is easier to take risk if you are a success pearson .
