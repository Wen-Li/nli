nowaday there is great controversi over the time young peopl spend help their commun . mani year ago , it wa veri common see young peopl help their commun in activ such help in church , school and so on , dure last year old peopl have notici it ha decreas the number of youth who help their commun . from my point of view , it is a matter of fact that the number of young peopl who help in their commun ha decreas in last decad . for instanc , when i went to my church ten or fifteen year ago me and my friend help to do all the thing that the preacherman could not do by himself ; but as we have grown up there are no young peolp who help in church and , in fact , the elder one are those who help the preacherman in order to go on with the mass . there are mani reason that can help to understand thi problem . in the first place young peopl are so ineterest in new technolog that they are forget so import valu such as famili or friend . what i mean is that they spend so mani hour play with comput or watch tv that they forget what is realli import in life which , i believ , is the peopl around you includ famili , friend and , of cours , your commun . it is obviou that if you do not care about your famili you will not care about your commun . on the second place , we live in such a competit societi that parent do not spend enough time with their children to educ them in the same as they were educ by their eldest . as a result , young peopl have not receiv the learn of help those around them . if you ask to me , i think that the lack of help from young peopl is an import problem becaus it is produc a great seper between the young and old peopl in their commun , and the onli way to resolv it is give a better educ to the littl one in order to avoid thi problem in the futur .
