i think that in today 's world even if a product is of excel qualiti and is veri use , it still need to be advertis in order to reach it sale potenti . have said thi i complet agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . there are coupl of main point i want to state here in support of my conclus . first , there is no way for the consum to valid the claim be made about a product in advertis . the onli way to figur out if the claim are right is by actual use the product or talk to other who have use the product . the advertis of the product exploit the dificulti face by consum in valid the product relat claim , by make claim which have no suppot evid . the best exampl of thi is the claim made by mani of the weight reduct pill on the market . the advertis claim that the pill will reduc weight by 50 to 100 pond in coupl of week . second point is the fact that the advertis use well know celebr to advertis and market bad qualiti product . just becaus a is act in an advertis for a product doe not mean the product is good . most of us know thi fact . but associ of the celebr with the product doe seem to influenc peopl buy decis . thi tell us that even though the product is not of the best qualiti , the advertis made it seem good just becaus it ha a celebr cast . for exampl in india the superstar actor amitabh bachhan act in so mani advertis for product which are bad in qualiti , but just becaus he is part of the advertis the product are baught by mani peopl .
