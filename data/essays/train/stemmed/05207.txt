the educ system ha alway been a veri critic discuss issu for all societi . some societi have favour student to specialis in onli a few subject from the earli age wherea other societi have favour student to have a broad knowledg of almost mani academ subject until the veri last year in their educ period . there are pro and con to both approach . as in turkey ; we tend to cramp student ' brain with so much detail and technic inform from the veri earli age that they start memoris and when the exam are over they can rememb veri littl of what they learn . although it is quit accept that they learn a lot about almost ani subject matter how much of the inform they can use later on in life is definit debat . on the other hand in countri like uk children start specialis around the 5th year in secondari school . thi system allow a student to alloc time onli to hi select subject and prevent the student from alloc time for subject that he is not interest in . the student in uk select 5 or 6 subject they are interest in pursu in further year and after they take exam base on those previous select subject they get qualifi to select 2 or 3 subject out of them which will if they are successful eventu enabl them to gain an entri to a faculti that they want . as they alreadi have a solid background befor they start univers the univers also benefit from thi . univers in uk donot have to reeduc student for the class they have to take in the univers as turkish univers have to accomplish these day . as a conclus i would definit support a uk like system where a student can specialis in fewer subject . on the other hand it is also true that an educ system should be abl to make up for the cultur gap student are experienc with their own histori literatur cultur etc in order to gener godd enough societi . ps sorri i couldnot locat where the comma is on thi keyboard so i could not place comma where they should be place
