i truelli believ that the best way to travel is with a group led by a tour guid becaus thi will save you time , money and will be more enjoy than be by yourself travel . one of the reason is becaus the tour guid know better the area and he will take you to the place that are more import in the area which you are travel through . for exampl if i make a trip to brasil by myself i probabl will not know what part i should visit becaus im not familiar with the area , and due to it i wont visit part that are tourist atract . on the other hand if i go to brasil with a group led by a tour guid i will be definetli taken to the main visitor atract due to the expiri and knowledg of the tour guid . anoth reason is that you will save time and money becaus you wont spend time tri to find place unknown for you due to the guid of the person lead the group . as an instanc , if you tri to get to an unknown place while you are travel by yourself you can spend more time ask the peopl where is that place locat and also you will spend more money pay tax to get to that part that you are look for . in addit if you travel by yourself you may get bore becaus you wont know anyon rather than if you travel with a group of person from your citi or countri becaus you may feel more familiar with them and it is a good way to meet peopl due to the time that you will spend with them . for exampl if you do a voyag to europ and you dont speak the languag you may find difficult to start a convers with someon due to the unknown languag therefor you wont realli meet peopl and you might start to feel bore due to it . as a conclus , i can say that i rather travel with a group led by a tour guid rather than be by myself travel .
