are young peopl nowaday not give enough time to help their commun ? i disagre with thi statement becaus i think mani young peopl give enough time to help their commun . first of all , while you attend a school , the school requir a certain amount of time of help your commun . moreov , almost everi univers requir those time when you appli for the univers , so you have to help your commun if you want to enter the univers whether you wish to help your commun or not . some of the young peopl may think that they are forc to do thi , but it doe n't chang the fact that young peopl are do the commun activ . secondli , there are mani club which are organ to serv for the commun in univers . these club are made with the student ' freewil , not against their will . for exampl , i am an univers student and current i am a member of a club mainli help the orphan and serv in orphanag . thirdli , older pepl usual have more famili member to feed than young peopl , so young peopl have more finic , mental , physic energi and time to help the commun . my father , for exampl , use to go to a volunt ' club to serv in a certain place that need peopl 's help like a place for the disabl befor he got marri , but after he got marri and gave a birth to me , he doe n't have enough time and energi as much as he use to have , so the frequenc of hi visit to a club ha decreas and he doe n't go there ani more now , even though he want to help . final , young peopl are more open-mind so they are will to help the other than old peopl . becaus the fact that you are young mean that you have a flexibl mind so that you can understand the circumst that other are face veri well . thi will make you easier to help your commun . for those reason , i think that young peopl nowaday give enough time to help their commun unlik the statement .
