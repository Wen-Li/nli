i think that be succes in life depend on your person persept of goal , determin and commint to your plan . be succes also reli on your habil and capabili and in the type of choic that you have to make in time . i do agre thought , that take risk o make riski desicion can make succes a life plan , becaus in order to achiev goal sometim the thing we can do well will not help us at all and therefor risk factor becam part of the ecuat . for exampl if we love our job but it ask to do someth that we are not use to or we do not know well how to do we have two option . 1. take the risk of do it , take into account all the extra work that the task repres by itself , or 2 . we let other person do the work and fail . if we decid to take the risk , we have to be awar that it is go to be difficult and sometim an extra effort ha to be done in order to finish the assign duti . the final outcom of the desicion whether it good or bad it depend on the perform of the person , but the standup point it that no matter the outcom , we have to alway learn from everi situat , make the good or the bad experi success in term of person growth . final i think that no matter the situat we should be alway look forward to challeg our knowledg and take some risk , think that we have to learn from our daili experi so in the futur , all desicion made are go to be taken base on uppon them .
