the role of media and advertis on our live ha alway been an interest topic for me . the push media play a signific part in our decis give process and consum pattern . i strongli agre that most of the advertis impos to us effect our buy decis and make the product seem better than they realli are . first of all , the product advertis on sever media channel mostli do not reflect it real physic apper in term of size , shape , or color . by the help of advanc technolog such as comput program and new view technolog in creativ scienc , it becam so easi to make adjust on the physic apper of a product . as a result the product seem much more attract to consum on tv or newspap . but when you go to buy the product you realiz that it doe not look as good as it wa advertis addit , in term of qualiti what is promis by the firm is mostli not realiz after the purchas stage . it is easi to promis on ad rather than realiz it . for exampl in my countri mani home applianc firm which basic produc wash machin or refriger assur their custom that their good will not be broken for three year . and if these good are broken they guarante afford the cost of fixat . in realiti the item you buy gener break down in less than three year . wors , when you email or phone them to transfer your complaint or dissatisfact , it is a tini possibl that you will get assist . lastli firm are get more wild on earn more profit becaus of the financi instabl in the world . war and econom crisi alway fluction in economi . therefor compani in order to strengthen their financi stand and improv their profit margin . they focu on advertis to increas their sale . as a consequ new way of advertis enter into scene which is lie peopl about their product and push them to buy without hesit . consequ i strongli agre that in today world most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are sinc the advanc technolog , eas of promis more and more and the financi statu of the countri and firm .
