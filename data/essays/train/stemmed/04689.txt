while some peopl say that there should be a tour gide dure the trip , i do not agre with the idea that go on a trip with a gide is beeter than go alon . there are two reason of thi : be respons and more chanc to commun with local . go on a trip make me more respons person in mani respect . for exampl , i have to make a reserv by myself and handl difficulti that i face dure the trip . if there is a tour gide while take a trip , i wiil reli on him or her too much and i will not do anyth need for the trip such as reserv a hotel . as a result , i will tend to be less respons person . in addit , if i got involv in troubl such as fight , robberi , or get lost , i would mamag the situat with my littl skill of the langag . thi experi will teach me how to overcom difficulti when i am alon , make myself respos . by contrast , if you are with a tour gide , he or her will all take care of you whenev you ask help . furthermor , indivudu trip or trip with out a gide will offer me lot of opportun to talk with local . for instanc , i can make ani schedul that i want and hang out with peopl with i get to know there . if i go to an ethin restaur to have dinner and make frind with local , i will enjoy eintir trip with them communicationg each other . howev , in a trip with a gide , you alway have to be in a group of visitor . in other word , you have fewer chanc to talk with local . in conclus , i prefer go on a trip alon to go with a gide becaus individu trip will produc more chanc to learn respons and commun with local peopl .
