i beliv the young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl , becaus young peopl alway think that there are in the begin of there life and they have a long life in the futur . on the other hand we have the older peopl who think that there life will end soon . anoth reason that i think whi young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl is that they do not have the experi of life , so everyth they do is interstint and new to them . but for older peopl they went into a lot of situat and problem , so they gain a lot of experi and when thaey go threw it again , they will think it is boar and old . young peopl are alway activ and look for some new and enojoy adventur . older peopl do not like to chaneg there situat and want to keep the same old stuff . whenev the person is young and healthi he ha more abil to enjoy what he is do , and whenev he start get old he start lose these abil . young peol alway look and search for thare fun , so they can enjoy there life befor get old . when you ask an old person about hi long life he will alway mention the enjoy time that he had when he wa younger , and he will love to start do it from the begin . young peopl are easier to have fun and enjoy life than older peopl . at the end i beliv that young peopl is easier to make them enjoy life than older peol
