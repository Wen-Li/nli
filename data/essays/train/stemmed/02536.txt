whether it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject is an interest question . some peopl think it is better to special in one , other think is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i think both are import , becaus it is import to have a complet but also specif prepar today . person , i believ that the best thing it is to have a gener prepar , infact i think it is import to have a broad knowledg , who can allow you to know a lot of thing and to be prepar about all argument than you are special onli in one . for exampl , when you are still student , you are not abl to choos your specif interest , becous you do not know all about the subject . at school you can attend mani cours , you have the opportun to discov a lot of subject and you are abl to make your right choic . howev , i think , after have a broad knowledg , it is an intellig thing to special yourself in one argumentat . the subject can be the one you love more or the subject that you need for your work . i think , for exampl , at the univers you can special yourself in one specif subject , and you can begin more practis in thi and you can increas your knowledg . in conclus , i believ , it is import to have a complet prepar , becous olni thi allow you to have a good work but it is import for your person prepar .
