i defin agre with the statement that the travel in group by a guid is the best , even though some peopl think they would like to make a trip individu . there are two reason for thi : cost of the travel and the chanc of make friend . firstli , i would like to point out that the cost of the group travel is lower that that of privat travel . in mani famou sightse place , there are discount system . for exampl , the fee to see a famou garden in kanazawa , japan is 1000 yen for individu visitor but is 300 yen for group visitor . furthermor , the rent of the sightse bu is extrem inexpens . in gener , the rental cost is set cheaper for the group travel . if a travel is go to take a bu or train , he or she ha to pay more money to move to the other place . the second reason is that we have mani chanc of make good friend dure the group travel . in the bu or train , a tour guid is gener explain the histori and the viewpoint of the next visit place . the member of the group can listen to the explan and discuss what they would like to see . thi convers will help peopl to make friend . dure my group trip to kyoto , i talk to mani ladi and discuss the histori of the citi . they listen care and want to know more about it . after the trip , i marri one of them . moreov , we will have a chanc to share the experi of the travel . we can exchang the e-mail address to other to send pictur . for all reason , a group travel is the best .
