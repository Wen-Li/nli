i do not agre with the statement that `` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i believ that the amount of car in the futur will be the same if not larger than in the present day . by analyz the past and compar it to the present one can notic the increas of growth in car manufactur . as time goe by more and more car agenc are be creat throughout the world , therefor more car are be made . there are mani type of brand of car that exist today such as jaguar , bmw , daewood , and other which did not exist 30 year ago . therefor i believ new agenc will keep surg and the increas in car manufactur and make will continu in the futur . also by look at the popul growth in the world and take into consider that car are the number one use of transport throughout the world , show that it 's demand will alway be present . the greater the popul , the larger the amount of car that will be need , and if the world 's popul continu to increas then so will the amount of car . in the present day car are the most popular mean of transport for the major of the peopl around the world , and until thi popular is taken or replac by ani other mean of transport , car will continu to be the greatest demand for peopl and therefor more will be purchas . overal i think that in the futur the amount of car will either stay constant as the present day or will be greater due to the continu emerg of compani which make car , the popul growth , and the poular of car . the demand for car around the world is too high nowaday to predict that there will be fewer one in the futur .
