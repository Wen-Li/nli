in my opinion it is better to be special in one subject . the first reason for thi is that nowaday it is import to be special . you need to be uniqu . when peopl are look for a job it is much easier to find one if you are an expert in your area . today mani peopl have a broad knowledg of differ subject , but i think that these knowledg are unimport and wo n't help to get a job . whi i 'm think thi ? well , most of the thing peopl with a broad educ know are onli basic to an expert . anoth reason whi i beliv that it is better to learn just one subject is that it 's much easier to concentr on it . you start with the basic and the topic will involv more and more detail as you keep on learn about it . if you are studi mani differ subject instead , you onli get to scratch the surfac each time . i know that support of the statement would say that it is necessari to studi mani subject becaus today mani area are link . in their opinion somebodi who ha a greater varieti in academ subject is therefor abl to find conculs in complex matter . i disagre with that becaus i do n't think that you will learn enough to solv a complex problem link differ area all by yourself . a group of expert on the other side should't have a problem with that . also , if you 're an expert , it is not that easi to replac you . but if you 're not an expert , it 'll be easi to replac becaus there mani peopl have the same knowledg . all in all , i think to be special ha more posit aspect than have littl knowledg of differ subject and should therefor be recommend to student .
