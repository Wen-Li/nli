is it import for student to understand idea and concept ? of cours it is we can not deni that studi a subject and learn thi subject doe not necessari impli that you undestood the whole idea and the whole concept . sometim might be better to understand the whole sens of a lectur at your first read for exampl instead of read it more and more time to learn everi singl word of it and be abl to repeat it in front of the professor dure an oral examin ! i would rather look like a comput machin repeat binari code without understand whi and what it is realli do ! i think that to better comprehend thi idea , comptur might be the perfect exampl . the whole concept is that scientist built the machin to help peopl perform their job easili simplif complex procedur use softwar base product . the machin is abl to perform all thi complex oper in a veri short time becaus somebodi program it to reapeat a matrix of data and multiplex it in differ way , the machin is abl to reproduc alway the same action but is definit not abl to understand whi is perform thi action , is not abl to learn from hi error , is not abl to modifi automat hi behaviour . that 's mainli whi i think ani sort of attempt to learn fact for what they actual are whitout understand what is the whole idea or concept behind them is total unus for the student . onc again if the student doe n't understand the concept he might not be abl to modifi hi beahviour ha the exampl of the comput machin , becaus without understand behaviour modif will not occur . you can learn from you error and mistak , a teacher can correct you if you are do someth wrong , peopl can learn from their own mistak , but if they keep on replic what everyonels is do and repeat what the manag or the boss say they will alway be stuck in their origin , let 's say `` behaviour '' no behaviour modif will occur , thu prevent them to emerg and to becom power or to express and sell their own idea .
