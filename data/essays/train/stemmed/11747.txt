i neither agre or disagre with the previou statement ( or better i recogn it unavoid realiti ) , i will provid below my reason ; i do n't appreci thi practic , even if i understand the reason which lead the advertis to adopt thi techniqu to promot product . the first reason is simpli practic , mani product do not look as nice in realiti as they appear in advertis , for exampl as regard pasta , usual expert use plastic copi of pasta in the make of their video advertis , becaus pasta is difficult to be manag and to look in an accept way for the long time need to record the video . the second and main reason is caus of market , peopl work in thi field believ and know that peopl do not use a product becaus they need it , but becaus it repres a dream , an illus , under which someth els is hidden : the individu need to be social recogn , the need to look in a better way , the need to look someon els , etc . so usual advertis depict an illusori imag of product , full of colour and bright , with dreami contour , in a rich and pleasant environ , etc . for exampl if we consid a car 's advertis , we could notic that we do not see onli the car , perhap move on a street , usual we would hear a veri rithmic music , after we would see the car , perhap in front of a luxuri restaur , a man in an eleg suit would come down and open the other car door to allow a beauti , sexi , girl to join him enter the restaur , perhap at the end we would see the coupl , insid a villa , on the border of a pool , drink two glass of , seemingli , champagn , natur the car is alway in front of the view . doe thi all reflect the real life of most of us ? i would say no , but it reflect our dream , our hidden desir of social power and recognit . they do n't sell a product , they sell a dream . conclud my discuss , i think that the topic the question is about , better look of product in advertis than realiti , depend on the way our societi is structur , a way in which appear predomin on essenc ; so i think it 's just inevit , it is not a matter of agreement or disagr .
