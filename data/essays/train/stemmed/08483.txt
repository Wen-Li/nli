to predict what will happen in the futur is almost imposs even to the so-cal futurist , but i can be sure that no matter what the shape will be , car will never be less use in twenti year . becom one world as time goe , the world is be combin togeth and the definit of borderlin itself is also be obsolet . we can easili find those exampl in europ union where the physic borderlin have been remov , and nafta where , although physic borderlin are still there , econom no borderlin exist . and as the nation are combin each other , peopl are move from countri to countri with their own car and trade are made between countri by car becaus of it conveni . urban as countri be industri , the citi will becom larger and more peopl will maintain most of their live in the citi . but the problem is , most peopl can not manag to live in the citi becaus of high cost live in the citi and as an altern , they will choos nearbi citi area as their residenti area to save cost . to live in the nearbi citi and to commut everyday to their day-lif area , the citi , they need to commut by their own car becaus thi is the cheapest and conveniest way . econom car today , peopl classifi their car as one of preciou asset they have and thi is not a surpris consid the price of the car . the other problem we are face is the expens we should sacrifi to use the car includ gasolin , maintain expens and park expens . howev , as the need of the car are shift to daili essenti tool , we can simpli imagin that we can buy veri econom car in the nearlest futur that consum less gasolin , less park place and , of cours , cheaper price so that everybodi can manag to buy it . in conclus , consid the conveni of the car and the chang which i have explain abov , i disagre that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use that there are today .
