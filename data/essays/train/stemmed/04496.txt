in my opinion , i strongli believ that in a close futur there will be more car in use than nowaday . i support thi statement becaus of all the think that i see each day of my life . to begin , the popul of the world is increas each day . thi situat is concentr in africa and asia . the previs for the futur popul in these counti are that it is go to growth and it is not go to stop . i have also notic that the number of car sold in these countri are increas veri fat and the number of person for each car is decreas . that mean that in a few year they are go to approuch and reach the us and europ statist about the number of slof car per inhabit . anoth reason whi i thing there will be more car in the futur is that the car are becom less and less expens due to the compet of the car market and of the new technolog that allow car constructor to produc at a lower price than ever . so , it is much more easier to have a car now that 5 year ago . i think that thi situat is not go to chang and i am sure that thi situat is go to be implement . furthermor , the proport of peopl who live in the big citi is increas not onli in asia and africa but also in europ and the us and the percentag of peopl for each car in the citi is much bigger than in the countrysid . so it will caus and increas of car in use . to conclud , the increas in the popul of the world and the proport of peopl who live in the cite , the amelior of the technolog and the are three reason whi i disagre with the statement that say that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
