dure our lifecycl , we encount differ period due to our age and we have to obey to bear certain role . we tri to make a promis futur in our younger period wherea we bear more respons in our older period . but when it come to enjoy life , doe younger peopl have more fun compar to the older peopl ? i think not , even though it seem so . in younger period of life , we will be persist , keep on tri to make a promis `` futur '' for ourselv . everi progress in mean of academ perform of field of busi is for make a basi for our futur . in short , we invest , to gain a futur . furthermor , we have less respons , which may seem to be priceless for mani peopl but not for me . have less respons mean that you have less control and effect in your life . when you are a child , your mum will buy your cloth , choos the meal you eat and even take stesp in your earli academ life . so , you are depend on your famili in your earli lifetim . as you grow and becom older you will increas the span of your respons . addit , younger peopl lack may be the most import aspect of success and surviv in life : experi . younger peopl are wors in decis make and success in everi field they are introduc to as new . doe be young ha noth to have fun ? absolut there are some . you can parti like crazi , live be depend on your famili and pay no care . everyth seem to be in order and you do not have to deal with that , then whi not just have fun of it ? as i mention earlier , thi is an illusionari situat and one have to know that his/her famili will not take care of him forev , so he/sh ha to invest for his/her futur . when we look into life through the older stage of lifecycl , everyth is establish and in order . we `` harvest '' our invest of younger period and have fun of it . we have establish what we dream of and we have reach the point , the point of success in our head . therefor , i thing one will be satisfi with his/her life in their older period . now , we have the respons of our life , even the live of our children or other , like our employe . anoth point is that we have the most experi in our older period , we know how to studi , how to be persist to reach goal and even how to have the most fun out of life ! to conclud , i strictli reject the idea of be younger mean enjoy life more . in my opinion , be younger mean that you are an unexperienc , unestablish passeng of the travel through life ; wherea be older mean that you are experienc and you are establish . the advantag i have state throughout thi essay of of be older will lead to enjoy life more than the younger one .
