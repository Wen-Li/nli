i disagre that ` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are todi ' for the follow reason . first , car are veri conveni . no other tranport can replac them . for exampl , car ha been ` a peopl 's leg ' . when i live in hiroshima , one of the local citi of japan , i can not move anywher without a car . social system are in the condit peopl can use a car . addit , i find it more in the countrysid , peopl can not go to shop without car . i believ that car are conveni and have been the tool for live . second , i think that car will be develop to adjust our life . the featur of car can chang and can solv the problem . for exampl , car comsum a lot of energi and pollut our environ , but now improv their mechan to reduc bad inpact . i believ that car will be develop better in twenti year and will not lose their possit . in conclut , for the reason mention abov , i strongli do not believ that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year .
