in my countri i think that it is veri difficult to help in commun . the school take away most of the freetim that a student ha . dure the past year i have been an `` au pair '' in the usa . one of the kid that i wa use to take care , a 7th grader , had to help in her commun and do some volunt work . i know that the school organ thi kind of thing and i think that is realli help for life that a kid find time to help other peopl . it give the person time to be with other peopl , time to talk about the thing that are happen around and see what your commun need to be taken care of . i don-t realli agre with the statement . becaus i think that there is not enough time sometim to help in thi realli import servic . i can speak for myself now say that soemtim i cut a littl time to help other but in thi way i found myself in a hurri to do other import thing that had a prioriti first . i experienc a commun servic in the state and i had no problem on find time for that . i had to collect cloth in a tini commun center for a thrift store . it gave me a so much that job that i would recommend to anyon that want to do a commun servic . and , there are a lot of other thing that would need to take care of , also , some funni thing to do with children while their parent are at work or give some help to poor famili that doesn-t have somebodi that can help them . i agre that mani peopl have time and they don-t care on help in thi kind of servic or they prefer to occupi theirselv in other thing . but mostli , i think that the main problem is in how the commun is organ and in how peopl expect it to be taken care of . mayb a littl bit more of relat between school and servic , also use for extra scholast credit , would make a differ on have more time for student to help in commun .
