i think advertis are soul of commerc . no one can sell hi product without advertis . i agre with the statement becaus i have found a lot of product that seem much better than they realli wa . i think the reason that could take a seller to use that kind of advertis is that peopl are realli impresson . if they see an advertis that promis them a lot , they certainli think that the product that advertis repres is better than anoth one which promis them less . nowaday i can say that a veri larg number of seller use thi kind of advertis . the first exampl i can talk about is diet product . in the televis we can see a lot of advertis say that use that product we could lose a lot of kylo in few week or day . we immedi can understand that thi it is an advertis that make the product seem better than it realli is . we all know that there is n't ani product that permit you to lose ten or twenti kilo in two week , and if it exist , it will be realli danger . i can talk about thi product also becaus my mother tri a lot of thi product , and no one of them ha given the result she want . anoth exampl i can use is bank or financi group which lend you money . in their advertis it seem like that you can use their money and to gave it back is realli easi . but there are a lot of claus , gener write small and in the end of the contract , that explain what you have to do to give their money back . gener here you can read about realli high tax of interest and other problem you will have to confront later , and that give you more troubl . the last exampl is shampoo . in the tv advertis seller promis you that their product will make your hair bright , strength , difficult to break and mani other promis that gener are n't true . i tri a lot of shampoo which have no one of the characterist i have said befor . in conclus i can say that advertis gener make product seem much better than they realli are .
