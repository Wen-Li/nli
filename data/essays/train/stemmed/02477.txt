i strongli believ that each subject you learn ha a long last contribut on your life and on your person . my dream is to learn and know everyth in order to bring myself to the fullest potenti , the question is : is that possibl ? in fact , it is not ! our life is too small for aciev a dream like mine with all the other issu surround us and need our care and time . furthermor , differ subject may not alway be in the same field , e.g : physic which is an essenti subject in the scienc field doe not match histori - a part of the human famili . in conclus it is better for us and for our preciou world and time to take a one way decis that we will take for our futur accord to our person , self imag , tendinci , capabl and all the other request need inform . special in one acadim field and not subject is the most essenti for me , for instanc : if i chose a way that is most suitabl for me and wish to pass it then i have to take a look on all the subway and instruct and neither pass it straightli nor blindli . i other word if i chose to special in aerospac engin then i must have a wide look on the other branch like physic , chimistri , mathemat ... at last i want to point that thi section of argument is so wide and complic but virtual , what happen in the real world is that we go with the river , we finish our school with an uneffici materi , regist for the univers with no clear imag to all the field that may fit us and then ... then we are in the hand of distini .
