knowledg is the key to success , is a say which goe a long way . without knowledg we as human are incomplet and not worth much . it knowledg which seper a fool from a learn . the most import form of knowledg in today 's world is academ knowledg . academi knowledg is what one need today to make a stand in societi . without academ knowledg one can not go far in life . i am personali of the opinion that a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than special in just one subject . with the fast chang world it better to have broader perspect and that includ broader knowledg in academ subject . i feel thi way becaus in today 's fast chang and ever evolv world it better to have knowledg about more subject that to be restrict to specif knowledg in just one subject . academ knowledg help us choos the career we wish to pursu in life . if we are vers with variou type of subject our choic are vast . we are not limit to a particular subject and the few option avail with it . we have a kaliedoscop of choic to choos from sinc we are better equip with more inform about variou subject . we have it in our hand to choos from those subject which we were abl to cope with or find interest or feel an aptitud for . therbi if we just specialis in a singl academ subject we are limit our own selv restrict our veri own choic . we also have the advantag that at ani stage when we feel that a particular subject that we studi can not be continu as a profess we can alway fall back upon the other subject we had studi and then adapt ourselv to our new career accordingli . to know what best for us we have to have knowledg about more than one subject . onli if we studi a subject will we know if we are mede for it or not or if we can appli it to our futur or not . and lastli i would like to mention that knowledg of everi kind is use . the more you know the better equip you are . the varieti of subject you studi the more awar you becom and it hepl you improv and grow as a person . if you stick to one particular subject it becom monoton and you tend to stagnat . for a balanc overal develop and approach toward life one need to be orient with a varieti of subject . and therbi i would like to end by say that academ knowledg should alway be welcom in varieti and abund and not restrict to a particular subject becaus the day the mind stop learn and gain knowlegdg , it stop be aliv .
