i have been work at a fast food chain for two year . becaus i have the most experi with the job than most worker , i train mani of the traine . as i taught , i made them learn the concept of make the product than to learn the fact . one day , when i wa on my break , an angri custom came to the store . he explain that the traine gave him a drink with milk powder , when the custom wa allerg to milk . the traine made an excus that she did not know what the powder wa made from . then , i notic the import of fact rather than the idea and concept . learn idea and concept may be a great place to start the educ , but fact are also veri import for a student . for exampl , a curiou student may be work on a experi use acid . the teacher may tell him the concept that the acid in the experi is danger . but , sinc the student is so curiou , that he may tri pore some acid on hi finger , to see what happen when you get an acid burn . soon , he would be suffer from major chemic burn , and be taken to the hospit . as it is said in `` pandora 's box '' , we are born to be curiou . onc we learn the idea and the concept , we must satisfi our pleasur by learn the fact . i can not say that idea and concept are not import ; we need them to learn . but just stop at the concept is not enough . we must proceed , and get better understand by learn the fact . ever sinc the incid with the custom , i learn a lesson to teach my traine the fact includ with the product . now that i think about it , who would train the traine the fact if i did n't share my knowledg now ?
