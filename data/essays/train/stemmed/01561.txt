i have been studi hard sinc i wa a child and now i am about to graduat in electron engin . in my univers path i chose the subject i want to studi and where i want to special in , so i sure think that it is better to acquir skill in one or few field than to have a broad knowledg , mainli becaus you will never be abl to have a cultur so wide that cover all the subject , and secondli sinc i am a pragmat person and i would like to be expert in my field . human cultur cover a huge varieti of topic and subject so i firmli think that no one is abl to build such a vast cultur . in fact i think that even the smartest person of the world such as einstein could not know everyth . moreov studi mani topic can creat confus or problem to rememb all the thing you have tri to learn . accord to my pragmat attitud i greatli prefer to acquir skill in a peculiar topic or field in order to becom an expert . have a deep knowledg onli in one field will help me to find a job that complet fit me and where i think i can contribut activ . in fact i think that everybodi ha to contribut to the benefit of societi in which he/sh live and there is no better way to do that than focus on one problem . in conclus i absolut disagre with the statement sinc i am tri to special in one particular field of elecron engin in order to becom an expert . in fact i think that i will serv the societi in which i live in a better way becaus focus on one issu i will have mani more possibl to resolv it .
