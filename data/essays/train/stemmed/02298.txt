the issu at hand is chose weather young peopl enjoy their live more than old peopl or not . i think that the answer to thi question is obviou , the young peopl enjoy their live much more than old peopl for four main reason ; young peopl can go to to entertain place , they have a lot of friend , they can be hierd easili anywer , and they are not count down for their live to end . young peopl can go to differ entertain place and have fun in their live , they can go to parti ani time they want , they can do most of the sport the want to do , even the hardest thing such as climb on mountain , or sky dive . howev the old peopl can not get the entertain the want wheever they want , that is becaus of mani reason , first thing they can not go to parti becaus it is not appropr for them to go there . also old peopl can not play all sport they want to play , and that is becaus their bodi are not abl to play these game , for exampl an old man can not go skydiv . young peopl can easili get new friend whenev they want , and that is besid their `` live friend '' , so they will enjoy have friend , and they can even do anyth thay want to do with them . on the other hand the old peopl face hard in meet with new peopl , and also we can assum that mani of their old friend are die or will die . youth can get most of the job , even employ usual are look for youth not old peopl to hire , and so all of the youth can get the job they like and enjoy them . but the old peopl can not get the job the want , and most of them can not get ani job , simpli becaus they are retierd , and if they got a job usual it would be a boar enterprenur job with no peer to have fun with . final youth can enjoy their live much more thn old peopl that is becaus the do not have to worri that they are go to die ani tiem , but old peopl are fear from the moment they will die . in a conclus , youth have much more fun in their live than old propl do , and that becaus young peopl have the opportun to see life .
