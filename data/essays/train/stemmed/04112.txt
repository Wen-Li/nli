i do not agre with thi statement becaus i think it is imposs for us to live without car . if it said there will be fewer car in use than there are in fifti year , i think i might agre , though . first reason i disagre with thi is that in america , peopl can not go anywher without use car becaus they do not have good transport system as we do . also , i do not think they can improv transport system such as train becaus america ha too larg contin so that it will not be easi to make railway all over the contin . i think thi can say in mani countri . next , car are realli use in our live . when sombodi in your famili get sick in the late night , you can drive to the hospit by yourself and it is much more comfort for sick peopl to move by car . if there will be fewer car in use in the futur , what will help our emerg trip ? a robot ? i do not think there will be new instrument invent in next two decad . thi is becaus it is hard to actual invent new thing than to just imagin it . and even the gasolin will not be abl to use in next twenti year , i think there will be new car move by some new energi rather than gasolin . moreov , even peopl are care about the environment issu which say that the ga from the car is harm the emviron , there are so mani car which doe not spew harm ga . although it is hard to invent new thing , it is much easier to improv old one . so i believ that we will not have to worri about emvironment problem about car . abov all , i do not agre with the statement which say that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year .
