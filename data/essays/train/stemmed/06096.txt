it my belif that whole purpos of educ is to train the mind to appreci , comprehend and eventu implement new idea and thought that come along through the cours of one 's life . henc , it is essentail not onli to understand idea but to have a will to tri and understand idea . unfortun , we now live in the `` techno-ag '' , where is it prime onli to deliv , irrespect of how you got to the end result . result are of paramount import as peopl and busi have lesser time to spare on detail and subtleti . howev , to deliv result effect and effici is it import to know the fact , and to know them well . let me tri and demonstr thi use the follow exampl . a student sits-up all night studi for an exam on the ` indian struggl for freedom ' . she feel passion for the subject , understand the emot at play and reason due to which one event led to anoth . but , on the day of her exam , she is stun when she look at the question paper . she ha been ask question requir her to state date of import event and name of revolutionari . she howev , wa so mesmer by the determin of the revolutionari , that she forgot to memor their name ! now , although she mayb abl describ the freedom struggl as a stori , her descript will be inaccur , lead to a low score on the paper . in conclus , i 'd like to say that , although learn fact can be as or more difficult than understand idea , it is import to be abl to do both . i will go a step further and say that , today everyon is expect to understand idea and concept . what differenti a win student from the other is the knowledg of hard fact and a knowledg of how to implement them .
