in japan , where i live , there are mani travel around famou place such as kyoto , fukuoka , and tokyo . as the way of trip , some peopl feel that travel in a group with a tour guid is the best way . howev , in my opinion , i disagre that the best way is to travel in a group . i prefer to travel individu . more importantli , i can go to travel when i feel to want travel . if i plan to go somewher , immedi i can go everywher and everytim . howev , if i go to travel in a group , it is necessari to arrang the time that member in a group can gather . for exampl , last sunday i went to hotspr alon in okutama , which is famou for hotspr locat in japan . at that time , i could go there soon becaus i did not need to gather friend . addit , individu travel ha a lot of chanc to touch local peopl . when i travel individu . i tri to talk to local peopl for know the real situat that i can never know from read a guid book . when i went to the unit state individu thi januari , i got wonder experi thank to talk to local peopl . when i spoke to polic in new york , i could enjoy to speak english and have fruit talk with polic . if i went to new york in a group , i could not have such an experi . therefor , from these reason i do not agre that the best way for trip is in a group led by a tour guid .
