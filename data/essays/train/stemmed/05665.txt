some peopl believ that young peopl can enjoy life more than older peopl do . other peopl believ in the other way which is older peopl have a more enjoy life than young peopl . as far as i concern , the latter is more reason than the idea mention earlier for the follow reason . in the first place , young peopl have more respons , which would allow them have less time to enjoy the wonder thing in their live , than elderli , as a older peopl , in a sens , there is no duti , such as rise a child , pay tax , and educ the next gener ; on the contrari , these respons are , now , weight on the shoulder of younth . they need to worri about mani thing , includ how to hold their job . and it is also the truth that an increas amount of time is be spent in the work place in order to hold the posit they hold now . that mean less and less time will be avail for them to enjoy the life . in the second place , older peopl have a more peac mind to enjoy the life . these is a grow tendeci for peopl to lose their ambit as their age is go up . compar to the young peopl , elderli feel more comfort with the life they are have now ; unlik older peopl . young peopl are alway on the way to seek someth better , someth they think deserv better . thi make them alway on the process of chase , leav no mind or mood the enjoy the life they are have now . final , older peopl can do number thing that young peopl are not abl to do . with the repect for older peopl take more and more import place in an increas number of peopl , peopl now build mani place onli for old peopl , and make more entertain for the older . these programm are more suitabl for elder . that 's reason some of the show can not be understood by the young peopl . all in all , young peopl cant not enjoy their life as much as older peopl do beacus they are have less time , and ambit mind to chase other thing . in addit , they ca n't understand someth that elder do . howev , i believ that in the futur , young peopl will enjoy life in a same amount that older peopl do .
