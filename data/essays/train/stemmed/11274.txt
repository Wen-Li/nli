advertis are the bread and butter of today 's commerci market and economi . they can be best describ as the `` necessari evil '' . although necessari , they can also contribut to wast of peopl 's money when they buy thing they like on televis but realiz long after that the product is not at all satisfactori . as an exampl , consid an advertis of a depress medic . if you watch it care you will notic that first it tell you all about it use and good effect and then it tell you about all the numer side-effect it can caus . it is realli interest to note that the side-effect are mention realli fast and can be overlook . and that the way the advertis is design to be . an advertis is made to attract peopl toward the product and if such an advertis is made for a non-prescript drug , a person may realiz all the side-effect onc they start use it . a second exampl to emphas the way advertis can act as a blindfold for the custom , is the promot for cosmet . the way cosmet are shown to improv an individu 's comlexion and beauti by show realli pretti face , the advertis often fail to indic that the brand be advertis may not suit everi skin-typ and may be harm to someon 's gene , caus seriou mutat lead to cancer . but , inspit of these argument about the way advertisemnt manipul a custom 's mind , they do make us awar of all the new product in the market and normal if you see care an advertis will definit tell you all the posit and neg about the product . but somehow , it is the natur of human mind to absorb all the nice thing , ignor the neg while watch and then find someon els to blame for their ignor . even though necessari , i still feel that advertis do make the real product look much better than it actual is becaus of the way they are design to take our mind off the problem about that product .
