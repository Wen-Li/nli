i partial agre with the follow statment , inord for student to understand an idea and concept they need to learn fact befor that to get there own idea and learn what is wrong and wright by live the scene or act it . ani person can understand an idea if it there own idea share idea that came from a fact would be extremli help . i 'm a student and my opinion in how a student can get to know thing and understand easili is by fact and real life stori somth that ha happen to someon or someth . if we compar a person which is highli experienc with a person that is not experienc but got taught that experi who would get more idea and get good in it ? obvious they live it and felt it . on the other hand , if idea come from student own knoweledg it would be a great idea if they would discuss it for them to exchang and share idea amongest eachoth and may be veri excit whera , learn fact from old histrorian book that is 100 year old would be extremli not intrest and the student would find it difficult to understand and conctrep with other about it , more importantli fact and idea about fact are realstic student would beleiv it straight away becaus they may have herd it from friend or famili . idea and concept are not limit i can sit in a room and give mani idea as i can and give concept all day long becaus an idea is base on how a student think and what possil matter can be done so it with no limit whera fact is somth real and may be limit becaus as they say fiction caus on and on caus you creat thing by your imagin while the fact is base upon a real thing that a brain would believ and end of stori . furthermor , i would like to all thi is import to all of us becaus it increas our knowledg level but thought of someth that nobodi ever thought of is nearli imposs .
