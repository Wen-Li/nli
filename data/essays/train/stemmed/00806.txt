i first tend to agre with thi statement and i actual hope there will be less car in the world , becaus pollut is a seriou problem . accord to me , in twenti year , they may be a problem about oil . we use so much of thi right now that it might not be avail in the next decad . if the oil becom harder to find , then it becom also more and more expens . the richest peopl may then be the onli one who will earn enough money to buy what is the main need to make a car work . i can even imagin peopl use their own bike instead . whi not ? would it not be better for our earth ? moreov , new law prevent the use of car may be creat . govern may take action to prevent marri coupl to own more than two car for exampl , or other thing like that . anyth can be done , i think too mani vehicl are on the road . sinc we are talk about close futur , mayb we will wait much longer for chang to be seen , becaus , let us also be realist , more and more peopl own a car nowaday , it is inde so comfort to own our own way to move from place to place in such a short period of time . we need ten minut to go somewher by car , and mayb fourti by feet . so it is hard to agre or disagre with the statement becaus all of thi depend on how the world will turn out to becom in the next few year . it depend on peopl 's state of mind , on polit , and on the decis that are go to be taken . but anyway , my point of view is fewer car would be a good and possibl thing which would be like to happen if each one of us are will to make effort to help our planet .
