i person agre with the topic that nowaday young peopl donot give enough time to help their commun . student in the present day modernis world are attract to more of thing like disco and pub rather than social activ . to make my opinion stronger i would like to take a personel experi . on the eve of the independ day some of our colleg friend decid to do some thing good on that day . as a part of it we decid to constuct a compound wall for a tribal school . we sent request to differ colleg in need of volunt . but on that we were shock to see that vrey few peopl turn out for that event . one more reason whi stuudent cant make to such event is that the world ha becom so competet that student dont even get time to relax for one complet day . for exampl my friend who are persu thier graduat cours also aim for other exam like cat , sat etc . also they need to maintain their grade in thier regular graduet cours . so it difficult for them to spend some time for the extracurricular activ . thu howmuch interest they have it not possibl for student like them . final the advent of internet in the 20th centuri revolutionis thing veri much . it ha made world into a global villag . anyon can access anyth in thi world by just sit at their home . thi made young peopl from move out of their place . thu make them lazi . henc seldom young peopl spare enough time to help thier commun . thu from my person experi i think that young peopl nowaday donot give enough time to help thier commun .
