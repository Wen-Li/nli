i agre that for student understand idea and concept is more import than learn fact . a coupl of exampl drawn by my own experi convinc me of thi . in school , be it high school or univers , student start familiar with a broad rang of concept that profoundli influenc their way of think and act . concept and idea provid an individu of a young age with a framework for think and follow a certain methodolog . for instanc , in an art cours , a student familiar with the underli concept of cubism will be more abl to draw infer on other work of art of the same period than a student who ha focus on the biograph data of an artist or on the name of hi work . moreov , the student who master the valu who are at the basi of cubism will be also abl to relat them to similar current of differ field , such as philosophi , literatur , music . a student who ha focus on pure fact could face some problem in link up sever fact if these belong to differ ` realm ' . although it is import to have a good knowledg of exampl of specif fact or event , it is indispens to understand concept and idea as they provid a good methodolog for analyz and understand the realiti as it appear to us , especi when we have no prior background inform to reli on . in a media class , understand which tool are need to analyz a certain radio show can be use in the event we have to design the analysi for a total new media product from scratch , such as a new internet-bas applic or an upcom inform technolog . final , although fact are part of the cultur ` baggag ' everyon use everyday , can be consid of secondari import than concept and idea which provid the framework for think and act .
