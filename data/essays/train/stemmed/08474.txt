yong peopl are enjoy life more than older peopl do . i am agre with thi statement . now in present day young peopl are enjoy well with copar to old day . becaus at thi present time they have so mani entertin equip and these all are not avail that olden day . and the world is develop rapidli . at a time the young peopl also work hard to reach their goal and to rech their ambit . they are do hardwork and enjoy at a time . they are seper their time for work and for enjoy . now these present day so mani young peopl are work in mani great compani and corpor compani , then they all are work weekli five day for compani and remain two day they are enjoy with their friend and famili . so young peopl also do hardwork but they make some shedul and follow that . now so mani young peopl are work under some compani or work under some institut , but these compani and institut are build by old peopl . so old peopl are work in their young day without enjoy and without free time then they can run that institut and compani . from the abov two sentenc i can say that old peopl are work hard than young peopl so with that reason they reach higher level . and these present day also have some yong manag director for compani and also have some young industrialist , but they all are get that compani and that industri from their parent and they run that compani verywel . for suppos anil abani is great indusrialist and great manag director for relienc compani . but he get them from hi father and he also workhard and develop their compani and develop their share in present market . so final i am support that the young peopl are enjoy their life more than older peopl and also they are workedhard and get good posit in their life . and for hardwork older peopl one of the best exampl is bill gate . he is the owner of microsoft compani . but now hi child that mean hi younger child are do enjoy well and they are get that properti from their parent and they are develop that compani with hardwork .
