in today 's life advertis are everywher , they are part of everyon 's life . everytim we go to a mall , we recogn some of product we see becaus we have alreadi seen them on a commerci . advertis play a fundament role in market : they tell peopl what is worth buy and what not . most of the time the wonder shini product we can appreci on a commerci is not what we expect it to be onc we buy it . that 's the power of advertis , and that 's whi industri would pay sever million dollar , for instanc , to get a 10 second advertis space dure the american footbal superbowl . whi would someon pay so much for ten second ? it 's quit easi to understand . .. i do agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and i think thi is quit understand . peopl would never buy a product which can be classifi as `` normal '' . peopl need to improv their life by own someth better everi day . i believ thi is a psycholog strategi , and industri do exploit it to make their incom grow as much as possibl . sometim i think that those who creat commerci do n't believ their own word , or mayb do . mayb an advertis is good when it own creator can tell what 's real from what 's a lie . in my opinion , advertis , particularli those base on lie , must not be trust at all , even though it is also true that the custom realli ca n't avoid bee the victim of thi strategi . the custom ha the right and the need to tell the good product from the bad one , in order to save money and buy what is best for him , not for those who sell these product .
