some peopl hold the opinion that young peropl enjoy life more than older peopl do . other have the oppsit point of view . thi statement ha caus a heat debat for a long time . howev , as far as i am concern , i do agre with the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do , at least it 's the case in china . sinc china is still a develop countri , so by comparaison with the western develop countri , like the usa or the franc , the gener of my grand parent are normal not rich . as a result , they do not travel a lot as their children do . they prefer to save money for later use . consequ , most of the chines old peopl , after their retir , choos to stay at home everi day instead of go out to enjoy life as their children do . also , there is a tradit in china that grand-par look after their grand-children . thi situat is consid rather common in the societi . consequ , you can find a lot of young coupl go for a trip alon and leav their children to their parent . howev , let 's take a look at how the young peopl enjoy their life . firstli , the young peopl have more liberti as they are more energet . as i have mention abov , the young peopl do not need to worri about their children even when they are away sinc it is a tradit that the grand-par take care of the grand-children when the parent are not there . and rel , thi young gener is richer than their parent are , so they choos to spend their money on enjoy their live , go for a trip for exampl . secondli , it is so commun that you find number of young peopl in the cinema after work or dure the weekend . and they go to a bar with their friend after work , or go to a gymnasium dure the weekend . sinc they are young and energet , they know how to take advantag of their spare time and enjoy their life . howev , it is so rare to find old peopl in pub or in gymnasium in china . mayb that 's not the case in europ or in the usa . howev , i find in china , it is true that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . perhap there will be a chang in the near futur ? who know ?
