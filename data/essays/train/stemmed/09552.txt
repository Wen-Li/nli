i agre that success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus noth happen without tri someth new . i could also be abl to learn new thing from risk . sinc i alreadi know the thing , that would not tell me anymor first , if i am afraid of do someth new and do n't make ani action , i would n't get ani reaction which i need . tri new thing and take risk , i can concentr on do the thing . without risk , i might spoil myself becaus of the lack of tention . for exampl , when i came to america to learn english , i wa afraid of speak english and make mistak ; therefor , i tri to escap have a long convers with american . short one like greet made me calm becaus i knew how to do it . howev , my english skill wa n't improv at all . second , i think i can learn better from mistak which are same as risk . to take risk , i could see new thing that i could n't see without risk . similarli as first exampl , i did'nt want to make ani mistak and i care about my english grammer as perfect english too much , so i could n't speak much . one day , my american friend ask me whi i care of the grammer so much and advis me not to afraid , and then i could learn more . sinc the time , i start to take risk . sometim american wa not nice when they knew i wa not a nativ speaker ; howev , most of them taught me how to use correct word in sentenc . that 's the reason whi my english wa improv . i believ there are more lesson from failur than success . repeat what i alreadi know is sometim bore . it is possibl that some peopl catch me up , and start do same thing as me . at the time i am not a success person anymor . if i continu do same thing , they would becom old and useless . in conclus , to be a success person , i need to keep do new thing which nobodi can not follow and take a risk for great knowledg from failur . noth happen seem to be the safest , but at the same time , it mean no chang and profit in my life .
