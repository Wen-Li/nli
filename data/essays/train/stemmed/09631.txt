the idea of teach may be describ in few step . the first step will ofcours be the theori . to understand a given subject one should know what is alreadi there , what exist . after that , as the second stage they will need to learn what is said about the exist case . a person becom a student to learn , learn includ learn how to think . for instanc if you are review a compani as it 's gener director , you should first know the basic thing like it 's field of product or expertis , capit , number of worker , it current stand in the market . after know what is there , you may start to creat your way of carri the compani forward . the thing you have to learn in the first step are the fact . when you are readi to walk on , you start take idea and concept on how develop . it is similar for a new learner student . if he or she doe n't know that two time two equal four , he or she will never understand the basic of mathemat . after learn the main rule and factor they may look into idea and concept that have form around the fact . so say that a kid refus to learn the main rule of math will be a geniu in the futur , under the name of open minded may be nonsens . if onli the factor were tought to student they would probabl becom narrow mind peopl and never get to see differ aspect of life . so combin the two becom a must . while know the fact one should also understand the idea about it . from thi frame i would like to state that understand idea and the concept is need for a student to be abl to see differ point of view toward a singl subject , but it doe n't carri a mean without know what the subject is which is form by gather of the factor .
