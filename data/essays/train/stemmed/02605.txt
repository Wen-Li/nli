although there is alittl time for young peopl , becaus of the high amount of reponsibl , work , and mayb we can say school ( if they were not graduat ) ani one can order hi time and hime self to get the benefit by do alot of thing in ashort time like studi , work , and helpeng their communitien or familli , but with out order time the person will lose the abil of work well , the person will not have time that he can not do ani more work . order time is the best way to relax and to have time for everi thing . so , the person will do alot of thing like finish hi work , then have time to studi , after that he will have the time to see hi parent , rel , and friend and ofcours he will be abl of do ani thing with them , as what i had observ and saw from my friend . he wa ordr hi time will . so , he done alot of work that i wa unabl to finish , he wa go to hi secondri school , then after finish hi class , he wa go to work with hi father , after that he wa take care of hi brother , at last he abl to set with hi parent and help hi commun . as aresult of order hi time . on the other hand , with out order time the person will lose time and he may lose alot of work , like what wa happen to one of my friend , he wa wast hi time , for that he wasnot abl to see and help hi commun . as aresult from have no time at all . he wa go to hi school in the morn , then when he come back he wa go into hi bed , then he wa wakingup from bed in the midnight . so , hi life wa not organ . in my opinion i think that young peopl will have alot of time if they organ themself well . as aresult of that i advis everi one to order hi time forthat he will have abett life and he will help hi or her commun .
