i think that thi statement is a real view of the today 's life of the young peopl and not onli . becaus the first reason for thi problem is that today , young peopl have not too mani time to stay with their realli friend and so do n't have time to help a commun . today thi boy have alway the same size of work at home for the school assign , but when thi is finish , they start to play with the comput or to do someth of similar . in thi situat they have onli a few time to tri to help a commun , but in thi time they think to other thing . thi commun , i think that may be help by everybodi , also in dayli life but with the today 's life , with onli the money at the center of everyth , onli few peopl there is that think to them . now , infact , there is chang in the life not onli of young peopl , the dayli work is differ also for the time that it had in a day , with a lot of peopl work from the earli morn to the start of even , so they may tri to help the commun onli in the weekend if they do n't work . but the famili in the weekend tri to do someth togeth . so with all thi chang that there is in the dayli life of everybodi , young or not , it is difficult to improv thi sector of the world . also i do n't give enought time to help my commun , and i know thi . but i had not too time today to support thi and i hope that there will be some chang in the life , to give some import also to thi sector .
