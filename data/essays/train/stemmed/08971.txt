today , there are mani kind of person who behav in sever differ way . some take risk , some play it safe . most peopl think that person who take risk are more success rather than other who do what they alreadi know how to do well . it is difficult to say thi statement is true or wrong . in fact , i think it is true that peopl tri new thing and take risk are more success than other for sever reason . first of all , peopl who do n't take risk stay alway in a same field . for exampl , a man who have alreadi work in a small restaur have good chanc to work in it for hi or her entir life . on the other hand . eopl who take risk could find their posit abil easili . therefor , they can work in a field that they are good to do for exampl . peopl who are not afraid to take risk could improv the probabl to success , becaus they are alway tri to do well . second , it is easier to get higher gain by take risk . for exampl , an investor who invest in a mutur fund of a poor countri could doubl or tripl the amount of money faster . they take risk , but they are alway challeng to make it better , therefor , they easili success in variou situat . in contrast , peopl who do n't take ani risk could get the gain safe , but slowli . we were all born to do someth big to increas our well-b in thi societi , so whi should they play it safe ? i realli do n't think peopl who do n't take risk are more successful than other who take risk . in summari , i agre that peopl take risk are more success than other do n't take risk for those two reason . peopl are afraid to take risk to get more gain , but they should be brave enough to take some risk to succeed in their live .
