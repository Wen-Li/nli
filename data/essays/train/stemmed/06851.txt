i do not aggre with thi statement . there sever reason explain in the analysi below which will indic the opposit . first of all , the histor develop of the automot industri ha to be taken into account . in the last 30 year the number of car sold worldwid increas year after year . in western europ an the unit staat the number of sold car might not have increas at the same speed it did in the 1980 or 1990 , but it still ha been grow . furthermor , the statement claim that the total number , not the number of sold car , will be reduc . that mean that peopl whose car are demag will not buy new car , which certainli is unrealist . emerg countri like china and india and also countri in eastern europ seem to develop the same way countri in western europ and the u.s. have a few year ago . therefor , the demand for car in those countri will rise year after year . when anayz the locat of product site of the automot industri it is obviou that they current focu on these countri . thi show that they expect to sell huge a amount of car in those area . other countri in africa have not even start to develop to an industri countri . in 20 year those countri will properbl have began their develop and consequ their need for car will have increas . the grow popul in the devellop countri and in the whole world will go hand in hand with the grow number of car . at the moment the import of the environ becom obviou to peopl in develop countri like germani . thi might make peopl think that the number of car will be reduc . but , the conclus that the will stop buy car is wrong . it is possibl to invent environment friendli car which onli need a littl amount of ga . at the same time the first prototyp of car use differn materi than ga have been devellop . thi give peopl the opportun to drive a car and to protect the environ . the argument abov show that it is veri unlik that the number of car will decreas in the next twenti year .
