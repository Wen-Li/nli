whi , you may wonder , should we purchas item accord to advertis ? when face thi decis whether or not to believ an advertis , somebodi will claim that they trust these thing , but other , in constrast , will believ that most advertis make product seem much better than their practic situat . from my point of view , i 'd like to choos the second one and my argument are list as follow . first of all , an import reason whi i hold confid on thi view is that the advertis alway state how well their product are . they may claim that they compani ha a strong background and what they produc may have some perfect effect . howev can you believ that there is someth perfert in the world ? usual , their word are not true . for exampl , there is a famou compani , odian compani in china , which is focus on the product of modern floor . in it advertis , it claim that it command center is locat in germani , but thi have been disapprov by a newpap . therefor , how can we believ the advertis like that ? furthermor , anoth reason for my inclin for my view is that we can not find the beauti characterit state in advertis . that is to say ; when we buy one item and begin to use it , we may find that these `` splendid '' characterist disapp and some new problem aris . from a practic point of view , the advertis will alway blow up in order to make money . for instanc , one of my classmat ha ever brought an air condit . accord the statement of the advertis , it will not produc much noic . howev , hi practic experi prove that it is not easi to fall sleep if thi machin is turn on . of cours , an advertis can tell us someth use . for a new product , a good advertis can help the custom to learn some detail thing about it and spread it impact in the societi . special , to some extent , i 'll agre that the statement in a coupl of advertis may be consist with the real featur . howev , if all the aspect are contempl , it seem advis for us to believ that most advertis will blow up . in a word , although advertis can suppli some use inform , most of them are blow up in order to make profit . what they claim just tri to tell someth untur to make their product more attact . from all the abov argument , we can reach the conclus , that most advertis will blow up in their introduct .
