in my point fo view the success peopl tri new thing risk rather then onli do what they alreadi know . so meni peopl like successful men 's or women 's there are will at stude and job there are come from good background at studer and envorn . they think about what . whi , how and so and so question . the peopl like will at stude and think in differ way the peopl the learn new think . they want to learn think 's for useful so they want to learn new think 's take risk rather current . for exampl take take on softwar proffeson . for exampl he is work java technolog . he is good at java and successful work on java , but in that some new thing are add to the java technolog for exampl swing , hiber net . it is use full for the next project . so that person learn that thing take the risk rather tan the do what they alresdi . success peopl tri new thing for develop thre futur . for second exampl we take music payer they work at some instrument onli , but they want learn the new thing in the music . thay tearn the thing take the high risk then the do thing . i thing that the person is success that is he or she take the risk on that what they do and do thing . so mani success peopl success by take the risk and interst in thar pariclar take . so meni risk and hard work give the so much result to the humen 's . we agre with the statement .
