in my opinion a lot of advertis increas the desir of particular thing in peopl and then it seem much better than anoth that are equal . such as shoe , there are some brand of shoe that make an advertis by televis , journal , and then guy will prefer a specif brand than other , but there are n't a lot of differ by one or anoth 's pair of shoe . the televis play an import role about thi topic , all the day on tv we can see a lot of advertis and our choos can be influenc by thi . a lot of peopl watch the tv and gener follow media and the brand know thi and then spent a lot of money for make them visibl . sometim if i am skill about the thing ( such as comput , car . .. ) i can be awar that anoth unadvertis brand can be more effici , can be better , can have more qualiti than what i 've seen on tv , and thi enforc the topic . when a brand spent some money for make it 's advertis on tv the price of hi product rais but not necessarli rais also the qualiti , but a lot of peopl buy him without know the effect qualiti , onli becaus they have seem him on tv or other media . the charaterist of a product can be the same ( or less ) than anoth but if a product have a specif sign on it will be more desider . mani time the person who buy an advertis object can be not veri happi of hi articl simpli becaus will see anoth brand with more better charaterist than him . the advertis can be not exhaust and can confus the buyer , it make the product more better than it is realli . the peopl that do n't interest about the effect qualiti of product that them buy often are unhappi becaus they spent so much and have a lower qualiti product .
