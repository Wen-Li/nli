when it come to public transport and car , peopl tend to take their car instead of public transport . on the one hand , it is more easi to take public transport when you are in the citi . on the other hand , peopl prefer their car becaus they are not disturbedbi noisi peopl . as far as i am concern , i think that the use of car will dicreas in twenti year . first reason i believ thi , it is becaus nowaday peopl tend to take public transport becaus they arriv at home or at their work place veri quickli . howev it is true , that it is not alway enjoy to take public transport becaus of other peopl and the nois but we can toler each other to manag to live in peac . the second reason i believ thi , it is becaus it is more secur . peopl can read a book in the train or can also listen music with their mp3 player . howev it is true we can listen music behind the wheel . but when peopl who drive are tire , they can rest a littl bit in the train or buse and they do not have to be concentr on the road to go home. , they will not have car accid which are more and more import nowaday . final , last but not least , peolp gain a lot of time , it is fantast . for exampl they do not have to search a car park dure hour , becaus we know that it is veri difficult to find car place in big citi , such as pari . and also they can achiev homework or read a paper for an assign when they take public transport . in conclus , i believ that it will be more convieni and iwe do not use car anymor not to use car in twenti year .
