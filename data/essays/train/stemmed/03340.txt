i believ we live in a whole world . i mean even if physic and intellectu peopl are differ , we live togeth and we have to feel good about that . to feel comfort we have to understand each other , that is whi i think a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject . first i plan to work in the hotel industri and whi not a day run my own hotel . in order to achiev thi goal i need to be polyval and know about mani differ area . i have follow busi studi which lead me to learn thing about mani differ topic such as manag , financ , strategi , languag . .. i found veri interest to learn about differ materi come from differ part of the world . then i believ that acquir knowledg of sever academ enabl peopl to be more open mind and autonom when they face problem perhap not in their work but in their daili life . i think the main goal of standard educ all over the world is to teach peopl a base of vital knowledg which involv differ topic : read , count , speak , write . to finish i am sure that mani peopl need to special in order to achiev their goal , but thi is not my view of life . i agre that some profession need to be highli special in their domain like surgeon , trader . .. but it doe not prevent those specialist to have interest in other topic . that is whi i believ that a broad knowledg of subject is more valuabl than to be special .
