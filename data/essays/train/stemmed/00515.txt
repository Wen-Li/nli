i agre with the statement , `` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' , becaus if they want to be more success than they alreadi were , they would tri to expand their skill and learn more new thing and tri to becom success in that , too . they would risk their time and money , and probabl even their profess , in order to gain that knowledg and master that . onc a person get good at someth , he or she either tri to get even better at that skill , or they keep it at a level they are content with . to success peopl , that is not enough . i have a friend who is a wonder harpist , and she practic her harp at least 9 hour a day . she is a harpist for 3 profession colleg orchestra/group and play in concert practic everi week . but even with all her talent , she alway say it 's not enough . now , she 's learn how to play other inster , like flute , clarinet , and cornet , and is expand her music skill to a new level . she is almost like a profession harpist , yet she push herself harder and harder by practic for hour and learn how to play new music inster . in order to learn new thing , peopl must get educ . in order to get educ , they either have to find a profession who major in that particular field or go to a school/colleg . most success peopl have job and probabl even a fammili , so if they want to learn someth new , they would have to cut their time short with either one of them , mayb even both . that caus new risk , like lose their job becaus they do n't work as much anymor , or lose their famili becaus they do n't spend time with their famili anymor and hi or her husband/wif is tire of their ignor . but if they think their educ is worth the risk , then they should go right ahead and keep on go . you do n't have to be success in order to learn new thing . no one ha the right to stop anybodi from gain knowledg for their satisfact .
