it is a well-known idea that young peopl should enjoy their life more than older peopl do becaus they still have ` energi ' and ` time ' to spend , but if we realli think about that statement we can tell that it 's not that true . well first of all it depend on what we mean by ` young peopl ' . if young peopl mean child , the statement will be kind of true , what i 'd like to say is that when your a child you will defenit enjoy the life more than older peopl do becaus you 're still sort of unconsci yet and without ani kind of worri besid ' what am i get for christma ? ' and so on . .. but if young peopl mean teenag , student or young activ it 'd be anoth problem . as for me , i think that be a teenag a student or a young activ is one of the most stress time of our life not that it 's not enjoy at all but it 's a period where time fli and it 's a period that will defin the rest of your life in other word everyth and by everyth i 'd like to emphas the word ` futur ' . what will i becom in thi world ? what will i do ? well i guess those question are get unsignific when your get older . i think older peopl among all should know how to enjoy life the best they can and time . as we 're get older , we 're get wiser ( well i do hope so ) and we wo n't have to worri about meaningless thing such as what kind of cloth am i go to wear to school today . altought older peopl can not as much thing as they use to do when they were young but they would definet take time to enjoy them .
