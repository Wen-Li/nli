i think that thi statement can not be consid probabl for sever differ reason . i guess the most import one is that there are mani not western countri ( as china ) , where the presenc of car is actual not compar with the one in the western countri , which are fastli grow and whose request of car for inabith is grow in the same proport , that make the request for new car to improv realli fastli , and thi is not a short term event . the second reason is that to have a car is still an extremli import stutu symbol , which would be hardli dismiss by a larg part of the popul . to have a car , expeci a fast and expens one , is a central way to sublin the own social posit , and i do not find ani reason which suggest that it would chang in the next twenti year . third , there is a gener financi problem in the balanc of the major of the state of the world . thi condit take away sourc from the investi , also from the innov and the develop of the pubblic transport ( with the except of some big citi ) . thi fact oblig mani peopl to use a car , which mean to have a car , even if they would prefer not to use it . honestli i do not think that in the next twenti year there will be found new sourc to make the car not to be necessari . the last point is that the car industri is still one of the central industri of the world . it crisi would mean a strong crisi of the global economi , and twenti year are not enough to transform a strateg section of the economi in anoth one : it is improb that in twenti year the car industri can convert is product toward other kind of good whithout a strong social impact . thi is even the reason whi the car product is so protect by the nation institut in so mani differ countri .
