acutli i disagre that becous if tha student get jast tha idia thay cant emropv ani thing . but if thay stadi and thay can see ther object in the fact thay cant foget that and they will think about it . if thay can understand and get the idia they cant think about it . but if they understandet and thay stell thing about thir object they ill ask thir self alot of question . and they 'll explor alot of sain like tha tacnalog right now . about if thay can get the idia with out do pract for that that 's ok but thay cant emprov thir skill and they cant do ani thing in thire live . and tha gad made us an he gave each one a main . and tha maind can forget everi thing ecept some thing like if it learn somr thing in the fact and saw it never can forget it . i know some sain you ca n't see it but you can imagen it and you 'll see it in the fact like in mathematich , visec or fasic so i like chang the educ from the first year in the elmantri scohl if thay can do that we 'll get alot of smart chaildren and thay can make agood live with agood educathion . i saw in tha news peaper in my home thay wanit to chang the educathion and relli it wa bad idia . thay say thay want to chang tha educact thay 'll give everi one a lapetob in the elmantri school . my opinian in that all of them 'll be stube becous thay do n't have ani idia about the computar so how can thay learn .
