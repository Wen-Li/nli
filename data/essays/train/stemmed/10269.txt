accord to my opinion it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani acadam subject rather than to special in a specif subject . i will express my opinion by take an exampl of an engin who is opt for electron as hi major . in hi four year of studi he will be explain basic about all the subject like math , physic , chemistri , c and data structur and some other comput subject and later on go to the higher class he will be explain about the complet depth of the electron . mani peopl who are opt electron as major , settl in softwar compani like sathyam , wipro just becaus of thier knowledg in comput . even though they opt electron as thier major . today world is becom veri competet in everi aspect so in order to cop up with a world like thi a man should have a broad knowledg on ani subject . suppos in a compani a problem occur in the comput that all account list are block which are veri import to compani that day to plan the rest of the day how the product are to be produc then we need a comput profession for it who is on leav that day . so the electron employe who is work in that compani , have basic knowledg about a comput can rectifi the problem easili . so by thi the compani go on it work without ani interupt . so it better to have sound knowledg on what ever we studi in our academ year by simpli not neglect the other subject think that it is not our subject we can leav it becaus our major subject is other one . by the sound knowledg on ani subject we can be advantag in ani field and also where ever we go .
