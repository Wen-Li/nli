i agre that it is more import and benefici for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . thi is becaus it is basic the idea and concept that lead us to variou fact . idea and concept form the basi of all the learn . concept defin the rule and regul assosci with a certain term . if an individu is clear with hi concept , he can understand everyth relat to that concept . for exampl , if a person 's english grammar concept are clear , then he can understand and write ani of the view express in english languag easili . idea is basic a motiv behind do of a certain thing . whatev , we do , we do it with some idea at the back of our mind . for exampl , if a person is pursu a manag cours , he is pursu it with the idea that a manag cours will provid him a wide varieti of oppurtun in hi career . similarli , variou idea form the basi of our differ action i.e drink water to quench our thirst , eat food to satisfi our hunger . if a person understand the basic idea behind ani task , he will be abl to comprehend the implic of that task complet . fact are normal state . they are the outcom of variou observ and experi perform under certain condit . but fact do not alway depict truth . they may be true in one sens but they might be wrong in some other sens . for exampl . if an observ state that a particular type of technolog is the most sophist technolog in it field , thi might be true for some but for some whose paramet of observ differ from the paramet of earlier observ might not think so . moreov , fact can be alter to meet certain specif object . henc , i believ that it is more import and essenti for student to get hold of idea and concept rather than cram fact . understand idea and concept will help them think more logic and practic . fact might mislead them but concept and idea will alway lead them to a logic path . understand of idea and concept make individu 's thought process more effect and effici .
