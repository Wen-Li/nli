let me tell you somthing about success peopl who most of them are rich . but we have the wrong idea about them becaus we think that they are look for poor peopl from up to down while most of them are just ordinari peopl . they do the same thing that we do they eat in normal restruent , wear normal cloth , drive an middl class car , that what i had seen two week ago in the t.v with proffessor willium who said that `` presption deffer from realiti '' . some peopl ask do success peopl tri new thing ? or they take the risk rather than done done thing normal ? the blief that success peopl are what we think that they are not modist and use poor peopl for their benfit without think about their life or their famili reali most of time is wrong as i mention in the first paragraph about `` wrong precipt '' . also , most of those peopl think that success peopl do not take the risk or do the thing in differ way . while , success peopl said that they are like to take the risk to make their life so excit and give it the flaver of danger which what they say keep them work for the best . morov , they said that they alway like done thing in adiffer way so that they discov new ting even if it is effect on their life carrer by make their life upsid down . howev , some of them prefer to do not take the risk and walk on a light way rather than dark way that mayb they would face pumb in their way destroy them or sent them to emerg . allov , there are differ kind of success peopl in their think . one of them who chose the easi way and other who chose the dark way becaus it excit them . well , my openion is that life without dark way have no excit place but who chose way have to know the key of it not wait for the next pump .
