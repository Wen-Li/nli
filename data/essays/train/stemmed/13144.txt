nowaday , there are numer debat about the issu whether or not peopl success by tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . some peopl hold the opinion that it is true that peopl can onli sucess by do new thing . howev , in my opinion , i disagre with the statement becaus success peopl can success by do the same thing they alreadi know how to do well . first of all , the crucial reason in hold my opnion is that when peopl do thing that they alreadi know they do not have to worri about the risk that follow after they do it . for instanc , my father is an owner of a supermarket . he ha run the busi for ten year , and when we move to canada he is still think of open a new supermarket here . by do thi , he doe not have to worri about how to manag the busi or how to improv the busi becaus he alreadi ha the experi of how to run it . anoth exampl could be when a person want to switch to anoth job such as be a doctor , chanc are that she will not be success be a doctor . thu , you do not have to worri about what will happen next if you continu to do thing that you alreadi know . furthermor , anoth reason in hold my opinion is that by do thing that you alreadi know will help you not to make mistak . for exampl , my mother is work as an account and when she met her friend veronica , who work in the stock , she encourag her to invest her money in the stock becaus she say that it will doubl or even tripl her money . as my mother doe not know anyth about invest , she trust veronica becaus she think that she will never betray her , and invest all her money in the stock market . as a result , the stock market went down and she loss all her money . thi is a clear exampl on how peopl can make mistak when they do not know about the subject , and thu be unsuccess . all in all , i think that peopl will be more success by do what they alreadi know instead of tri new thing and take risk , becaus they do not have to worri about what will happen to them and also it will help them not to make mistak . therefor , for these reason i would say that risk taker are not as success as peopl who do thing that they alreadi know how to do .
