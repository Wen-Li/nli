the problem of the new trade is directli connect to the fact that we must understand which product have realli true effect , and which not . today a lot of peopl go to supermarket to buy their product , becaus in these place they can have a lot of chosen . at the same time we must take attent to what we buy , becaus a lot of product seem much better than they realli are . gener we buy an econom product becaus we think that it must have the same effect than one expens , but i think that there is a reason if one is cheapper than anoth , and thi reason is not onli connect to the fact that one bring an import name , and anoth not . gener when we buy a product that have a maior cost , mean that we have buy a sicur object , that we 'll can use without ani problem , also if we must rememb that thi is n't alway treu , becaus we alway find some surpris . at the contrari when we buy a product cheapper than anoth , we can find bed surpris . for these reason i buy alway product that are n't so cheapper , but also not expans ; howev it depent to what i must buy . when i buy a dress i want somethingh that give me a garanc of qualiti , and gener it 's directli connect to the cost of the object ; the same thingh happen when i must buy the meal , or somethingh for my hous . .. so i prefer spend somethingh more when i buy a product that must dure , and i spend less when i buy somethingh that doe n't have much import , for exempl somethingh that i 'm not sure that i will use a lot . in conclus i 'm agre with the fact that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are , and for thi reason i tri to do attent to what i but , tri to buy somethingh that ha a middl cost among the product that i can find . at the same time i want remenb that it 's not alway true that an expens product is better then one that is cheap .
