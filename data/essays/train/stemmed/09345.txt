even if i agre with one aspect of the subject , i disagre with an other . let me explain . when you learn mani differ thing in mani differ subject , it make you have veri interest discuss and debat when you meet peopl for exampl . when the peopl you meet get interest in what you say , or when they see that you are understand what they say on specif issu , they will appreci you and what you are say . when you are specialis on one specif subject , peopl will think that you are veri smart and that you know a lot of thing , but they wo n't alway be interest in what you say . for exampl a specialis botanist who will talk dure hour about flower to someon who is n't interest in it , will seem to be a bore person . someon who know mani thing will have more differ friend . there are also job where you need to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . for exampl , journalist are expect to know mani differ thing on differ topic , they would n't have time to get all thi knowledg if they had to get specialis . i can not imagin a journalist who would n't know some thing about polit , sport , histori etc . on an other hand be specialis , mean know almost everyth about an issu . when you work or learn at school with peopl who share the same interest , they will appreci all the thing you know . when someon ha a passion in one field , whi would he need so much knowledg in other subject . final , at school it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani subject becaus if you 're good at one and not in an other subject , you will fail your gener exam and do the same class one more year , wherea when you are specialis in one subject it is good but it is not enough . so even if i understand both opinion , i do more agre with the first one which say that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject .
