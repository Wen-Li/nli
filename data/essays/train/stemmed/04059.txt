in my opinion , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better than to special in one specif subject . i am of thi opinion for differ reason : firstli , you need the knowledg of mani differ academ subjetct to understand a specif subject total . for exampl , you can not understand literatur without histor knowledg . know what a novel or play is about is just not enough , addit you must know someth about the time in which the literatur wa creat or the societi the author live in . thi knowledg will not be present in literatur class , so you need to deal with histori , too . secondli , studi one specif subject is onli succes if you have thought about the subject from all possibl perspect . understand someth onli from one point of view creat the risc that you do not know enough about critic or differ opinion . for exampl , there are mani differ opinion about evolut . if you are special on biolog onli , you will never learn some other theori or you will never understand how american theologist can argu against darwin 's evolut theori . addit , a reason whi i think that have a broad knowledg of mani subject is the better option , is that some specif subject contain question that can not be answer by thi specif subject alon . a veri good exampl is medicin : you can studi medicin without ever get in touch with ethic , but dure your career , you will need ethic knowledg to make some import decis . it is imposs to be a good doctor if you are onli interest in medicin ; you have to be interest in ethic and the human societi in gener , too . in conclus , we can say that the best way is decid which subject you are the most interest in then and studi on it . at the same time you alway have to keep in touch with other academ disciplin to becom not onli an expert of one specif subject , but to get a wide gener knowledg .
