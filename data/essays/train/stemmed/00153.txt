i do disagre with the idea accord to which young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their own commun . i would rather think that nowaday young peopl do a lot of effort to tri to help and solv social problem in order to improv and join their own commun . though young peopl are usual consid as lazi and selfish and without ani particular interest toward social or cultur problem , i do not think that they actual are . let is consid , for instanc , the case of young volount . they are widespread as you can find them everywher , in everi countri . it doe not matter which specif field they are interest in , it is just import that they are engag in someth they believ in . ani littl help given by young peopl help the societi to improv itself . in addit , ani singl minut they spend for the commun is meanful . in my particular experi i wa use to be a social volount for nearli ten year , first in a commun of down children , and then as a phone listen in an associ call ( telefono amico ) : it is clearli a lot of time . thu , in my opinion and in my experi , i think that it is not that true that young peopl do not give enough time to help their own commun . they actual can do , and they do , that .
