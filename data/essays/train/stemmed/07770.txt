in the follow i shall give my opinion about the question of whether it is better to have a rather broad but not so deep knowledg of sever academ subject or whether it is better to be an expert in one specif subject . honestli speak , i do not think there can be a gener question to thi answer . i believ it depend on the aim and profession goal a person ha in life . for some peopl it might be better to focu on one thing and becom realli good at it and for other it might actual be smarter to becom familiar with a varieti of differ subject . speak for myself , i think deal with a broad rang of academ topic is the better choic . thi is due to the fact that i still do not know what job i will work in later . i do not feel readi to alreadi special in one specif subject . what if i am make the wrong choic ? anoth reason for me to prefer a broad knowledg of academ subject is that peopl who know about a varieti of thing appear more educ to me . whatev question one might have , they alway feel readi to answer -- at least most of the time . now imagin you are spend time with a person that is special in one specif field but doe not know anyth els . if you do not happen to be special in the same area as he or she is , what are you go to talk about ? it could becom quit a bore as well as frustrat experi . furthermor , i am of the opinion that peopl who have broad knowledg in a varieti of subject are more like to have a veri success career . we just have to look at high execut in the busi world . mani of them did not special in busi in univers but they studi a varieti of topic includ `` art histori '' or other subject which do not necessarili have to do with the job they are do now . what compani want today is peopl who know about mani differ thing . as i said in the begin thi might not be the correct way for everybodi , but with my person goal it certainli is for me .
