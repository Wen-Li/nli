my opinion is disagre . i think young peopl should help their commun . i have two reason . first of all , young peopl in other word , student have much time than work peopl . after school , mani student have a part-tim job for earn money . it is import for them to do a part-tim job . they can buy mani cloth , shoe , snack , and so on . but , i want to recommend them help their commun . thi may free . but , they can know new thing which do n't learn in the school . for exampl , they can know about old peopl . there are variou peopl in commun . so they can talk with who they do n't usual talk . old peopl know mani thing than young peopl . secondli , young peopl live in their commun too . not onli clean their own hous but also a park , a road etc . m
