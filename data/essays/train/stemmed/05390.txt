i agre with thi statement for allot of reason and argument . the first reason for thi statement whi it import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact is becaus it so much import to understand it then learn it and forget about it in the futur . the main idea for thi statement is a student ha to understand wat he 's learn becaus it help him in lot of way instead of just help him in one day just to get it over with and done . me as myself it better for me to understand it then to learn it and not know it . i think it better for a teacher or a proffesor to explain wat he or she is talk about exactli instead of write and write on a board and the student not understand a thing . it better if he or she ( teacher ) goe in detail and explain everyth for the student so the student will actual understand the topic and what there talk about . the idea 's the teacher give student are realli import for them becaus they 'll get and idea of the topic i mean the main idea and the concept of it . in conclus of all thi i agre with thi statement becaus of allot of stuff such as what i said for exampl it better for student to learn what the teacher is actual talk about then just learn the fact of it , becaus the fact will not take u anywher becuas you will forget them but in the other hand learn the idea 's and the concept and actaulli understand it is much better for the student so he wont have ani difficulti in the past about the main topic given in class . so that about it about what import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
