i think that today , with the advanc in tecnolog , anyth is possibl . i agre that in twenti year there will be fewer car than there are today . there can possibl be total minimis in the number of car too . sinc the beggin of time , man ha surviv through mani way . not onli is he fight to surviv , but he is tri to improv the condiit around him , so he may make hi life more comfort . car start with travel through anim ; in earli time , peopl would sit on horseback or on a donkey back to reach hi destin . then later came the bullock cart , where the anim pull the cart which wa on wheel . like thi , mani advanc have been made in the mean of travel such as bicycl , tricycl , motor cycl , train , ship , plane and ofcours the most conveni mean of transport - the car . nowaday , that is , in the twenti first centuri , in mani place , the metro is be built . it is a develop of the train which are gener use to travel long distanc . the metro , is a faster mode of train , it can be use to travel short distanc - which may take the place of car . car , be a veri use vehicl , ha a lot of disadvantag such as park space - nowaday , almost everi famili own three car . park is becom a great problem , as there is no space at all . anoth problem is traffic . traffic is the worst problem of all - it caus peopl to get late for appoint , meet or other import place . even the price of the car are rise , which peopl can not afford as there are other expens to make too . so , i think , that in the near futur , mani peopl might sell their car and may travel by metro which is built in mani countri such as india , u.k. , u.s.a. , and is be built in mani other place too . i think it will be much more conveni for those peopl who do wo n't use their car and for those who still have their car , becaus there will be less traffic and less park problem .
