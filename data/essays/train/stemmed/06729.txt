`` onli peopl who ventur into the sea get the pearl '' . so goe an ancient indian proverb . and how true ? i complet agre with the statement that success come to those who take risk and do n't mere rest on past laurel . i will present some explan and exampl to support my strong opinion about the issu . if we stop and think about what will happen if all of us continu to do onli the thing we are sure of , or thing we are best at ? i shudder to think of such an eventu . the whole world would come to a grind halt . the world need innov and hunger in peopl to tri on new thing . and the peopl who do that can be call the driver of the world . they are the leader in the true sens . for exampl had gallileo not taken a stand about the earcth be round , had columbu not made that discoveri that chang the world order . what would the world be like ? the constant need of chang and tri on newer and better thing may be riski but is certainli worthwhil . also in thi fast chang world , if peopl howev success , stop tri new thing and take risk , they will soon find themselv not success . busi , scientist and govern , in other word all the peopl need to take risk just to surviv . you can keep on do what you do best ; but in time you will realis that the thing you do no longer is good enough becaus the time have chang . moreov none of the invent and discoveri were made without take risk . current popular manag and busi procedur were a risk when they were implement for the first time . we have onli the peopl to thank who were brave enough to take up the challeng . we need more such peopl if we continu our growth in almost ani field . anoth import fact about risk and new thing is the novelti valu and the motiv effect . new thing and risk challeng peopl which is fodder for most success peopl . they crave for that challeng - they are challeng to out do themselv and thi keep the success peopl go on . here goe a common joke on bill gate . `` bill gate drop out of school to creat the microsoft empir . i can bet my last dollar on `` had he continu in school , he would still be work in microsoft - just own by someon els '' . thi aptli conclud that success come to those who are not avers to take risk and constantli tri newer thing .
