i agre with the statement that it is better to special in one subject rather than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject becaus it is good for a student to special in a subject that he is interest in than to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . if a student is special in a subject as he had concentr onli on that subject he can can do veri well in that subject rather if he had to concentr on mani subject where he can not concentr on all of them at a time . normal a student will have broad knowledg of mani subject as there will mani academ subject throughout the school level . after that onc they enter into the colleg level they need to concentr onli on the subject they are interest in , but not on mani academ subject at a time . at the colleg level the student should concentr on the subject they are interst in , which will help them to special in that subject and to have indepth knowledg about that subject . more over i support my opinion by take the exampl of a scientist of a particular field . a scientist in gener will be special in the subject which is relat with hi current work field and abov all he will have indepth knowledg about the subject in which he special . special in a field also help in make advanc to that field ingener made by the person specialis by invent mani new method or improv the old method which he had studi previous . on the whole i conclud the specail in a subject in which an individu is interest in , will help to go into go indepth into the subject and probabl the individu may special in the field of the subject . so it is essenti to special in a help in a subject rather than to have broad knowledg about mani subject .
