i person believ the statement abov to be fals . it is import to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject but at the same time it is crucial to be special on someth if one want to be success . a well-round individu is not good enough when it come to live through life . school teach piec and bit of everi subject to student . thi is the part of their intelectu career in which they are introduc to all the differ area of knowledg ; when their basic fundemant are creat . in thi stage the student is abl to explor all the differ area , and decid which of these is hi / her interest . thi doe not mean that the student ha to pick one , but at least narrow down the list . onc school is over , student have their basic pillar of the academ subject creat . colleg is the next step to special . student now decid where they want to special . if everybodi had broad knowledg on everyth and no special , societi would not function correctli . a town need a baker , a doctor , and a blacksmith ; these are not task that can be accomplish by everyon . for exampl , farm is a task that requir a lot of knowledg on the subject and dedic . if everybodi had just some broad knowledg on the subject , crop would not grow veri effici , so there might not be enough food to support the town . the town would not be abl to surviv if there are no profession in each area sinc all the job that have to be done would not be accomplish to their best . it is fundament to be introduc to all the area of academ knowledg , to have a broad understand on each subject area , but that is not enough for a societi to function . in a societi there ha to be a certain degre of organ in order for it to run as expect : individu should comprehend what their role in societi is and fulli accomplish it in order to run smoothli . if everybodi is special on someth he/sh like , then the task will most probabl be done as best as possibl , and at the same time , as a whole , form a well-round societi .
