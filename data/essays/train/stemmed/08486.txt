i agre the statement that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . as much as time goe by , older peopl got more experi from the live and they alreadi have some fierc . so mani older peopl do n't want to tri new thing such as educ , travel , and cultur , etc . but the young peopl are differ . they are ambiti and they are alway will to learn new thing . i usual get happi from learn . as my opinion , i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do becaus older peopl have less chanc to learn rather than young peopl . as time goe by , the number of entertain increas . in the past , peopl should work for live but now peopl make money for the entertain and qualiti of thier live . young peopl have more opportun to enjoy their live than older peopl do . for exampl , my father is veri hard-work and he doe n't have free time for himself . sometim , he look like work robot . i want him not to work too hard and do whatev he like but work becom hi routin life . my father ha work hard for the live and he ca n't stop work even though he is enough rich . i think my father is similar with ani older peopl . goal of the live is differ between young peopl and older peopl . so i think young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . i ca n't say which gener is happier than other gener becaus everyon ha differ concept of happi . it doe n't matter how peopl live but it is import to enjoy their own live . peopl should have their own happi and do their best to achiev the happi .
