i complet agre with the propos statement . in my opinion , there are sound reason to believ that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use . first , i think that pollut ha becom a seriou global problem that soon will have to be solv . in addit , i believ that unafford oil price will incentiv peopl to use other kind of transport . first of all , we may argu that nowaday almost everybodi support a dramat reduct of pollut . we all can agre that car contribut to increas urban pollut . in order to tackel thi problem , some citi , such as london , have implement new regul that do not allow peopl to drive car around the center of the citi . from what i see , much more citi should appli thi sort of polici . likewis , mani citi are current improv the servic render by their public transport in order to provid peopl with a good altern to the car . i think that these two measur will incentiv peopl to avoid use the car ; thu , we may conclud that fewer car will be in use . secondli , i consid that soar oil price will also help to have fewer car in use . from my point of view , oil ha alreadi start to be a realli scarc good , and even now mani peopl have problem to pay for it . hope , peopl will realiz that use the car is not sustain from both an ecolog and an econom standpoint . to sum it up , i do believ that in twenti year we will see fewer car run through the street . we may expect that peopl will colabor to reduc pollut and will start use public transport . in addit , i think that oil price will prevent peopl from use the car or , at least , will incetiv peopl to use it less .
