in my view young peopl enjoy life more but moreov in an other way . three argument are on my mind whi i am abl to sign thi statement . in the first place young peopl do have much more free time . while young peopl are normal finish around 5ish with school , adult have to work longer . furthermor young poepl have more holiday and are free on the weekend . my father ha hi own enterpris . normal he return home for dinner . but while he is still work , i watch tv or i play tenni with my brother . i guess sometim he could use more free time so that he would be abl to do such activ and just enjoy . that bring me to my next thought . older peopl have more respons than younger peopl . accord to that , adult need to invest more time into complex thing such as tax or bill . my father compani count 300 worker . he is respons for everyon . if you have to keep up with such a big respons , your day can be stressi . young peopl do not have to worri about that becaus they count on the help oh their parent . final young peopl have more energi to do activ . it is natur that a young bodi is fitter than an older one . the bone are still young and the bodi of a young person is still grow . when my mother an me go for a walk up the hill she is the first to make a break . my leg are younger and i am abl to wlak longer distanc becaus of my condit . in conclus there are sever reason whi young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . the most import is that young peopl have more free time . in spite of that older peopl enjoy life too , but in an other way .
