i agre that young peopl enjoy life than old peopl . thi agreement is base entirli on my own experi and common sens . to demostr what i believ , i would like to state some view here . everytim when i meet young peopl , i feel an air of freedom . they may be presumptu or fatuou , or even ill-mann , but they are never anxiou social climber . they may have littl knowledg or even non-educ , but they have desir to explor the new world . unlik the old one who live and think via hi earli learn , and stop there . all these can be defin by the air of freedom that lead the youth to be higher , stronger and faster in order to enjoy their live more than old peopl . anoth import condit is the physic and mental state of the youth . becaus of the limit by age , the old lose lot of enjoy thing . they may be rich and healthi , but they do not have interest to nice food ; they can buy a great variti of cloth , but they do not have good look . apart from their elder , the young take advantag of a nice age . no matter what cloth they put on , they seem to be activ and handsom . they do not need to worri about the blood prssure while take delici pizzar or other fast food . life begin with good food . in conclus , i admit that there are neg ponit to young peopl . the fear of unemploy , hard work , scarc resourc , consist it . but they are lucki for the youth .
