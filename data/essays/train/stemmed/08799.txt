everi stage of live ha it own prioriti and way to enjoy the moment . i do think that young peopl and older peopl can both enjoy the life they are live . howev the intes with which someon can enjoy live mainli depend on the effort and the sacrific he had to do to reach to that point . in fact we can take the exempl of a young boy : hi live , hi univers is quit simpl . a singl simpl thing can fulfil him like the consider of hi teacher when he ha drown a beautiful tree or learnt a poetri . but i think to enjoy that moment of proud he had to concentr and to make an effort . on the contrari , i am sure that some student who doe n't realli work hard to succeed in hi studi and who think that what he is do is just enough to pass hi exam ca n't realli enjoy live . in fact even if he ha all the time and the possibl to go on holliday and to parti with hi mate , he would soon or later fill that he is not do hi best and wo n't enjoy thi live anymor . that 's whi i am deppli convinc that in order to enjoy live , we have to see in our past and be proud of what we have been abl to perform . moreov , after year of work in a veri fullfil career , older peopl have earn money that can allow them to travel , to have the live they have alway dream of . but they have earn more than money dure their career : they have earn the abil to be sincir proud of what they have done . that is to say , the familli they have built , the educ they have given to their child and the good memori they are give to their grand-children . that is whi i think that older peopl can enjoy live more than younger one .
