i agre that the opinion that young peopl nowaway d onot give enough time to help thier communitu . i think there are two reason . first of all , noaway , young peopl do not care about thier commun . the reason whi is becaus , they do not think they receiv a lot of benefit from thier commun . howev , they receiv a lot of benefit from commun . for exampl , they can go to the school , and can studi becaus of commun . in addit , they are protect from the crimin becaus of policemen . therefor , they should cooper with their commun . they should back what they receiv . second reason that they do not give enough time to help commun is that it is increas to commun with propl . for exampl , there is a case that they do not know peopl who live next to their hous . in addit , recent cell phone is becom veri popular , so peopl can talk or commun with peopl even if they met each other . therefor , their mind that help each other is increas . in conclus , it is danger thing to increas the time to help their commun .
