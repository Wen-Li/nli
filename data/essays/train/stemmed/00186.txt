it will be unfair to be on either side of thi statement , as both are good in their own context and usag . but , in order to take one option , i will go with have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject rather than special in one specif subject . as , we are live in a fast pace world where inform is pass at high rate and we are rapidli becom a resid of a global villag . i am sure that a person with just a special know how of creat new toy for children will not be abl to go far if he do n't poss good market skill too or a comapni like toyata would have not been so succesful if it had not abl to match it suppli and demand , ofcours simeltan . for anoth exampl even in one of the most special occup , militari it is essenti even for a good and strong soldier to diversifi himself and have a proper knowledg of hi locat with respect to hi enemi which he can get with the help of new technolog like gpr with a primari knowledg to fight and surviv , it all about surviv of the fittest . it is also veri riski for ani individu to keep special in one field without know the scope and growth of that particular field . it is after all the question of surviv in thi highli competitv world . even to understand our own interest and strength befor special in ani particular subject we need to diversifi us into variou academ or real life experi and sometim by even fail in few ventur where we are not strong . so instead of keep all my egg in one basket i would rather go for variou basket befor make the choic for the perfect one . i would rather understand variou academ subject and will be in a posit to effeci corel them and that will be more fruit than special in one field .
