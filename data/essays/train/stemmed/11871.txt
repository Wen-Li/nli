i gree with the statement that peopl who tri new thing and take risk usual turn success than those who onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . first of all , i believ creativ is one of the most fundament essenc for human invent . all valuabl invent in the past happen becaus peopl then were creativ in respond to specif difficulti or need of the situat . without creativ , one need to abid by the neg condit or hardship . i strongli believ one can learn greatli from failur as well and take risk will eventu bring the person a profit in the long run . some peopl may argu that some tradit cultur are better preserv as they are , and i agre with thi opinion in principl . howev , preserv the cultur can take differ way than just leav them unchang or untouch . for exampl , it is often report that the tradit craftmanship is at danger of be lost becaus of the chang in peopl 's lifestyl . in such case , the tradit can be preserv by adopt it style to the modern way , still use the accumul knowledg or skill to make that happen . without such challeng , that specif tradit may be at more risk of extinct than take up a creativ chang . in conclust , i stronfli believ that be creativ and readi to take risk is a veri import factor for peopl to be success , and hope i will be so in the face of upcom challeng that i may encount by studi abroad .
