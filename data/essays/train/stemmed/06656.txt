it is my person opinion that one should have a broad knowledg of sever academ subject till he attain a certain level of matur , after which it make perfect sens to special in one specif subject . for instanc , at the school level , it is veri import to ensur that student have a balanc develop by gain broad knowledg of all major academ disciplin . at the univers level , howev , student can start special in their chosen area of interest . thi special can be further narrow down to a specif nich area as one progress with hi studi . a preliminari knowledg of all subject will make an individu a balanc human be , with the capac to appreci and understand all field of studi . eg. a knowledg of basic mathemat will ensur that an art major develop the capac for logic reason wherea take a few cours in music will make a physic major more recept to the beauti of the fine art . a basic knowledg of all subject would also help an individu to ascertain where hi interest lie and enabl him to select the disciplin he would like to special in . after a certain level , howev , it would becom necessari to special in a specif area of studi . thi would give an individu an opportun to cultiv hi person interest and would also give him the depth of knowledg requir to get down to research work . thi would ultim add to the knowledg bank in that particular area of studi . to summar , i believ that a broad knowledg of mani subject is import to begin with , but for ani real valu addit to one 's person academ pursuit as well as the disciplin he studi , it is necessari that he special in it and gain in depth knowledg in that specif subject .
