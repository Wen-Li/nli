the paasag read that it is the best to travel with conduct group tour led by a guid rather than travel alon . obviouslli , travel in guid tour can be amus and safer than singl tour especi for those who do not have travel much and do not want take ani risk in travel . nevertheless , i have differ idea to thi . first , i believ travel ifself is a teacher of our life . as , dure the travel , we get to see lot of differnt peopl and live enviorn we may have think back and forth of our live in the place we are live and to the peopl we are interact about futur and the past . thu , it can help grow our thought to more deleg and matur to which often group guid tour can not teach as we may spend much of our time with other peopl in the group and listen to guider all the way of travel . second , travel alon can have more open chanc of uniqu experi to which group guid tour may not have such as talk with nativ resid and experienc uniqu cultur and food to which most group tour miss as they tend to focu on what mass tourist like and hear in shallow . for me , while i travel europ alon in the earli 1990 , i got to experi all the newest uniqu thing which nobodi did tell me befor . it wa absolut unforgett experi i have until now . final , as tour-guid led travel doe not requir lot of inform and toll we are travel , even after travel , we becom forget easili and do not know much about countri we had been put asid of more money it cost as group tour more focu on spendig the money . on the contrari , travel alon doe requir lot of pre-inform , studi , and plan ahead of travel . howev onc we are back , the outcom we have thourought travel can not be the same of group guid tour . as abov , for me travel should not be necessari accompani by group of peopl nor amus should follow . just be alon can match great journey as be good travel . so , i disagre to the sentenac of favor guid group tour .
