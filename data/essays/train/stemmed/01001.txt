`` success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well '' i agre with thi statement . probabl the secret of mani success person might be thi onli . if peopl go on with the well known thing they might feel their life bore and they ca n't think innov , which lead to miss their success henc the fame or reput . for exampl a man could not be a scientist unless he tri to invent or invent a new thing . for instanc take the astronom who would alway think of do someth or discov or analys someth new from the space which an simpl man ought to do , make them to do rick like space travel . evenif they will fail onc they would tri besid their live for new thing . which make them great success citezen . i wa alway encourag by my father to do new thing so that i can give wing to my mind and think beyond and becom a sucessful guy in my societi . which brought me sever prize by particip in the scienc fare . also when peopl tri to do new thing they will adopt for that and they will get habitu to those despit of the difficulti . also tri new thing would also give some self satisfact for oneself . if we do a new thing and succeed in it we feel proud for that . it will also be play full to do new thing . kid usual have thi behaviour that is they would like to mplay alwaya with new toy or other which they like the most for them even candl light would be so attract that they would like to touch it which may bring rick for them but unknowingli he doe it and find out what would happen uf he touch a harm thing . that is tri new thing willl make a person to leatn new thing which help him through out hte life final i conclud that go for newer thing make man more successful . as success not mean onli success in acedem or other but selfsatisfact is also a type of success which make us to stand still for ani circumst we face .
