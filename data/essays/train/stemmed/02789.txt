is it more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? i strongli agre with the statement for three reason . understand idea and concept is import for develop of student ' abil to appli , to care for other , and also to come up with question and theori . first of all , without idea and concept , student can not use the knowledg in daili life . for exampl , let 's say there is a boy who ha learn the pythagorian theorem but ha never been taught how the mathematician came to the theorem . he doe not know where and how the fact came from , therefor is unabl to appli hi knowledg for some similar but differ problem . secondli , i believ that the sens of moral issu can onli be develop through vast knowledg of idea and concept . to understand how peopl act , student have to know idea and concept about human mind rather than fact , becaus everyon is differ . if student are taught moral issu as fact , not as concept , they will like to stick with that idea and not abl to think of other peopl . the last and probabl the most import reason is that understand idea and concept well may lead the student to develop with further question and theori . know where and how a fact come from give the student better understand about the fact . moreov , further investig use concept will lead some of them to find fact that have never been discov . develop of theori is definit due to well-understand of idea and concept . some adult , even the teacher , insist the student learn fact rather than understand idea and concept . i strongli oppos to that opinion . as i state , understand idea and concept result in student ' abil to appli knowledg , to understand moral issu , and to come up with question and theori .
