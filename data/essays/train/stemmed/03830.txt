i do not think that it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject instead of special in one specif subject . have a broad knowledg doe not mean that one ha a good knowledg . howev , it is more import to be good in what you , i think . if a person ha a broad knowledg of a lot of subject , usual it is not veri convinc . it take a lot of time and effort to realli learn fact about a certain topic and to understand them . therefor , it is nearli imposs to have both . it would take too much time . furthermor , when appli for a job one usual need to have specif knowledg of the respect sector they will work in . therefor , one should know what profess they want to prepar for and then get a good educ for that specif profess . employ will usual appreci it more if their employe is an expert in hi job . my most import point is that one should not have a broad knowledg becaus they will not be abl to enjoy their live . they will realiz that they are not realli good becaus they do not know detail and can not support their idea with reason fact , for exampl . henc , they will get unsatisfi with themselv . one consequ of that might be that they fall into depress . anoth consequ might be that they tri to improv their knowledg . howev , that is not easi becaus there are so mani subject they would have to work on . a possibl solut would be to final special in one of the field they are interst in . in conclus , i think it is better to concentr on one subject and to be good in it in order to live a happi and fullfil life .
