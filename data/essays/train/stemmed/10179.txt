i think it is veri difficult to say which one is more import . howev i agre that is more import for student to understand idea and concept becaus those are veri use to develop a critic approch to the world . but i have to say that understand onli the concept have both advantag and disadvantag . on the plu side , like it is written befor , understand deepli the concept help you to see what is happen in the world with your own mind and to be critic too , so you can say what do you thing is run great and what is not . you can also say your opinion and support the solut for a specif problem that you like more . on the minu side it is also veri import to learn fact , becaus histori is base on fact , and onli the knowledg of fact can help you to understand what happen and how can you act in order to avoind the bad thing . in addit mani work are base on the fact , for exampl an administr or a manag of a compani must decid what is better to do base on what realli happen . on the contrari there are other job where i think it is more import to understand the concept . let 's consid an engen : he ha to develop new product and he ha to solv veri difficult problem and also he is alway look for the best solut , so he must elabor new solut base on what he alreadi had learnt . we can say the same thing if we consid an artist . an artist is alway look for new way of express , he want to shock everi time hi fan present them someth that is total new so hi job is base on concept ! howev we can say that the best solut for thi problem is to give the right weight to both of idea and fact , probabl idea is more import than fact , but without fact i think it is imposs to use the concept you have learnt .
