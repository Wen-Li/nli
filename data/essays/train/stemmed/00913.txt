i disaggre with thi staement . in my opinion both , understand idea and concept and studi fact , are import . understand idea and concept are veri import for student becaus if they just learn fact they would n't understand them when it come to more detail topic . for exampl studi foreign languag at school . student can practis their vocabulari and the grammar just by learn them in their mind ( the fact and rule ) but it doe n't help them when they need to read or actual speak in that languag . there you need idea or concept which the teacher can give you to learn that languag more easili . moreov student need to studi praxi . with fact they can not learn them . at thi point you need concept and idea . for exampl in a math class . the teacher can teach you some fact and rule about a specif topic but without hi or her idea student are not abl to understand that topic . they need to practic the topic by themselv to make sure that they actual understood the sheme of the topic . on the other hand it is also import to studi some fact . the subject histori could n't be taught without fact . student need to studi special date , for exampl about the world war , to understand the timefram and to get a feel of the past . furthermor i think that you usual need to get some fact first befor you can start to get some idea or concept . the best exampl at thi point is again the mathslesson . you need to read some fact or proof first befor you can get into the topic . in my mathlesson we usual had to read first a page with fact and exampl befor our teacher explain everyth a littl bit more detail . all in all i am of the opinion that student need to understand idea and concept on the one hand and on the other hand i believ that it is import as well that they studi some fact .
