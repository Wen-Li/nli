i agre that most advertis make product seem much better tahn they realli are . in the recent year peopl 's life have been great improv , and pepol began to demend more thing to their life . becasu there are more demend , or consum , the market start to expend , and it caus more supplier join into the market . supplier must compet with each other inord to let consum to buy their product , and one effcient way to compet with other is advertis . befor buy anyth from the supplier , consum would tri to know more about the product through advertis made by the supplier , and thi give the supplier a chanc to show their product . bearli no one would buy a thing just by one look , so the advertis need to be more detail and more attract . consum would compar about the advertis between differ supplier rather than the product themselv . supplier clearli understand what consum 's thought are , and they would tri to add more thing to the advertis , what may make them more superior than the other . the superior one are alway more attract to the consum , at least more peopl would pay more attent to them . although the `` addtion '' thing or function ad to the advertis are usual not exist or in the real product or the real one will not work as effici as the one the in advertis , but it would never be a problem for the supplier , becaus what they care most is the amount of product been sold . consum may not recogan what is true about the product until they bought them , and somehow they have to accpt the truth although they expect a much better result . in the recent year advertis are no longer a way for consum to get know about the product from the supplier , but more like they becam a way to just increas the sell amount by the seller . thing describ better than the real one in the advertis are veri common now , it is a misfortun for most of the consum .
