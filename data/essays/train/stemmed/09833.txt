i believ the correct of thi statement vari greatli from one commun to anoth . if am to answer thi question consid turkey , the countri i live in , i would still say the answer depend on differ socio-econom class in turkey . howev , i agre that the major of young peopl in turkey nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . one thing that can be said is that the more educ a young person is , the more time s/he devot to help the commun . when we look at the uneduc youth of turkey , we see that they spend their time do simpli noth . a larg percent of them is unemploy and they do n't have the sens of help other in the commun sinc they are the one who need help in the first place . howev , when we look at the youth in the univers , we see that they are more concern about the problem in the commun and possibl way to solv those problem . so , from thi point on , i will concentr on the educ young peopl . when i look at my univers , there are some peopl tri to help the commun , and some peopl who simpli do n't care . devot time to help the commun is not realli common , though . the heavi courseload forc peopl to plan their time effect , and what is includ in the plan is , most of the time , the thing which have practic benefit . peopl simpli do n't have time to enjoy the moral benefit obtain from help other . actual , a person can devot time to help other peopl onli when his/her own need are fulfil , so that s/he can enjoy the moral satisfact and respect from other in the commun . howev , in a commun where it is hard to fulfil the need of oneself , it should not be expect of young peopl to devot their time to help other in the commun . mor
