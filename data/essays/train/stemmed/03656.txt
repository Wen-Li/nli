modern societ are think more individu than ever . thi is a result of multipl factor that i will shortli describ in thi writ . the first factor is the metropoli concept . at the beggin of the 20th centuri , there were no so mani citi in the world with more than a million of habit . today , one can realiz more than 50 citi with more than 10 million of habit . the metropoli ha mani implic in the way of live , in term of competit for a workplac , time dedic to educ activ , time and resourc invest in transport . day after day time invest at home is decreas and the young peopl quit often do not see with treir parent as they have so mani thing to do , but the famili is not a prioriti anymor . a second factor is the revolut of commun media and all what it ha brought to societi . the media influenc over the peopl is huge . unfortun what bring cash to the media compani are the star program . i have not seen ani top seri for young that focus their attent to comunitari program , obvious , that wo n't have ani rate . the third factor is the lack of believ . as a human be , is import to believ in a superior god , no matter if is christian , methodist , budism , etc . the believ and practic of a religion are the basi of a commun . the final factor is that the educ at school are focus more in technic format than humanist , focus student more in `` me '' think than in a commun think . technic educ is basic , but moral educ is as import and shoul be teach in the same way and intens . multin and global corpor work as a commun , share a corpor cultur and valu , and from my point of view , that is the onli way that one could guarrante sustain . one of the basi of leadership is to work in group to bring result foto the commun and young should be advis of the import of help their commun .
