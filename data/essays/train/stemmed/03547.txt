i clearli contradict the statement `` it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to speciasl in one specif subject '' . it is better if we special in one particular subject as we can gain the complet knowledg about that particular subject rather than know inadequ small amount of knowledg in variou subject . to have complet grip on one subject one should put hi complet concentr in one subject , but if we tri to gain knowledg from everi other subject the concentr get distract . it is better to be a king of one subject than be a jack of everi subject . as an exampl if we take a doctor , he ha complet knowledg of hi subject , but if he studi other busi or art subject along with medic subject he can never becom a succes doctor , same in the case of a bussi administr , if he concentr on other thing hi busi may suffer a loss . so , it is alway advis to gain complet knowledg about the particular profess or subject . one of my uncl wa interest in learn all the subject which he came across , and to fullfil hi interest he didnt concentr on ani one subject but tri to master all the subject and wa final left with inadequ knowledg about each of them . as a contrast my father wa interest in be a succes bussi man and from childhood concentr on hi subject of interest and now becam a famou busi magnet . thi clearli depict the advantag of speacial a particular subject and on the otherhand disadvantag of tri to gain knowledg from all the subject . thu i clearli want to state that one should master in one subject which can give him a great monetari or social gain rather than tri to master all the subject and ultim fail to do so .
