if one had to ask me , i person agre to the follow statement . in today new world where student are compet with each other , where educ ha becom a prime necess and not just a mere hobbi we often hear student have endless convers about the assig they need to submit or the test that are come up . each one have a goal to strive toward . with more time for work and less for play we hardli find young peopl sacrif some of their time to their commun . commun servic hold littl valu to mani youngster in today world of technolog , the modesti that we would find in youngster of the previou decad is absent . on the other hand we still find youngster make an attempt to find time for their commun , to selflessli devot some of their valuabl time to the helpless peopl of their commun and to help interact with them , to help bring a smile to their face . when compar to the number of student that help their commun , the number of student that dont outcast them howev , there is still room for improv , everi cloud ha a silver line and therefor i can say that mayb in the near futur some improv might be made , howev we notic that as the year are pass we tend to see more peopl involv with their materialist world leav no or less time for the helpless . a good exampl would be myself , i start everi month with an intent to help atleast one person i know in my commun , to help bring a smile to atleast one person face but the month fli by and befor i know it the next month ha start with exactli the same intent but no progress . the drive that we student have toward our educ result in a fall back when it come to serv our commun . our weekend are use up in complet unfinish assign and relax ourself from the tire week that just went by and therefor i person feel that in today world veri few young peopl devot a good amount of time help their commun .
