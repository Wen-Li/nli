i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . it is obviou that the world of advertis is not the real world . one may ask , whi thi busi is still run so well , although everybodi seem to know that all these advertis are fiction . in my opinion it is not worth discuss thi particular circumst state in the statement . much more interest is the fact that the advertis industri is such a live and success industri . to question that , will lighten up the reason , whi the untruth of advertis final doe n't bother us . everybodi know , that there is a lie lie in advertis in gener . but i think , there is someth like an agreen go on in modern societi , an agreement between peopl and the advertis compani . advertis satifi long of mass of peopl and it becam a space or a tool to express , exchang , consum and play with way of lifestyl . and thi is the keyword for explain thi whole situat . in my opinion peopl enjoy to get inform in thi way . thi can be seen from differ view . on the one hand it 's a way of freedom , base on hi or her own respons , on the other hand it a subtil way of leathership that te advertis compani were abl to grasp . so there is a world that consist out of long and desir and there is no point to discuss the fit between the advertins and th eproduct itself . thi industri care about lifestyl and that it .
