the issu at hand is whether there will be fewer number of car in usag in the next twenti year . in my view as the technolog is progerss at a faster pace and the economi of an induvidu will be increas so there will be increas in the number of car in the next twenti year . firstli , when we consid from a point of improv in the technolog mani advanc have been made in the field of technolog when we deal with the car of the past they use to give a lesser mileag than the sophist and welli improvis car of today offer . when we relat technolog to the econom condit of ani countri , as there is an improv in the technolog and henc it would creat employ for the peopl there by the econom statu of the induvidu increas and henc the car be the symbol of luxuri everyon want to travel in a car so in my view the usag of number of car would drastic increas in the next twenti year . futhermor , when we look at the issu from other point of view like when the time is taken into considerart the car of today are much faster basic becaus of the technolog use . for exampl in olden day in the sens in the nineteenth centuri the mean of transport wa mainli by buse , cycl and tram , but after the foray of the car into the world of transport it revolutionis the field by not onli provid luxuri , and comfort but also peopl were abl to reach their destin in time . in a busi world of today where everi thing is run by machin time is the major constraint . so for the peopl to reach their destin as earli as possibl car provid a basic mean of transport . lastli when we consid the fuel which is use in the car there ha been a drastic improv . initi it wa petrol and diesel , now due to the advanc of technolog the car are driven by use batteri , by use latest technolog of use a motor-gener set mechan which bought a revolut in the field , so peopl will have variou option to choos from and the research is still go on in thi field to find out a cheaper fuel on which the car will run so it will afford to all the section of peopl , so the usag of car is go to increas in the futur . i disagre with the issu that there will be fewer number of car in the next twenti year becaus improv of technolog , foray of variou kind of fuel on which the car can run , and the econom condit of the countri , the life style of peopl - these are the variou factor which contribut to more usag of the car in the next twenti year and near futur .
