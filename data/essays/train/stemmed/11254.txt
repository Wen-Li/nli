i think there will not be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year . car in use will be increac . becaus popul of human will be still inceras in twenti year and technolog will be still develop , too . it is true that there are mani car in use in the unit state , england , franc , japan and so on , but for exampl , most peopl in china ride bicycl to go to their offic or school . i think the price of car is so expens that they can not buy car . if the tecnolog of make car develop in thi twenti year , the price of car would be lower . so peopl who can not buy car now will be abl to buy car . and the number of car in use will be increac , i think . some peopl would say that car are bad for environ of the earth , and it is true , i think . but i hope that the technolog of eco would develop , and we would be abl to have `` eco car '' , which have no badli influenc on environ of the earth . and , mani peopl say that their hobbi is drive . it is becaus car are privat room for driver , i think . when i feel sad or when i have problem , i want to drive to be relax and reflesh . so , if the train or aeroplan were more comfort and usu , peopl would not take their car away . car are not onli traffic tool but also `` oasi '' for peopl . these are the reason whi i think there will not be fewer car in use than there are today in twenti year .
