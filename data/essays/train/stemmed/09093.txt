i think the commun ha to help itself , it is not onli a moral oblig of young peopl ! what do you mean for young peopl ? teenag ? a 30 year old man is still young , but he is not a young man for the commun ! all the peopl have to give time to help the commun ! all the peopl do not care about the other , onli a few peopl , like the men who go to africa to help the poor popul ! they give all their life to help the commun . as you can see they are not young peopl , so all the peopl do not give time to help , abov all the young . but now the societi is differ , it is not like 50 year ago , there 's been a lot of chang , the peopl need differ thing , nowaday a young man need to studi , to realis himself ! how can i help a person if i do not feel well ? i have to realis myself , i have to studi , sometim i have to relax , sometim i need to have fun . young peopl are a particular kind of peopl , but i think they are the most import part , they are the futur , so they have to realis themselv and a day they will be abl to help other peopl , but not today , it is not the most import thing now ; the old men can help the other , becaus they do not have other thing to do , now they can use what they learn in the past ! may be in the past the young peopl had more respons , i do not know , and i can not , but as i said befor , the time ha chang , the time is a circl , today it is your turn , tomorrow it will be mine . i 'm young and i 'll have time to help the other , i wish , now i have to care about myself .
