when wa the last time you spend just an hour help anoth person ? all of us -- not onli young peopol -- may think about thi question , becaus nowaday we 've becam more selfish , complet dedic to our own life and sometim we do n't realiz that there 's a lot of peopl around us that are less priviledg and need help . therefor , it 's true that now we do n't give enough time to help our commun . i think that there are sever factor that explain thi behaviour . firstabl , societi doe n't recogn thi contribut , but instead of it , you 're better if you get two major , an excel job , buy a car and a hous and live with all the conveni . so , we spend our time tri to get these goal and forget about the commun . a second factor could be that nowaday the time is the most appreci valu . the compani pay us for our time , we spend a lot of time work , and free-tim is veri import for us . work on a ong project will take us a lot of free and not revenu time , so we prefer not to do it . to illustr thi point i can talk about my own experi . while i wa work for an advertis agenc i tri to spend more time help the other , i felt that i had to do it . i contact to ` aldea infantil ' ( a childhood project ) and i spent a year teach children and play with them just friday afternoon . in the end i decid to quit the project becaus i work at the offic son mani hour than then i did n't have enough time to see my boyfriend and my famili . i realiz that time wa too much import if you do n't have enough . in short , although it 's difficult to have enough time for all , we have to tri it and spend mayb just an hour a week help our commun .
