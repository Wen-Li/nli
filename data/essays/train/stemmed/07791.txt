young peopl are often independ and sometim selfish . moreov , peopl who help their commun are usual quit old . so some peopl can say that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . there is truth but i do n't total agre and i will explain whi . it is true that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . it is a fact that the member of thi kind of associ are often old . there are no mani young peopl in it . it is a piti becaus young peopl have much time and they could use it for that . there are even some young peopl who have fun when they disturb their commun , it is a real problem in some area , for exampl in the suburb of pari . but i do n't think it is realli new as the statement seem to mean . it is a veri old thing , solidar wa never veri strong for young peopl . young peopl like to enjoy their life , they are independ , they spent all their time for their own life . and i think it is time for them to do that . i do n't think they have to be selfish and it will be good if they help more their commun . but i understand whi young peopl give less time to that . i think it is more a question of cultur than a question of age . if there is a lack for help nowaday , it is becaus of everyon . for exampl , a young peopl will be not encourag to help hi commun if hi parent do n't . thi kind of behaviour is help by the educ from the parent and the school . everybodi must do someth to improv the situat and put the respons on young peopl is not the best thing to do . final i think that it is true that young peopl do not give enough time to help their commun . but i do n't think it is new and i think it is not the main problem .
