i agre that the most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . thi is the mojor strategi do by advertis to reach much number of peol . but some of them can say lie for selll the product . advertis onli give the adventag and best side of the product , you ca n't show ani attent about it 's disadvantag . consum must also learn bad side of the product . furthermor advertis can tall much more than they are . in addit to thi if you make lot of advertis about the product poepl want to learn what it is than less advertis product . of cours they will go to the shop centr and look your product and usual thi look will finish with buy the product . in our countri there are also lot of advertis which make person bore in a rest of tv program . sometim it take twenti minut . in fact as me all peopl chang the channel to fin new one which is not advertis someth . if advertis want to take peol on tv they must do funni and interest advertis . besid of that most advertis may includ more lie than other . thi is sell method and we ca n't know if they tell us true or not . we must search and ask alot about product befor buy it . we can get thi inform who use that product befor . and also politician have to do some law for advertis . that law mu limit the advertis and includ some punish if they tell wrong in the advertis . as a result there are lot of disadvantag and advantag of most advertis . i agre that peopl want to buy product alot w'th most advert's but it mu n't includ lie and harmful thing for peopl . they must be true
