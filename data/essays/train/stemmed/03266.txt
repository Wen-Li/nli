i am agre with the idea that in twenti year will be fewer car in use than there are today for differ reason . first , peopl are more concern about the pollut on the environ than year ago , and they see as problem that we have with the higer temperatur sinc few year ago . some peopl made the deciss to use the car onli for a specif and relev situat . they use the public transport to go to work , they discoverd that with bu or metro they arriv faster , and they abov the trafic in mani citi . second , health on sociati it is everi day more import . mani peopl use a difer way to tri to be feet on their daili week . it is becam more popular use the bike as person transport . in mani european citi as dublin , barcelona , pari . .. gover ate concern and the are prepar the street for peopl who use the bike . also it is a good idea for have less pollut on the citi and trafic more fluent . other peopl prefer to walk or runn when they go to work and they dont have to use the car , they keep feet without of cost . it is a big descis when you decid to buy a car . they are veri nice and handi bthey are veri expens thing to have . cost a lot money the insur and petrol , it is other reason for whi i think in twenti year we will have less car on the street .
