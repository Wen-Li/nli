i agre with thi statement . i think thi phenomenon is much more frequent in advertis of food , but it is also widespread for other product . we have a lot of exampl in the allday life : when we go to a supermarket we see lot of product that seem veri prelib , quit appet , that realli seem to be perfect . in my person experi , i often know that when i 'll be back home and i will be abl to see how realli the product is , my delus will be clear . but thi not avoid me buy that product , and obey to the law of consum : consum must be stimul to buy a product , in everi possibl way . so the messag of some advertis for exampl emphas some qualiti of the product that are not so import , or that the product doe n't have ! thi is a tipic aspect of the modern societi , which is total focus on the appear and veri often seem to forget that sometim it is more import the substanc than the form . but i think also that thi trend in modern consumist societi is due to an intrinsec characterist of the product in commerc . we can see that the product in a certain field are quit similar : for examp everi car well doe it function , to carri a peopl from one place to anoth . there are veri few differ between one car and anoth one : one car may be less expens , the other may have less consum , anoth one may be more fascin , but realli all car are veri effici if we think that they onli have to permit us cover big distanc in short period of time . sometim one compani is abl to project a car which is a bit differ from the other , for exampl becaus it ha a new technolog devic , but thi improv is not so determin , and other car doe not becom obsolet in an istant of time . so whi a consum should choos a product instead of anoth ? at thi time is veri import the aspect of thi product , and it becom so import that in some case it bring to a systemat lay , by make product much better than they are .
