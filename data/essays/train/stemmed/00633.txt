in my opinion in twenti year a lot of thing may chang . as regard the car i think that sinc one of the major problem today is the pollut produc by car mayb in the futureb car will be fewer . there ha been a lot of confer about thi probem , in these year . i do not believ that in twenti year there will be car with a differ kind of carbur , abl to respect the natur , becaus mayb that special car will go too slow and the peopl would not buy them . in my person opi that is more probabl a solut could be car that doe not destroy the natur ambient it will not happen and it would bo too expens . but i think that in 20 year i think also that in the futur , for the increasingli amount of the popul the traffic will be a real obstacl for worker , it will becom easier for everybodi to take a plane . the plane will be less expens and they will go more and more faster . thank to technolog a lot of new futur machin , a part from the plane , will be discov , so the car will be abandon . sinc the life in the 2006 is caracter by the fact that nobadi ha time enough , oll the everyday situat are becom faster and faster so peopl in 20 year will `` run '' for all the day . for thi reason a car is not suffic . if i think about the world in the 2026 i can see a sky full of plane and air structur , and no car at all . mayb everyman will have hi own person plane and the car will be consid as an old nice object for aa art collect for exempl . .
