even though it is quit import for student to learn fact as well as idea and concept , i would like to insist on the import to understand idea and concept befor analyz fact becaus otherwis student can not keep right on truck . there are a coupl of reason whi i emphas for student to studi idea and concept first . one is the fact that studi idea and concept first would work for student to learn fact effici . the other is the fact that learn fact doe not make sens without a studi from ani perspect base on concret idea and concept . first , if student understood idea and concept befor learn fact , they could appli thier knowledg to focu on what the essenc of the fact is and how those fact occur . thi is one of the most import abil for student to learn in univeris . they can not analyz ani fact without fandament idea and concept . for exampl , student can understand econom phenomena much more effect with a number of concept than without them . second , fact themselv do not make sens without ani background infom . if student did not studi idea and concept at all , they would understand fact as just what happen at that time . howev , they need studi idea and concept to understand fact from differ point of view . for exampl , when terrorist attack build in new york , some peopl might say that it wa total isram 's fault while the other say the unit state is also contribut to thi incid . in sumarri , student should understand idea and concept deepli befor they learn and judg the fact . although it wa not realli easi for them to studi idea and concept becaus sometim those concept are veri complic , they still do thi becaus fact do not make sens without ani basic idea and concept .
