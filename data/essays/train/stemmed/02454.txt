i will not agre to the first statment given that broad knowledg of mani subject is better than have specil in one subject . becaus it is veri diffcult for a student to understand mani subject at atim . he can not concentr on ani off them properli sinc he will have a littl time for one subject . it will also make him tire off work . if he feel that he is lack off time are he is work more it may leed to get tension and strees . which will creat alot off confus for what he have to do are not for hi featur . on the other hand if a student is allow to studi one specif subject at a time it will allow him to studi care and understand the subject well . sinc he will have a lot off time to work on the subject , ani he can easili clarifi ani dought if he get with hi teacher and can understand betterli sinc he do not have ani other work to be done more than thi . a student can have a littl knowledg of mani subject . but a broad knowledg off al subject s will be veri diffcult for him at a time . i will be better to studi one subject at a time then shift on to other subject .
