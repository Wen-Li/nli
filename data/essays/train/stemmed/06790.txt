car belong to the big progress in our industril period . nowaday , in industri countri , car are realli common and sometim realli hep and use dure our daili life . but for mani reason peopl will have to use less car , first becaus of the lack of petroleum in a come soon futur , then the effect on the environ caus by the pollut of car and the grow of the popul . the petroleum is becom more and more rare and therefor realli expens . it will becom so much expens that more and more peopl will have no choic that take common transport instead of individu car . we are also spoken about new fuel that can be use instead of petrol but i think it will be also expens for the peopl . for exmpl a hydrogen car is a highli technolog solut but as we are talk we are just in the prototyp level . organ oil can be also an altern solut but it will mean that we will need to have uncred huge crop yield to feed all the car which is imposs . anoth aspect which can decreas the number of car is the pollut . all peopl know the bad effect creat by a car for our atmospher . peopl are all the more awar of the problem that we can see in our period time the consequ of the pollut in the climat . the climat is becom warmer and we are more face to natur catastroph caus by a strang behaviour of the weather . peopl are sensibil to the subject of the bad effect of some gaz emiss in our atmospher . we will reach a time where peopl will had no choic that to leav their car if they want to prevent the earth from an ecolog drama . final the popul on the earth is increasingli grow up . we are know almost 6.5 billion . some crowd countri are becom more and more industril , for instanc india and china . there will be probabl a problem of logist if everybodi ha a car . it will be imposs to drive , there will be too much traffic . peopl in thi case should find anoth solut to move , to commut . we can conclud that in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than today when we observ the problem we are face today with the number of car . it will be obvious a cost for our confort but it will be total benefici for the futur of our planet .
