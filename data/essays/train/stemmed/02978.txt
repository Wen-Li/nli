univers cours nowaday are made of idea , concept and fact . but i disagre with the statement that say that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . concept and idea are onli a basi , concept and idea are often born from fact and fact allow student to go out of the theoric field to be closer to the profession life . in univers cours , concept and idea are onli a basi . it is essenti to understand them but it is also worth to learn how tu use them through fact . fact are in a sens concret exampl or element which will help student to learn concept and idea and help them understand that concept and idea alon are worthless if one do not learn to use them through fact . in econom scienc lot of concept are veri abstract as for instanc the concept of util . if you do not appli it to the everyday life it is stay hardli understand . secondli most of the concept are born from fact . sometim idea and concept result from reflect but most of the time they are the result of experi or fact . in the chemic industri a larg number of formula concern chemic materi are born from experi made with thi same formula and which lead to an unexpect conclus . that is the same for cook . lot of recip are issu from a test . moreov fact allow student to pass through the theoric field to adapt the concept and idea they learn to professionn life for exampl . a student learn commerci relationship will understand sell principl much better through concret exampl . actual concret exempl or experi relat to concept realli help to be closer to the professionn world and to understand better profession relationship . so as a conclus one can say that concept , idea and fact are work all togeth and one can even underlin that in some field like histori for exampl , fact are most of the cours .
