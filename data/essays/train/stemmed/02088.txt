in my opinion i can not realli agre or disagre with the statement `` succes peopl tri new thing and take risk rather then onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . '' for exampl , it is alway necessari to do thing which i realli know are good and how i have to do them . i can not open a design agenc if i do not know how to work with colour , art , sign or type . that are necessari and elemantari topic for a design . but if my agenc work good , i could tri some risk . for exampl , i could tri to achiev new goal . thi doe not work without some risk . when i first onli colour book and invent new corpor design for other firm , and now i want to offer a new part of design , the imagefilm , it includ a lot of risk . i have to ask me some thing : `` do i have enough money for the new equip ? am i abl to handl with the new topic ? '' or '' will i have peopl want pay me for my work ? '' thi are all risk and the topic is a new thing for me . but i could realli be succesful , mayb i have a great talent in make film . and new idea are go to be search . it could be , that i have not mani limit in my mind about thi topic and i could tri mostli everyth . thi would be a new way for me and my agenc . and if colour book and make new corpor design are thing which work good befor , they are the basi for new thing and risk . and i can be sure that i have thing which are abl to allow me the new risk . that is whi , i think you need both to be succesful , first you should have knowledg which you alreadi know to handl and then you can tri new thing amd take risk . thi would be a veri good combin for bee a succesful peopl .
