i disagre with the statement `` it is more import for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' learn idea and concept are as import as know the fact . by know about the fact , student becom more practic , they know what idea and concept are been use in thi world , by thi he come to know about the real world . have knowledg of onli idea and concept make student conserv by know fact they becom outstand . learn fact make student complet . it increas their knowledg and they becom more innov . thi will improv their perform in studi . just know the idea and concept without fact keep them in the dark . fact enlighten them . by know idea and concept they can do good in the exam , but fact make them to do better , when they get job . idea and concept educ the mind by tell about the subject how it is invent or discov but fact educ the soul of the student . educ , onli with idea and concept and no fact is wast . suppos for exampl we have learnt darwin 's `` surviv for exist '' but later we came to know the fact that it wa wrong . so , i agre that kow fact is as import as idea and concept .
