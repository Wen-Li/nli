as soon as a child begin school he/sh is taught to be creativ , to think out of box , rather be unconvent at time , challeng the exist dogma . perhap these are the virtu that have help mankind in the develop of the world today . these are also reflect in success peopl . they tri new thing , take risk and thi is what make them success and differ from the common man and perhap i fulli support the statement . imagin if peopl did not tri new thing and take risk , then would and new metal or perhap discoveri by madam curi be possibl . would america be discov by columbu if he did not take the risk to ventur out on a round the world trip . would we know of legend like hercul , achil or alexand if they did not take the risk of conquer the world . perhap even today we would have thought that the earth is flat and not round , earth is the center of the univers and may be we would still be write on leav instead of paper . sucess can not be quantifi and what is success to one might be just an ordinari achiev for other . to thi critic might say that you should do your work with proper thought and achiev masteri in one expertis rather than be a master of all . thi what they would say that `` you should work on onli what you know rather than take risk and tri new thing '' . but in my opinion the answer to thi is that , would `` microsoft '' be there where it is today if `` bill gate '' had not taken the risk and tri to be unconvent rather be submiss . also if we take the exampl of the field of medicin , then perhap new discoveri would rather be imposs . if our doctor had not taken the risk involv in organ transplant , cancer research , or may be stem cell research then perhap mani peopl would have not been here today as they are becaus of them . to thi i may add that be foolhardi is also not advis . you should take risk onli when you know that there is an element of success there . just tri to show off will not land you anywher . therefor if i were to conclud then perhap to be successful you will have to tri new thing and be courag to take risk but onli when it is advis and need . imit other might give you momentari success or may be even more but not the recognit wherein you will be rememb for someth new .
