i agre with the statement that the student must understand the idea and the concept rather than the student to know or learn the fact becaus learn the fact will not help him to know about someth practic . the best exampl for thi is about the flight , you can onli drive the flight onli when you know the idea to start the plane and the concept to take off the flight where as learn fact are onli use to tell to other how the flight use to work . so thi mean that idea and concept will alway help in mani way like when the pilot is in troubl so then you would atleast know that how to land the flight as if you know the concept of it how to land the flight down on the runway . anoth exampl is for exampl if you want to creat a hardwar devic , you can onli start when you have a basic idea on it , without that it is imposs to creat a hradwar devic . later you need the concept to develop it featur and the perat it need . learn fact is also need here to make the devic complet without ani problem which the peopl who had work on the other devic befor . thi make the work more easier than get into the troubl . but here we give impot mainli to the idea and concept rather than learn the fact thi fact would onli help us to complet the devic quickli . so student have to understand the idea and the concept which help them in futur when they want to research anyth or they want to develop ani product which is alreadi exist . as they get succeed they think or get idea of do more research and develop . so idea and concept are more import the learni
