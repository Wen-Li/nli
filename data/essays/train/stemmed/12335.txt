i agre with the statement as fact do n't drive the concept or the idea . i feel that concept and idea have more import than fact . without know how to implement a concept and how to tri an idea know fact in not quit need . a person with idea and concept can appli them when he ha a problem he cant do that by know the fact . the exampl are discuss in detail below . a student when given a problem in math can solv the problem onli if he understand 's idea of how to start and the concept that he ha to use to solv the problem and get the requir answer . just by know the fact on the problem he can not solv the problem with eas it take great difficul to solv the problem without know the concept and have an idea of the problem , concept . for a student to understand a subject he need to have an idea about the subject and he need to understand the concept of the subject first , then he can easili understand the fact . so primari thing is to understand idea and concept rather than just fact . it is the same in case of scienc subject like physic and chemistri . for do practic knowledg a student or the reserch should understand the idea of the experi and the concept to deal with the experi . understand idea and concept have a veri great import in life . there is a need tro understand idea and concept particularli in the educu life . the concept and idea are more import for student and reserch to develop new thing and to excel in their feild . so i feel that fact have veri less import even by know the fact about the subject it would be hard to analyz it just by fact . the abov reason make me agre with the statement .
