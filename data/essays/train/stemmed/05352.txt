if we think about the statement , that `` it is better to have broad knowlegd of mani academ subject than to special in one specif sucject '' , we can make a lot of comment on it . becaus everyon have differ abil to answer ani question or make comment on ani question . in thi essay , the specif subject , that is state befor , is critis and compar and contrast . firstli , in my opinion , half of peopl live in the world may choos differ one of the chois in the statement from rest of them . if i say someth about that topic , i say that of cours everyon should special in one spesif subject , that is benefici for human , but he or she also have a littl knowledg of everyth , becaus nowaday human popul is develop increasingli . so technolog is . as the matter can be seen , special in one specif subject doe n't enough for work somewher you want . boss are search for man who can do everi job that necesseri for the firm . for exampl , if you are a comput engin , you must know manag becaus in the futur you will be a manag , there is no reason not to be maanag , becaus nobodi want to die as retir engien . most peopl want more than they have . in order to that , besid you special in one specif subject , you should know anoth academ subject as a hobbi . on the other hand , peopl who did n't choos special in one specif subject , are alway loser , becaus there is n't ani job anywher . the cruel world make us to studi whole day . we must studi english to pass prep class or must studi buisi administr to finish the school or must increa us cultur to becom more social , etc . howev i choos the second one , i suppos that the right one is the first choic to becom more success . to sum up everyon should make hi own decis about that subject to becaom success and happi ,
