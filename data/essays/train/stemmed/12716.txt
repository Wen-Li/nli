altough there are some young peopl who endeav to help their commun , it could n't be wrong to state that young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun . an old say of my countri say : `` except doe n't make the rule disfunct . '' the main reason of my support thi statement is the way the young live , the way they behav to each other , the onli intrins purpos for do someth and their attidut toward older and younger alik . nearli all the young live now selfish . they contempl onli the benefit for theirselv , which they can obtain from ani activ . they are unawar of the term altruism . thi is observ to be continu in accord with the technolog . the faster the technolog invent are made , the more selfish the peopl are . the comput , the televis and same function facil are the prison of younger , but the differ is they are happi there . everyth in order to be done for be benefici to the commun doe n't interest them , becaus they are happi in their prison . their attitud toward the other is realli affect by the guardian in these prison as well . and everybodi know who the guardian are . to sum up , the young are uninterest to the social problem , howev whose guilt thi is , is obviou : technolog improv and us , who could not obey thi invent and who let them be the most import part of our live .
