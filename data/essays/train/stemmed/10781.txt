i disagre with the statement . in my opinion , it is better to be specialis in one field rather than have incomplet knowledg of sever subject which may not serv ani purpos . it no good be `` jack of all trade - master of none '' . a person have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject is like a blunt knife . it ha a larg area and zero penetr power . a specialist , on the other hand , can make breakthrough in hi field and contribut more to the societi . these day the knowledg of each subject is veri vast . to know about everyth and then assimil that inform into someth miracul is not possibl . the day are gone when a leonardo da vinci could paint masterpiec , write mathemat theori and creat model for an aircraft . today 's cut edg technolog requir specialist from divers field who can work togeth and bring about a signific develop . for exampl , consid a car manufactur compani . it doe not have all it employe know how a combust engin work , much the same way as it doe not have all of them know how to market it car . it ha specif peopl for a specif job . it ha promot to fund develop , engin to design car , account to oper logist and advertis to sell a car . it is a team of divers element , each a master in hi or her respect field , that can contribut someth use . these day mani pioneer research are carri out by group of scientist who are profici in their respect field . a physic and a chemistri expert may collabor to give someth that one could not have hope to achiev by himself . a scholar who know someth about everyth can not do much when the requir is everyth about someth . human ha thrive on it dynam and divers . to avoid stagnat , we need specialist as the field of knowledg have outgrown the capac of a singl human . a jack may fit anywher in the pack of card but it never beat the king .
