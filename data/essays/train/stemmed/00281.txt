well , i disagre with the statement that say `` it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . the reason for that , is i think fact are the basic of idea . so , how can an ida or a concept come befor the fact . consquant , the we leran the basic which is the fact , then we propos an idea . so , if a student recivi an idea or a concept without have the solid basic , he wil not be abl to make hi decis about it . therefor , he will not have the apportinuti to discouss the concept . clearli , the logic way to learn is fact then concept . so , we teach student the basic and the fact , and gradual tri to involv some idea and concept into their materi . in thi way , they will learn how accepet all the opinion and then make their own decis . also , they will tri to interfer from the fact then tri to propos their explain and support it with evid . an exampl for my chois if geolog calss . if we taught a student that cave are form in a certain way , he will memor it without conventit . in other hand if we taught him about cave from differ area . they are an extent area but if he got some inform about kind of cave and how it form , he will be convint about what he learn .
