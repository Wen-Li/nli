in thi text i will discuss the question `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' . at first i have to say that everybodi will be old at one day and thi is my first argument . when young peopl think `` i will be old sometim '' they often think on `` but not yet and i have anough time to enjoy my life ! '' . then the young peopl often do someth forbiddin or someth `` freaki '' . for exampl i read about parcour . parcour mean that you run accro a citi and alway run straight on even if there are car , garag and hous . you just climb up the wall and than jump down and that is what mani young peopl do . for older peopl enjoy life is often spend time with the famili , go travil and read someth in what they are intrest . for exampl can not everybodi remebr hi grandmoth or grandfath do someth that your parent would have never allow or someth like that ? and most peopl think that onli older peopl have got the money to travel to hotel ? older peopl most just enjoy their life . but the young peopl are often not allow to do the thing they want to do and often the parent are the reason for that . so the real question is who actual can enjoy hi life ? but thi would take to long so i will write my oppinion on the question `` young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do '' i think that young peopl enjoy their life more than older peopl do . i think that , becaus i often hear stori about oler peopl bee veri ill or have pain everywher and like thi you ca n't enjoy life . young peopl often do forbidden thing and that give them a kick and the thing with girlfriend is although give young peopl a feel of enjoy their life . so i think young peopl can enjoy life more than older peopl do .
