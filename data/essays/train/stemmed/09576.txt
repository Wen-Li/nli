i strongli agre with thi statement : it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i have strong experien that can support the reason of my opinion . i agre of thi statement becaus of two reason below . first , without process of understand , we can not say that we know fact . when i wa a high school student , there is the teacher who famou for hasit for student 's question . he tought nation histori , he alway tought us as book say like copi the book . when i question about thi subject , i could not satisfi of hi answer . he seem to do not know well about hi subject , and i do not think he understand perfectli of hi subject . he just knew and tought onli fact . espeti the nation histori class requir `` understand '' , not `` fact '' , becaus of him , i still do not know about my conutri 's histori entir . second , there is a virtu that `` know one , know ten '' it mean when we understand one thing perfectli , we can know nine thing relat with it additionali . few day ago , my one of friend ask me about concept of market . i answer to her as i learn from book , and she also knew that concept . but she need to know it profoundli . so we start to studi about it research internet , read book relat with it . eventu we could understand perfectli , as understand it , i can understand till anoth concept of market easili . becaus of two reason , i agre with thi statement : it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than ut us for them to learn fact . theseday , we can learn about everyth easili through the internet . we need attitud that think about one thing deepli rather than pass with just it fact .
