i disagre with the statement , i think student have to learn the fact inord to understand the concept , with out learn the fact regard how can a student read ? in my opinion student have to learn everi thing practicali so that he can rememb for more time , let take an exampl , let take a lectur from a proffessor in a biolog class , the professor is explain about some subject relat to frog , in thi case with out see by test a frog just have a figur in the black board and blindli follow the textbook is not good , if you want to learn the subject perfectli then go to biolog lab and test a frog then know the fact by your own and then prepar your own note , check it with your textbook content and see wether what you studi practicali is correct or not . with out do all these just by read the textbook andsay that `` i got understood '' is not at all a correct thing for student . we can learn fact by do thing practic and by conduct research . student should be in a posit of describ new idea and new concept but not in the posit of mug the old idea and concept . there is much thrill in learn the fact , here is an exampl from my person experi , last time when i went to my friend place which is some where near warang ( histor place in southeren part of india ) , it is a veri rural area even power suppli is not there , the peopl there are uneduc , there is a belief in that area that if ani one go at the night time to a place call `` maranam '' ( a big tree with lot of cave ) then they will be kill by an evil , i felt strang when i heard thi , that night me with my friend went there my firend hide near anoth tree and i 'm stand nearer the tree , i wait their for a long time , atlast i found a short and stout object come toward me ( well it is come from a forest which is near to that tree ) i slowli call my friend by sugnal with the tourch , that move object near me and me with my friend torch at hi face , got shock it a lion , see at the light the lion got scare and ran away into the forest , next day we anounc in the villag that it a lion do n't get worri and we even inform zo author and they had taken it away . thi is how learn fact will also give thrill , and one import thing is learn new thing will make
