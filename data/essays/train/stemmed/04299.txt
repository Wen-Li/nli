i agre with the statement that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are . first of all , of cours , all advertis are made to promot sale of product . therefor , maker and advertis agenc are alway tri to do their best to make the product look nicer in the advertis . they use a lot of techniqu to do thi . although some institut check the qualiti of advertis to avoid bad express such as untru express or exager , it is easi to make product look nicer in advertis without make lie . for exampl , how do peopl feel when a well-known actress who is a groumet say thi product is realli delici ? peopl believ it is more delici . and thi is not a lie if it is not delisi to a custom , becaus thi express depend individu ' tast . thi inclin of attract advatis is also help by the fact that most of the product can not be tri by the comsum befor the product are bought . that is some product such as cloth can be seen prior to pay , howev , most of the product such as food can not be tast pior to payment . therefor , attract advertis are effect . so peopl make advitis that make product seem much better than they realli are . actual we know a lot of the procut which were popular at the time of start by the advertis but lost the popular soon . thi fact show that those product were less attract than the one in the advertis . to conclud , i think it is true that most advertis seem much better than they realli are . it is unavoid fact , if we consid the charact of the advertis itself .
