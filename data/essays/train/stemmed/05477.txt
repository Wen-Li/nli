is the best way to travel with a guid group ? for some peopl the answer to thi question will be a loud `` ye '' . it might feel like an atvantag , becaus it wo n't take much time for research . it is easi to go to a local travel agent , get a plane trip , get pick up at a certain time , be guid through the differn site and come back home on time . sure , it doe sound great and it will work for some peopl , but not for me . in my person opinion the answer to the question , if the best travel would be within a guid tour , would be `` no '' . consid the background of my experi with travel i have alway enjoy be with my famili or partner rather than in a larg group . the advantag of thi is that you are total abl to concentr the trip on your person interest and abil . you can visit differ site , museum and do all kind of acitivti that are enjoy and doabl for you . on guid tour it is sometim difficult to stop at place of interest and move on to other site , if the shown is not enjoy . also the varieti of interest and idea is in a group much bigger . sometim it might also be hard for disabl , old , injur or sick peopl as well as children to keep up and to follow the given inform . for those peopl it is desir to have idividual self guid tour , which can be accomplish with the help of travel book or prior reserach . of cors you will need to inform yourself befor hand and plan the detail of your travel . but for me it alway is an interest part to collect inform on the differ opportun at the place i travel to . it doe not onli help me to plan , but also to learn more about the countri or place i want to visit . from time to time i even find out fact i have never heard of befor and will find site , build , park and mani more i have never thought of visit . thi will never happen if everyth ha been arang through a guid . overal i think peopl can get more advantag out of a self guid trip than a travl within a guid group .
