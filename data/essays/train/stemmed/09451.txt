i agre with the follow statement . there are some young peopl who would volunt to work for hi or her commun , but the number of young peopl who would not give enough time to help their commun is increas faster . the first reason that more young peopl would not help for the commun is that there are mani way to spend your spare time . you can play game , play sport , watch televis , or do whatev you want to . quit a number of peopl especi like to play comput game , and watch televis . a few month ago , i have read an articl about thi problem . it show that the percentag of watch televis and play game ha increas after the law of work 5 day a week ha been put into the realiti . so , instead of wast time on game and televis , we should tri to help our commun . second of all , we have to studi hard for our futur . nowaday , there are hardli ani job that you can get . in order to surviv in thi cruel societi , you have to studi , studi , and studi and graduat collag with a degre . then , it would be easier for you to get a job . the pressur of studi doe not give you ani free time to help your commun . there should be some chang in the curriculum of teach and studi . furthermor , mani thing have chang from past . it also made peopl to chang . hundr of year ago , our ancestor would have help each other out when they are put in a hard situat . but these day , peopl think onli about themselv , instead of work as a group , as friend . thi is an improt thing that we should learn from our ancestor . young peopl have strong power and intellig brain . but they are use it on thing that are not import . help commun will out our commun to grow to be a better place to live .
