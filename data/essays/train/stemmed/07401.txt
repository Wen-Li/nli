i think i agre with thi statement . as far as i am concern , i think that there are two idea which can support thi statement . first , recent environment protect awar ha been rise rapidli . peopl nowaday realiz that ailr pollut is get wors and wors becaus of car . thu , in order to give thier gener a better environ to live , peopl may begin to decreas drive car to the place they want to go . instea , they will start choos public transport , such as mrt , tran , and bu , to get to the place they need to go . moreov , the payment for a car is not cheap at all . for exampl , when you get a car , you have to pay for the oil and repair . i dare to say it will cost you much money than spend money on take public tranport . second , oil is becom less and less though scientist have done thier best to dig oil and find where oil can be . oil is one kind of natur resourc and the format of oil must be veri long , so it is not limtless . howev , oil is essenti for car . without it , peopl can not start car at all ; then , peopl will reduc use car step by step . i think that the abov i write can explain whi there will be fewer car than today . just rememb that quantiti of oil is limt and one day it will be gone , and the govern have spent amout of money on establish public tranport . where do the governmet get the money to creat pubic facil ? it is from peolp who pay tax . so , we , peopl , have to enjoy what we have invest and keep a better live for our next
