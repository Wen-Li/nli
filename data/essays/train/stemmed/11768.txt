there alway occur some disagr between young peopl and old peopl everytim and everywher in the world regardless of their citizenship and region . thi will continu until the end of the world as well in my opinion . but the base and the form of these disagr chang over time . nowaday , the behaviour of young peopl among themselv or to their societi are a major problem in the societi . peopl come togeth to help each other . thi is whi a commun is form . an individu can be consid week without it commun . i herebi admit that nowaday young peopl do not give enough time to build good relationship with their commun . the also do not help other individu in their commun . thi condit widen the gap between them and their societi . youngster may have distinct hobbi other than older peopl or other young peopl have . but they should respect to the other idea and hobbi first of all . i consid thi issu in order to emphas the import of be respect while commun in a commun . thi will help commun to reach qualifi standard . becaus the commun is veri import in a societi . howev , young peopl do not behav in that manner . for exampl , yestarday , i saw a young man that is listen music with hi walkman phone in the bu . that 's ok , he can listen whatev he wish . but not that loudli . the volum of the music wa loud enogh to make us listen to . anoth youngster near him said : ` hey , can you adjust the volum . pull the volum down man ! ` after thi , they start argu in the bu and the peopl in the bu were unhappi . there are two wrong behavior in thi exampl . the first one is the loud of the music that the youngster listen to : the second one is the attitud of the other youngster while talk rude . as a result , other peopl ( commun ) becam unhappi . if the youngster would hae want to help them , they behav differ and respectfuli . youngster nowaday do not read ani book . ` i do n't like read . i prefer play with my game cube. ' they say . the young peopl of thi gener are the manag of the next gener , next age . how can a lazi and untal person manag a group of peopl . a question here may aris : ` is take respons directli proport to have enough knowledg - so read ? ' the answer is alway ` ye ! ' for me . the more you know , the more you help your commun . not dure your young age , but dure your older age while work for your countri . be a veri import virtu , read should not be underestim . for an instanc , how an untal and less-read teacher can help his/her societi ? he/sh can not . in conclus , youngster should be more carr while commun with their commun and help them .
