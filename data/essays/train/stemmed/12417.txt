thi is a veri particoular theme . in my opinion the thing that is better is the first afferm . i think thi becasu for a person in the world is more interest to know someth of everi argoument instead that onli a specif sector . all thi becaus a man with a littl conosc of variou argoument can have a relationsheep with a lot of person in the world than a man that know onli a singoular sector . in the world of today the knowledg and the intellig are two import element that permit to the peopl to surviv . in the modern societi is present the refoular of the most clever . usual a man with a limit intellig is condan to suffer . for me onli in the case that a man live onli and make a particoular work without to have ani relationsheep with other person can have a special onli in one specif subject . but thi discuss is valid for few peopl . an eclect conosc permit , also if it 's limit , a dialogu with a lot of person . sometim a special conosc is not necessari becaus the the major of the discuss that peopl do is gener . onli in particoular situat is request a specif conosc of a argoument . thi is my opinion , but is not law . also becaus a limit conosc of a thing is better that no/knowledg . a life of success is possibl onli with a particoularli intellig . in fact a man onli with a intellig more develop can have a lot of success in the own life and becom a veri import person . usual the fact go in thi way . rare a man becom famou and import for a casual event . in the stori of the world these fact are veri rare . in conclus a person should have a develop knowledg in everi sector , so that he can speak and to have a relationsheep with other person of differ social level . in fact a intellig person can speak with everi person , intellig or not , but a person with a limit conosc difficulti can have a relat with differ person
