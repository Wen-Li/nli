young peopl time is gold . although young peopl care about and are worri about it , time is not suffici for them , while they have to do lot of thing : studi for their major , learn a foreign languag , part-tim job . .. i am focus on those young student that are at the univers , and that they are complet dedic to their major . due to the fact that they are student they have to be more concetr on prepar their major and prepar themselv to be better off , time for communiy activ is not as that much import . but it all depend on what sort of activ are we talk about . for exampl , work with non-gubernament organ , chariti , is total differ from other . with thi kind of activ you can becom more matur and have a differ perspect in life . have these experi may help you in your futur , think that there are some other that need more help than you . what is more , thi activ might be coordin with your own and primari activ ( go to the univers ) and sometim it is not veri easi . i have a friend that is work as a volunt in a chariti , teach peopl with physic diseas how to cook on tuesday and thursday . he love it , but when he is in mid-term exam is imposs for him to attend thi kind of cours , becaus he need to focu all hi time and energi in the subject he ha to prepar . in conlcus , it is true that young peopl do not dedic time to help their commun but they have good reason to explain and demostr whi the ca n't . mayb young peopl should reconsid the option of help the other and make an effort to do it , but it 's still young peop decis .
