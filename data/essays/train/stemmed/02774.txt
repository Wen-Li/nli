a lot of peopl special themsev in one specif subject at univers and take cors in the same depart in order to have degre in a particular field . we can wonder if it is good to have a special knowledg or a broad one . have a special knowledg on an academ subject could be great if it is in the view of be a research , a specialist or a technician in a certain field . moreov , it is easier to concentr on one specif subject dure studi and it is easier be more known becaus specialist of some subject are rare . for exampl , it is rare to find a specialist in treatment water process and so some peopl who are could have more chanc to find a job after graduat . to the opposit , have an overview of scienc and some knowledg about religion and phylosophi is necessari in everi day life and also becaus some field could cross other . for exampl , take cours about both polit and econom is better to understand the way a countri goe . it is also veri import to discov thing in order to know what it seem to be the more interest and which correspond the most to a personn . accord to me , the best is to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject at the begin of the scholarship and to special at the end . it is like that the american univers work and i think it is better than in franc becaus peopl are too special . in unit state student must have credit from other depart they are studi in in order to have an awar and a cultur more import and so they can compar and choos a field in which they are interest in in order to special themselv after .
