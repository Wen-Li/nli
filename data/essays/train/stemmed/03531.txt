i disagre with the point made abov that have knowledg of all the thing is better compar to have the knowledg of one specif field . as it is said it is better to be the master of one thing rather than jack of all trade . i have differ reson for counteract it . take exampl for the follow case : 1. if the abov fact would have been true then in univers there would be no ani special of ani subject and all the student would opt for all the subjects. but in the current sceniro thi is not applic in ani part of the world which itself is a evid of the effect of the abov logic . 2. take the exampl in the medicin field. as time goe on new and new diseas is affect the mankind. in thi situat onli the person who ha experienc in the correspond field can go for the research for the curement for that diseas by the mean of biotechnolog and will ultim land up with some specif kind of solut . 3. take the exampl of the engin field. how can we suppos to think that a person who ha no experinc in civil and in construct will be abl to make a dam for the societi . if he will go for thi perpos the govt. will itself not allow that person to build it. even if by ani mean he is abl to penetr through all the hurdl then in that situat he can not give the guarnte about the dam which he built . so take the abov exampl and fact one could easili conclud that for the better of societi one ha to undergo special which itself lead to the better for himself .
