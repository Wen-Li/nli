nowaday a lot ha been said about the role of the advertis in the current societi . some market practication have defend the idea that market and , in particular , advertis keep play a neutral role in the modern societi by onli promot the featur of a product . on the contrari , among academ and most of the public opinion , thi claim ha complet been reject . in my opinion thi second posit best highlight what the actual situat realli is : product are overpush through the advertis channel by mistel what they realli valu for the final custom . ever more commerci promis custom greater benefit from their product mislead the real want and need of them . modern advertis are abl to manipul the custom will and often convinc him/her to buy product not realli want . it may also happen that the featur illustr by the commerci are realli disappoint to the custom when thi experi the product . furthermor , by lie to the custom through advertis , the firm can realli harm the final consum . thi is the case of those kind of product that caus accid to the user . these product tend to overestim the capac of certain featur expos the cutom to danger . sinc , i think , thi issu is tremend current , more attent should be given to it . it involv ethic problem which must not be avoid . onli through a new concept of advertis , i would call it an ethic advertis , thing can get better for peopl .
