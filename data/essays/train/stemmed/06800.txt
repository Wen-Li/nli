commun is a group of peopl that have the same object or goal . ani commun can have almost peopl of everi age group and especi and mostli the youth . with the given statement , `` young peopl nowaday do not give enough time to help their commun '' , i ll not accord as per my view . let us have a brief situat analysi along with some exampl to support my view . energi is what that drive the youth at their age . so , ani commun will have the most contribut from the age group of the youth onli . interest and enthusiasm are two other key word which are particularli special about the youth and indic their attend to the commun . well , there might be a categori which doesnt have these qualiti and doesnot care about the time to help their commun . we can actual call them lazi , in other word the youth lack the energi and fire to rise the spirit and take up the work . but becaus of thi , we can not say on the overal that youth do not give enough time to help their commun . becaus we can mainli observ that all the commun are still run and for that they need to be given time . if it not one part of tghe youth that doesnot contribut , then it the other part of it which doe that . but basic the commun are be help upon by the youth . for exampl , in today 's busi life , a person if not go to church on sunday can not be call not give eough time to help hi commun . becaus the same person might donat a lumpsom amount to the church on an occas tri to show hi respons of help it . not enough time is nt the correct word for today life as it veri busi . all it doe matter is whether the individu help the commun or not and most of the time youth doe help but probabl in a hidden or indirect way . it wrong to say that they are n't give time , becaus there is no time itself due to their busi schedul for them . henc i ll disagre with the given statement and go with the one as `` young peopl nowaday might not have enough time but certainli tri to help their commun .
