it is now the year 2006 . when today is compar with 20 year ago , it is easili seen that thing have chang a lot . noth remain the same but technolog chang more than anyth els . when car wa first invent , a develop countri presid made a comment about the car . he said that it wa an unnecessari invent and peopl would not like travel in it . they would sure be bore of drive it one day and would return back to the hors they were ride befor . but hi comment never come true . it is clear that he doe not like invent but most peopl like . sinc technolog is get more advanc day by day , it is not hard to guess that someth that will be more use than the car will be invent soon . mayb in 20 year peopl will not be drive car . i strongli believ that in 20 year a mixtur of a plane and car will be produc . so peopl will not drive on the earth anymor . thi new invent will be good for everyon . sinc there will be no car on the earth , there will be no traffic jam and sinc our `` plane-car '' will be in the sky there wo n't be ani accid becaus there will be plenti of empti in the sky . also thi invent will be closer to the sun . so it will work with sun energi . as you see there will be no need of gasolin . peopl will not have to have a budget for gasolin becaus their car will work with onli sunlight and it will be free ! also if it is night and there is no sun , it will work with moon light . the idea of a `` plane-car '' is just a dream for now but it sound good . mayb it look like a real fantasi , which is imposs to occur but we should keep in mind that some time ago mani technolog devic that we use now look imposs , too .
