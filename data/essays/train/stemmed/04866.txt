i agre with thi statement . it is more import to understand basic idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if someon doe not understand the idea behind a concept , it doe not help to know all the fact . fact are normal written somewher and it doe not take long to look them up when they are need . but if the whole concept is not understood , it is imposs to realis it . that shall not mean that i believ that learnig fact is unimport , the believ of the bigger import of understand the idea is just bigger . i would like to explain to you where thi believ is base on , on a practic exampl . emagin you sit in a restaur . you are obvious hungri and have pleas the waiter alreadi to hurri . he seat you , hand out the menu and start explain what all is new in thi menu . you look at him , beg with your eye , while he start to present the specialmenu for the weekend and the actionmenu of the month and so on . that waiter definetli know all the fact , but still you will be unsatisfi becaus he did not get the point . you are hungri , and all you want is that you get good qualiti food in a fast time . he should have suggest the daili menu and you would have been pleas .
