travel is one of the most popular pastim for most peopl . when you dicid to have a travel , should you join in a group led by a tour guid or travel alon ? in my opinion , both of them have merit . travel with a group led by a tour guid may be easier and more comfort than travel by yourself . the guid will arrang everyth for you , all you should do is just to follow his/her guid . in addit , the member in the group will help each other and share their feel about the sceneri with other , which will make the tour more interest and funni . furthermor , travel with a group can save you some money . for exampl , you can share a hotel with the your groupmemb . howev , in other circumst , travel alon may be more suitabl for you . firstli , travel alon can give you more flexibl . you do not have to follow the strick schedul made by the tour guid . secondli , if you do not want to be interupt by other , travel alon may be better choic . in addit , if you tend to go a place , where is not attract to other , travel alon may be the onli choic for you . also , you can have more privaci by travel alon . as to me , my prefer depend on where i intend to visit and how much money i plan to spend on it . suppos , i plan to visit a histir place , which is relev to my subject , and even most of peopl do not know it , i may have to go there alon . on the contrari , if my destin is yellow stone park , i would like to join in a group , so i can commun with other member . in addit , the money is anoth factor , which can affect my decis . on one hand , if you have enough money , i prefer to go there alon becaus i have more flexiblil . on the other hand , if the buget is limit , i would like to share some cost with other , then i will choos a group to join .
