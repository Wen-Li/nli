it is gener agre that the younth enjoy life more than the older gener doe . howev , i will explain whi i am not a strong advoc of thi belief . firstli , most student have a lot of work to do for their studi . as a student in an engin school , i have to work a lot in order to pass my exam . i donot have too much time to spend with my friend . my parent have more time to invit friend and to attend to cultur event . i am look forward to have as much free time as they do . a lot of retir peopl are in a good shape and are travel a lot to discov the world . i am person convinc that mani of them are enjoy life more than i do . it should also bear in mind that when we have a job in a compani , we are independ and it is for me a top prioriti . we have the opportuni to spend our money as we wish . we can set up a famili and spend a nice time with our children . i woud realli appreci to bring up my chidren and to do my best to enabl them to be well educ . i know that befor thi , i will have to work veri hard to be allow to go to the universti of my dream . abov all , it should not be brush under the carpet that mani young peopl suffer from the lack of assist . some of them even commit suicid . also , some teenag have to face drug problem that have tremend effect on their health . i think that much remain to be done to decreas the rate of these dramat addict . to conclud , i back that young peopl do not alway enjoy life as much as the older gener d. i think that author should focu more on the way to help more the younth .
