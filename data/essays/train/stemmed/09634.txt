i unfortun agre that the yuth in our time not share enough ihn the commun develop . if we compar thi share with avail type of commun need . i am alway ask my self . whi thi small avail help hand . in deed i see the need for the volunt effort are increasingli clear speciali in the develop countri . one side of the commun need is the need for the donatiion to get money to help the poor or even the hungri peopl allov the world , in addit to that these donat can be channel to help the poor student to complet thier educ , more over the richi man can patron some of the sporic event to maintain the good health of theyuth in the poor town . in other area that need the help of the rich , is develop some environment project that can recycl the wast droduct in the poor countri . thi type of help not onli with econom valu but also ha a great effect on improv the health of the communitti due to minim the epidem diseas caus by the pollut . at the end i can see a lot os area peopl can help commun to develop . but again the question aris ; whi thi littl effort have been given from the yuth to th ecommun ? in my point of view there are some caus for the answer . firstli , the govern in mani countri control the donatiion of the volunt insist to expend in special area , which dissatisfi the donner . secondli th eperior of the yuth now is for fullfil the the basic need for their life wich are endlessli chang and veri ycoastli than befor which not onli take moneyi but also take alot of time . thi mone and time can be channel to the commun if th ey are siml need as befor .
