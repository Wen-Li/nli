if i have to decid whether i agre or disagre with the the claim that understand idea and concept is more import than learn the fact for student , i would disagre thi claim . student need to have concret fknowledg of fact to be an educ intellectu . i would like to give an exampl about learn a forein languag . when peopl learn a foreign languag , it is import to understand it grammar , how the word are integr , and it pragmat , how peopl use the target languag to achiev their goal . howev , even if you understand the grammar and the pragmat which could be consid as idea and concept of a languag , it doe not assur you are abl to speak the target languag . you might be abl to be a veri success scholar of the languag , but you might not be abl to speak the languag at all . in order to speak a languag , you have to memor vocabulari and idiom and learn sentenc and dialogu which could be consid as a process of learn fact . if we educ all student to becom a scholar , the approach focus more on understand idea and concept would be effect , but student will take differ carreer . educ should provid opportun for them to learn enough knowledg to surviv the real world . moreov , in order to understand idea and concept deepli , concret knowledg of fact is inevit . therefor , i strongli believ that student need focu on learn fact , not just understad idea and concept . it is not onli for student to prepar the time when they get out of school , but also it will help student to undersatnd idea and concpet more profound ly than when they do not have enough knowledg about those .
