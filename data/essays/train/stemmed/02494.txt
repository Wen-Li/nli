as far as i concern i agre with the statement success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know . first we think that who are the success peopl ? how they success ? is there ani special trick or ani other possibl ? so mani question are arriv in our mind . let we know about success peopl mean who succed in do thing . how they suc in do thing ? they have the strong determin that `` must and should i will do thi work '' as far as possibl . they are not compromis at ani where in the work . one thing we have to rememb that all success peopl may not be a perfect . definit it is true the success peopl be in a good posit and have a good respect . rather than these peopl some of us are do thing repeatedli , that mean they do thing what they know onli , so there is no chanc to implement their view and idea . they are at a place where they are in the previou and all at a time . success peopl also do thing wrongli . but there is a differ that when they do thing wrongli they will find where they will do wrong step and correct them and succed . for exampl if we are read a theorem they thought that how it came , who will be deriv thi , is there is anoth way to do thi on thi they will refer mani book , articl , newspap , and in mani other sourc . at lost they will find the answer and with thi appropri answer they gain more knowledg , they have the capabl to implement their idea in mani oter way . final i conclud that the success peopl tri newth and take risk is best due to thi they had the capabl of do thing , they will improv their knowledg as no one can expect and have mani oter advantag than do thing repeatedli what they know .
