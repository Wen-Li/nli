i veri much agre with the statement . research , develop and innov are certainli the key to success in modern and develop economi . it seem to me quit obviou that peopl who dare to take risk and tri new thing are success peopl . if nobodi tri to risk the economi will never be competit . howev , i would add that , onc you take a chanc and dare to risk you must prove that you are actual capabl of keep that success . in other word , tri new thing and take risk will onli make you success if learn how to run well your new busi . we live in a world which is becom more and more a global villag and the new economi like china , india , taiwan and south korea are becom more and more competit compar to the countri of the so call develop world . develop countri can produc what we can alreadi produc with veri low wage , which is whi we have to compet with them in term of innov and new thing . in order to be success you have to do someth well but you can not just do that . i will make an exempl to make my posit clearer : milano , the citi where i live in , is famou all over the world for the fashion and furnitur industri . cloth and furnitur are veri easi to copi , so if we want to compet and keep a lead posit in these sector we have to add some extra that can not be found in product made elsewher . it may sound strang but innov and research can be found and have to be extend to fashion and design industri as well . the point is that the success that italian product have all over the world is mostli due to the fact that we can do some thing well and better than other , and we have to keep thi leadership . thi make me think that keep on do well what you alreadi can do is as import as tri new thing . as usual , both aspect are import .
