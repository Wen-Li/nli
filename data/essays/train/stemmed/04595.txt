i total agre with the statement about the young peopl nowaday . the reason whi i think so is becaus i actual see thi phenomenom , young peopl are spend all the time on their own self and seldom care about thier own commun . after school , most peopl would ask to play around out side , seldom of them might think of there own commun , like their commun have noth to do with them , it 's onli a place where offer your commod . but i 'm not like them other guy , i think that make our effort to help our commun is so import . in my opinion , the atmospher of the communiy you live will directli affect your mind , mood and behavior . we all know that peopl could be affect by their surround eviron so easili . in one of my class , a teacher told us to concern about our own commun , do our best to help our commun to go better , and he would constantli ask us if we are do the right thing ! i feel thi is so good for us to establish our conscienc in our own place . everyon is respons for their commun , becaus those are n't your privat area , i think everyon should collabor togeth to help thier commun , in order to make their ownself a better live . as the proverb goe `` all bird flock togeth . '' it reveal that if you are make effort tohelp your own commun , other will start to contact you and do it with you , thi realli help a lot . in a nutshel , i think that we should start to educ our own offspr to know how import it is to help our own commun , onli a littl peopl is not enough , we should promot it as a civic activ , live begin at our own commun , with more help , there is a better tomorrow .
