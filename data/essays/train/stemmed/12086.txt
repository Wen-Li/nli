i do not agre with the statement that say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . we usual travel for differ purpos , but when travel is intend to be just for pleasur , the best way to do it is not in a group led by a tour guid . tour are usual restrict and schedul , which doe not allow you to stay more day in a place that you like or visit other thing that you would like to see that are not includ in your tour itinerari . the best way to travel is to plan your trip befor hand , do some research over the place that you intend to go to , see which are the most appeal attract and see if you can reserv the hotel room or if possibl plan other activ that you know you will be do . the onli situat in which i believ it is a good idea to travel in a group led by a tour guid is if you are visit the countri for the first time or if you know that you will not have the time to do the research befor get to the place . anoth import factor is the languag . usual , when you go to anoth countri most of the time you can do pretti well if you know how to talk in english , but there are some veri exot place in veri remot area where thi will not be much of an use tool . in thi situat , if you do not know the languag spoken in that region , the best thing you can do is to travel with a tour guid . unless you have a veri adventur spirit and would like to have some fun get lost or get into veri peculiar situat that you can later tell to your grandchildren . travel alon is much more excit than travel with a tour guid , but not all peopl are will to live such and experi .
