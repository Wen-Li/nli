student go to the univers to learn thing which will make them more effici in their job . but is it more import for them to understand concept than to learn fact ? understand a concept and/or an idea is veri import in some subject . for exampl in chemistri understand how a special reaction occur can help research go further in research by invent new molecul , find new or develop former reaction ( which were known to take place , but not know how it take place ) . understand an idea or a concept can make the student more effici in hi studi , research , and in hi futur job . know how someth occur help a lot in go further quicker . learn fact is also veri useful . i take the same exampl of chemistri . some reaction are known but you ca n't explain how it work , so you have to learn it to go on . learn fact make you also more effeci , you do n't have to look everi where for the answer to the problem ask . if you want to use a known method to do each or each reaction , if you have learnt it befor , you do n't have to look in the litteratur everytim to do your reaction . i think that both are veri import for the student . you need inform that are given to you by the lectur and you have to learn and understand them . sometim learn someth can help you understand a point which wa dark for you . learn thing can make you also be brighter than you are alreadi . sometim you do n't have to understand someth . learn thing which can be useless to the student can be reveal later to be veri import . learn give you gener cultur . in a sens i agre that for student it is more import to understand than to learn becaus onc you have understood an idea you do n't have to learn it , and it make the student save some of time . but your also have to learn . in conclus i would say that both learn and understand are the key which open the gate of the knowledg and of concious .
