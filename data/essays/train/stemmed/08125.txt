in newspap we oftenli read that today 's youth would be the so-cal ` fun gener ' who is ignor the problem and need of their commun . in my opinion , that 's a generalis which doe n't fit with realiti . young peopl can and are engag in a wide rang of field . in germani , there is for exampl the ` volunt social year ' that young peopl can choos to do after they finish high-school and befor they start higher educ . in thi framework , young men and women are care for a period of twelv month either for elder or disabl peopl or are engag in cultur or polit organis . further , it ha becom rel frequent that german high-school absolv go to anoth countri or contin to do some social work . in 2005 i attend a world youth congress in scotland that gather activ young peopl from all around the world who are involv in develop project within their commun . there were lot of exampl of young peopl who are do fantast work . . a young indian girl who creat a librari for girl or a sierra leonean who conduct workshop for a reintegr of former child soldier to civil life are just two of them . i think that today 's young gener is combin the principl of fun and care for their commun becaus they discov that it give pleasur to help . they have the educ background and the necessari awar to be abl to recogn how their own behaviour affect the develop of their commun - at least they should have it . but in the case that thi consciousn is not yet exist , there are other young peopl lobbz for it . an exampl are the karlsruh student day one world where high-school student get familiar with topic around globalis , environment protect and human right by attend workshop which are conduct by member of activ youth group .
