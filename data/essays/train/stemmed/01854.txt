i agre with the statement mention in the question . there are sever argument for my decis which i tri to illustr in the follow essay . first of all , tri new thing and take risk alway contain new chanc which would n't be offer to you otherwis . if you continu what you alreadi know , there wo n't never be the chanc to develop . i want to give an exampl to demonstr my thought : i 've been live in small town in the south of germani for 20 year . i knew noth about the life in a big citi or how peopl in other part of germani behav . but last year i had to move to hamburg becaus of my new job . know nobodi it wa a hard begin in such an enourm metropol . now i can state that my personnel horizont ha grown a lot becaus i made experi i would have never live stay at home with my parent . furthermor , life would be veri annoy without no action or risk . the most peopl have to work all the day and for that reason there is n't much time remain for hobbi . whi should n't we tri someth extraordinari or ecxit in our less free time ? for exampl , learn a new instrument or tri bunge jump ? as for me , these are the highlight which enrich our life becaus they offer us a short break in our everi day life . the third argument that i want to mention concern take risk . i 'm total convinc that we ca n't reach a high aim by exclud everi risk . for exampl if someon give up hi or her safe job in an economi in order to start hi or her own busi , there will alway be the risk that the busi can fail and that he or her will lost all the money . for that reason , it 's necessari to accept the risk and to be consciou of becaus you will onli be abl to success if you are n't fear the disadvantag or the risk .
