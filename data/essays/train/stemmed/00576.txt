you can find advertis everywher : in newspap , in the cinema , at bu station and even on the toilet paper . so they defenit influenc us a lot . often we just buy a new product becaus the man in the newspap had such a nice smile . it 's the question if you realli get what they are pretend . i think there are a lot of product which are in fact not as use or of the qualiti the commerci let them look like . there exist for exampl a tv-spot where a handsom girl watch a big screen with an ice-cream on it and while watch it dissapear and suddenli sit 's on an tropic island . of cours thi is not possibl in realiti but it should show , that togeth with the ice-cream you buy some tropic feel . advertis alway are use to express some special need to the person who whatch them . and a lot of studi show that most of the peopl are easili to impress , especi with pictur or video . from my point of view thi is a danger fact , becaus advertis often promis thing which a person doe n't just get becaus of buy the product . for exampl the commerci for smoker . there are alway shown a group of modern and happi peopl , sit togther , relax and of cours smoke . so a young boy might think that if he buy 's those cigarett he will get a lot of new friend and self-confid . but in realiti it 's not that easili . in addit to that , onli compani with a great amount of money are abl to start commerci . they will be shown everywher and a lot of peopl will buy their product just becaus of that and not becaus of think it trough if it ha got the best qualiti or the best price . so i think it 's possibl to produc less good product but at the same time sell lot of them just becaus of a wide rang of advertis . all in all , from my point of view , advertis often pretend to give a certain use to the person that buy the product , but in the end it 's often just wishful-think .
