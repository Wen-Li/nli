nowday , befor the launch of the ani product it is usual advertis . the advertis of ani product help alot in it market . advertis are so catchi that make the viewer to think over the product and sometim they are convinc to buy it . but usual it ha been observ that the actual product is so effect as shown in the advertis . i have been also mislead by one of the advertis . i wa have dark circl under my eye . so , one of my friend suggest me an under eye gel . she came to know about the gel from it advertis . in the advertis it ha been given that it will decreas the dark circl . and one have to be regular in appli it . the cours period wa about 3 week . so , i tri the under eye gel . in first few week it wa give posit result but as the time pass i notic wrinkl under my eye . and my dark circl were also not improv . the gel ha the side effect of caus wrinkl to my skin . and wa not helpful in clear all dark . i wa realli dissappoint by thi . so by thi i came to learn that product in the advertis are sometim are much better than they actual are . the advertis compani do thi in order to promot their product . but they actual are foolish the custom . like thi there are sever exampl . anoth exampl can be the good , actract pack of the candi , toffe , icecream and etc. but in actual they can be tasteless . also thi in dress materi thi is been seen . thu from the abov point i believ that advertis doe n't given the actual pictur of the product .
