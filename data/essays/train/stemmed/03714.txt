some tipe of advertis use to make differ product , and a lot of them are , better it 's say that they seem , much better than they realli are . is it true or wrong ? it is good or bad ? do i agre or disagre with the statement written at the top ? i realli do n't know . i ca n't find a person and not common opinion about thi theme , for that reason i will say sorri befor for the not realli interest text that i 'm go to write , or better that i 'm go to tri write . first all the advertis can be devid in two group . the first one comprend all the advertis who use to give product as soon as possibl , the second one , at the contrari , use to give product in a log way . in the same line i 'd like to devid all the product in two order , the realli `` good '' and the `` appear good '' . after thi tipe of divis is possibl to combin in differ way all group . so we can find advertisemt who give to you a product realli soon and whit a lot of good thing correl at it , or at realli opposit concept , an advertis who give in a realli long period someth not realli good for your person . i 'm go to the conclus of thi issu , and i want to declar that thi is a realli difficult topic where i have trought to give my opinion or someth who tri to be the same shape . if i have to take one decis about what tipe of advertis i will choos , i hope to find a product whio can give to me a seem better than it look like . whit that i hope to be finisch all my argoument ad idea about thi realli diffucult and embaras issu .
