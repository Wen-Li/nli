as a student myself , the question of whether it is necessari to acquir the knowledg or to mere learn the fact about it ha been pound quit often through my experi of learn . obvious , it take far more time and effort to entir understand the knowledg wherea sometim it is mandatori for student to roughli learn the fact accord to the requir of their curriculum . in my opinion , i complet agre with the point of view in the statement that it is far more import for student to understand the idea and concept . first of all , to be abl to understand the idea is to master the knowledg , which requir student to be quit familiar with the field of knowledg where a great deal of research have to be done befor one could reach such level of understand . through the way of reseach , student can not onli learn the histori and origin of such concept but also gain a deep impress of the knowledg itself . the knowledg that is total understood will last a long time and thu becom the life-tim fortun for student . secondli , a rough knowledg of fact would n't help student to learn further . some educ system ask their student to rememb a certain fact on the textbook as a way to learn knowledg . in thi way , student might pass their exam with impress mark by stay up late to cram through the textbook but there would n't be much knowledg left for them after the test , which to mani of them is a massiv loss as well as a wast of effort . if student have a better understand of the knowledg , they are abl to appli their knowledg to real life and solv problem easili . last but not the least , have a good understand of idea and knowledg inspir student to go further beyond . it help the student to foster a great interest of the knowledg and drive them to `` dig a deeper hole '' . `` interest is the best teacher . '' the mission of learn is to carri on the experi and wisdom of the past and walk farther in civil . the inspir student gain from their understand of idea and concept help to broaden their horizon , to see the world in a multi-dimens perspect , and eventu to foster nobl valu and belief . learn , as we all know , is a life-tim experi . therefor , it is quit crusial to find the best way to learn . appar , `` burn the mid-night oil '' is not the perfect method that mani educ approv . teacher should encourag their student to understand thoroughli the idea and concept rather than to just learn the fact . be a smart learner , not a facts-collector !
