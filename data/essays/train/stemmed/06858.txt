i disagre with the opinion that there will be fewer car in use that there are today in twenti year , becaus , basic , i think it stay the same as mani peopl like to have their privat car . inde , it is good to have public transport mean such as , train and buse , as they reduc not onli the traffic jam but also the pollut . and i believ , for such reason , there will be more high-advanc public transport mean in the futur and i can easili assum that mani peopl may think that it may reduc the number of car on the road . howev , at the same time , i believ that , even under such circumst , mani peopl still prefer to have their own privat car . there are mani peopl whose resid are not close to the stop-point of the public transportaion , especi in rural area . for instanc , my uncl is live in a rural area of japan where it take fifti minut to get to the closest train station . and , there are mani peopl who like drive itself . also , there are mani peopl who realli prefer to have privat space even at the the time of commut . for exampl , i have a friend who realli like to take car . i usual prefer to go for trip by train becaus , in that way , i do not need to care how to get to the destin and where to go to the bathroom . howev , thi friend live in urban area in tokyo , alway go for trip by car even if it take longer time than go by train . he onc told me that he prefer car to train and buse becaus it give him more privat time and he doe not want anybodi to bother while commut . i believ thi is true to mani other person . mani peopl think it is import to have privat time . i think it is true that , if you are busi commun peopl , then you feel frustrat and in that situat , peopl need privat time . given all those circumst , i still believ that , so long as peopl are as busi as now , even twenti year after , the there will be same number or even more car as it is now .
