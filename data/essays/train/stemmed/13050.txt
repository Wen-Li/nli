thi question remind me of the time i chose my way when i wa a high school student . i definit agre with the statem that have broad knowledg is better than special in one specif subject becaus of three reason . first , it provid us with a broad and comprihens point of view . in realiti , there are mani problem that can not be solv by one point view . for exampl , you can refer to the environment problem or poverti and so on . the environment problem are relat to chemistri , econom , or polit . poverti is also connect with mani point of view such as sociolog , econom , agricultur and so on . there is no problrem that can be solv with onli one point of view . you have to integr you broad knowledg to find the solut . second , it can give the student choic which field they want to studi and have career . it is stupid to forc student to choos their field without know mani subject and which field suit them . especi in japan , student must choos their disciplin befor they enter the univers . therefor , i wa frustrat to do it , and chose my current program of my univers which allow you to studi whatev you want while you are a undergradu student . so i realli appreci thi program . like thi program , studi mani thing can give student a chanc to choos . lastli , it bring you a lot of fun to studi mani thing . peopl natur have curios to know mani thing and it should not be stop . when i learn someth new , i feel realli happi and want to know more . for these reason , i believ that to studi mani academ subject than to special in one secif subject .
