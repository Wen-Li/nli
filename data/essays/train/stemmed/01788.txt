i completali agre with the point that most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are and to elplain my point here are some exampl which we see in our daili life . advertis are to promot the product and to make the consum feel that thi is someth realli big for exampl there is a advertis for hidden valli ranch salad dress and it goe like thi , there is a girl sit in her dine room and she take a bite from her salad boul . the moment she take a bite the backgroung of her dine room chang and she is present as sit in a garden under the tree and all is so nice and green and the weather had chang after eat that salad and she is in new land and happi . the point is can ani one realli get transfer from a busi and stressful life of citi to a nice and pleasent life of countri side ranch by just eat a salad dress thi is not true and they realli make product seem better than it realli is . anoth exampl is of the the crest toothpast in the advertis it tell that it if u start use the crest white tooth past ur teeth will be white as pearl in few day . but theortic it ha been proven that everi human be have a differ color of there teeth base on the miner that took place dure the format of teeth , there surround , there genet some tribe have whiter teeth than the other , there eat habbit etc . simpli brush the teeth will not make them pearl white . anoth exampl is of a nutrigrain bar . in the advertis it say that just have the bar will fill u with energi and u will feel realli good and strong . the actor in the advertis start jump and make u feel like u will be all muscular and strong by just eat one bar . conclus is most of the advertis make product seem much better than they realli are and i total agre with the point .
