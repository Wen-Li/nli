mani peopl prefer to travel with group with tour guid , but i total do not agre with thi way of travel . there are number of disadvantag if someon choos to make a group tour with guid . such as lack of flexibl of the schedul , loos the oppotun to meet new friend and inconvini caus by the larg group . first of all , the schedul is not flexibl for the guid group tour . let us assum that you are on a trip . if you are in the group , all you can do is just follo the guid and listen to him/her . on the other hand , if you make your own trip , you can go to anywher you want and whenev you want . if you feel tire from hike yesterday , you can sleep a coupl of more hour if you want . the second reason that i do not prefer the group tour is that i do not want to loos the oppotun to get close to nativ peopl . the hilight of a trip can be make new friend from all over the world . i simpli can not afford to loos the chanc to make a convers , exchang polit opinion and so on . final , if you are in a group , it take much more time to move to anoth place . for exampl , if you are wait in the line in the airport , you have to still wait for your compani even though you are finish with your process . howev , if you are alon or with a small group , you do not have to wast your time to wait for the peopl whom you realli do not know . in my opinion , true travel ha to made up by travel themselv so that they can experi more and feel more . the most import thing you can get from a travel is how much you felt and experienc , not how mani place you have been or see .
