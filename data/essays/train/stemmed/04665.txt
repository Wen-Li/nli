i believ thi statement is true onli in part . youg peopl nowaday are involv in a varieti of activ for their social and cultur develop , that it is hard to find time to help the commun . school take away the most part of the day and person studi take away anoth big percentag . the rest of the day is use by young peopl to relax or to have fun . a critic reader might say that these aspect are secondari , but it is not total true . in a cultur where social pressur is so stress and everybodi ha to reach high standard , the time use to relax , think , and have fun is foundament . young peolpl of today are more stress than young peopl of fifti year ago . i believ thi is a basi that is hard to demolish . on the other side it is true that the time a person ( not onli a young one ) sacrific in order to help the comun is a well spend time . help the commun mean , for young peopl , the possibilti to grow in a wide sens and , in particular , to start test the world of work . these young peopl who help their commun are develop those skill that are essenti later . there are still thousand and thousand of young peopl who are hard work for their commun not regard of money . these peopl are part of the hidden world that the adult like to forget about when they wrtite their critic speech about the passit of the new gener . i can assur that i know at least 20 boy and girl who everyday take care of the countri , the societi where they leav without a singl world of gratitud by anybodi . those are the peopl of tomorrow , the peopl who will chang the world in order to secur better condit for the societi .
