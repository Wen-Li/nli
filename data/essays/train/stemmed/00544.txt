no i do n't agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact becaus for my opinion i think both of them are imporatnt for student to know . student for their knowledg need to understand the concept and the idea in order to answer the `` whi '' question and understand whi thing work like thi or like that andon the other hand they need to leran fact in order to understand better the idea and concept and especi that these usual are the conclus of other work and most of them come from a pass period so you ca n't just ask the student to learn them if you can not prove them by real fact . imagin in mathemat cours the student ha to understand the idea of parrallel and the teacher ca n't give a him a real fact or exampl about parallel and how two parallel lign could never meet or in physic he ha to understand the concept of the light without give him a fact how thi concept work in realiti and what about histori cours ? how can a teacher teach histori class without use fact ? to conclud i would like to chang thi statement into the follow one : it is as import for student to understand idea and concept as for them to learn fact .
