power , money and reput are veri desir thing , and if you are success in your job , you probabl have them all . due to that , success play an import role in our life . the question aris , how to be success . you could tri new thing and take a risk , or you could focu on what you alreadi know how to do well . in my opinion , you can be success with both strategi . on the one hand there are lot of compani which improv an alreadi exist success product . for instanc appl . they choos the normal mp3 player and improv the storag capac , the handl , the design and name it ipod . due to the improv and a huge market campaign , they sold an incred high number of ipod all over the world . the success of thi product wa outrag ! on the other hand , rememb the foundat stori of the appl compani - an almost perfect exampl for creat a new market . with the comput for common household , they invent a completli new product and took a high risk . as we all know , the product wa accept by the market and had an enorm impact on the societi . there are numer other exampl for both strategi and therefor i disagre with the statement that peopl who tri new thing are more success than peopl who do what they alreadi know to do well . becaus of the high risk , i would rather tend to focu on thing which i do well , and where i know veri well how to oper .
