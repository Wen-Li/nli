in my experi i have learn that have a broad knowledg of everyth is much better than onli just focus in one specif subject . when you are have a group convers if you do n't know anyth about the topic at hand you will be seen as a person without ani kind of knowledg . on the other hand , if the topic that is be discuss is your topic of special there will be an advantedg between you and the rest of the group . unfourtun , convers topic chang a lot so the situat mention abov will rare happen . i am someon who know a lot about a lot of thing , thi give me an advantedg abov other peopl becaus it may give me a realli good appear . sinc appar are vey import in modern day societi have a broad knowledg is of great import . one exampl of thi sort of situat can be ; if i 'm appli to a univers or a job , my interview will not ask me question about one topic in particular . he will interrog me about a seri of differ topic , becaus , in gener , peopl want peopl who know about anyth and everyth . in a way , societi obli you to know at least a littl bit about everyth . what is the point of high school ? high school is a phase befor the univers in which you are suppos to gain a wide knowledg that help as a base for your superior studi . everytim you turn on the televis you learn someth , when you see channel , live discoveri , that special on documentari on a huge varieti of topic , when you read a book or magazin . societi impos knowledg and one should be happi to accept it and use it when ever it is oportun . in my opinion , and base on my own experi , i beleiv that the more you know the better .
