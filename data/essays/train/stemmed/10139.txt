mani peopl like to go trip . nowaday peol can go anywher they want by air plane or train , or even car . when you plan to go trip , which do you prefer take part in tour guid , or travel yourself ? in my case , i prefer second one . i want to go travel with my plan becaus of three reason ; do not have to follow dislik plan , can meet a lot of local peopl , and can save money than tour guid . first reason is that i do not want to follow some dislik plan that tour guid plan . sometim i tri to take part in tour guid travel , howev , mani time i find my dislik plan . if you take part in a tour guid , you have to follow all thier activ whether you like or not . on ther other hand , if you plan your travel plan by yourself , you can plan activ that just you like . second reason is that i want to meet a lot of local peopl . if i travel with my tour menber , probabl i never tri to meet , and talk with some local peopl becaus i would think that it is better to enjoy with my member than local peopl . although it is good to enjoy travel with tour member , my porpos or travel is meet somm local peopl , so i want to travel with my plan . third reason is that peopl can save thier money if they decid to travel with thier own plan becaus if you want to take part in travel tour , it is necessari to pay money , and it is more expens than plan of yourself . nowaday peopl can find cheap tour guid plan , but if you can go to travel compani or can use the inter net , you can find chear hotel or transpot . therefor it is better to plan travel plan yourself . in conclus , it is better for me to go trabl with my plan than take part in tour guid becaus it is not necessari to follow some dislik plan , can get more oppotun to meet and commun with local peopl , and can save money . of cours , tour guid also have some good point , but it is more suit for me .
