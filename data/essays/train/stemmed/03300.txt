to special in one specif subject is better than have broad knowledg of mani academ subject . firstli i would like to quot a say `` half knowledg is danger '' . thi explain that have a broad or not perfect knowledg is danger than have no knowledg . we should have broad knowledg of academ subject onli upto a certain stage of educ and then a special subject . secondli consid a person who is plan for hi futur . he want to join in ani one of the higher studi through one of these-iit , aieee , eamcet , bit . have an special idea of one will make him get succeed get admiss in to higher studi . step him into all way make lead him not be succeed in ani one atleast . next let me state an exampl . consid a person who want to have a broad knowledg of civil engin . he go through roughli have an idea how hous are construct , how soil below account to the structur , what are requiremeni of hous ( like electr work , sewag distribut , pipelin connect etc . . ) . he need the assist of each and everi person special in each of these feild to take an appropri defin which which suit all the factor . rather if he is special in one of these he could complet take chanc over that . so , i believ have special knowledg of one subject and be perfect in that is advantag . one can complet reli on themselv and even defend other while they are mislead . have a broad idea one should alway consult other for more detail regard that topic . the idea of be special also help a person to improv hi self confid becaus he can perfectli deal effect . the state of feel that `` i can do thi '' incorpor a lot self confid in a person . the knowledg of special subject will also make a person mental strong . at last i conclud by say that it is better to special in one subject rather have broad knowledg of all the academ subject .
