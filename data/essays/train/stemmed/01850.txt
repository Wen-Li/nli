it is often difficlut for peopl to decid whether for student to understand the idea and concept or to learn fact to be import . for us student , the import of learn fact alway outweigh thi of understand the idea and concept . tere are numer fact whi i agre with thi spoint , and i would in here like to explain a few of the most import oe . first of all , learn fact can let the student master the event or knoweledg firmli . know the fact , student the meanig how the idea or concept are creat . for exampl , the concept of nutrient , what of the food is of nutrut , when student know the milk can provid protein for peopl health , then they know `` protein '' is the nutrut element . that would be better to illustr the fact than to tell the concept in thi case . secondli , understand fact is help for student to make differ between differ idea and concept . sinc difer idea and concept are origin differ fact and the fact are alway easili distinguish . for a instanc , the `` frezen point '' and `` the dew point '' , these describ differ in conclus , but if all factor are contempl , it is no difficlut to inconclud that learn fact carri out more weight than those of know idea or concept . so , in conclus , i think that learn fact is superior to inderestand idea and concept .
