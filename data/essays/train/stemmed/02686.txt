nowaday life is tough and expens and young peopl have a lot of responsibili in their life . depend on the econom system and depend on the countri where they live , most of the young peopl have to studi to get a diploma to be abl then to find a job to earn money and be independ from their parent , so studi take a lot of time and some of them need to work as well as to studi , so it would be veri hard to hep other or give time to the commun . to stay healthi , most of the young peopl spend time in the gym or practic sport outsid and that will take an extra time . a small percentag of young peopl get engag veri earli and mayb they have famili to take care of so thi will lead to lack of free time other than for the famili member and for work , depend on the employ law , young peopl would need to work full time duti and would n't have time to help outsid . when young peopl come from wealthi famili , or depend on the famili educ they have , mayb these condit will allow them to be help for their commun to improv the commun they are live in , to help needi peopl , and each young person can particip with hi personn skilll and possibl for the best of all the commun member . everyon of us can be a activ member to help other , becaus in that way we can be stronger an life may look easier to us and to other and who know , mayb oneday we will need help so we will be happi to find support from other . in my opinion , everyon can have littl time to give to hi commun to improv our life and have a better futur in our own countri of citizenship or resid . as an activ member in my commun , and as a mother of 2 children , i can help other by give littl time for psycholg support for needi person and help children to have their vaccin updat , in that way i can help improv our life in the commun
