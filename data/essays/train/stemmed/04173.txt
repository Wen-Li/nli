i believ that in the futur fewer car will be in use than today . the human popul on earth is grow rapidli and thi is reflect in everi major citi of the world . as the metropol get crowd the qualiti of life declin in that citi . today among the biggest problem of citi such as pari , ny , london and istanbul is the traffic . citi offici are offer their citizen to use altern way of transport such as subway but due to the much crowd popul , the chao of traffic doe not seem to end . the istanbul mayor onc propos to have restrict on the number of car to be out on the street but it wa not consid sinc it would be interf with the right of the citizen . more propos are be work on . thi problem had a reflect on the autom sector . if we take a look at the recent year , we will see that smaller car are becom in-demand more and more . small car are seen as , if not perman , but effect solut to the park and traffic problem in the major citi . in twenti year , i would like to believ that thi problem will be solv and there will be more altern way for everi day transport . therefor the usag of car will be less than today . car also are said to be a danger to environ . it is proven that fuel ga and motorin are harm the ozon layer therefor endang the environ . mani car compani are work on project where altern engin are produc to halt thi . most power brand have either complet project or ongo test to build car that can work with water , electr even sun . howev noth is said to replac the usag of fuel financi . it is still the cheapest way on the market that 's whi the altern engin gener will not be as widespread as quickli as the environmentalist hope . howev these 2 reason i state are strong enough to make me believ the usag of car will be fewer in the near futur .
