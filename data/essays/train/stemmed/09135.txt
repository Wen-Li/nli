i do not complet agre with thi statement , becaus young peopl usual do not realiz what they have and how short and quickli the youth is . young peopl are continu expect someth of extarordinari happen to make them happier , but without know nor themselv what thi extraordinari mean . have you ever red the colombr by dino buzzati ? it is a nice metaphor of young peopl searchign a chemer dure hi youth , which never is found , so that they can not tast the flavour of happy dure hi flowerish age . moreov , young peopl spend often their time do noth . i see these guy stand outisid bar , smoke , drink , of cours smile , but without a seriou purpos and so risk of get bore . in other word , they wast their time . on the contrari older peopl , who have less life time ahead them , do not wast time , they appreci all what they have . they do not wait for someth special happen , they do not get angri for the boyfriend or girlfriend . older peopl appreci the time pass and most of time are satisfi of what they have done dure their life . they feel joy for the fact of have had children , who at their turn have had other children . older peopl , despit the young , have had in the most of case a brillant job , or just a job , which ha let them creat a famili , buy a hous , go on holiday . they are fullfil of their reach object . as far as young peopl concern , thi is not alway true . although young peopl have more life time ahead , it doe not mean fewer worri . let us think of young peopl now : the problem of job , the problem of durabl job , the worri of buy a their own hous without a job ! ... concludind , enjoy life doe not concern on what we are do , but it reli on our expect and what we manag to do befor .
