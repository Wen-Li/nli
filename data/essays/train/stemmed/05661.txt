the problem that the statement underlin ha an import impact on my person life . as far as i 'm concern , i realli can not disagre with the statement becaus i am person involv in thi subject . i have been help elderli peopl sinc i wa 15 : it 's not my job and i do n't get paid for it but when i have some spare time i just do it becaus i enjoy it . apart my person experi , we have to face the fact that young peopl ( or most of them ) are complet not interest in help their commun probabl also becaus the mean of comun , such as tv radio internet , do n't stress too much on thi problem . my suggest is tri to make young peopl more consciou and respons by organ event that involv all the commun . i live in a small villag and i found thi idea veri use . last summer i organ a big event that took all the peopl togeth just to meet each other , simpli to know the neighbour and discov that there are a lot of peopl that need help . there is also anoth exampl that can express how much thi problem is understim . dure the summer period most of the peopl go on holiday and leav their elderli rel alon at home and they do n't take care of them at all and sometim happen that they die and nobodi know ( just read a newspap to find it out !! ) that sound disgust !!! we can not be consid human be if we behav in a way like thi .
