in the past there were no televis , pubblic , no advertis and so on . . nowaday are chang a lot of thing and the invent in thi field have product a lot of effect : posit and neg effect . for exampl . . the invent of televis ha allow the possibl to show everyth , to explain , to understand and learn thing of everi kind . but there are a lot of aspect that we must consid to understand clearli the situat about the advertis that are made . i think about these question . .. if they are effectivetli connect to realiti , if is all true what we can see on the screen . . or not ? first i make out that the produc that ha a specif farm , like food farm . glass farm or someth els , sure want to sell hi product and so i think that he pay someon that ha studi about pubblic design to creat a sort of slogan , or to invent a way to make hi product commerci and not unknow . he have to sell and make profit so he must find the best way to do it . secondli i think that peopl are quit interest about `` new-entri '' , so everith that repres someth of differ from befor is well seen . for exampl new pc game that advertis explain like a game that will chang your day , or new televis program , or new chocol drink that can make you more stronger . in a sens i tri to say that i agre with the statement baceus i think that the final work of advertis is to convinc peopl about the characterist of it , to make sure them that they will see result ( like a gym advertis , but . . do you remenb that you have to meke sport and no one els do it for you ???? ) they will chang or they will be better . and how the advertis is made is not total under control of someon : truth and fals is togeth and often product realli seem much better than they realli are . final we must pay attent about what they realli give us .
