i do not think that young peopl enjoy life more than older peopl do . life enjoy ha noth to do with age . it doe not depend on the activ a person doe , but on the feel he ha . it is true that young peopl have more chanc to experi differ activ and to meet differ peopl . they are usual more open to learn from other peopl and to perform new activ . young peopl can meet new peopl at school , at work or at the club and bar . they are also physic abl to do sport , to travel to ` unsaf ' place , and to go to long-last parti . thi kind of activ can be good sourc of joy and happi . but older peopl do not have to experi differ activ or to meet differ peopl to enjoy life . as well as they get older , they identifi what kind of activ provid them the most joy . they also learn who are their true friend . older peopl stop worri about everyday problem and start understand the thing that matter . they have more time to spend with the famili : they can enjoy their children and greatchildren more than they did while young . they have more time to travel ( to ` safe ' place ) and to see their true friend . i believ that the secret for life enjoy is to understand everi age and not to tri to take back time . peopl who understand everi moment as a uniqu opportun to be happi can enjoy life when they are old as well as they did when they were younger . and it is not a theoret belief : i know old peopl who have enjoy life onli by understand everi moment . my grandfath is a good exampl : he is 80 year old . everytim i see him he is smile , everytim he rememb the past he smile , and everytim he think about the futur he smile . i want to live my life that way : i want to take the best of time with friend , with my famili , at work and at the univers in order to enjoy everi second .
