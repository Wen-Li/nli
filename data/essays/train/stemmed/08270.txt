techniqu of advertis start to develop at the same time consum began to spread in the world , and they improv a lot dure the last centuri , especi as new media , like televis , grow up . as i alway did job relat with market and commerci activ , i am veri awar of the fact that mani advertis make product seem much better that they realli can be . so , i will explain the reason that thi habit can have , and also the problem it can bring about . firstli , i think that a compani alway need to provid consum with an amaz imag of it product . as a result , an advertis usual stress on the better qualiti of the product x , without name ani problem relat with it . for exampl , when ferrari , an italian sport car manufactur , launch a new car , it most like creat an advertis show the new car 's great speed , but it doe not realli point out that thi car would consist consum lot of fuel ! thi neg factor probabl doe not even interest ferrari 's typic custom , and the car is present as it realli is . on the other hand , while i think that usual advertis present the real side of a product , i must admit that sometim they are realli excess . when a product is made for a specif purpos , it should not be present as someth differ , just in order to creat a better impress in peopl 's mind . for exampl , mani car manufactur , like fiat , anoth italian firm , are use to creat sport version of their util model , and they present them like sport car . the problem is that they realli are not sport car , but onli slightli more faster model of normal car , so the imag advertis introduc is complet wrong . to draw a conclus , i thinlk that it is realli imposs to prevent advertis to give the best imag of product they can . most of compani realli offer the truth of their product , just omit some neg aspect , but sometim they realli lie to consum , by provid fals imag . howev , i think that thi is not such a common situat , and most of advertis present product nearli as they are .
