knowledg person is alway acept as a wealthi one in th societi . as knowledg ha no limit the broder the knowledg the broder is the think of the person . howev , accord to me have special subject knowledg is better than those of have of mani subject . special knowledg is alway a boon , sharp and a didic one for a person . as an exampl , scientist they have a broad knowldg but of a specfic subject on waht they are work on . as an exampl , my father is an mechnic engin from the past en year is work in mechan plant from then and now hi mehan skill have becam sharp . few peopl think that have the knowledg of mani subject can help in know each thing better but , it is just a misconsept thing dose n't work like that if u want to learn more u have to be veri specif about the subject you take . for exampl , one my friend is veri knowledg but not in the field of ani specfic subject . one more exampl i would like to discus is about engin or graduat program offer by the variou school . whi there are differ subject in differ program becaus , to make a person special in a specif field of studi . if a person have an deep knowledg of the subject of studi he can contribut a lot more . exampl , astrnom contribut there effort toward the field of astropyhs . anoth exampl , biologist he contribut toward the field of biolog . but the person have a broad knowldg can not go so much specif about ani subject . broad knowledg of diffrent subject help peopl in life but onli in normal way not in ani specif direct . henc , a specil knowledg of a specfic field is more better then have a broad but genral knowledg of everyth .
