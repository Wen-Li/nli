i do agre with the statement that `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid '' . there are four reason show that it is benifiti to travel in a tour group . first of all , it is much more safer to travel as a group than by one ' self . especi when peopl want to travel in differ countri , it is possibl for them to get lost or get in troubl . if they travel in a group , sinc peopl can take care and protect each other , the opportun of get lost or even get rip is veri small which keep them have a wonder trip . secondli , when travel in a strang countri , there are too mani thing need to be consid . sometim , it will be exceedingli confus for peopl to figur out which way to go , what bu to take or even where to live . for exampl , onc i went to the capit of china , beij with my parent , it should be a wonder trip for us , sinc we had no much time to get togeth . howev , it took us almost the whole day to find a hotel to stay over night which we wast time and energi . eventu , the trip wa end in a unhappi mood and everyon wa so tri to even look around . threrefor , travel in a group and have a tour guid can make the trip more effici and easi . thirdli , sometim due to the misunderstand of differ cultur , peopl who do not fimiliar about that cultur may make mistak . in addit , the mistak can be veri seriour that tourist may caus accid or hurt . howev , have a tour guid can give tourist the best and most accur suggest and warn which provid them avoid make unnecessari mistak . lastli , the tour guid alway know the best place to shop of present for friend or tourist themselv . usual , tour guid will set up a day or particular time for shop , sinc it is not onli about shop , it is also about the cultur in that countri or citi . howev , if peopl travel alon , they probobl may not find the cheapest and the best to shop . in conlust , i think travel in a group led by a tour guid is a bright idea for save money and energi , keep themselv safe and have the most effici and wonder trip .
