i dont think that there will be fewer car in use than there are today becaus everi day the number of peopl who use car is increas as i see . when i go out i with my friend , i can not hear her becaus of the car voic . wherev i look i see car cover all around me . and we see that it is get wors and wors day by day.10 year ago i couldnt see so mani car on the road but today peopl have to wait for hour to arriv home becaus of the heavi traffic . the situat is just for my countri . if we think about all the countri in the world , the number of car is horribl . in china most peopl use bcycl outsid . but they are alon . even if thet do that car in use are increas . if onli all peopl in the world did that . if they did , the road would be veri quiet and also the atmosfher would be cleaner . but if we look today it is imposs that there will be fewer car in use . unlik today the number of car in use will have been so increas that we will not walk on the street . if it will continu like thi it will damag the environ , too . we are damag whole world and in twenti year we will not find anywher to live . use car is also caus the decreas in petrol . we are consum so much petrol that it will not be enough . so we can not drive our car without it . mayb it will be better becaus if there is no petrol there will be no car . i think peopl have to be educ about thi . while they are do thi they do not know that they are damag both the environ and the atmosfh .
