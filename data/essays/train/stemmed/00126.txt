for the time be , the number of car in the world ha not stop grow . inde , the technolog breakthough with h.ford and the ford t provid the idea that each peopl would have a car . but nowaday scientit want to make peopl awar of the danger of car . so we can wonder if in twenti year ther will be fewer car in use that there are today . the market of car in rich countri is almost full . in consequ , the number of car will not signif . new car are bought just when the former one is over . in other way a lot of peopl especi in poor countri do n't even seen a car or mayb so rare . in my opinion when those countri will developt everybodi would like to fulfil hi dream and to buy a car as peopl from rich countri did . besid thi problem , peopl that own car feel they depend on it becaus they take it so oftent . but recent problem like polut make the point that the worl would have to reduc the number of car . the gaz exhauc by car make the athmospher polut . those if we want to provid a avail to live earnt , we would have to chang our behaviour . sever goven purpos bill to struggl with the widespead of air polut . one of the major point is to put public transport much more avail in big citi . in my belief , thi is a big step forward to recuc polut and also car in citi . if govern want to reduc number of car in rich countri it have to make provid some waranti like develop also public transport in public area . for poor countri , govern are experienc with problem of rich countri so i hope they will not make the same mistak . befor that car becom usual , they have to provid a good network of public transport not for popul to see too much interest in have a personn car . final , i support the idea that car will be fewer in the futur becaus , in my opinion , the problem of mass produc car is quit widespread and so govern will be smart enough to take them respons to provid network of public transport and even to put restrict . howev , i think that we have to focu in industri now .
