knowledg about differ subject are import in thi fast and devolop world . one should have knowledg of mani topic to surviv . i agre with the fact that the broad knowledg of mani differ academ subject is better than in one subject . to begin with , i would like to draw attenton toward the fact that less knowledg less opportun . a person with broad kwowledg of differ subject can perform well in ani field . mani field are open for the person at the same time . but person who ha done special in ani singl subject will not be abl do anyth out of hi field . . secondli , peopl with broad knoledge lead to great achiev in life . for exampl if a person from engin feild enter into manag of ani big compani and manag it well . he will be promot faster than a employe who is special onli in engin . anoth exampl if a student keep on read cours book and score well in each semest without good knowledg of comput . he will face big problem in perform ani job as comput ha becom a great need of the peopl nowaday . thirdli , if the person ha knowledg ogf mani stream , he can chang hi main stream whenev he want . he might face difficulti in perform good in hi stear and so ca n changer field whenev it is requir . for exampl if person have taken both medic and non medic subject in junior colleg . he or she alway ha chanc to shift in the field in which he or she is perform well . in conclus i would onli say that knowledg about the differ field is alway a posit thing
