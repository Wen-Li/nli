it is the hardest choic on everyon 's academ path . someon think it is better to special as soon as possibl , other think it is better to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . i think children and teenag should learn as much as possibl on mani differ subject and dure univers they should special in one specif subject . when i think about great scientist in the past centuri i am surpris . they all had a broad knoweldg in mani differ field sometim veri differ from each other . for exampl leonardo davinci wa the greatest painter , philosoph and scientist of hi time . i think nowaday it is not possibl to reach a deep knowledg in mani differ field becaus of the increas complex in everi subject , furthermor i think it is better to gain a deep knowledg in someth than to have broad and superfici knowledg of mani differ subject . special in one field is veri useful for two differ reason . the fisrt one is that special student like will find job easier becaus our societi is interest in woorker with special and advenc skill . the second reason is that if you special you bacam awar of the complex of the subject . even if a person will work in a differ field with respect to the field in which he ha studi , he ha learn to face difficult and complex problem and it is will turn to be extrem helpful . if one learn mani differ subject he like will know just the basic idea and he will not develop hi abil to fix complex problem . althought i think it is import to special in one subject i also beliv student should be abl to tri mani differ subject befor choos their field . it is difficult to inderstand what you are realli interest in . tri is the best way to make a good choic . for thi reason i think univers should allow first year student to chang their major without ani charg or penalti .
