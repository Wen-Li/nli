accord to the task to discuss wether travel in a group led by a tour guid might be the best way to travel i would like to say that first of all it is one of the most comon way of travel . especi japanes are often seen traval in a huge group . me myself i like to travel alon and disagre becaus of that with that statement . when travel alon you are independ and you can make your plan by yourself . in big group you have to do what everybodi want to do or if there is a tour guid what he plan . most of the time there are no except . be alon also mean that you get to no other peopl mayb nativ peopl , mayb other visitor . but on the other hand i like a mix of both like take a tour guid for a day or travel with other who are interest in see the same thing or place . i alreadi travel alon by myself and it wa the best experi i have ever made . although i made trip with friend , group or my famili befor i had never so much fun . if you come to a town were you do not know even one person i will have to talk to strager . and besid i am shi i got to know mani peopl which i would have never met if had been travel in a group . i made trip with them , what explain that i do not disagre striktli with thi statement . what i am sure about is that you learn much more about the countri you go to , as if you had gone with a guid group , if you prepar yourself a littl . most of the time you can bare find a tour guid which is right qualifi to tell you more fact , than if you had inform yourself by book . some might say that thi is not true , but i just talk accord to the experi i made . `` but is not more safe if you travel in a group ? '' some might ask . i have the opinion that if you do not take to much risk and if you care a littl for yourself , you will travel at least with the same safeti . on the other hand group of tourist are easier aim of terrorist attack becaus the follow a strict plan and are easi to hit . but in gener i just like to travel no matter how !
