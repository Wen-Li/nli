i can agre with the statement . but we can not see the matter from a singl point of view > there are in fact two contrast forc govern the number of car in the world . on one hand , we have western industri countri . their whealthi life style ha to face the problem that the increas cost of fuel creat > actual mani countri use more fuel than how much they can produc . for thi reason , they buy petroluem by saudi arabia or iraq , who can produc a lot of it . but it cost ha wide increas in the last year due to the tension that terror and the isralian situat creat . moreov , as a non renew resourc , it quantiti will decreas over time . for thi reason , i think that in the western countri the number of the car will decreas in the next twenti year accord to the increas of the cost of fuel . we can-t forget that in the other hand there are the newli indutri countri , like india or china . thi countri experienc in the last year a real industri revolut that brought their whealth to increas . as a consequ , the new middl class in thi countri began to use it new econom power to express it social statu , like the middl class of the western world did befor . in thi new trend , have a car wa no more a need , but a symbol . but thi brought them to face a problem they never face befor , that is the air pollut creat by a car . in these countri in fact , and special in china , thi problem ha led to physic hill in the last few year , and in my opinion it will increas in the next . so we could see a decreas in the number of car in order to resolv thi problem , or at least we could see the same scenario of the western world to which develop nation could be brought by the increas of oil demand . accord to all these instanc , i think that , for differ reason , there will be fewer car in use than today .
