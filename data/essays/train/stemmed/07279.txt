i agre with the statement that peopl who tri new thing and take risk are more success than peopl who just stay on the level they are alreadi on . in my opinion peopl who want to be success should be creativ and open for new thing . furthermor they should believ in themselv and should not get insecur , if other person do not agre with their opinion or way of proceed . for instanc , mani big invent such as car or plane would n't exist thi time , if there would not have been somebodi who wa affect to new thing , had the will to research and to take the risk of fail . probabl , when daimler invent the first car most peopl thought he would be crazi and did not support hi plan . he had the risk to fail , but as we can see today it turn out as a big invent and he becam famou . howev , if peopl would n't be riski and open-mind the human natur would n't be on thi level it is right now . the societi need peopl who are interest in new thing to develop and to grow up . if we all would stay on the level which we are good in and do not increas our abil , we still would live in wooden hous as centuri ago .
