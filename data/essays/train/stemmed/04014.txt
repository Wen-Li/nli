mani organ centr depend mostli on teach their student the concept of a lesson or structur , as they think it would provid them with better knowledg skill and life experi . but other organ are strict enough to teach what they were thought , and what book are to mention , that is `` fact '' . i agre with the statement , as it is true in my opinion . be a student in a class requir a lot of effort of listen to the teacher , in mani case , my classmat and i use to daydream in the class . thi is subject to happen onli when fact are to be learnt . like for exampl , if we are told about a result of a particular polici in let ' say , econom subject , it wo n't sound interest at all , instead , most of us use to feel bore and felt sleepi . if econom is to be more interest , these fact which are be thought could be diversifi into idea and concept base on realiti , for exampl , our school could schedul for us an access to differ industri from differ sector , depend on the lesson object . thi will not onli creat a joy environ in the class , but , instead it wont vanish from our brain so easili ! . fact are to be forgotten in a day or anoth , wherea , concept and idea would never be forgotten . we would alway pictur the idea or experi again . mani of us graduat annuali from differ univers , but ha anyon of us gain a job experi base on our major in the univers , the answer is no ! . instead we have to ought ourselv to hard work to get the experi from compani , and get paid low wage , some of us are humili ! . mani of us have n't yet complet our master degre , and we requir a job to pay for our master , howev , mani compani do not employ us becaus of the lack of experi . thi problem can be solv by provid the undergradu or high school student with life base experi , not far from fact , but fact attach with realiti and which can be clear from doubt and misunderstand .
