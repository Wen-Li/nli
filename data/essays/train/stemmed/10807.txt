i can say that i agre with the statement . nowaday , young peopl spend too much time for themself . in fact , they stay a lot of time in own hous to play with the video game or to watch the televis and rare to studi someth . first of all , i believ that the tecnolog and all the thing around it have contribuit to damag the person of the youth . in the past , a boy or a girl had to help their famili in the field or in home becaus their famili oblig them to do someth of use . the boy improv veri quickli their skill and they grown faster than the modern boy . the girl learnd how to cook and how to repair the cloth of their parent becaus it wa a necess . the modern young peopl have the possibl to get everi thing that they want becaus their parent do not oppos resist over all request . in fact , i believ that the new parent are too much flexibl and permiss . they should be more strict to allow to understand to their son what thing are import and what are not . so , nowaday , the young peopl are more materi than in the past so they do not mind if the societi around them is go to fall down in a big depress . for exampl , i saw a lot of peopl do not interest of the news or the newspap a littl thing that push a person to think about the real world . final , the modern young peopl are too much influenc to the societi . they see their friend behav in a particular way and understand that they can get some thing in that way . they do not spend time to help their commun becous the modern commun offer all thing that a young need . therefor , a boy or a girl doe not look for someth of interest to do . i think that it is the main reason in the declin of the youth .
