in my person experi , i have travel both in a group led by a tour guid , and in a group with out a tour guid . i think that one of thi experinc is better and fun . next i will compar thi two situat . if you travel whit a tour guid , then you do n't need to search map , itinerair and local inform , becaus the tour guid will have all the thing that you migth need on a trip , thi is a possit sigth of travel with a guid . but also travel with a guid mean that you are not owner on you schedul , becaus you need to follow the itinerari of travel agenc . for exampl , when i went to brasil with my class , i had to do all the thing that the tour guid tell us to do , so we ca n't decid wich restor pick for lunch , or with pub to go on nigth . on the other side of the coin , if you travel by yourself , with out a tour guid , then you can do all the thing that you want to do , for exampl , if you wish to sleep all the afternoon on the beach on rio de janeiro , you can do it ; or if you want to spend one entier day on just one place , you can do it too . but such as the first posit ( travel with a guid tour ) , travel with out a guid impli some problem , for exampl : where can i chang money ? , where can i regist in ? , how much should i pay for a suvenir ? . in my person opinnion , i think that travel in grup with out a guid is the best way to travel . thi mean that you can program your own trip , and you dont need to follow an schedul . when i have travel with out the led of a tour guid , i 've had more funn .
