in my perspect , i believ that the number of car will be reduc in twenti year from today . at first , the petrolleum crisi will affect directli on the product of car . becaus it ha been estim that the world will run out of petrolleum in twenti year from now . that 's whi the world have to find anoth sourc of energi instead . recent , the scientist have invent a car which run on the hydrogen energi . howev , it 's not as effici as the petrolleum , also they found it more expens than the petrolleum . secondli , the environment crisi that the car made from it exhaust . the environment associ will not be satisfi about what 's happen . they will forc car manufactur to reduc there product of car in reason of what environment threat caus by car exhaust . furthermor , i think that the mechan energi will be the most common after twenti year from now . it 's not that worthi for ordinari peopl , and it will be common use instead of car . thu , that 's whi i am total agre with the statement that say : `` in twenti year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today ''
