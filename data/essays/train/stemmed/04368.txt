first of all , we have to determin whether we are suppos to be in a high school or in a colleg situat . that definit make a great differ on my opinion . in fact , if we are in the high school case , i think it is import to have a broad knowledg of mani academ subject . the reason is that high school student have to primarili go over as mani subject as they can to realiz which are the one they are most interest in . second , a wide knowledg of subject give the student a wider view , it `` open '' their mind , and get them the opportun to increas their cultur level . howev , thi is not valid for senior high school student becaus onc they reach the last school year befor colleg , they should now focu on what they would like to studi in the futur . for instanc , if a student want to studi advertis at the univers , he should start take art class , or econom lesson , so that to receiv an introduct , a perspect of what he will studi the follow year . on the other hand , talk about colleg situat , i disagre with the statement sinc i believ that , onc you graduat from high school and you get prepar for the univers , you should concentr yourself on a specif subject . that doe not mean , by the way , that you do not have to studi other subject . it simpli mean that you have to channel your studi on the subject you will need in your futur job . take the previou exampl , if i want to becom an art director in an advertis agenc , i will not continu studi languag , math , physic educ , and the other subject i wa use to studi at the high school . instead of them , i will choos subject that directli concern with advertis , such as the histori of advertis , the econom method of advertis , and other subject that best fit whit my futur job . in conclus , i believ that have a broad , wide knowledg of mani academ subject is veri import for it let us make up our mind about our futur , but onc realiz our primarili interest , we should focu on that one and start becom who we want to becom .
