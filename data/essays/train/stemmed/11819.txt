most peopl like do what they are use to , what they have learn from their famili and societi over the pass year . thi is a good way of live to avoid make ani mistak , and to keep thing the tradit way . but the trueth is , onli a few peopl are the one that take risk in life and make a differ . peopl openmind , who enjoy explor and tri new thing are the one who take risk , encourag themselv to tri uncommon thing and see thing in anoth perspect . thi kind of peopl most of the time find success ; howev , some find may it after their death . an exampl of thi would be the famou artist vincent van vough . he wa a pioneer in a new paint techniqu ; he wa a great paintor whose work did not have much import when he wa aliv . but it wa after hi death that hi work rechead the valu it had hidden , and it becam famou . an exampl of a success person who had reccodmiss while aliv wa the pope john paul ii . he wa a brilliant man , that accomplish to do mani activ that were not tipic done by a pope . he wa the first one that have ever gone to almost everi countri in the world and he spoke sever languag that help him through all hi trip . hi charisma wa uniqu , and becaus of thi characterist he could stablish a sens of brotherhood between cathol and other religion member . success peopl are also good role model , not onli for young peopl but to adult too . they show anoth way of live , probabl a more difficult one , but it result are not repres . i believ that not all human are destin to have success , but everybodi can tri new thing . it just need determin and hard work .
