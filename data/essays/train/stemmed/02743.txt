success peopl alway need not tri new thing and take risk rather than onli do what they alreadi know how to do well . but sometim i support that tri to do thing in new manner alway give the interest and enthusiasm to work but at the same time all the way which a person select may not lead to success . and when we talk in the other manner , the exact way to success will alway be onli one i.e. hard work which are the inspir say of swami vivekananda ( a famou pylosophist of india ) and one can not achiev the success if one doe follow the other way than work hard . the success person onli dare to take the risk to tri new thing as he alreadi experienc the success and the unsuccess person can not take risk everytim to tri thing in new style but he can search for the best path which would lead to hi success in my opinion , i agre partial , that the success peopl tri new thing and take risk rather than do what they alreadi know how to do well becaus they do not want to get bore with the same old way to do thing . and rather they like to have some risk to do their job in a differ manner which would add the spice to their work and life . but at the same time it add the risk and the job may not be successful .
