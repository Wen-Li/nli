some peopl might believ that learn the fact is more import to student . but person i agre with the statement that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . here are the reason and exampl from my experi to support my opinion . first , i am thinkig about my mathemat class in high school . i learn mani fact how to solv the problem . my teacher just taught the method to solv the problem . we did n't focu much on the theori , which is origin of the solv method . i wa good at solv problem on exam , but now i forgot most of problem solv method . i can not appli to real life . i believ it is caus by learn just fact , not the whole idea or concept . second , i want to talk about my design class at colleg . professor taught about wide varieti of the idea and concept of the art histori . and she gave the specif fact of each idea and concept . it is much easier to approach the class becaus we understand the idea and concept first , it help a lot to understand each characterist and fact . it also help when i develop my design and portfolio . if i just learn how to make the portfolio with same way or how to sew my design just follow the direct , how can it be differ from other ? in conclus , we should understand the idea and concept first . thi is the way we can reappli the idea and concept to real life . if we just learn the fact , we can not be creativ and reappli the idea and concept to the real life . i truli believ the statement that understand idea and concept is more import to student than learn fact .
