my point of view about thi topic is clear and precis : i total disagre with thi statement . i am go to explain the reason whi i think young peopl gener give enough time to help their commun . the best exampl i could explain is about myself . in fact , i am engag in an associ as a volunt , the name of the associ is worldwid known as `` emaeu '' . the goal of thi associ is to provid help to poor peopl by provid to them the food they need , or in winter by collect use cloth from gener famili and give it to the poorest . here are two of the possibl by witch you can work as a volunt , but there are sever other issu . my best friend for exampl graduat hi busi school on last year , so he ha a diploma in financ and account major . thank to those knowledg he ha about account , he engag himself for work 5 hour per week as account manag for the associ emaeu , and as a volunt of cours . my friend and i do that becaus we want to fell useful , and thi provid a good person satisfact to help the one who are in need . the second reason whi i disagre whith that statement is becaus in the countri i live in ( franc ) , thi enjoy for help commun is becom more and more common . in school or univers for exampl , we could find lot of advert for becom engag in associ , and thi have more respons that attept . peopl in franc are veri quiet about help their commuun .
