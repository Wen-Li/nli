advertis is now regard as one of the greatest industri in the twenti first centuri . the foundament philosophi of advertis are obvious-to creat a better impress of the product the advertis is describ in the mind of potenti custom . as commun technolog and psycholog theori advanc consider over the last centuri , the effect and power of the advertis outfit with high sophist comput gener amaz visual scene and sound effect , grew more and more power in convinc the custom that `` thi '' product is wonder , inpecc , to a extent often exce the realiti ! even about ten year ago , thi unbeliev strength of advertis had emerg for a long time . i rememb that when i wa a child in elementari school ( probabl the second grade ) , i wa fascin with the afternoon advertis of the littl sun beverag . the tv advertis creat a fals imag that the bottl of the soda , which , of cours delic decor with wing , could realli fli , and a lot of children could follow it and find a mysteri land in which they could enjoy play there with catoon star . howev , when i got thi bottl as my birthday gift , i wa disillusionis that it is just a toy , not a creatur of ani kind . therefor , i herebi denounc the trick employ in the advertis that beautifi product inproperli . moreov , we can see the capac of advertis to exaggar the merit of the product by discuss the process of the advertis creation . first , a market survey is conduct , in which the subconsci desir of peopl are analys and taken advantag of . for exampl , the common ill are sever impedi for peopl who travel around all the time , so the advertis know that if they could trigger the travel subconci fear of get sick dure their trip by cite a exampl in which a offic is assign an extrem crucial job oversea , and ani delay can caus a dread lose of hi firm 's profit . in thi case , a ill can be a so terribl happen that the person want to avoid desper , and now , a tricki advertis can manipul the stori . he can say that by take a kind of medicin , the travel avoid a diseas which would bother him if he had n't eat the pill . therebi , by construct thi plot , it seem that the pill worth a lot , becaus `` without thi pill , the compani would lose a hundr million becaus the man take respons would be imped by sever ill '' , howev , thi impress is fals and a pill is just a pill not compar to a million dollar , but learn advertis can link a pill with a hundr million dollar in the mind of the consum subconsci . as a result , the advertis creat a imag that the pill which in fact worth onli a cent can be as valuabl as a million dollar , which is horribl better than the pill itself ! second , the visual imag produc by highli develop comput technolog entitl the advertis to penetr the watcher ' defens . when we watch a advertis , we conduct a analysi of how valuabl thi product is by use our past experi and knowledg . howev , those grandios imag can easili confus our mind and hinder our abil to reason effect . therefor , by obstruct of own capac of defin how good a product is for ourselv , the advertis actual confus us and give us a fals imag about the product , and the advertis have no motiv to creat the fals imag inferior than the realiti .
