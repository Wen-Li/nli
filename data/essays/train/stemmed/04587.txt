i am disagre with thi statement , becaus for me it is the same import . to understand idea and concept about a topic is import becaus you know about that , but if you can not see the fact you onli will have your own opinion and you may not see how thi thing will be carri to the end . for exampl if you studi biolog you can not stay onli read and understand concept becaus when you finish your career you could not work becaus you do not how that thing make . inst if you learn for difer fact you know how you should drive a situat in the moment becaus you have alreadi seen and practic . in my career , ingeen , i have to learn of the fact becaus all that i made should be experi and prove so thi experi is a fact . for other hand you can think that the fact are not onli the most import so in difer career is not a rule have the fact becaus are more import idea and concept , but in some case thi thing should have some fact to prove and learn . so in my own experi the two idea are mani import , if you have the first you should have the second idea , the first can not live whitout the second and the second can not live whitout the first . thi idea are a complement each other and i think that the teacher have to carri to the practic thi situat . use thi two thing , the student feel more self-confid about that they know and how can they solv a problem .
