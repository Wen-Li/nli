aquir knowledg is a continu process in the human life , so it impart for everi bodi have knowledg through learn , i disagre with the author assert that `` it is good to have a broad knowledg of mani subject than to have special knowledg in a perticular subject '' , whybecaus improv knowldg in the perticular area enabl the indivisu to aquir complet grip on the subject and eventu make him to invent somth in that special , there are two reson to support my opinion , one with out specizlist there is no kind of new discoveri possibl other the specialist have wide knowledg about the thier field so that they can solv mani problem that occur in thier field . firstli , special is impart to build a good societi , student should choos specif subject of thier intrest , rather improv the knowledg in the vast field , thi enabl them to aquir a full grip on the field and they can invent new thing in that area , and form new theori which were imposs for a generalist to do . there are so mani specialist becom scientist , take for exampl einstin he is a civil student but hi extreem intrest in the physic made him a great scientist of 20th centuri and to form theori of rel , so improv the knowledg in a perticular area will help the person to achiv greater height . secondli , if a problem come in perticular field , say in a factori which is manufactur the wine and encount a seriou problem that wine tast ha got chang , the employ over there are generalist not specialist to solv the problem , at thi time the requir of specialist aris , he ha complet knowledg of the chemial compon that are use to make wine and the amount of proport to mix to get a perticular tast . he can solv the problem by give a better solut otherwis it is bit difficult task for the generalist ( employe ) to solv it . finelli i can say that the peopl should aquir the knowledg in a perticular area , which help them and the societi to have a better futur with the invent and solut to the problem , eventhough generalist serv the purpou of integr the task of specialist , howev with out specialist generalist are like rat in a hole without have the knowledg how to to come out , so improv knowledg in perticular field is impart rather than learn unneccessari subject that have no relat with the special .
