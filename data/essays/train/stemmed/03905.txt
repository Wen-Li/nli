to answer thi question i will first give you some idea from the busi area , as i think that thi is the ideal environ to prove that success peopl tri new thing and take a lot of risk . as you can see on daili news , a lot of peopl invent success new product for exampl like the googl founder . but these peopl also had a high risk in not succeed . so , i think that you can onli have a lot success if you tri new thing and take all the risk thi might includ . one reason whi i believ thi is , becaus consum are all look for new not alreadi exist thing . they want to be more and more uniqu and seen as individu so you should not copi an alreadi exist product but creat a real new one . if you take the tamagotchi as an exampl , the develop had some produc cost , but he took thi risk and wa success , becaus he develop a complet new product which peopl look for . therefor , by tri out somenth new he wa realli success and gener a high return on invest in hi new idea . furthermor , i think that by tri out someth new you will learn a lot about how thing work . of cours you will make mistak , but you will not do them again if they occur the next time . for exampl , if you take a babi that ha touch a hot oven , you can be sure it will never touch it again , becaus it ha experienc the neg effect of burn hi or her hand . final , your life will be more interest if you alway tri someth new instead of do all thing in the same bore way . you might gain a lot more life experi and you will develop into a real interest person . for exampl , on parti you can alway talk about the thing you just did and you will be respect by the other peopl for the courag that you demonstr and therefor , you will be consid as a success person . in conclus , these are the main reason whi i think that success peopl tri new thing and take risk is the better option .
