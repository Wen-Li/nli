nowaday we live in a veri comppetit world . we are be overun by advertis everyday . we see them on tv , radio and they are even take over the street . but how much of those product be advertis actual work ? . what 's more , are they realli as good as they seem to be in the advertis ? . sometim you are watch tv and you see someth that seem to do wonder in the kitchen , wonder on clean , a product that doe the laundri , clean the dog and also wash the car . you just have to buy it . but sometim when you do and you tri it for a few time you keep think : `` but thi did n't happen on tv '' . that becaus on tv they onli show us what we want to see . they dont put on air if it hard to use , or danger for the kid . they put that on the box , in tini black letter . and it did happen to me when i bought a `` all-in wonder '' blender . in the world of advertis it 's all about apper . most peopl is be suggest by those advertis to buy the product becaus the peopl that sell it onli show the good side of it . also to sell it they have to make it look spectacular on the eye , becaus nobodi buy an ugli box . all the effort is focus on make it look attract , not where it should be : qualiti . compani are more interest in make more money by make the product more attract to the eye , than make the product effici , safe , and good . it the constant battl betweent qualiti vs cost , and unfortun , these day that battl is won by cost , becaus it give more money to the compani that make the product . in conclus , our global world is more interest in make a product more profit than reliabl . we live in a `` use it and loos it '' world . an base on person experi , when i hear the statement `` most advertis make product seem much better than they realli are '' i say to myself : sad , but true .
