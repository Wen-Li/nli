from my point of view is thi statement not to support . there some signific reason to reduc the use of car , for instanc the environment cost through pollut , the expens in gener for the car owner like for fuel etc . but i strongli believ , that even if the natur resourc are run out and the price of fuel will continu to rise , and even if we pollut the air and do not do ourselv a favour , i believ that the mankind will not use the car less , as long there are ani car avail . and thi opinion ha mani reason . the peopl today do often not care about the world tommorrow , they just live in the presenc , in the time of comfort and wast . peopl want to be independend , they do not want to wait somewher at the busstat , be rule by a schedul arriv and departur . use the car is often the most comfort and fastest way to get somewher , especi to a workplac . often it save time take the car than for exampl the train . nowaday we are too individualist , we also want to have our own privat space , and often prefer to drive somewher just on ourselv quiet and relax , than have chat peopl around us that could disturb our peac moment in the car . have and use a car ha also mani practic reason . if you go somewher for shop for exampl , your car is abl to store a lot , you do not have to carri heavi bag around . especi for a famili do have car an enorm import . it is more pleasant for a mother have your children close by you in your car , than use with them the public option , that onli would caus stress and bring you children in a danger . but i believ that if our econom system will continu like that , have a car will becom much more luxuri . but i am convinc that peopl rather would increas their depth and get a loan to afford have a car than miss thi out . the human be in the industri world are just too lazi and comfort for be more sensibl and think of other or consid the environ .
