i 'm absolut agre with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . travel in a group can solv the problem of bore becaus you can talk to peopl who share the commom interest as you are . furthermor , travel in a group will be more secur rather than travel alon especilli to those chaotic area in the destin . and travel in a group led by a tour guid will reduc the rate of miss famou place and worth see sceneri . becaus guid is a person know the place well and he know at which sesason , at what time , where is beauti and he also can lead tourist to visit avoid the peak time which is veri convient for tourist . then , travel in a group can make a lot friend dure the vacat and can enhanc the relationship . our human be are not isol one , we need to commun . and in the modern societi , whatev organ or bussi compani oe even univers all requir peopl have the abil to work or studi as a group . i had an experi which wa impress . when i wa a junior high school student , my teacher ask us to draw a pitcur which we though is the most beauti one . so we began to draw seper without disscus . after a while , each student show their pitcur which all present veri pale in mean except one which combin the work of two student and which show a more meaning and more variou color in it . ye , the teacher want us to know sometim work with our partner and share both valuabl thing would attribut a amz result which mayb could not predict . if travel in a group , we can exercis the abil to be more cooper and will to help each other which will make our societi more colou and more competit in the long run . i highli recommend to travel in a gruop led by a tour guid .
