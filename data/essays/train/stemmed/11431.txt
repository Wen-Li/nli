i believ that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . i believ thi becaus the student in an academ field will not have grassp knowledg to get the entir knowledg on one specif subject and it the teacher respons to explain the futur task which are go to be there in the subject mind . one reason , the student in an academ subject will not requir a special in one specif subject becaus the student will get a brief idea about all the subject in the academ field . and thi will in turn give a good idea about the futur goal , student can decid which will give a better idea of the subject . second reason , the student in an academ subject will not requir a special in one specif subject becaus the student will get a broad knowledg of everi subject in the academ subject . from thi broad knowledg in a academ subject , the student in the futur will know what happen in the societi and cultur activ in theie own place . lastli , the student in an academ subject will not requir a special in one specif subject becaus the student will be expos to differ type of environ which the student may face in the futur and teacher should explain the student about the explor and understand of the subject which are go to face in the futur by the student . final i conclud that it is better to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject becaus a broad knowledg in everi subject will give a better idea of all the subject and student will have a bettter idea about the futur goal .
