i agre with the statement for sever reason and i will tri to explain them through my person experi . i 'm realli convinc that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . while attend my univers i had the chanc to studi mani differ matter and all of them equip me with a multitudo of skill . most of the research i carri out for my univers studi were relat to the intern law which i am veri passion about . i took everi singl exam that could give me the chanc to deepen my knowledg about intern topic . thu , my studi includ element of intern law , compar law , european law . .. upon obtain my degre in law , it ha been my goal to work in an internationa organis and today i believ that those skill i learn at univers will play sooner or later an import role in my work futur . to tell the truth , my hard studi from univers ha alreadi play an import role and thi is the reason whi i am posit that acquir and understand ide and concept befor learn fact is import for student . if i had not studi the basic of intern law at univers , i would have not been abl to pass the select for an internship at the europea parliament . in fact , the student who want to appli for an internship whithin the european parliament had to demonstr to know how thi intern organ work in theori . onli the student who were abl to pass the test would attend the internship . sinc i studi hard befor appli for that posit and i knew well the structur of the most import european institut , i manag to pass the select . i went to bruxel where i spent the most excit time in my life thank to my studi done earlier at univers . after the internship i also acquir pratic knowledg of the european parliament , which ha ad someth use to my whole prepar . it is then import , in my opinion , for student to pay attent to idea and concept .
