i agre with the statement that success peopl rather tri new thing and like to take risk than do what they can alreadi do . when you alreadi know that you can do someth , it 's just normal that you tri a new thing . everybodi want to tri new thing . small children are the best exampl . when they are abl to sit , they want to be abl to walk . they get up and tri to do so until they are abl to do so . you 're come further when you tri new thing , you get new experi as well . there 's anoth exampl . if i 'm abl to read a german book easili , it 's just normal that i start to read englisch book . i start read englisch book when i wa in grade 5 . i alreadi could read german book and wa success in read german , so i tri so get some new experi and want to tri a new thing . take risk is the same . peopl who are success are often also secur . you onli take risk when you feel stabl at a certain level . success peopl alway stand on a certain level , so they are more will to take risk . there 's also an exampl . if someon just built a hous and now ha mani due at the bank , he wo n't lend hi neighbour much money . he 's unsecur about hi financi situat and therefor now is more caution . all in all , you can say that success peopl alway take risk and want to tri new thing . they feel secur in their life becaus they are satisfi with their situat at the moment . they therefor can risk someth . it 's easier to risk someth when you are secur . you ca n't lose as much as someon whose situat is insecur at the moment . anoth point is that sometim you can be bore if you alway do the same thing . to get out of boredom , you start to do new thing and also take risk . to summar , i agre with the statement .
