i do agre with the statement `` it is better to have broad knoeledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject '' . becaus of differ reason . firt , i believ that it is nice to be abl to talk about differ kind of theme . for exampl , i would love to have the opportiunn to debat about econom problem with a person and discuss world histori at the same moment with anoth person , such as it could be a dinner with friend . also i believ it is better to have and idea about differ aspect of life becaus it show what is import for a person in their life . the idea of be interest in a varieti of stuff for me is a way to demostr that he or she is a cultur person who want to learn more and more about life . besid , that is a statement that i have been debat with myself late becacus i am at one step to enter to the univers , and i had to choos whether a carrier that contain knowledg of mani sbuject , such as intern relationshiop ( i. r ) , or to choos one with more specif inform . sinc i like to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject , i decid to follow the i. r carrier . in conclus i prefer to have knowledg of differ aspect beacus i have the strong believ that it is import to be inform about almost everyth . in addit to that , i think that with thi kind of knowledg , societi person 's imag of a person is gonig to be better and more interest . final it is the kind of knowledg that i consider appropiet for the univers carrier that i had decid to follow .
