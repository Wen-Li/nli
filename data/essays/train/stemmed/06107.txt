my parent often tell me to enjoy life . i understood that they have some regret about thing they want to do but they did n't . that 's whi i am sure that older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl . i consid that young peopl are peopl from 15 to 30 year old . i think young peopl do n't have time to enjoy life . except the young peopl who do n't care about hi futur , the other have alway to work hard in order to have a good job , a good life . .. they are constantli worri by someth . older peopl , who know that there are thing more import than money becaus of their experi , tri to enjoy life as long as they can . that 's whi my parent , and more generali most of the parent , tri to have good time with their children , even when children do n't want . the fact that older peopl know the death , and realiz how life is short , is a reason of my convict . they tri to do everyth they could n't do when they were younger , and that 's whi we can observ more and more parent practic activ `` reserv '' to young peopl . i rememb the day i met a group of older peopl in a parti organ for young peopl . it wa realli amaz becaus they seem to have more fun than us . i do n't say that young peopl never have fun . we see more young peopl in concert or bowl than older peopl . but the way to appreci the moment is not the same . becaus of their experi , older peopl tend to appreci more than us . younger peopl often do n't realiz that life will not be alway like a student life . they think that it will go on so they do n't appreci . to conclud , older peopl enjoy life more than younger peopl , as far as their bodi allow them .
