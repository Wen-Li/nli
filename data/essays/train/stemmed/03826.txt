`` everyth wa better in former time . '' i guess all young peopl know sentenc like thi from their parent or grandpar in particular with refer to the opinion that young peopl nowadi do give enough time and energi to support the commun they live in . but is thi true ? in my essay i will debat , if peolp spend enough time and eneri to help their commun . in particular i will highlight whi the help of young peopl is bitterli need as well as whi also young peopl would benefit from help their communti . in my opinion young peopl , particularli teenag and twen could and shoul help much more in their commun . firstli , i think , nowaday budget of commun are often almost empti , and as a result , much help is need . lot of municip do not know how to provid servic , e.g. for older peolp - prevent them from isol - or for children . the onli way of provid these social servic often is unpaid work of resid . but as far as i know onli less young peopl are interest in provid time and effort to help their commun . they are more interest in have fun , travel and plane their carrer . e.g. in my hometown almost all peopl work unpaid for the commun are older than 50 . henc , i think the qualiti of commun life would benefit from an increas of engag of young peopl . moreov , i think also the person develop of young peopl would benefit from an increas social engag . nowaday young peolpl - at least in europ - often take anyth for grant . they are not awar that we all depend on support and that lot of the thing they take for grant caus much work . by do it on their own they would learn to worship thi work . take all these point into consider it can be state that young peolp increas their engag for sever reason . bot , the commun as well as themselv would probabl benefit from it , howev , it will need some time to realis .
