base on my person experi , i agre that it is more import for student to understand idea and concept , than it is for them to learn fact , becaus the understand of idea and concept prepar the student to use thi knowleg in furter situat . fact learn may be useful too , but is not as effect as understad the main idea . for exampl , there are mani student that learn the fact to take a test . they might get a veri good grade , but they do n't hold the inform for much longer , becaus they learn almost everi especif detail and tempt to repeat them exactli as they read it . on the other hand , student who understand the idea and concept of the topic do n't eassli forget it and can not onli get a good grade , but also use thi inform later in a convers about the topic or an exam where the student are test for their gener knowledg . if is more effect , for exampl , in a math class for the student to understand where the formula come from and how it appli , that onli to learn it . in my person experi with difer math teacher in my school , i retain the lectur in my brain of those teacher who made us resurch and understand the formula , than those that just gave it to us and gave us a lot of excercis to practic . anoth reason would be , that the student that learn to understand idea and concept are also learn to think on their one , not like student who learn fact , they tempt to be more insecur , becaus they learn to regist the inform exactli as it ha been given to them and they do n't develop the abbl to agre or disagre with it .
