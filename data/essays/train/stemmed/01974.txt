the good way of the group travel with a tour guid is that the group tour is make travel funni . we can meet mani peopl who have n't meet yet , and we can also be friend . and if i have tour group we can talk each other about place we went and could discuss about it . also if i go to truvel with a tour guid she will teach us about good place , good restaur , and lot of other thing . it might be veri good thing for us . that becaus if that place we travel is unknown countri , we do n't know where is here and also we ca n't speak languag . when that happen if we have a tour guid , she will set up all thing that we need for us and sure she will present place where we travel correctli and trueli . the good way of travel yourself is that you can go to anywher you want , but if i go to travel with group it might not be true . exampl , if i want to go to dysney land , but the tour guid said we will go to univerti studio so you should follow them . my think is not agre , but not disagre . that mean i think you can choos group travel or yourself travel in the stuation like if you want travel with mani peopl , you can go with group . when you want travel all around freedom , you can go to travel yourself .
