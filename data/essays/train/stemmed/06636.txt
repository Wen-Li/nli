i disagre with thi statement . first of all i think that the lack of help within the commun is a problem in gener . it doe not onli concern young peopl , but everybodey . i think it is more a problem of peopl ' state of mind than of young peopl bee selfish . the overal attitud of peopl toward help each other and pute themself up for someth good ha gone wors . most peopl are complet focus on themselv . they onli care about their work , interest or their own problem . but in my opinion there have been mani attemp to improv thi situat . mani compani for exampl expect from the candid who appli for a job that there ha been some kind of engag , which is not suppos to relat to their educ directli . that is whi mani student join organis in their commun , which purpos are to take care of other student or engag for social matter . thi way they learn to take over respons and keep thi state of mind up in their futur life , teach thi to their kid later on . there are also some compani who support their commun themselv by make donat or support student , hospit , kindergarden etc. in their commun in some other way . the valu of the commun and take over respons ha increas i think . the issu ha becom more present in the meantim . hectic and pressur are control mani peopl ' life . for young peopl it is especi their fear of the futur . but eversinc thi way of live ha occur , peopl more and more feel the need of comfort and support . the urg of have someon help and support them , will hope result in a chanc of mind . that is whi i am think that there will be improv concern thi issu . not onli in young peopl ' but everybodi 's mind .
