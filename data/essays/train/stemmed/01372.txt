i diagre with thi statement : in my opinion you should concentr on one - or at most two - academ subject . the first reason you should do so is that academ subject and modern scienc have develop to a pretti high level . furthermor , a lot of way to special - mean minor topic - are avail in each distinct subject . thu , you may not gain the abil and experi which is necessari to work as a profess in a certain subject , if you do not concentr on thi singl one eagerli . second , if you keep on wander among too mani subject dure your time at colleg or univers you may easili loos track of what you are head for with your educ . on the contrari , if you stick to one paticular subject there will not be too much difficulti in earn a master 's degre in thi one within a usual period of time . i have made the experi of studi mathemat and physic both as major at the same time myself . although these subject are definet relat to each other and one might guess that there are a lot of connect which make it easier to advanc in these one than it would be with ani differ combin , it still is veri demand : work on both subject ha taken almost all of my time and therebi did not leav much room for leisur activ not relat to univers . furthermor , i sometim felt like be lost in a sea of too mani choic : as a result of my intens studi i got to know realli a lot of minor subject which i could special on in my diploma thesi and most of which seem to be interest . thu , i felt like stick at a point where it wa hard to make a decis ; had i not start off with both subject , the decis which topic to work on would be easier , as i would not have come in touch with so mani promis topic . in addit , it would definit not be possipl for me to work on one more subject no matter how few the addit workload might be . final , instead of work on too mani subject , i would recommend everyon to train hi so call `` soft skill '' . thi mean that peopl should tri to engag in commun activ and social programm rather than work on anoth academ subject . thi will give them a sens of how to work with differ peopl , which is realli import for their futur carrer : for busi as well as for univers research it is import to effect work , discuss and find proper solut togeth with other person . result from these reason my conclus is that you should not tri to master as mani academ subject as possibl , but rather tri to concentr on one academ subject and differ social activ .
