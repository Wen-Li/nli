i disagre about ` in twenti year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . ' in my opinion , if they fewer car use in than there are today , that will call a lot of problem . first , they are young so they can make mani possibl of problem with car than adult . of cours they are not so young to drive but they are not adult eigher . for exampl they can make the drunk drive . they do n't think harder than adult so they think they drive with drunk . that wa just one of possibl situatuion . how do i know ? my friend 's brother start drive when he wa 20 year old . oneday , he drunk at noght with hi friend . after drunk he drove the car . he thought he could dive . and he made accid . anyway that is one of exampl . second , when we start drive when we are 20 year old . they will more pollut than befor . and that can make more traffic jam . . so in conclus , i do n't think they will be fewer car in use than there are today . howev they can use public transprot for move . that wa my person opinion .
