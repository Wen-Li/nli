the question ask is if student should focu on learn fact , or rather on understand idea and concept . thi issu ha a big import becaus it is link to the teach style addopt by school and univers , as well as , to the learn approach that student should choos . in my opinion learn concept and idea is better than studi fact . i beliv it is not effect to learn fact becaus fact are gener link to one particular situat or experi . mani time thi fact are from the past . on the other hand , concept and idea can be appli to a bigger number of case and dure a longer time . for exempl , what happen dure the second world war is alreadi in the past , but the concept of war is common to mani situat of thi type . base on thi idea , i am convinc that it is more effect to understand concept and idea . furthermor , it is reccommand to studi concept becaus the prcess of understand a concept stimul and develop think skill . for instanc , when a student concentr on the concept of account rather than on memoris the balanc shit , he or she will be abl to understand much more , like the idea of imput and output , in gener . due to thi fact , i think that studyig concept is superior to learn fact by heart . final , i believ that concept are easier to memor than particular fact . becaus concept can be associ to so mani situat and to so mani mental imag , they remain in our mind a veri long time . moreov , concept tend to becom part of our mind , of our permanet way of think , but fact do n't . for exempl , if we understand the concept of trade , there are so mani situat we can link thi to , like ancient silk trade , slave trade , modern trade , so on . becaus of thi , i prefer studi concept and idea more thad learnig fact . in conclus , the fact that concept can be appli and link to more exempl , that they stimul think and are easier to rememb , demonstr that studi concept is a better option . i believ that while studi a concept , a student reach higher level of intellig and of effici .
