the univers usual teach the student to work hard . to read the appropri book , to listen care , to make note and final to recollect the learn inform in an exam or paper . but are the need inform onli learn by consciou or are they understood and still avail in our mind after the test ? if a cours consist onli of learn fact and figur , then for sure the student will forget pretti soon what it wa about . but if they need to understand idea and concept they will be kept in mind onc they 've been learn . despit the import of understand the inform and concept , in mani cours it is still necessari to learn figur and fact to get a background knowledg about the topic . as long as the balanc between learn and understand is kept , there is no problem with it . but if the learn overwhelm , the student might get bore of the stuff and demotiv . the risk of give up is high then . moreov it is veri import that a student can realiz how to use the learn concept in praxi . that point also stand for understand idea . but if the idea or concept is veri complex and the student did n't get it right , he might stay behind and ca n't follow the cours ani longer . especi if the follow build on the known concept . in my opinion it is inde more import to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , becaus thing i 've onc understood i would n't forget again . moreov it give me the feel of success if i understand the way it work . for sure i also have to learn theoret fact for my studi but i think it 's more import if i can use the fact i 've learn as a base for go further in understand a concept . to sum up i would say that a combin of both , the understand and the learn process is optim for a success studi .
