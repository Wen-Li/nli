one may travel for a varieti of differ reason , leisur , work or educ , and may do so led by someon or plane the activ oneself . although travel in group lead by a tour guid is an option i do not believ it is the best way to do so , primarili becaus it cater to the need of a group not to the individu . thi lead to loss of opportun , time and overal enjoy of the activ . take for exampl , take a lifelong dream tour of europ lead by a tour conductor . first of all one is stuck to a schedul list of activ that someon thought would be interest . if in a particular citi you want to visit an unschedul histor site you will probabl not be abl to do so , therefor loss the onc in a lifetim opportun to view someth you realli want to . you could of cours skip the tour day , but what would be the purpos of take the tour in the first place . sinc there the mention and dread schedul , if someon is late for ani activ , and someon usual is , we loos more valuabl time . not to mention patienc , influec our state of mind throughout the day and possibl the rest of the tour . these are probabl veri individualist point of view . and i defenitelli do think there are benefit of travel in group led by a tour guid . but for my person need i would rather to plan my own travel .
