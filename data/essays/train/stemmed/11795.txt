i do agre on the statement that young peopl nowaday do not give enought time to help their commun . i would saz the word nowaday could be taken out . i can tell you from my person expieri that thi is not a new stori . i wa as well not a good kid in regard of help our commun . i alway had the feel that i do not have enough time to help . when i came home from school , i did my homework and than i went to my sport class . i just wa part of the group and went home again . i also want to spend time for do noth and just relax a littl bit . there wa not enough time to do someth els . now i know that thi is not true , as a kid you have a lot of time to do someth for your commun . i did onli realiz thi when i began to work and i saw that i will have not that much time in futur . i think the young peopl have the same problem as i had . they would like to spend their time for someth more import for themselv . they do not realiz that help other would bring ani benefit for them . therefor it is not onli the fault of the young peopl that they do not take some time to spend with their commun , it is as well a problem of commun due to the fact that onli adult could commun from their own experi , it is their respons to take action . parent and teacher should talk the ownership on thi and get the young peopl up to speed . if the parent would explain how import the commun will be for the futur of their kid . there will be more interact with the commun alradi . teacher should rais thi issu in their school and mayb implement some commun activ in their schedul . so that all kid could learn more about their commun and see by themselv that it is an import thing , so they will continu to particip in futur activ . in conclus , i would like to make the clear statement that everybodi is respons to help our commun and we should not point with the finger to other .
