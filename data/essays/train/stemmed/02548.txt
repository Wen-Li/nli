i absolut disagre with the given exampl . older peopl enjoy life the same or more as young peopl do . thi is due to the fact , that young peopl live life accord to their expect futur , creat thi way a fals sens of etern . therefor , young peopl are unabl to experi the marvel mysteri and beauti of daili life . on the other hand , it is well known , that older peopl live life more intens . older peopl are capabl of experienc everi second of their exist , becaus they are awar of their mortal destini . life is base on experi , life is what we creat on a daili basi , but life ha an end . life is uncertain , but death is certain . everyday respons have made young peopl , as myself , unawar of the realiti of our existinc , of the real mean of life . life should not be just about complet assign and work for a compani , life should be someth deeper . but it is well known , that our industri societi ha made out of us work machin , and taken away our freedom to live life accordingli to our decis . as one grow , one is taught to be a person who dedic most of it life to the well-b of the societi in which one 's live . befor , for exampl in my countri , reach 65 year , one is oblig to work , and one will be abl to live onli after turn thi age . thi is an import reason , that explain whi most of the young peopl are uncap of enjoy life , the way they should , and whi older peopl are capabl to . it is a piti , that most of the peopl in our societi will start to live life just after have dedic their entir life to societi . it is dure thi stage of life , when older peopl realiz that their life is mortal . it is dure thi revel , that peopl start enjoy life more . everi second is preciou , and everi second could be the last . it is thi fact of life that make older peopl enjoy life more than young peopl do .
