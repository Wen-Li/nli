the argument at hand is whether we should travel in a group led by a tour guid . i disagre with thi statement . in my opinion , travel on one 's own is a better choic instead . i can conveni plan my schedul , use my budget more effici , and most importantli , learn about the histori of the countri that i visit . firstli , travel alon mean that i can have a flexibl travel plan . i can book my own air ticket , reserv my own hotel room , and decid when to visit place . but when i am on my own , i do not have to worri about the need of the other . i can choos my time to buy a cheaper air ticket , and rent hotel that appeal to me most . i also do not have to visit place that i am not interest in . secondli , i can use my budget more effici . if i am to be led by a tour guid , i will have to pay . the fee is usual veri expens and will account for a larg part of my travel expens . and sinc the qualiti of the servic provid by the tour guid is unreli , i think it is a better idea to spend the money on the travel itself , instead of hire a tour guid . with more money , i can go to more scenic spot and attract . i can also afford to buy more souvenir , and tast expens cuisin . thirdli , i can fulli explor the histori of the countri that i visit when i travel alon . tour guid onli give superfici inform about place , and they seldom tell us about the histori . all they care about catch the coach bu on time , and hurri place after place . when i travel alon , i can talk to the local peopl , and ask them about the local histori . thi way , i can have a closer look on the histor background of the region , and learn more about it cultur . to conclud , i disagre with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid . i prefer travel alon . i can plan my own schedul , utilis my budget more effici , and learn about the histori of the countri that i visit .
