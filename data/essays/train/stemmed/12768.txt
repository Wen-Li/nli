life is just a short jurney in everi person 's life . it 's a small stop befor our long last life . so peopl should enjoy everi moment of it . i alway believ that old peopl have more experi than young peopl becaus they have spent more time in thi life . as a result from their experi in life they learn that each individu should enjoy his/her life befor death . that whi they enjoy their life more than young peopl . i believ that old peopl learn that they have to enjoy their live in the hard way after spend half of their live worri and think about what will happen to them later in the futur . enjoy life need peopl who do n't think too much about what will happen next , peopl who think that everyth is written in their book of life and peopl who believ in someth call disteni . all of these three thing are mostli present in old peopl . as a person who is full of faith i believ that everyth we 're do in our live is written and decid by god befor we were born . that whi i alway listen to my grandpar when they advic me to enjoy my life . life come onc onli , thi is someth that not most young peopl keep in mind . they alway work hard and worri over thing that wo n't help them enjoy their live . old peopl believ that if they enjoy their live they will get a healthier and a longer life . which is someth reason . think about it in thi way , if you are live in a life that is fill with worri you will get mani diseas start with sleepless night to blood pressur . that whi whenev my parent say '' live your life '' it make senc to me . to conclud , i believ that if each one of us tri to sit with our parent , grandpar or even our older friend we will learn and benefit so mani thing from them . not to mention our awar of life and that it 's a short journey that we should alway enjoy .
