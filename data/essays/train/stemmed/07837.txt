some believ that it isbett to have broad knowledg of mani academ subject than to special in one specif subject . but other one believ the neg attitud . in my opinion , the answer of thi state is depend on one 's person exper and the life stile . now , the societi is more and more complex , so broad knowledg are need for peopl to fit it . so , if one peason onli want to get a batcher degre from the univers and will go into the societi to earn themsel , they shoud have broad knowledg of mani academ subject in order to fit the societi better and quicker . due to the blank of employ situat , broad knowledg of mani academ subject will offer more oppertun in the job market . for exampl , one peason who have the knowledg about pc , soft ware , physic , and electr ha more oppertun to be hire by a it compani iit . but , as we know , more and more inform is contain in one academ subject , so it is diffcult , even is imposs , for someon to master all the inform in one subject , not to say mani academ subject . so if someon want to learn some inform about one subject better , he/sh would better learn one subject and special in one specif subject . for exampl , one peason is interest in biolog veri much and want to got a phd degre about it , it is not need for he/sh learn more about histori . in a word , the answer of which choic is better depend on one 's person exper and the life stile . to someon , have broad knowledg of mani academ subject is better ; but to other one , special in one specif subject is better .
