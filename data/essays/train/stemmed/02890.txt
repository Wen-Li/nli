citi twenti year later how will our citi be in the futur ? how will peopl live twenti year from now ? these are question ask for so mani year and we can see mani differ answer , theori and approach through out histori . when tri to answer these question , the key aspect of citi such as traffic and car use come into the pictur . i believ that , in term on car use in the citi , there will not be signific decreas in the number of car use and even more car will be use in twenti year . there are sever aspect effect the car use today . the main element is the car-depend life style of modern peopl live in the citi . i believ that the citi life of the near futur will as car depend as today or even more . citi evolv and continu to get bigger count on the mobil of the peopl . as new suburb are creat and citi with multipl citi center away from each other , are develop ; as the current situat in istanbul nowaday more and more peopl will need to use car . the onli reason for fewer car to be use in the near futur would be the concept of work from home use the internet . peopl can argu that when peopl will have the chanc to live and work in one place - the home offic concept , they will not need to use car . howev the concept of a home ofiic is not that new and in the past 10 or 15 year mani peopl tri to work from home but end up go back to their offic . big compani are not support peopl work from home , on the contrari they are tri to creat better and more confort work environ in and around the citi . base on what i see in my own countri ( turkey ) and mani other develop countri i can say that more and a lot of money is invest in the car industri , highway , tunnel and bridg make it easier and necessari for peopl to use car . therefor i believ that in twenti year there will be more car in use than there are today .
