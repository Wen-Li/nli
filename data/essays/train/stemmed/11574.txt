there are lot of car today anywher on earth , and it is clear that the number of use car ha been steadili increas by the develop of techniqu in make car . although more and more car are still made for mani peopl who want to buy it , i think the popular of the car may be decreas in twenti year for the follow reason . first of all , there are too mani risk to drive a car in real life . even though the modern car are well-equip to reduc the risk broken out dure the accid , it can onli minim the risk of the accid , not prevent it from origin occur . in realiti , the more car are bought , the more accid are occur by it . furthermor , the risk of drive a car is much sever than we expect . if we are injur by the car accid , it might cost not onli a lot of money for us to cure our bodi but also lot of time for us to overcom the mental fear from the accid . so , for thi reason , i think mani peopl will not use the car as much as it is use now for their safeti . moreov , there are lot of other conveni transport around us , especi the subway which can substitut the role of the car perfectli . these day , we use subway veri often when we go to somewher we want . differ from the begin of the histori of the subway , we are now easili access to the subway station near to our home , school , and workplac ; therefor , we can go anywher we want also by use the subway , not by the car . and the strong point of the subway is that it help us save our time . there are so mani car on the road that it not onli make us be tire of the traffic jam but also make it difficult for us to arriv at the place in the time we want . that is , use car can be the wast of our own time . thu , i think the subway will be use much more than the car in the near futur . in conclus , i agre with the statement that the number of peopl who use the car will be decreas in twenti year , for the reason i mention abov : sever risk that the car can bring and the appear of the more conveni transport such as the subway .
