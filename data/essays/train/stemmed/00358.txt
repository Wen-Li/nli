well , i agre with the idea that is more import for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , i think thi becaus when you understand someth you take it for you , that is better than learn fact , if you understand the idea they want to teach you it will be better for in the hour of the test to answer becaus you alreadi have the main topic on your mind and you know what is the essenti part of what you understood and learn , and in the other hand is also good if you understand the concept they want you to learn . althoug those concept will help you to sometim answer and that is anoth way of learn . i disagre wiht the idea of learn fact becaus i do not think that is use becaus that will be someth you learn and did not understood , but for some student or peopl is better when they got the idea of the concept , and for some other is better if is someth clear for them , someth that they have an idea of what is triy to understand , for exampl for me is more use if i understand what the concept and idea are about and in that way i can alway rememb that , anoth exampl will be , like i have a friend she alway learn fact , and at the hour of the test is more difficult for her , than it is for me but the thing is that i understood the idea and concept of what is the topic or theme about , but sometim is better when you learn fact and that is all becaus you did not understood the concept or the idea of what they are triy to teach you . there are a lot of factor that make student understand idea and concept sometim is eassier then learn fact .
