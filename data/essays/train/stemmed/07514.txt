i believ that the is no easi answer to thi question . one must consid posit and neg aspect of both form of learn . one the one hand , it is veri import to learn and to know fact , espesci while deal with complex problem . a lack of factual knowledg on a certain subject will render ani student unabl to properli discuss it with other . when be face with differ fact within a convers , one can not differenti whether the inform use by one 's counterpart is accur or fals . one could be overwhelm with fals inform and trick into believ the counterpart 's posit , even if it doe not give an accur pictur of the topic . a student that ha no idea when abraham lincoln live or serv hi presid might be convinc by other that he fought for the right of african american in the 1960 's instead of dure the civil war . on the other hand , a mere learn of fact doe not reveal to a student the interconnect between them and how one fact might lead to anoth . a student that ha learn the name an inaugur date of all us presid doe not necessarili know anyth about their achiev and could therefor never enter an argument on which presid best repres the middl class or fought for equal right . thi is where the understand of idea and concept becom import . in conclus , i would say that in order to fulli grasp ani subject and to be abl to discuss it with other one ha to find a balanc between the learn of fact and the underst of idea and concept . while some student may find it harder to learn fact they might compens thi with a great understand of the underli concept and vice versa . howev , no student should ever complet neglect ani of these two form of learn .
