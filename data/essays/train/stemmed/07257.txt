nowaday , tourism ha becom an import part of the entertain industri , especi in the western societi . peopl tire - and sometim fed up - with their job alway keep an eye on their agenda , wait for the next vacat . but when thi day arriv , peopl usual have to face a dramat dilemma : do they have to travel by their own or with a tour guid ? thi issu ha been larg debat for the next ten year and is at the heart of the polit campaign of mani countri . travel by your own impli that you can be organ : you have to book the hotel yourself and you have to speak the languag of the countri you plan to visit . overal , it will be difficult to understand the stori and to appreci the monument you visit , except if you alreadi know the cultur of the countri veri well . actual , the choic depend of the type of vacat you like . for instanc , if i go on vacat to the beach and that my aim is to have fun play volley ball and have a nap while stare at the sea , it is not obviou that i need to be led by a tour guid . actual i can still do so , but the role of the guid will be slightli reduc , sinc there is noth special to visit . on the other hand , if you prefer a cultur trip , thing are differ , and you might need a tour guid as i said belov . i would say that be led by a tour guid is the best way to travel if you fanci cultur trip . my point of vue is that i prefer travel on my own . thu i can make cultur discoveri and meet the inhabit of the countri i am visit . furthermor , i can practic my foreign languag . that 's it : next vacat i will go to a english speak countri , so i could practic my english . i will lose my horribl french accent . and i will not need to pass the toefl exam anymor . therefor i will no longer bother an anonym corrector with stupid essay ; )
