in my opinion advertis make a product seem better than it realli is , so i agre with the statement . in the today 's world a great amount of advertis is given to us , even if we do n't care of them we are often compel to watch them . i think advertis can chang a person tought about a thing , and for thi reason we found advertis everywher . it often happen that a person 's choic is chang becaus it had watch an advertisemt . some peopl buy onli thing that are show on televis becaus they are influenc by advertis . advertis make them think that these product are better than the other . fortun i am not realli thi type of person becaus i do n't care of advertis , just becaus i know that they could chang my decis . so when i have to buy someth , i ponder my decis and i look for the best price and the best object without think to what wa show on televis or said in a radio program . i do n't follow advertis for anoth reason : all object show on them are more expens than other of the same type . that is becaus of the cost of the advertis , but these cost seem to be repai by the influenc that advertis have in peopl 's opinion . when i look for buy someth i alway budget my money and i choos less expens object rather than more expens one , which are alway the one show all day long in advertis . in conclus , i think a great part of the peopl is influenc by advertis , which make product seem to be much better than they realli are , but i think that peopl have to choos with their own head and must not follow advertis seen on televis or heard from the radio .
