it is dificult to forecast the evolut of the use of car in twenti year , becaus it depend on a lot of factor that could chang in such a long time . howev , and given the news that we are face all day , i think is possibl have an accur idea about what the futur will be , and in thi futur will be fewer car . at first , look back to the past , we can see that the develop of car manufactur wa link to some social and econom factor . in the veri beggin of car industri , a car wa consid a luxuri devic for most of the popul , but thank to henri ford , the privat automobil becam a popular consum good , formerli in the unit state and later in europ . in it heyday in the fifti , the american car were a symbol of power and wealth in all the countri of the world . nevertheless , the environment condit have chang wide in the last decad . the continu rise of the ga price , link to the polit unstabl of the lead productor ; the rise of the conscious that the planet resourc are limit , and the fact that the natur environ is be harm , have chang the attitud toward the privat car . inde , the urban life ha been sever disturb by the wide use of car . the possibl of use the car to conmmut everyday ha creat the sprawl phenomenon , with the bitter consequ of decay inner citi , collaps highway , destruct of farmland , pollut , and lack of social contact in the car-ori suburb . therefor , i think that the use of the car will be reduc in the futur . it is necesari that all the societi face the environment and social problem that car are creat . of cours i think that car are use and i drive , howev , i think that car should be use in a more smart way than today . combinig the car with effici public transport network , we will creat a differ and most sustain pattern of urban grow .
