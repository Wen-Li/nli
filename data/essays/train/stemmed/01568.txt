the new gener of peopl are more self involv . if we get to understand them then we can see their evolut toward egocentr . the world ha open it frontier sinc airplan , train and bost are access and less expens then use to be . peopl get to travel more , their nomad live bring them to dicov new place , new civilis but not to get involv in a commun . they basicali lock themselv up and do n't even see what is out there . so help the commun they live in is not a prioriti . there are a lot of polit issu that are involv in the neglig or even distruct of commun , like povreti , immigr , tax , unimploy , ... all of these factor contribut in the young peopl ' action . to help our entourag , we first have to like it and feel appart of it . and in most citi the most of the time peopl do n't like where they live , they ca n't afford better so they just do n't even care . if we compar it to the last gener which live all their live in the same hous , with the same neibour , they were more involv in the well be of their commun . they were help peopl and love one . but they felt they belong there , they just got over a war and were just happi with what they had . but as for today , wealth is a prioriti in life , educ leed us there . we get an educ to be buy thing we do n't need but want . and for that we tend to want more , an addict like the say say `` time is money '' . and greed come with careless . be appart of the young peopl , i get to be confront everi day with person whom could'nt care less about peopl and commun . but know that thi kind of tought are just selfish and worthless , i tri to get out of thi stereotyp gener and tend to be less self involv in what ever i do and where ever i go .
