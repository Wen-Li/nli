the purpos of travel is to discov and explor more of what the world ha to offer . it is a chanc for someon to fulfil their curios and their imagin . there are mani way to travel and explor . someon may choos to travel alon or accompani by a group . most of the time , the group is led by a tour guid who is an expert on the histori , past , and site of that specif area . other peol travel alon becaus they do not have a specif destin , and would rather explor at their own pace . i beleiv that everyon ha differ interest , and that the standard tour will not necessarli satisfi everyon . i think that there are more benefit to travel alon than travel in a group , and be led by a tour guid . one of the major advantag is the fact that the person is abl to sole visit the site that he/sh is interest in , and therefor is abl to spend more time at that locat as oppos to have to report at an other locat that may be less interest to him/her . i also think that everyon travel for a differ reason . some travel to make research about an area or a subject that is fascin to them , while other do not have a specif goal . travel in group will not allow someon whose intent is to research to fulfil hi need . that person would need time to focu on his/her area of studi without interrupt or limit . there may also be some difficulti when travel alon . one of the most common one is that the tourist who is not familiar with the locat may not be abl to locat him/herself and find the histor site . the histori and inform about each site that a tour guid provid may not be avail . i person disagre with the statement becaus i do not think that someon should limit when travel . i think that befor travel , a person should make some research and familiar him/herself with the area he / she will be visit , and defin his/her prioriti . no one know what the world ha to offer until all the possibl have been explor . i also beleiv that the true and best way to explor the world is alon .
