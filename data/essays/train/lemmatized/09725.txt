from my point of view i ca n't agree with the statement , that the young people of today do n't offer enough of their time to help their community . in the following passage i will try to explain my point of view and give special argument for this conviction . if you want to have a discussion on this topic , you must first of all set a definition of what the term < helping other people > actually implies . to me , helping other people is evey form of making an effort to suuport other people in any part of their life . in my social and personal environment i have experienced a lot of situation in which people and especially young people have spent a lot of time on helping other people . starting with helping other pupil in class who are n't able to cope with their homework on their own , to helping other fellow student in university with special task up to helping old people in situation they ca n't handle anymore on their own . in my opinion , another aspect of helping other people can also refer to sport activity . for example in my rowing club is wa a common procedure that the older member teach the younger how to row . by this way of proceeding also the younger member became awre of the fact , that they depend from the help of the older people in the club and a a consequence of that , there wa no question about it , that helping each other wa the overall principe of this sport club . this show to me that in our society the principe of helping each other is widely spread , and that especiaklly young people are aware of this neciissity .
