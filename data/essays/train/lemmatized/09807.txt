in the modern economy , characterized by the progressive saturization of the market in each business area , it becomes more and more strategic for farm the use of advertising through the mass medium ( television in particular ) . but often , in order to stimolate consumer ' desire , advertisement seem to overextimate the real potentiality of product . that assumption is more than that . it 's a concrete reality . in fact in the last decade public institution had been created to control product advertising and to state if the picture offered by advertisement really reflects the product characteristic . the creation of such institution point out that in order to improve the sail of a product , it 's much more important the immage the farm give to the market of it than it real technical characteristic . for that reason often consumer prefere buying a well-known product than an un-known one , even if it ha much more better technical quality . an important example of that phenomenon occured in the car builder sector few yars ago . two important group , audi on one side and saab on the other one , decided to improve a project for a new car togheter . i particular , in order to cut down the cost associated to it production , they shared the same motor and also the same structure of the car . so the two car had the same performance a reguard for speed , control and other technical parametres , but were a little bit different in the hestetic ( not too much ) . well , even if this two car were so similar , audi sold million of unit more than saab did . and why did it succede in doing that ? only because , thanks to a better comunication and advertisement to the market , it had maden people able to believe in the superiority of it product and in the reliability of audi brand . but lot of other example can be shown in all the business area : product pictured a innovative , sure and unbreakle are only common product that you can buy with ease ( and sometimes at lower price ) from another farm operating in the same area . finally , looking at those and lot of other example , i completely agree with the statement presented and i want you all to meditate on such a misrappresantation .
