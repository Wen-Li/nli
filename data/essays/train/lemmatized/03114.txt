i totally disagree with this statement . so many young guy today are helping other people to manage their life . i live in a small city called erding and also in such a small city a club to help student to get better mark established . i joined this club one year ago and first i wa surprised how much young people were offering there help there . all of this people are graduate student who use their free time after beeing in their course and class to spend it at teaching other student . a major fact is that the other guy and me do not earn a lot of money by this activity . since my first visit in the club i have been doing private lesson once a week . and i think it is a great honor to see the person teached by you getting better and better grade . i also have a friend who support a poor family in asia with 400 euros a month . without that help they could not even buy clothes for all of them . 400 euros is quite a lot of money also for the european way of life . but the girl work hard for beeing able to afford this project . another example for proving my statement given above are many other student and friend of mine . i have already asked many people for their opinion about the fact that many older poeple that the younger one do not care about the environment surrounding them . most of them refused to join the military after finishing school . instead they did a social work . this would be for example helping older poeple to get to the supermarket or to the church . and surprisingly every one of the enjoyed his job . everyone agreed that they gained a lot of social experience whithin this time . to sum up i would say that young people often are misunderstood . they are neither laisy nor not willing to offer their help . you can find young poeple all over the social environment working for free and helping the people who need this help .
