today in japan , i think some young people dont help their community . i think it is because they are not interesting in their life . some people say that they dont have much time to spend helping community but i think those are just the reason why they dont want to do it . so i think they should be interested in their community and give enough time to helping their community to see their life again . some community have some problem . i think the most biggest common problem is the environment . i am interested in these environment so i do want to know about these problem and want to think what i can do for community . these environment problem are very important today i think , because those are depending on our life and they are relative to our future life . so i think that people have to consider about these problem again of course , but young people should be in mind these problem becasue young people will make our future life so that they should give enough time to helping thier comminuties . these a little helping can make our community better . having siad that , some people against my idea because studying or playing sport or doing what they like are also important . however , i think young people can give more time to helping considering their community because young people 's infuluences are very big so that if they more pay attention to their community , i think their community will be better . in conclusion , young people should see thier life again and they should consider what they can do for the future . so i disagree with this statement .
