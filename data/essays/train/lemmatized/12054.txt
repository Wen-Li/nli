my personal opinion towards this matter is that a person with a specialised academic subject tends to be more successful than someone who ha a good general overview of most subject . by this i do not mean that a person with a specialised subject is more knowledgable than a well rounded person . someone who ha studied a subject in depth and ha received a degree for it , will be more prone to getting a good job in their field of study than someone who ha a wider general knowledge but a shadier knowledge in a certain particular field . nowadays , a degree is perhaps the most essential element required in order to get a good job due to the increasing competitiveness for place . therefore , somebody who lack this degree will not be a likely to get the job a someone who ha perfected their field of study , a the latter is likely to be more efficient and to provide a company with a different and wider approach of the subject required . notwithstanding that it is important to specialise in a field of study , it is also essential to have a wide understanding of other aspect in life which could be helpful towards a career . through past experience , i have encountered people who concentrate on a subject and are probably near to being the best at it . however , i have also noticed that some of these people lack basic skill such a socialising with others . this is not a generalisation , but a partial observation . in conclusion , it is vastly important to have a good knowledge of a certain field of study , but optimally , it would be better to have an equilibrium between the two , having a broad general knowledge a well a knowing substantialy about a certain topic .
