first of all . i agree with `` most advertisement make product seem much better than thy really are. '' because if i have company then i make some advertisments for some product . and i show them in the tv for the people , also i show them in the street , but i shwo them in a bad way . i mean they were seem bad or ugly . then nobady going to by anything from my commpny . they going to put ex on it ( all the people goning to heat it ) . any way any one want to make an advertisement have to show them seem gret way . to attreact people to that kind of product wich mide the advertisement for it . here is the example for two people mide two advertisments for two diffrent kind of bayby milk . the first ont showed the bayby milk with darty stuff and with sick child . also the pearson showed that advertisment with bad music . the second one showed the bayby milk with clean stuff and with cutte bayby . also with nice music . now here is the bottom line . the people who wictched the two advertisement , wich kind of milk they are going to buy ? . difnlay the second one , because it ha really great stuff and really great way to ahwo the bayby milk . that even in other product . itis depend how the product showing . and wht the gift come with it . also if it ha good offer or not . i mean it is depend how is the product shwoing . that wa my opinion if i agree or disagree with `` most advertisments make product seem much better than the really are . '' and igreed with that .
