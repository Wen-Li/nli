well history ha given enough example that successfull people try new thing and take risk rather than doing the same thing . i strongly beleive in that . i have good experince about that i worked six year steadly working in a same manner a like other in my medical proffession but than after i shiffted to new research based study and that helped me greatly in improving my knowledge and offcourse my life and above that patient life . i still remember when i discovered new method of treatment how dramatically the result i got but i have taken risk , i left my job for a year and did research on very minute thing and definetly thats pay me alot . as it is mention in history the great `` colombus `` found the west indie by doing different , like great scientist `` gallelio '' who is the first person to say that earth is round like a ball . so it is like cristal clear that if some one want to become a successfull person he / she ha to do something new . today is a world of competetion or we can say that `` survival of the fitest '' . one should do some thing different from another . today world is going into new direction we are exploring in technology , in space , under the earth it only because of those successfull person who did something different . think if we wouldn `` t ha done these different thing in life we wiol probably would be same a animal no invention no light no telephone . today we can not imagine the world wiyhout thesis wonderfull object . in the end i would reccomend that every man who want tobe successful in life should think differently and do thing differents but only and only for improving a man kind and it nature only than a one will be remember you a greatt successfull person .
