i ca n't agree this statement . why i think so , there are some reason . firstof all , when i go on a trip in a group led by a tour guide , i have to do everything with my group . for example , i have to eat the same food what group people eats , i have to see the popular tourist attruction where very crouded with the amount of people with group people , and so on . next , i love to stay at a rich hotel and relax , because the most of my perpous of go traveling is relaxing . however , pack tour 's timetable is too tight for me to relax , and there are many people in a group , so i do n't relax . walking around unfamiliar place without some map and brouches is also a relaxing . i can found my favorite seanery where people do n't know . the most important reason why i think go on a trip not to use a pack tour is boring . travel agency want to make a very cheap tour to buy a lot of ticket a many a they can , so pack tour is more boring than other travel . when i use such a pack tour , i will go to the very famous plase to see , but i do n't like such a famous place . probably , there are many people in a such a very famous place , and i will be not able to find that i really want to see a worthseeing place or a lot of people . i do n't want to have such an experience . therefore , i disagree with the statement
