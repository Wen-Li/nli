the mobility of society is a topic which is often discussed : in newspaper , in politics , but also among friend . should there be le car to decrease pollution ? yes , there should , but in my opinion this will not happen in the next twenty year . on the contrary , i think that the number of car in the world will stay the same or probably even increase . different reason such a the need for mobility , improved road condition , a better economic situation in developing country and the growth rate of the population will lead to a constant or even higher amount of car . first of all , mobility is one of the most important point for modern society . also in twenty year , this wish for mobility will still going on . people still want to be mobile , to reach everything within a shortest time period . as it is , car are the fastest medium of transportation , at least for short distance . thus , the majority will not be willing to give up his or her car only to decrease pollution . in switzerland , there is a lively discussion about improving and extending road to absorb all the traffic . also in other country , these measurement are of high interest . if there are more and better planned road and therefore le traffic jam , even more people will think about buying a car and using it to reach for example their work place . considering developing country , they hopefully will have improved their situation in twenty year at least a little bit . less poeple will live in poverty , and more will be part of the middle class . this positive development also lead to a higher demand of car , because a car is a symbol for having enough money . in developing country it is even more important for people to show how much they earn and therefore to climb the social ladder . finally , the simple fact that the world population in the whole is growing indicates that there will be more car owner in the future than now . the growing demand for mobility in western country a well a the longer the more in developing country lead to a higher number of car in the world . this development is supported by the fact that a lot of country are thinking of expanding their road system . thus , it can not be thought about a decreasing amount of car in the future .
