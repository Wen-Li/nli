young people enjoy life more than older people do from my point of view , i belive the young and old people enjoy they life the same . there is time for everything and a moment . to understand people behaiviors , we need to see , where are they come from , what are they like to do , social and personal interest . for example ; i born in costa rica , small country where young and old people enjoy soccer , and dancing , and are no different from others people or culture around the world . younger people is more active and careless , they no have many responsabilities , so they use all they free or spare time , doing many thing , such a : a ) - sport , b ) - travel , c ) - dating , d ) - working part time , e ) - study. , hoping that something really work out for them and have some fun at the time . many like my self , take some adventure and leave the country , try to find new horizonts and adventure . older people the still have fun , and they enjoy they life in they way , becuse usully older peolpe have more responsabilities , such a family , child , full time work or carry , they have le time to do what they really like , but that doesnt meant that they no enjoy they life . the meaning of enjoy life is in everyone , we all enjoy our life in so many differents way , and a long we belive that is correct , is ok . be young or old is depent in each person , some people young are like old people , and some old people are like young people . enjoy life is a present from god , and we need to be gracefull just for be alive and see a much a we can of this work . enjoy life is no matter to be young or old , enjoy life is live life .
