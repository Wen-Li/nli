most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , i personally agree with this statement because the company developes advertisement in order to sale and it implies many time lie about the product . the company developes advertisement in order to sale and it implies , many time , lie about the quality and advantage of this product and the product brings many people who is dissapointed about it . the company do not aware about the risk of this item because the company could lose many profit and also people could demand them for this . furthermore , the company which develope the advertisement should have a rule in order to control the quality of product because they could be demanded also for this item . i think that is an ethic problem , the company should have ethical class in order to avoid this behavior . many company have a lot of quality measure in order to avoid this problem , for example , a company which develope make up have a lot of test before the product wa saled , this is due to the make up could cause many problem in the skin such a allergy reaction or eruption . moreover a company which developes medicine must to be very carefull testing the product before the sale . however i think the most of the make up producer lie about the advantage of their product because they have to overrate the product in order to be saled . finally , i think that the customer should demand any time they buy something which is saled a a wonderfull thing and it is not a wonderfull thing because with this measure we can stop the company which announce the best product and they are not . we should demand also the advertisement company because they do not have ethical value .
