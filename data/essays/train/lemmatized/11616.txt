new thing gives success many people believe that if a person want to be successful , he/she should try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i agree with it . although there are many different definations on the term `` successful people '' , i believe that if a person doe not try new thing , he/she would never be successful . there are many successful people a example for this statement , such a albert enstein and bill gates . albert enstein is one of the most famous and revolutionary physists in history . what ha he done , is used his radicular thought on situation with speed of light to contrast with sir isac newton 's theory , which is called classical physic and contains most basic theoris on force at that time . with this contrast , albert enstein established new physical theory . by taking a try on new thought , enstein had physical subject step forward to new generation , and himself became a successful person . he ha said : `` imegination is more important than knowledge . '' as he said , without this creative thought , physic would never have a progress . another successful person i want to show here is one of the richest person in current world , whose name is bill gates . he is the ceo of the biggest software campany , microsoft . with his great sense on the development of computer , he really pass a gate toward bill . when he wa still in his teen age , computer wa really a rare thing . ignors the objection by his classmate , bill quit harvert university and take this new thing , and also risk . of course , if he ha continuoued his way in havert , he may become a nice lawyer . however , to him , nice mean nothing . he doe not want to be normal . by running personal computer programming business , which is a new task with new risk at that time , he successed . trying new thing give him reward much more then any one can image . not only albert enstein and bill gates are the successful people who have taken new thing and risk , the way of other successful people like plank or schrodinger to success are also trying new thing . different people have different way to success , but successful people always try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
