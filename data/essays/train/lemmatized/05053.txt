where are you going grandpa ? shopping , golfing or maybe to a cruise on a yacht . that is what i usually get when i am really bored of studing or tired of endless working hour while my grandfather or even my father are getting ready to go on some sort of selfpleasing activity . i believe old people enjoy life more than youth or even teenager do with all the study and work hour or the restriction forced by parent . it is so hard for a young family member to enjoy life a much a elder do . as a begining , old people dont have any kind of study , midterm or final to care about . they dont have to spend hour studing , going to school , attending class or even buying book . they have alot of free time they can spend in any selfpleasing activity that brings happiness and joy to them . in addition to that most of old people do not have a job or a career to care about . most of them are either business owner or unemployed at all which is evern better they have nothing to distract them from having fun . not like young people who spends between forty and fifty hour each week at work . they have much more time to enjoy it . also , financial wise young people have alot of bill and payment . after school fee , rent and maybe car morgage their is not enough money left to spend for fun or enjoyment . most of the time elder people dont have these kind of concern finaly , the limitation and restriction forced by the family on their kid donot leave much space for fun . you are not supposed to go their or you are not allowed to be out that late , thats usually what a young member of the family gonna endup getting . not liek elder one with total freedom . for all the spare time they have and the avilability of money or abscence of limitaions there is no dought older people enjoy life much more than youn one do \
