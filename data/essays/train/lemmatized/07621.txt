yes i agree with the statemet given above . all the middle class people ha going to buy a car in now a day because at now a day the car are going very cheep and the bank are offering no interist on the some car of very cheep . so by taking loan of the bank and there are going to buy a car . so by going on a car there are more advantage . those are listed below 1 ) by driving the car we can not fall on the either side of balancing 2 ) during the rainy season we can rest our head inside the car 3 ) in the laxuary car of such a benz we can safe our life by protecting the ballons in the car 4 ) when we are going to the function the car are to be very good startagy of the person . 5 ) by using the car a more than ( i.e more than nine member ) can travel at a time to go from one place to the another place . 6 ) by traveling from one place to the aqnother place the time may taken very le because the speed of the car will be very fast . 7 ) in the car there is a luxury life and we can not be very struss because if we feel not comfort we will stop the car and we will be relaxed and we go on journey . so by this there are so many advantage by using the car . but the people of the middle class is to offer the car by using the loan and there are going to buy . so here there is a propability to grow up the car in the forwoding of the fast twenty year . so at present there are many car and these are going to be on the road . so i think that the car in the froword twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today in the city .
