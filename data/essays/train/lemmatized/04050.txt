i completely agree with the statement of ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' for several reason . the first and foremost one would be the safety and comfort offered by your companiens in group , especially when traveling to new place farwaway from home town . in case of any unexpected emergency or untoward event happening on travel , you have a gropu to take care of your need and shre the burden and sterss . secondly , the guided tour would provide right information about theplaces and one can get more precise information about the place visited for the first time . also , a guided tour in a gropu is more economical over personal tour with or without a guide . the guide are trained to perform the tour on a timely manner while explainig the fact in detail . when you are in a group , you would spend le money on travel , accomodation , and money spent on engaging a travel guide . tough it may not be possibl to spend their time a one wish , while travelling , it provides the opportunity to ineract with other people in group and know more about the place than it would be other wise . i provide a typical example , to justify my opinion . it is about my travel in india last year . i have to spend about $ 150 to go to a historic place all by myself in a taxi , while it cost only a fraction of that , i.e $ 5 if i choose to travel by public transport that wa available . i choose to go by taxi a i wa alone and afraid of travelling in publice transport system along with the many local , for fear of isolation a i do n't under stanfdthe la thus in conclusion , a guide tour in group is , safe , economical and time saving .
