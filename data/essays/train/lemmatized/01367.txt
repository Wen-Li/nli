in order to be successful , do we need to try new thing ? or , should we stick to what we know how to do best ? do n't we have an intirinsic cruiosity ? so , what make u frightened to try new thing or should we be brave enough to chose not to do what we already know best ? could we imagine any progression if we did not try any new thing ? as a successful commander sir winston chirchill ha a saying : `` the first of all value of man is courage '' . i agree that in order to be succesful people should be brave and try new thing . let u first look at to the history and pick up mr. edison . he invented the lamb after tryind 2000 different way leading him to dissappointment . he tried `` 2000 new thing '' and came up with the lamb . likewise , we can consider darwin and his theory against creavitism . besides , being historically proved our intrinsic cruiosity always lead u to try new thing . people always wonder about what we do not have or what we have never seen . we wonder what it feel to be popstar , or we go on a vacation to see a part of the world . since it is our nature why should we resist it . it is like to be a carnivoriuos loin ! can you imagine such a lion survive or become successful . in order to be successful people should try new thing .
