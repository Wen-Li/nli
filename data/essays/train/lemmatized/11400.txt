traveling is an oportunity for sharing with people , but mostly to discover wonderful thing on land . if you go with a a group of friend , it turn a really enjoyful experience and if you decide to be guided by tour guide probably you will know new beautiful place . however not always the tour guide show all the place to meet so in that case , is better to try guiding yourself along with your friend . usually the tour guide have an specific tour and they did not change it so often , also they have specific activity to develop within your group . so , when you are being guided you must follow all the time the tour guide and you could not explore yourself other wonderful place . traveling in group without a tour guide , allows you and your friend to discover by yourselves the wonderful part that a new place have . also , you can surprise with other thing you find special , so i consider that it is better to travel in group , therefore enjoying with friend , but you must experience by yourselve at the time yo make a tour with a tour guide .
