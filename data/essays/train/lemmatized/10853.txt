i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . instead , i feel it the other way round . its the old peole who have an opportunity to enjoy their life rather than the young one . there are various reason which justify my position . first , a young guy would always have a lot to think . he would be worried about his career . he know it a crucial time for him which shall shape his future . he spends most of his time planning and thinking . a lot of his effort go into this . since , an old person would be through with this phase of his life , he will not have any tension related to career a such . he ha achieved what he wanted to and could now enjoy his success . secondly , when a person is young he 's know that he ha to take care of his family . he know he is the bread earner . this fact of life doe n't allow him to savor his youth . he spends his time working in office or runninng business to cater to his familiy 's need . on the other hand older people donot have to work . they have retired and free to enjoy their life . third , a young person is still learning to survive in the world . he doe n't have all the wisdom and exerience to deal with the difficult situation which an older person would have . from childhood to youth , he learns how to adjust , deal with relationship and handle pressure . for the young , the life is full of hardship and he 's learing to find his way through . forth , it a time when a person get married . it 's said , a right marriage can make you and a wrong one can destroy . the person need to develop that level of maturity and understanding to deal with his spouse . he doe compromise , making it a not so easy life for him . on the other hand , having lived so many year together , older people have developed that understanding . this leaf them with a good partner to enjoy their life with . undoubtely , according to me , when a person is young he 's building a platform for his older life . a platform on which when he grows old , he can live and relish life and can enjoy thing which he missed when he wa young .
