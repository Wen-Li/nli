i disagree with the statement saying , `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' i believe in the other way around stating , `` it 's better to specialize in one specific subject rather than go for many academic subject . '' i am going to provide some of my personal experience with specific example in the passage . personally , i feel i have been off track since my schooling a i needed to go for many academic subject . i used to have knowledge on various academic topic every year . once i got into higher study , some of my subject were of no use and i wa made to stress only on certain subject . from then on i never practically or theoritically implemented those subject which i left off long way back . if i were to be specialized in any one subject i would have been a more knowledgeable person than i am today . secondly , having specialization in any one specific subject can build a person in a right way . the person could be able to make a research in the subject he learnt right from his childhood . it make him more motivated and result in an obvious expansion of the subject whereas in having knowledge in many academic subject could really limit a person 's true potential and ability because there will be a time factor in this case and the person may not be able to make up the time for research purpose . finally , another advantage of specializing in one specific subject can make le burden on the child who are made to carry bundle of book daily to school and college . studying only one subject can make this work a bit easier . more over the student can spend their time equally in theory a well a practical class which is more important for a human brain to work efficiently . there must be more practical knowledge of the learnt subject rather than only book knowledge . the student must be able to apply what ever he learnt in his/her practical life . i would like to conclude by stressing my point that it is advisable to have knowledge in a specific subject rather than opting for many academic subject . more over by specializing in any one subject of student 's interest or choice , it help development of research in vast educational field . there is more scope for individual development here .
