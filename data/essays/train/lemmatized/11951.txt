some people disagree with the statement most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i guess the people are just lucky . most of the time the good look much better than they really are . for instences , when you go try to taste a new menu of food , or when you buy fornitures . for the first exsample , when you watch the advertisement about the fast food on tv , it look flesh , and look homemade . however when you try the menu at the fast food restaurant , the vesitable is not flesh , and they do not taste the same a the tv sais . second , you see fornitures on the catalogu . they look very gorgious and beutiful . however when you go to the store to see the fornitures that were on the catalogu , they look so different . they look cheap , the color is different , and the shape are a little different . i think the display on the catalogu make them very fasinating . although most adveetisement make product seem much better than they raelly are . they complimant about the good too much on tv , and also they take very good picture of them .
