i disagree with the statement . i think in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . the new technology ha been developted and will be in very high speed and in very varied way that people use the car more in their life . the car doe n't mean not only tool of movement for people any longer but their important partner . you may have used the car for commuting your office in every weekday or going out to visit the new place with your family or going to shopping with your friend . and the techology showed the answer to our nees in many scene of them . and now you have some benefit of the new techology , for example , the navigation system show the situationof traffic jam or short cut on your way to work . you are not afraid of the new roard which you never have visited before because you can have more information or the right place where you want to arrive at . you may do n't have to open the door of your key when you 're bring many stuff from your shopping if you have an intellegent key ( called `` keyless entry '' ) . people can feel the convenience with car more and that will a essential part of our life . sometimes we have heard the negative aspect of car . for example , car accident or the influence on the environment . i think the new techonoly can also slove some of the problem , the automatic driving system or the sense that can find out the distance between the car or internal camera on the car can help reducing the rate of accident in the future . and the study about hybrid car or new furuel must be more increased in many country with their own nature resource . in twenty year , people use the car more in their life in more safely and convenietely
