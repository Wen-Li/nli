considering the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' , i feel that the statement would be much better changing it to the past . the way we live now and the way we will be living in the future may change . we know that science ha developed a lot and everyone is aware of the recent development . vehicles which are running on the fuel ( petrol ) now , may not work on the same grid . latest invention like electric , hydrogen car have come into existence . many facility like charging point availability in the petrol bunk is done . this rapid growth result in the much more invention and development . people who go for the economic and best , will be sure of purchasing these sort of car . since initial purchasing amount will be quite low , where maintainence cost is lowered , with cheap recharging of the engine at near by location . people generally have awareness of the pollution in the future and have concern towards it . so opting these car is favourable and helping . comparing the past , present and future , we know the olden day car were very expensive . but now many people could buy them . since the car which run on electric charging were cheap , people will be buying them too . infact we may see the increase in car in the future due to this reason . hence , even though the number of car have increased , they are not creating the pollution problem . the statement mentioned will go well with the past circumstance , not with the future .
