young people are majorly useful to build a nation . they play a vital role in economic development . they have to build community to help the nation . unfotunately , they are not showing interest to participate in a community . they dont have time to help their own community . community mean that discussing their view in one place . this could be developed through the internet or by the club . here they will communicate with their colleague and freinds . when there is more discussion there will be more development . the discussion should be healthy . in community people exchange their view . they wil gain more knowledge with in a time . but unfortunately they are spending their time to help their community . this is loss to a nation . for example , a computer engineer have time to help their community but they are wasting their time in consumig liquor , party , and sleeping . this situation ocurs because of working overtime . they have lot of work to do , lot of competition and new task to be done . they can spare half an hour to help their community . they are not caring it . every one ha become selfish . another example is in the case of a doctor . doctor are gained mainly through their community . even they have more to work but they should spend some time in helping their community . they have become busy in their work . they are taking more rest . if this is the case nation have to face severe problem . young poeple should be made help their community . it is the respnsibility of the government to encourage them . they can encourage through news paper , advertisement and movie . they should be told the advantage in helping their community . ofcourse they are inspired quickly and positively . in coclusion , young people have to spend time to help their community . if this is not the case they will loose communication which may effect the nation economy growth . they have to realise in the importance of helping their community .
