i have worked for a long time a a researcher in my university 's laboratory . what i have learnt during that and other experience is that only people taking risk and trying new thing are successfull . threfore there are at least a couple of reason according to which i agree with the statement . the first one is that people trying to explore new thing most of the time give a different point of view to all the other . for example , when einstein ha introduced his theory of relativity he ha become one of the most appreciated scientist of the world . his theory ha opened new research field and it ha been the result of a deep research conducted making new assumption , trying new thing and taking the risk of being criticized . the second reason is that who try new thing is in general a very particular person and in many occasion i feel like them . during my experience in the laboratory , for instance , i wa used to get in a deep state of concentration , eliminating all the external stimulus i could have . few month after i have finished my experience in the laboratory , i have read some biography of famous and successfull people and i have understood that they all have this attitude to isolate themselves from the outside . concluding i can say that i agree with the statement because i think that people trying new thing give ever a new point of view to mankind and because sometimes i feel like one of them . i hope that in the future i will do something by which i will remembered a a successfull person .
