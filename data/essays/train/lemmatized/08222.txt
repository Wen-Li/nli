no , i do n't agree completely with the statement that in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i have many reason that support my argument . firstly , there is no immediate reason why people are going to do away with car in another twenty year . car is one of the most commonly used automobile these day , human use it for many of their daily purpose and a whole industry thrives on this . and car is a symbol of status in some of the developing country even today . and the way technology is progressing by leap and bound , one can only imagine the various level of comfort and advantage a car provides in contrast to any other vehicle . but , a any study on the problem plaguing the road transport would rightly indicate , car are creating some problem that may prompt anyone to suggest their ` extinction ' . there might be several reason for the author to give this statement , some positive and the rest indicating the ill effect of usage of car . one reason that might have prompted the author to state that the fate of car in use is going to sealed , in the next twenty year , is that nowadays we are trying to find alternate mean of road transport , because of various problem a car pose today . definitely , a huge amount of research is going on this direction , to find better and better mean of transport , that will subside or eliminate the use of car and their corrent problem . but noone would disagree that at the same time , lot of effort are going on to address the current problem car are posing , and thus making car a better vehicle . coming to the problem car are posing these day , the first thing that evinces is the pollution caused . automobiles cause a lot of pollution and car do form a lion 's share of this . but , research is giving sufficient attention to this , alternate way to avoid the use of petrol and deisel a the fuel for car and other automobile , are being studied and experimented . we already have some car running on the road using solar energy or biodiesel for fuel , which though are in their infant stage , provide attractive prospect for car in the future . moreover , these alternative may , who know , eventually make the car a better vehicle than what it is at present . another reason is possibly the traffic problem posed by the increasing car . governments are encouraging people to let their car rest in the garrages , atleast on some day of a week , so that both pollution and traffic problem can be attenuated . but even these problem plague the whole of automobile industry , and the only way to control this is by having proper strategy for all the automobile , not car alone . further , an attempt to amelirate the current situtation of road traffic should work towars making the roadway more effective a a whole by better management and other mean . just trying to avoid the usage of car wo n't do . thus , from some of the plausible reason put forward in the above argument , it can be said that car are not going anywhere in the next twenty year , but they are going to have the same dominant role they are playing now in the road transport . further , i suggest that if the tone with which the author ha given this statement would have helped much more in the analysis .
