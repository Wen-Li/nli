it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with the author 's statement . i have a few example in my mind for which i can support the author 's statement . the example that i would like to sight are a follows . firstly , it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept rather than simply learning the fact because the knowledge achieved will be true knowledge and can be of more useful in practical application of one own life by understanding the the idea and concept throughly . for example if we learn a formula in mathematics class just a a fact it will be useless where a if you understand the idea and concept behind that formula it will be of much practical use . so it is necessary for each and every student to understand the idea and concept , without this one ca n't be aware of it practical application and his knowledge gained by learning a fact may be useless after day . hence it is necessary to understand the concept and idea throughly . secondly , it is very important to understand the idea and concept in the modern competitive world . as the competition is growing day by day it ha immense effect on understanding the concept and present them whenever it is needed . if a student merely learns the fact then he will be no where to compete with the student who understands the idea and concept and present them in a great manner whenever needed . so it is necessary to understand the idea and concept to withstand the competition in modern world . furthermore it ha many advantage in the carrer of a student who do this work perfectly by bunderstanding the idea and concept which will be helpful for a student to have a sound knowledge of the particular topic . thus it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
