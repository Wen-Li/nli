i would like to go against the statement that `` there will be fewer car in future than they are today '' . i have many fact to support my view . firstly , according to the news promoted by the news channel , the number of car that are being purchased is increasing day by day . this , clearly show that more and more people are willing to by car . secondly , the number of new model of car that are being introduced in the market is rapidly increasing . we have a new model of a car in every month ( approximately ) . no company will waste a huge amount of money for their reaserch and development , in order to design new car , if they feel that the usage of car is going to decrease in the near future . thirdly , the two-wheelers can carry a maximum of three people , provided the third person is an infant , or is unusually thin . therefore , for family with four or more member in it , there is no other mean of transport except for the car . ofcourse , the trasportation provided the the government will do , but most of the people do not prefer to go in it , becaue , having a vehicle of their own is a matter of prestige and to them , and is definitely more comfortable . forthly , the car are useful in long journies , unlike the two-wheeler . the other source of transportation may be the aeroplane and the train which are more costly . therefore , by travelling in car we will be comfortable , and it is cost effective also . in the busy life of metropolitan city , the car can be used not only for ourselves , but they can also help an individual to make money for himself , by making it a taxi . he can drop people at different place and make money for himself . unless and until an other vehicle is discovered , which can satisfy all tha point mentioned above , the demand for car will not reduce . since the probability for such a vehicle to be discovered is very le , we can say that the number of car being used will not decrease in the next twenty year .
