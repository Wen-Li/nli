i disagree with this statement . when you see the evolution of the number of car in twenty year , is constantly growing . that is why i do not think that that in twenty year after there will be fewer car in use . car represents one of the most important product of consumption . the majority of people in developed country ha a car because it is confortable , easy to go everywhere and mainly to go at work . in country like united states , car are necessary because distance are very big . many family in united states have two car and americans generally learn very early to drive . the main problem of car is that it consumes petroleum . this energy is more and more difficult to find and it cost a lot of money . car represents too one of the major cause of pollution and which provoques environement 's degradation . so with all this factor can we considers that in the fututre there will be le car in use than today ? i do not thin so . car 's ingeneers invent prototype of car which will be differents than today 's car . and i think that in the future there will be car with another type of energy like hydrogen . so a car'constructors find solution to make non pollution car
