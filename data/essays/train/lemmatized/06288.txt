l do think the route to success is by continuously trying new thing and taking risks. l still remember what my mother had told me `` failure is the way to success '' . a lot of great invention were created because the inventor willing to take risk , for example the airplane . if the scientist did n't try to fly over and over again , we will not be able to enjoy the flying nowadays . or if they were not that enthusiastic about trying new thing or new technology we will not be able to use computer now while we are doing the tset . while we are talking about new thing , let explore them a little bit . according to my dictionary , news are advice , environment , group of people , whichever can lead me to success if l know how to handle them appropriately . by saying new thing to successful people , of course , we are talking about taking risk , doing something that we may never do before , trusting people we might not know , taking advice that we might not accept or even not possible to happen in the real world . l think keep onces mind open to new thing is very important . and never confine yourself to the old school . do n't be nervous of taking risk , neverthe le always prepare to fail then one day you will successful .
