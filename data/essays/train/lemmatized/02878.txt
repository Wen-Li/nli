in this era , where it is possible to underline an increase of the production , most advertisement can make product seem much better than they really are . this is a result of a great number of product that the owner of the company ha to sell to the consumer . for this reason i agree with that statement . i think that , in this period , everyone who have to sell anythinks want to show it in a better way than it really is . is possible to find a product that have a very low price but at the same time it is problably not a very good item . now where internet ha increase it importance in selling product , all the people try to show them in a fantastic state with a beautifull picture and one very accurate description . for example one year ago i bought a support for mobile phone for the car . when it arrived at home i observed it and i noted that wa not well a in the computer . the material that it wa made wa very very bad and an optional item , that i bought with the support , did n't arrive at home . it ' s possible to find a lot of advertisement on television that show all the item in a very beautifull way and i think that anyone have to pay attention before buying a particular product . i think is better to buy an item of a brand that is known . in this way you are sure to buy a good item event if it price could be expensive . the most important brand have a great experiece in working and they use all kind of machine or material they need . in this capitalistic era infact there are many people that open an industry to selling a product . to have a very low cost they use a material that is not good . this is occurred for example in cina where the price of the product are very cheap . i had a lot of experience in buying a product that are not good a they are showed , for this reason i suggest to buy a very famous product !!
