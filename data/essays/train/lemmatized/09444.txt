i agree with the statement `` it is more important to student to understand than it is for them to learn fact '' . as we can need some prior knowledge likeconstruction , working , advatages and disadavntages of a particular instrument to handle and operate a highly sophisticated instrument other wise it can cause either false result or some time it may also effect the working condition of the instrument . not only in practicals but also in theory of various subject like mathematics we require the basic concept and idea a without knowing the concept of right formula in right situation we never get an appropriate result . when we take an example of a medical student if he doe n't know about the basic anatomical term like superior , inferior , posterior , anterior , dorsal , ventral , superficicial , deeper , distal , proximal , phrenology , cardiology , heamatology , dermatology , like basic concept are basic for understanding the physiology and also the pathological condition of a particular part or organ . coming to the pharmacy without having the basic knoledge about formulation we never develope a new formula where we need the concept of ingredient present in the formulation . in physic we never understand the how to solve a problem in force or work or power chaper until we have a basic knowledge of the concept of newton 's law of motion . not in only in a particular subject like physic , chemistry , biology we need basic of the subject in every field . even though it is easy to understand and remember the fact very easily than learning the the main idea and concept it is suggestable learn the basic idea and concept .
