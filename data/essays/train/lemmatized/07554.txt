the informer story i agree with most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for two reason , first , i work in advertising and second understand about how people perception of product it affected by advertising . because i work for an advertising agency i know that we develope advertising campaings that make the product more appealing to the consumer so the fell more attracted to buy them . i also know that some product had not special benefit but thanks to advertising we create a new world around them so people see the product a a new one or improved . the second reason it because we , in advertising know how to affect people perception of a product . so we use advertising to change this perception allways trying to create the ilussion that the product it better than it really is , so people go right away and buy it . there are regulation among comercial comunications that keep advertiser to tell lie about product or it benefit , so it in our hand to create the new reality of the broduct without telling lie , and that is crativity . in conclusion advertising make better look product but without making them a liers . everything depends on consumer perception .
