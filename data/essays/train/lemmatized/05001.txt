i agree the statement successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only donig what they already know how to do well . some people say successful people tend to be conservertive and not to change the environment because they do not want to lose the thing they already have . however , i do not agree these kind of opinion thorugh my own experience meeting successful peeple and reading book about successful people . for example , one of my father 's friend , who he wa very successful a being cfo in the largest advertising company in japan , started running the organic food restaurant for elder people after retireing his job . another example , some famous japanese traditional dancing artist started her own international trading company which introduces japanese traditional gadget to the uk . though she had no experience and knowledge about business . i think there are three common chacteristics in successful people . first , they are always interested in and want to know the new information and intelligence he or she have never touched . second , they think one of the important objective in their life is to meet and make friend with a lot of people a many a they can . third , they think progress and inovation is the only way they keep their success . i think almost all the successful people i know hold these common characteristic and these point make successful people more powerful and attractive . in concequence of this circulation , successful people want to find some new challenge even though they have to take risk . therefore , i think successful people may want to try new thing and enter new environment to find new opportunites to make them more successful .
