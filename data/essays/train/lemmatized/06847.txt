i agree on that in the future ( around twenty year ) car will be fewer , because other kind of transportation will improve and will be more easyer . for instant using train with a fast speed and ha many different station will make man be more comfurtabule using it rather then his/her oun car . also bus can give a big comfurtabule life for peaple . because peaple will not have to think about parking or even taking care of thier car or any other careness . in addition , number of peaple will increase in the future , that will cause a lot of traffic and air pullotion . so i think using other transportation other thene car will give a big help for peaple to get to other place without any problem a mentioned above . therfor , i beleive human will begin to egnore car and try to depend on more easeir and more comfurtabule tranportations to live a better , comfurtabule , cleaner life .
