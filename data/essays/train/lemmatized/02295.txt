i beleive that a person face all sort of risk to become a successful man . without taking any risk it is impossible to achieve greater height and become a successful person . therefore i strongly agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . '' today we are enjoying a lot of invention and discovery made by successful people who took risk and even sacrificed their life . for example aeroplane , space craft etc . if the right brother would have thought why to take risk and invent an aircraft , we would not have travelled from one country to other country . same thing with aircraft people would never been landed on moon . all these we are enjoying today are the risk taken by successful people to invent new thing rather than doing what they already know . i have my own experience regarding this , i have a stage fear and i do n't participate in any task that involve a large group of audience . when iam doing my graduation , there wa a science fare competition going on in my city , the one who stand first will be given scolarship for graduation . i wa inspired by my father , he is very courageous , infact he worked for the army . i took risk and participated in the fare by displaying and explaining how various stimulant like agonist and antagonist act on frog 's heart . i stood first in the competition and from then onwards , i started participating in all competition . i beleive one should take risk and enjoy the fruit of success . taking risk also involves money . investing a huge amount of money in a business , for which success is unpredictable is a type of risk . my uncle invested a huge amount on his software business . he worked very hard to invent new software and became a successful man in notime . now he is able to provide job for hundered 's of people . i finally conclude that , success depends on trying new thing by taking risk rather than doing what we know .
