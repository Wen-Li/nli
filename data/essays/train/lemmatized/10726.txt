i agree with the statement . it is because only new thing can brings more chance for people to earn more money . doing what is already well-known will just increase the competition of job . as a result , the profit will be limited . the more successful running a company , the more successful a person is . nowadays , thing change very fast . those people with creative thinking can also earn a lot of money because they can think a lot forward than others . they know what people will need in the future time and they start running a new company about this . when others notice that it is a chance to earn big profit , those clever people have already lead in front . a successful company should have different type of business . if the clever person can lead lot and lot of business in front of others , he will then be very successful . it is because he ha already earn a very big profit when other company are still doing the old thing . we say a person is successful becasue he is clever and do something that others can not do . if the clever person doe not start a new business , how can others know that the business is also a good chance to earn money . when you do something that follow the other , no matter how good you do , you are still not successful . when a person start a new business , it is very dangerous because nobody ha tried it before . a successful person can success because he know how to solve the problem and reduce risk . a person fail to start new business is not successful because he cannnot manage the risk . a successful person must try new thing and know how to take the risk . in conclusion , people who try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well are successful . those people are cleverer than others , they can think more forward than others and they can think something that others can not imagine . if a person can do them , he is successful .
