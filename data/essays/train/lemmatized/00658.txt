there are many young and old people who are enjoying their life in different way . however , there are people who believe that the only time to enjoy the life is with early year . i disagree with this statement because i think that older people can enjoy there life more than young people . for example , i met and got to know some older people here in canada after coming from my home country . i found out that these older people have older body but their main are still fresh . they want to do many thing that they were not able to do when they were younger . as an illustration , reg is 75 year old and he go to the florida every year to watch some sport that he enjoys . besides , he drive his car from sarnia ontario where his ha his house to the florida , it is a long trip still for young people but he is able . by the same token , some older people have enough money to pay to enjoy their life . these people have worked hard all their life so after doing this for many year , they think about start doing something different life spend time traveling aroun the world . in addition , these people want to spend more time with their family instead of spending time working . another fact about this topic is that older people can teach young people like me to enjoy the life . i try to spend time with older people because they tell me about their experience trought their life , for example i meet once a week with an older man who ha a grat sent of humor . i try to learn from him many thing that i can use in my life . in conclusion , young people should try to follow the way how some older people spent their time many year ago . these older people always have something to share or give in order for younger people to learn how to spend the time in a correct direction . besides , these older people do n't want young people to waste their time in activity that can spoil their life i
