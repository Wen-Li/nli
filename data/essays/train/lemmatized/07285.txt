i think that is more important to understand idea and concept than learning fact , because when you just know fact , you do not use your brain . you only use your knowledge and not your comprehension of the thing . i think that it is more important to understand idea and concept because you can resolve a lot of thing with just your understanding of a problem for example . if a person explain to you how something work , but you are not able to understand , you will not be able to make it work . i think that sometimes we give too much importance to how a person know a lot of thing ( fact ) . because when we arive in real life , i mean in the street , it is more important to be able to count for example , and that is not to learn fact , it is to understand how we do it . i will do a example . in math , when the teacher teach you how to do something , you can not just learn the answer , you have to understand how you can arrive at this answer . i always said that the intelligence , it is not just to know a lot of thing but also to know to think and to understand how we can do the thing . when we look at the person who reach the top of the society , it is the person who learn fact but the most important , the person who understand the idea and the concept of more thing that they can . i think that when we go at school , it is to arrive in real life like at a job and to accomplish great thing , so if we want to do great thing , you have to be the most balance person that you can . and my thinking is that it is more important to understand idea and concept more thant learn fact .
