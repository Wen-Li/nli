i can say i agree with this topic but i also can say i do not agree with this topic . i 'm not sure about the point of part of it say `` car in use '' . car is one of the most familiar good that we need in day life . we also can use bus or subway even the air plane but we always need a car when you try to go somewhere , even with your family . and poeple actually think they need a car for some reason . this cause horrible traffic on the road all the time also with bad gas from the car it destroies enviroment these day . we always want more comfortable life style with better quality that we could have . now day car is pretty much affordable good . even though there are alot of expensive car . but i 'm pretty sure about the number of a car for each person who ha the car would never get discrease but not everybody would drive their car everyday . it is already enough that we going through right now with horrible traffic and bad air . i do n't have my own car yet but i see my parent , they have their own car but they do n't go out driving with their car all the time . sometimes subway is much faster than driving a car without being tired . basicially what i 'm saying is , the number of car in use would never be discreased but it doe n't mean that traffic would get worse than this or everybody would n't drive their car and only start using a bus or subway . about the bad gas from car , alot of technicsions are working on making non-gas car . for example the car could run with sunshine or even water etc . actually i heard some one made that kind of car already but it 's not that common for everybody . i 'm sure there will be alot of poeple who would drive that kind of car . but i also hope we make better situation to use a bus or subway for going everywhere . that would reduce the number of car in use for sure .
