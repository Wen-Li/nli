most advertisement make product seem much better than they realy are . i totaly agree with this statement , most of advertisement give the consumer the advantage that they can get by using the product , and they try to avoid mentioning the disadvantage or the misuse or side-effects . to give a life example of that statments , i will give an example from my personal field which is pharmacy . patrients or consumers in other word like most of medical company prefer to address them , see the advertisement on tv , or newspapper . and easily get convenced with the mediaction because of the following . first , they use easy langauge and something most of u suffering from like pain , insomnia and syptoms of allergy , second , they keep repeating the advertisement over and over agian . even some people get convenced that they have problem in sleeping although they do n't and how the medication is effective and safe . i know one of my patient , that she forced her physicain to call me at the pharmacy to give me a phone - prescription for sleeping pill that she previously saw on tv . although , she wa not suffering from any sleeping problem just she liked the advertisement and the music on it and the colour of the sleeping pill ( it wa nice shiny pink colour by the way ) and i say forced him becuase some could say '' he ha the right to refuse . he is a doctor '' . yes , that is correct . but she mentioned that she will go to every single doctor other than him to prescripe the medication for her in case he will refuse to do so . and simply he doe not want to lose bussiness . third , the side-effects of the medication are wrtten in small letter in the end of the advertisement or mentioned real fast that , the customer can not follow what wa exactly said and the most important thing a i mentioned earlier . it ha to be in the end of the advertisement , so no one can pay attention . we can use the example that i just gave about the medication and the advertisement and thier way on every single aspect and field on adverisement bussiness . to conclude and summarize , i agree with the statement saying that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . for the previously mentioned reason .
