i agree with the above statement , a student these day are more focusing on idea and concept rather than on fact . i go with it because to learn anything you need to understand the idea and concept it is because fact are known by everyone but it upto student to understand concept . i want to give an clear example to support it a we are in the development side it important to know about computer . because they are a important and necessary tool in today world people know about it evidently but you need to understand the idea and concept behind it . everyone know about it fact it only not required to operate it we need to know the idea behind it . so , it more important to the student to know what lie beneath . i also suggest student to know fact but rarther these wont fulfill the requirement . student must know about idea and concept because is help him to gather more knowledge and can easily operate them in an proper way . simply understanding idea wont help them a because they need to implement them in practical to get the perfect use of it . as in many case student are not eager to know the idea and conepts they tend to face huge complexity in life , like in any product we need to understand it idea by mainly implementing them . we can make people know about idea and concept they need separate class to know them . likewise i give another example people tend to believe on fact which are given or described in ancient time the story from past did n't had proper idea behind them they simply know the fact and doe n't show interest on idea behind them . like the story , myth , the story of legends they do n't require any idea it 's just a fact we need to accept . in the later part of the conclusion i want to give my opinion that student pay more attention on idea and concept than it is them to learn about fact .
