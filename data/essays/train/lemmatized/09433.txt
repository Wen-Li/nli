i agree with people try new thing and take risk . successful people 's method are only referance to get an amergency situation . even if we are failed , we have to try to get a new thing . this is a real life . if people do n't try anything about something , everything will be the same over and over . also , all of people will follow someone who did it . if so , people want to get something oneself without another people . everthing will be getting to mass up and lazy . when people try to do new thing , people realize something about result . it doe n't matter of good thing or not . of course , successful people tried new thing . we have to always find out by oneself . otherwise , we are sick and tired of living in the world .
