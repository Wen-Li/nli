old people enjoy life more than younger people do . i think age of people doe not affect the enjoy that they can take from life in a negative way . the most important fact that affect the level of the enjoy they get from life is the characteristic of people . according to me , the enjoy depends on that the person is social or not . a young person who is not social may not enjoy from life a older people do . a social person at older age can be a member of social club , attent to touristic journey or join to social activity . however , unsocial young person can stay at home and do nothing except eating , drinking and sleeping which are only the basic activity of a human being can do . an advantage of old people posse in enjoying more than young people is the age . age can be thought a a limiting fact at first ; nevertheless , if we thought more we can realise that it is not . young people should work hard to earn their life in economic mean and for their career . they should also spend their time with their family . in short , they have limited time for too much acivities or duty . in contrast , old people have no limiting time problem . they do not to think about their life , their work and their family , since their life is at a stable phase . on the otherhand , young people have a lot of stress source which decrease or limit the enjot they get from life . moreover , their economic status maybe better than the young people . they can have enough money to spend in social activity . another advantage of old people for enjoying life more can be experience . as they live more than young people , they can easily find anything to enjoy . for instance , they can go to a holiday instead of palying card game with their friend . however , one can say that there are several disadvantage for old people to enjoy from life . health and old age are inhibiting agent of enjoying life . old people can have sickness more than younger people . in addition , old age can restrict them to do certain activity like sport activity . nevertheless , an old but social person can find alternative activity according to his or her age . in conclusion , i believe that the age of a people doe not defines the level of enjoy that they can get from life . furthermore , old age can provide more opportunity to people to enjoy more from life .
