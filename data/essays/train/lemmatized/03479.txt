i stand behind of the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . there are three reason : changed society , health and internet . first , comparing to some decade before to present , the society ha completely changed . old timer were spending time for themselves to live somehow for gaining money a much a possible when they are young . however , young people these day are given with almost any good which are essential for everyday 's living when they are born . therefore , young people can spend their time for enjoying themselves . secondly , although in order to enjoy life , people should be healthy , older people more likely not to be healthy than young people . if they are sick , even they are very much optimistic person , it is usually hard for people to enjoy their life enough . lastly , in present circumustance , in order to enjoy this worldwide and borderless society , people are needed to operate a computer and usage an internet service enough . to operate a computer is a kind of hard for older people . for instance , my father who is 65 year old only can type by his right hand so that using a lot of time to operate a computer . also in the occasion of the computer crushed , my father , one of the older person , ca n't solve the situation . on the other hand , young people are more used to usage a computer and know much about it and internet servece . in their age , computer in no more complicated material than mere everyday 's staff like a microwave . younger people usually are much more familier to the system of computer and know about several solution about the computer trouble comparing to olders . also young people can type the keybord faster than oldtimer , in that way young people do n't feel flustration for using a computer . for all those reason , i think young people are enjoying their life than old people do .
