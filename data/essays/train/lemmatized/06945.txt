some people say that there will be fewer car in feature . but i disagree with that oppinion i think there will be more car than there are today . first , from the begining of car manifacture , the number of car have been incresed . and there is no history that number of car is decreasd that id first reason why i think number of car will not decrease . secondly the affection of car are increasing . today when people go sonewhere they use car more than other public tranceportation . becuse going out by car is more convenions . and people want convenions more and more . and their is no alternative to car . maybe you will say air craft , but there have to have to be wide land to aircraft to put on . but i think it will there will be le land in future than now . another reason is that willbe more population in twenty year later than today . so a number of people grower , it will also grow number of car , people want . and in twenty year , car will develop more and more . and ability of human will grow . and if li that happen , gorvenment will lower the limitation of age , which people can drive . like reason above , i insist that there will be more number of car in twenty year than today .
