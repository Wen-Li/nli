will the number of car in use be lower in twenty year from now ? i believe the answer is probably no . what element could support the theory in question ? maybe the decrease in natural resource available to produce oil and finally feed our car . in fact this problem is already being assessed by car manufacturer and oil maker and we can say based on real example such a brasil that colza based oil can effectively replace standard petrol product . electricity or hydrogen engine can also be an answer to oil unavailability . the second argument , linked with the first one , is the consciousness of our civilization regarding car impact on pollution and environment . this is a good point , but we can see this feeling growing today only in country were almost all the active part of the population ha one or more car . and these civilization are also the one having le demographic expansion . in other part of the world like africa , india or china there are still a lot of people dreaming about having a car , the rapid growth of their population will have a huge impact on car annual sale . in my opinion another element which could be also utilized is the development of alternative way of tranportation . i belive this can be true in big city were traffic jam and pollution are not good advocate for car . but we can oppose the fact that it 's being the case for the last 10 year and the decrease in number of car never happened . also in more rural region , any public transportation system will be efficient enough to replace the car . and the feeling of individual liberty that the car brings will not be found while sitting in an overcrowded bus which stop only in pre-designated spot . and to finish , the special link - almost human - between some men and their car , the car being the external image of their supposed success , is not a sign tha indicates a potential decrease in the number of car in the next 20 year ...
