well , to see if i disagre or not with being traveling with a tour guide i have to explain first the advantage and the disadvantage . well , let 's begin . the advantage we can say that primarily there are four advantage to being traveling accompanied by a tour guide . 1. they have the experience that they know well the place in which you are traveling , most if it 's a different country or even a different city . in case it 's a differente country in which there 's a different language talked , that 's a really benefit . 2. they know important fact that maybe one will not know in case you do n't know history or do n't understand the language . 3. i think , that the primarily advantage of being guid by a tour guide ii that you do n't get lost ! it 's normal that if you are visting a city or country for first time you can easily get lost , so , ther 's a great advantage ! 4. a tour guide know the principal place or the most common , the famous one . the disadvantage about the disadvantage , there are also four , 1. the first one is that you have to pay money ! ha ! ... maybe you are traveling with exact money and you do n't have enough to pay a tour guide ! 2. when you are guided by a tour guide you depend on the fastness he move , maybe you want stay more time in some place and get out faster in other one , but it depends on him , the tour guide . 3. even the tour guide know many place , one can get into service office and ask for information , you do n't have to depend on others ! 4. and one important and final fact is that you can meet a lot of people by your own . you can make a lot of friend , know lot of place you really want to visit , not only place all visit , instead many others ! conclutions i prefer traveling maybe with only a friend and between he and me i think it would be a great experience , without wasting and meeting a lot of people .
