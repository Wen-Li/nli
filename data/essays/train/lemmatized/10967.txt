both learning fact and understanding idea are important . neither one of them dominates another . on the one side , learning fact help people to get experience so that they can understand and generate idea better ; on the other side , the ability which people ha to understand idea affect people 's performance to learn fact . everyone start to learn thing from learning fact first . for example , young child start to learn fact when they start to go to school . they might learn that seventy five percent of the surface of the earth area is covered by water . this knowledge is not from understand idea but from fact . another example is that young child learn that fire burn and hurt people by touching fire because they have no idea about fire before they get hurt . however , only learning fact would not help student to get knowledge effiently , they must go to school or somewhere else to learn idea . for example , some of the the knowledge learned by student at school are idea . when student have enough knowledge and idea , they would learn fact deeper and broader . understanding idea and learning fact should not be separate . both of them are the way to help student to abtain knowledge .
