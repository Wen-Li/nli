do young people enjoy life more than old people do ? this is a very difficult question to answer and to be honest , i wonder , too . but for sure i can give you a view out of a young person perspective . i surely can state that i alway want to enjoy life to the maximum . so now we have a different viewpoint on this question , respectively on the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . maybe do young people have more and better opportunity to enjoy life than older do ? i 'm asking myself what is needed to enjoy life ? i start to think about what make me happy . time and money play an important factor to being happy . but also friendship , a rewarding job , familiy , sexual life , inner peace , living standarts and peace in general a impact on howmuch you enjoy life . let 's take the first two point i mentioned , time and money . i already see a conflict here . when you young , you usually have time , but no money to fullfill your dream . there are certain point you can fullfill yourself which make you enjoy life at the time your young , but for sure not all of them . for example you wo n't have the money for spending beautiful shoping weekend in new york and sleeping in a beautiful hotels - okay , fair enouth , not everybody is looking for that , but a mentioned in the begining , i 'm writting from a personal point of view . you start to study hard to become maybe an important personality in future so that you finally could bring up hte money for doing this new york-shopping trip . but then , well , you won-t find time anymore . so you always will look forward till you get retaired for finally spending your over year earned money , but then you might not be in good health condition anymore . my point is , to conclude , that there in every life-section will be certain point you enjoy to the maximum but on the other hand point you ca n't fullfill - certainly for that special moment not . you always will keep on dreaming .
