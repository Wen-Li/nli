some people hold that it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . as far a i am concerned , i 'd like to take a neutral stand on this issue . my opinion go a follows . in the first place , with no doubt , the society aspires talent who have comprehensive knowledge of many academic subject . for instance , in some company , a secretary is expected to perform not only in administration , but also in related area such a banking , accounting , marketing and hr . nowadays it 's not uncommon that more and more company , in order to acquire more profit , often cut back cost on the number of staff . making one staff do the work of two or even three is not unusual . employees at work are expected to be equipped with broad knowledge , so that they can perform in all area . as we all know that to do well at work , you have to be an all-rounder . many people have been aware that language command and computer skill all have become common tool , all modern people need to know how to use a computer . we have to admit that a lawyer who could speak english and ha good computer knowledge can do better than his or her counterpart who doe not speak a foreign language . however , in certain field , people need to be specialized in one specific subject . this is especially true in science and technology field . to do well in a certain field , people have to be specialized in it . especially those student who take doctorate degree , some are specifically in glass , some in optic fibre . in my opinion , even an accountant can do very well if he or she get only specialized in accounting . we need to be objective in this issue . depends on what field you are in and what job you are taking , either ha no harm .
