it is believed that young people nowadays do not give enough time and response on their community . i am agree with the statement , young people do not eve have enough time to interact with others . people in the past liked to communicate with people , with their neighborhood , with family member , with student at school . now it seems to me that they give more response to computer they have around , to i-pods they have in their pocktes and to any technology witch is facninating them . they dont have anough time for other thing beacuse they just see the fact of 0 's and 1 's the same a the digital life , only true and false . so , there will be no other thing around bothering them . old man trying to cross the road , child running trough the car on the road , rubish trown on the road will not bother them at all because they have their own life , own world a tehy have nothing to share with others . the real fact is that , no education supporting the idea that young people should pay more response to their community is made . schools , goverment or family are also responsible . there might be a will of helping their community on young people but i dont really see the act suppporting them . eventhough they have an idea to do so , they are busy with school homework and project more then helping tehir community .
