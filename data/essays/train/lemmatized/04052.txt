a lot of people will undoubtedly dispute this . in fact , the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guid . all you have got to do to prove it to yourself is to think for a while about how much exciting and interesting to travel alone than to travel with a gruop of people you that do n't know . it is often suggested that when you travel in a gruop led by a tour guide is easier and cheaper than when you travel by yourself . i do agree upto a certain point with this , but at the same time money is not the most important issue in this situation . for me , i always think about how much fun i 'm going to have , and i believe that money is ment to be spent not to be saved . furthermore , when you travel with a group led by a tuor guide you will have to follow a fixed schedule . as a result , you will not have a free time to explore thing by yourself , which is the most exciting and interesting experience that any one will have when he/she travel alone . forexample , last time when i went to italy i had too much fun , and it wa really good experience when i found my way home after i got lost in rome . i had a nice opportunity to know the city well . finally , i would have to say that , if i had another chance to travel , i would travel alone because that i will have a good experience and im sure that i will have more fun too .
