i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject and be an expert on that subject than to have broad knowledge of many subject and not have a specific area of expertise . having broad knowledge of many subject doe not necessarily show that one is qualified . that sort of knowledge can easily be acquired through personal effort and experience , which make it almost the same thing a what we call ` general knowledge` . general knowledge is the accumulation of one 's experience and learning gained through education and/or quite simply , living . everybody ha a general knowledge to some extent , and this knowledge doe not bring any bonus point to you in the course of your professional life , no matter how vast it is , especially in an age a competitive a ours . on the other hand , specializing in one particular subject give you the opportunity of being unique . there is no limit to how much you can learn and discover on any subject . therefore , it is possible for someone who ha chosen to specialize , to go a far a he or she want with his or her study , research , experiment , etc . let u take the profession of conference interpreting a an example . it is a must for each and every conference interpreter to have broad knowledge on many academic subject , since they could be hired to work in many conference regarding many subject . it is not possible for them to interpret what they hear if they do not understand anything , or if they are not familiar with the particular terminology . nevertheless , this certainly doe not mean that they are expert , or in other word , that they have specialized in those subject . this doe not mean that they are not expert in any subject either . what this mean is that they are specializing in conference interpreting , and that without their expertise in that particular area , their ability to simultaneously listen and talk , their knowledge of interpreting technique , their broad knowledge on many subject would not do them any good . in conclusion , in an environment a competitive a the current one , where you have to stand out in order to be able to achieve certain standard in your life , you can not just settle for a broad knowledge of many subject . you certainly have to have your area of expertise , an area where you are unique , and where you are willing to pursue that `` uniqueness '' to the furthest extent possible .
