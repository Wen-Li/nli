as time go on , there occur technological development that make our life easier . all of these technological development provide u a more efficient time usage . car wa the most important technological development that have ever been made up to now . however , today we faced with some problem in the usage of car . this problem made me think that in the following twenty year , there will be fewer car in usage than there are today . now , most of u are complaining about the time we spent in the traffic . this mean that , this technological development `` car '' doe not provide u effective time usage now . then , we need a better technoloy than using car a soon a possible which will decrase the usage of car . as i mentioned above , one of the reason for the decrease in the number of car can be the technological development we will have in the following year . however , this can not be the only reason in the decrase of this number . the second reason can be that the decrasing energy supply to work our car . when the energy source decraeses , the money that we have to pay for it increses . then , day by day , it is getting more difficult to pay this money to buy petrolium for driving our car . this is the second supporting idea about why i think that the number of car usage will decrase . this are some reason to explain why i think there will be fewer car in usage in the following year . i hope the development in technology provides u better way to travel .
