i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of several reason . in general , it is because that young people nowadays have so more much responsibility than they did in the past . first , they are expected to achieve academic success . this mean that middle school and high schoolers have tremendously pressure in school because they are expected to get straight as and do all the community work in hope to get into their ideal college . second , young people have tremendous peer pressure in school . this is true particularly a many of them strive to fit in by wearing the right clothes and using the right term . thirdly , after finishing their education , which is generally expected to be a minimum of a bachelor 's degree from a considerably respectable university or college , they are expected to find a job with decent amount of salary . ideally , because of the way hollywood protraits the so-called `` american dream , '' they should be able to buy a big house , own a couple of nice car , and start a family . thirdly , after getting their first job , they have to work day in and day out and at the same time deal with pressure of uncertainty in their future , including the possibility that they might never be successful in their career or could even lose their job . on the other hand , older people that retired from their work are much more at ease with their life . first , they have a peace of mind because they have already done most of the challenging task in life , including school and work . second , their daily schedule are much simpler are le task-oriented . rather constantly worrying about getting done with the next thing to study for or attend to , they can just enjoy life and be without the pressure to keep up with a schedule . as going to museum , listening to concert , taking a walk on the street , day dreaming , or reading simply for enjoyment are part of their daily activity , they can simply enjoy life for the beauty of it simplicity .
