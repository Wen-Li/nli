i agree with this argument , and i think it is very important not just for student but for all of u to first of all understand the basic idea and concept and then to learn fact . a good comprehension of the basic is important because the idea and concept actually make up the fact . therefore for anyone to learn the fact it is imperative they have a proper grasp of all the factor that go in it 's making . it is a fact that physical exercise is very important for the human body . now if the student just learns that , it will not have much relevance and will not really contribute to anything that is productive . on the other hand when the student understands why it is important --- the idea behind that particular philosophy it will be much more relevant and thus more meaningful . the student can understand how physical exercise release stress , how it increase a person well being by altering chemical in the brain etc . physical exercise in the form of a team sport teach people to be able to interact and cooperate and work together . thus the fact will make much more relevance . another example is the fact that it is much more difficult to breathe at higher elevation . it is very important to understand why it is so . if i were planning to be a mountaineer for example , i would be able to deal with the whole situation much better if i understood that air pressure is much more at higher elevation
