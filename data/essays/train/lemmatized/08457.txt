advertisements are the most common and colorful part of our life in the 21st century . everyday another selection for a material is made or invented and coming to our tvs or newspaper page to show u his advantage . people have different idea about the issue that most adverstisements make product seem much better than they really are . some think that it is right others think that it is a wrong way of thinking . i 'm personally agree with the firt one . first of all , advertisement make the product seem bigger . every advertisement is a little circus show to make you believe that ` this one ' is the ` one ' that you have been looking for since your childhood . to make you believe they will try every method , especially do not believe in the size of the product in the television . for example last year a newspaper begin to promote a tape . the tape wa the best that i have ever seen , i mean ` the tape of my life ' . i ordered the product and when the box came to my home i wa really amazed , however , there wa a little problem ; the tape wa more little than i saw it in the advertisement . secondly , most advertisement make the audience believe that the product is cheaper . the life in big city like my own is very expensive to live . so , i am really careful about spending my money and always looking for the price of the material that i will buy and i am always looking for the information on price in the advertisement . for the 20th birthday of my best friend i promised her to buy the dress that we saw in the magazine together . in the adverstisement it wa not looking so expensive . i wa thinking like that until i went the store to buy it . it wa much more expensive than we read . lastly , advertisement make the material seem more useful . for instance , a friend of mine who ha a kilo problem , began to use a material advertised a a ` losing calorie miracle in 3 month ' , it ha been 6 month and she is not looking lose much more than only 1 kilo . .. the product seem her much more useful than she experienced . thus the information told by advertiser is not so accurate and convincable . all in all , adverstising a product is something made to show that it is the best that you 've ever seen . so , the advertiser will try to fascinate the audience and by making the stuff seem better than it really is , they reach their goal . the product shown in the advertisement can be smaller , more expensive and le useful than it is seem to you .
