people travel to different place , to enjoy their vacation or to acquire the knowledge and historical improtance of the place they are going ot visit or to spend time with friend and relative or to take some time off from their daily routine work . what ever the purpose of travelling , i think , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . travelling with a group and a tour guide make the trip more enthusiastic than travelling alone or with a partner . there are several advantage if we travel in a group . for example , we will be more secured , get more knowledge about the place , interact with different people , share food , play game etc . for example , if we travel to a different country , absolutely i like to travel in a group , since it is a long trip and the other reason is that if we doe n't know the language of that country , some person or the other in the group will be familiar with the language . if we travel without a group then it is difficult to survive in the new place and enjoy the trip . more over , a tour guide know about that place and he will guide u . i travelled to ooty a place in india with my friend and relative last summer . ooty is a hill station , with beautiful senic spot and vegetation . the temperature is very cool . our tour guide suggested u what to bring withus in order to adjust with the cilmate . it wa a three day trip . as soon a we reached the place , the guide gave a list of hotel which are reasonable in prize and are good to stay . he took u to improtant place that are worth visiting and explained about them , he also cleared the doubt of some co-travellers . during night we put the fire and enjoyed eating food in group . childern in one group and elder in another group . we divided the group according to age and had lot of fun . those are the most memorable moment for me . i interacted with lot of friend , even today we discus about the tour . based on my own experience , i think , one can enjoy a lot , if he/she travel 's in a group with a tour guide rather than travelling without a group .
