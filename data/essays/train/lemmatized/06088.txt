i 'd agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are many reason for this but none more than technology and the internet . in today 's hi tech world , everything you want is available at the click of a button and the young people of the world are at the core of this internet revolution . although the internet allows you to master domain never heard of before , it also make you forget your immediate neighbourhood and your community . and thats the downside to this revolution . lets take shopping for grocery for instance . shopping at the nearest store used to be a great place to meet people from your community . friendships were formed while shopping for fruit and vegetable . but now with everything available at the tip of your finger , the neccessity to go out ha reduced greatly . going to movie with people wa another great way to meeting and knowing people living in the community . but now even movie can be seen in the luxury of our home . as a result of these change , the need to go out ha reduced a great deal , thus cutting young people away from the community and it people . young people nowadays hardly know who their neighbour are . because of this scarce social contact with the community , they do not feel the need or the urge to go out and help the community . even if they do , it 's more because of an external pressure rather than a real desire to do something for the community . this trend can be reversed only if people go out and meet both the young and the old in the community and interact with them . some time ha to be set aside for community help . that way , young people will feel part of the community . the urge will come naturally once they feel part of the group . this will help both the community and the young people in the long run .
