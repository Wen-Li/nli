nowaday , an increasing number of people like travelling . someone said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because the guide know the place deeply than the traveller , and a group of people will make more fun . but others think that travel with one or two people without a tour guide is more comfertable . and i 'm one of them . first of all , if you have a tour guide and a group of companiers , you will feel not very free . travelling with a tour guide , the plan will be formerly ordered , somethings you want to see a other thing or want to go to another place will not be alloweded . you ca n't change the plan . but for me , the plan which is ordered by the travel company or the tour guide is not the plan i really like , but i ca n't change , because of the whole groud . that make me feel very upset . and a large mount of people will have a large mount of oppinions . it 's difficult to recognize the idea . and some people will not follow the rule . once i joined a travelling group , but we have to wait for one or two people all the time after visiting some scenery . i felt that 's a waste of my time . then , travelling with a group by a tour guide is always very busy , you ca n't visit one thing in a comfertable way , there 's only limited time that you can stay in one place . the whole journey is in a quick pace that you ca n't enjoy it . and most of the tour guide will let you to some place whice they will get benifits from it . but this kind of place really waste our life . as a result , a for a i am concerned , i think travelling only will one or two best friend or relative without a tour guide is more free and comfertable .
