nowadays , people can not only get very much information on television or newspaper or magazine and also subway even more on street . i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are several reason are first . i have seen many people who buy some product on internet shopping mall often return product , second , it is broken easily . i saw many time that some people returned product . it is usually sell on internet shopping mall and home shopping . for example , i have experience . in korea , home shopping is general . i saw the program to sell gelly shoe . it showed very cute and pretty . but it delivered to me , i wa disappointed because it wa different when i wa seeing . so i had to return it . somtimes , many people are attrated good model who are advertise special product . people can not bear for temptation . all advertisement are not lie . just a few product show much better than real product . b
