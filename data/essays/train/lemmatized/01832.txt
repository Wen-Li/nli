i completely agree with this statement . i think it is very important for a human to make , to tery new thing in their life . sometimes it may be very risky , but we do n't have another life , so will not lose anything with trying . making change is always good for u . this change can be a very big one or a small one . it is same in all field of our life . let 's say that i am attending a research program . and i have an idea that may effect this research but i am not sure about it . if there is no another chance , i will to that thing , regarding the risk that a became face to . i may be successful or not . but if i at least try i will not loose anything . we have to encourage ourselfs to try new thing . it is our life . no matter what other people say , for example some people look u like a crazy person , but i thing it is worth to try . if we do n't try new thing we will stay where we are all of our life time . doe it really enjoyable ? no , i do n't think so . i actually think taht doing the same thing everyday take people 's all happiness . i think that the person who doe n't afraid of taking risk is the successfull person wheter he/she succeeded or not . taking risk make the most important change in a person 's life . it 's like stay or go , do or not . even if we make a bad decision with taking a risk , if you are still alive after that , than nothing is over . you can start again where you left , but not taking the same risk . we can not just take a risk to prove our encourage . we take risk when we beleive that it might effect our life positively . so , taking risk and making new change in our life is good , but in my opinion we have to think twice before making a decision
