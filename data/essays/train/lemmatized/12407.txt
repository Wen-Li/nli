the statement is ambigous and could have more then one interpretation . what i do belive is that both of the tecnniques for learning are necessay for student to acquire enough knowledge in the field they are studying . a general way of studying is the basis for good learning skill . the understanding of idea and concept is important for the student because not only it give them the opportunity to be interested in what they are studying and to learn more and more profound information on the topic , but it also allows the student to open his mind to new idea and therefore have his own opinion on the topic he is studying . this is important for the lerning process because it give more profound knowledge to the student and prepares him for debate and essay which might ask for his opinion or might ask him to sustain theory previously studied . on the other hand allowing the student to learn the fact is obviously necessary to achieve the understanding of the material studied . this is because without the basic fact of the topic the student might not be able to draw conjecture on the topic and might lack severe knowledge that would result important then in giving his own opinion , giving lecture and debating . for example a student that ha to give a presentation infront of the class and ha not only to show his fellow student what he learned from the various lesson but even how he us the knowledge he owns to formulte his own hypothesis need to know all the basic fact on the topic or his presentation might result full of conceptual hole and lacking important concept that in the end would impair the student to construct his own opinion and to give a thorough presentation . in conclusion it can be said that the statement is right in the sense that understanding idea is very important but is wrong in the sense that to achieve the understanding of several topic it ca n't lack the basic fact and material or the understanding will be impossible for any student .
