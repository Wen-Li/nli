even if we all have been once seduce by an advertisement although the product wa not that good , i think that this question is more about what the real objective of advertisement is : to demonstrate the quality of an object or to give to someone the desire to buy it . as an example , i still remember an advertisement made by san orange juice company . it showed an young teenager who wa coming home after playing basketball with his friend and asking to his mother where is the juice . the boy and his life looked so great that for week i wanted to taste it . it happens that one day , i found it in a supermarket and tasted it , of course i did not like it but the advertisment ha already done it work , i had bought a bootle of it . neverthless did the advertisment lied about the juice ? not at all , it ha only match with what i wa wanting to see and what could make me desire the juice . that 's why , i do not agree totally with the sentence a it is a bit more complicated . an advertisement must be due to a type of person . to that group the product will seem great but to lot of other , they will not see what that advert is made for . advertisments play with a whole range of feeling that a man can feel , it can also play with confidence . by making famous person only saying they use this product and not another one they manage to sell a lot . indeed the man who is buying the product will first think a his star that this product is the b so in my opinion it is true that advertisement seem better than they are really but not totally
