i agree that it is impotant for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because the concept and idea are basic foundation and root . . how can tree are survival without their root ? one example , many korean student are good at math . some student practiced simple math question repeatly without understandingof concept . they reapeat and repeated on the same or simillar question . they can get a good grade in elementary school . but in geometryl , student who did n't figure out of math idea ca n't prove the solution how it work . another example , i studied hard on math when i wa in school . after 20 year later , the number which i studied have been just number . i have i do n't remerber . any thing .
