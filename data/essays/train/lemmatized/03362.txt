this is a very difficult question which can not be answered in one strict way . in my opinion there is no general right or no to answer this question , it depends on the situation . to answer this question it is important to see it from different point . on one hand it is good to have a broad knowledge of different academic subject . for undergraduate it better to have a main idea about different topic to see what they are interested in . without this knowledge it is impossible to decide which subject you want to take in the further study . but not only for the academic career a wide range of knowledge is important . to understand connection between different subject or to understand social problem it is necessary to have an general idea about several academic point . there is one more point in favour of a broad knowlege i want to mention . if your academic subject you are an expert in , is no longer something which is important to work at , maybe because computer can do all these thing instead of human beeings , than you have to watch for a new job in a different field of work . in this situation experience in different subject will be a great advantage . on the other hand , a an graduate student you need very specific knowledge about one subject . if not , about what will you write your final exam ? for which job advertisement will you apply ? both are impossible thing without a good knowledge about a specific topic . in nearly every exam during your study , except you are studying something really general , you need specific and deep knowledge about one topic . all in all i would say it is important to have both , general knowledge in different academic subject and special knowlege in one subject . there is one thing we should ever think about when we discus this question . you can not get deep knowlege in a subject before having a general idea about it .
