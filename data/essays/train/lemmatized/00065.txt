some people have an idea that young people have a lot of time to give hand to their community . however , others think that youngers , these day , do not have enough time to accomodating the community they are living . in my opinion , to young people , time is lack to helping their communites becasue of their educating and more option for spending their free time . to begin with , nowadays , many parent believe that education is the most important point to their child . therefore , they make their child concentrate on only studying . to be specific , my sister who is high school student spend a lot of time on studying . after finishing her class in the school , she go to the english and science institution . when she come back to the home , it is always about 11 a'clock in the night . as a result , if many younges want to contribute to their communites , they do not have time to care about the helping the communites . in additon , aroud the young peole , there are many attrative option to spend their time except studying . these attractive place interrupt to helping the community . in my city , there are many theater and amusement park . also , by developing the internet , young people often play game and chat with friend in the online . for example , my cousin who is 17 yea old think that playing on line game is only a resort to spend his free time , he told to me playing the game is more intersesting than helping his community . in brief , i firmly beleive that now , young peole do not use their time to working at their communites , because their parent let them focus on only their study . as a result , they are extreamly busy . also , if they have a little time , youngers do other thing like going to the theater or other place and playing on line game rather than sharing work for their community . if you are a busy student because of your study , which one will you choose between going to theater to watch exciting movie and working for your community ?
