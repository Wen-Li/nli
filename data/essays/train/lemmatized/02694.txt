i do agree with the satement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , because iam a teenager of this generation . but if i would be a old generation teenager i would would think about this statement , i have a reasonable reason for both of them which are explained below . if iam a teenager of this generation i would strongly agree with the staement , because this generation is a well forward generation than aprevoius one , a lot of change had came in this generation , the techonology is very much developed so a the mind of the people esspecially teenager . they are well matured and know about the outer world much better than the old aged people in this generation . they really enjoy the thing much better than a old age person do , because they are well aware of all the consequence about what they are doing . for example , think of a student who try to dirve a car in avery small age but his father is worried about him but he knews the consequence of it and drive a car which he enjoys a lot while driving . but if iam a previous generation tenneager i would really think of it because the envoirnment then wa not a today where we cant find a place to enjoy a lot . the main reason behind that is there no development at that time in many area . and taking in view of old aged people they dont seems to enjoy more a the teenager or young people do because , they are bound to there family and responsibitlies , which make them to look after all the family matter and they hardly have a time to enjoy the beautifull world . the old age people dont notenjoy a lot but they help their child do that . the young people doesnot have any soght of pressure on them such a family matter , bussiness and so on . so they can enjoy a lot where a a old age person can not . on conclusion , i strongly agree with the stament because of the above provided reason and example which imples the statement .
