the issue at hand is whether student are supposed to know idea and concept or to know only fact . even though some people consider memorizing fact is more important , i agree with the statement , which mean that understanding idea and concept are more important . first , i would like to discus it by using specific academic subject . for physic , some teacher think that student should learn only formula , ie fact , not basic concept . last year i had a teacher who belives in this way and i wa miserably confused . as the formula of physic seem to be identical , i could not figure out what formula i wa required to use in the exam . as a result , my grade wa terrible . however , this year , my teacher ha taught me the fundamental concept of physic and how each formula came form . this time , i could handle formula and succeeded in the exam . from this reason , i strongly believe that understanding idea is extremely prominent and vital . furthermore , it is essential to learn concept because leaning and memorizing fact are just pain . in my opinion , to learn something is to deepen one 's knowledge by having fun . if people are encouraged to memorize fact and not to learn basic idea , they will likely to dislike studying . on the other hand , if they are supposed to learn concept , they will be able to know the way a thing is and realize how much learning can be fun . for instance , learning histroical fact are boring . nevertheless , understanding why the event happened is a really attractive method to approach history . in other word , memorizing what happended during the world war ii is not fun , but understanding why this happened is extremely interesting . in this manner , understanding idea and concept is suited to my opinion .
