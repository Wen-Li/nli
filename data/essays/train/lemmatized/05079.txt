young people nowadays definitely do not give enough time to helping their community . this is clearly reflected in modern society where everyone is busy taking care of his/her own problem and very few people have the kindness of caring a little bit more about the people around them . there are two kind of young people that should be considered . on the one hand , there are those who do not care about the community where they live in , they are so busy doing their thing , enjoying themselves or getting into trouble that there is no way they would have time to think about their community . these people live their life centered on themselves and are most commonly seen among u . they do not want to do it because they would rather use their time and money doing thing that would benefit themselves , which is probably the most obvious thing to do . this selfishness is one of the main component of the human being that is almost impossible to eliminate . even if they had enough time or money , they would surely find something to spend it on and not dedicate it to helping the community . on the other hand , there are those who really wish to help the community . they are rare , but not extinct . they are usually those who have a little more spare time to dedicate to thing other than themselves and probably the economic power to do it . spending more time and resource on the community would mean having le left for themselves , something that not many people can really afford because these young people usually have to study , go to school , or even work ! i personally believe it all resides inside of u , in the desire to do it or not . even when under bad circumstance , a long a you have the will , there is nothing that can stop you . but if the will is not present , no matter how much time or resource you have , you will always need it for something else .
