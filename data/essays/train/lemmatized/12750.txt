in my life i study at the politecnico of milan and i work in a small company that produced electronics component . when i go , every day at the school , i study many subject that ha refered at the telecommunication . in this type the university i must before do three year to learn the basic subject and then i can specialize in one subject of my course . i belive that there are my advantage and disadvantage to have broad knowledge of many academic subject that to specialize in one specific subject . the advantage is that in this way i can have a lot of oppotunity of work and i can be very competivite in my work because i have study a specific subject and i understood every part of my work . for example in my life when i had finished my study , i known my product , that i had built , very well and i can be very competitive with the other company that product the same component . an other advantage is that i can have a lot of money if i have a good specialization in stead of if i have not a good knowledge i have not a lot of money . this is the situation that there is in italy . the disadvantage is that to have a good specializzation in a subject i must study a lot . if i study a lot of subject i can have broad knowledge and i can be clever in many material that i can see every day in my life . for example , in this moment i work in a company and i have not a specific knowledge but i have a broad knowledge of my subject and in this way i can see the vary aspect of my work an then i can deicide the subject that i prefer . at the end i prefer to have a specific knowledge of many academic subject because i can understand my subject very well and i can resolve other problem that are specific in my work .
