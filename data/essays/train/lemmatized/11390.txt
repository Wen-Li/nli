i am agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather then only doing what they already know how to do well . because i belive that if we want to be successful in life then we have to take risk in our life . we need to learn to take risk and also need to learn that how we can get success in that . if we just spend our whole life doing just one thing , then at the some stage of your life you will get bored of it . and i think it make lot of differenc that if we do something from our bottam of hart , and we do something because we have to do it and we dont have any other opation . for example in my backhome which is india . we have a one very well known personalty called mr.ambani . he started his bisness with one small factory of washing powder , then he expend his bine and in ten year he wa the owner of the biggest powder factory in india . he did not stop there then he invest his money in cloth factory . eventhough there is very tuff compition in indian cloth market he took a risk and in after seven year of his hard work he wa the owner of the biggrst indian cloth compny . he still didnt stop and again he took risk by investing his money in indian petrolium market . and belive me or not after his and his compnys hard work he is owing biggest pertolium compny in india . at the present time he is owing corporation which include six india biggest compny . in his 30 year of crrier he face lot of problem and ton of diffuclty but he never fear from that and look back . he always took a risk and a result today he is covering most of the indian market and gaining profit in trilons . his achivement help him and india a lot to make his identety in world . if he though that one factory is enfough then the seen today is something different , but he do n't . thats why i belive that you will get success only if you put your money , your life in risk . and if ypu do know that how to get out of it and how start making profit from anything . always remember when there is a will there is a way . you just have to find it .
