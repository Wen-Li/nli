i completely agree with the statement that it is more important for a student to understand the concept , the idea behind what he is reading , than it is for him to learn fact . i state that on the basis of two reason : 1 ) understanding the concept is the only way a student , and a person in general , ha to help his mind not to forget . 2 ) it is implied that an idea , a concept , can be adapted to several other situation . concerning the first argument , there is no doubt that a lot of student today , maybe stressed by the exam and by the fixation to obtain the best grade , tend to learn a subject even without understanding it untill the end , i mean , without going behind the word and the mere fact . it is not difficult to affirm that this is not the best approach to the study , because it generally lead to forget in a short period of time whatever that person have learned . on the contrary , according to me , only when a student manages to have clear , to catch the concept of the subject , of the different argument , ha reached his goal a a student and satisfied alle the effort the teacher ha made . everything that is well understand is unforgettable , and it is confirmed by my personal experience , considered that i wa not a good student , in the sense i 'm supporting , until the beginning of the secondary school . in fact , whatever i learned during these year is still present and clear on my mind . understanding the idea that is behind the mere fact ha also a second advantage : the concept can be easily adapted , and in this sense we can say that it ha a wider `` field of validity '' . in fact , it result almost natural to think that a concept can be used even when the fact at it basis are completely changed . and this is what all the student in theory should do : learning something already known , abstracting the concept that it contains and adapting it to fact and evidence that are still unknown !
