i agreed about that statement because of two reason . at first , i think the number of car will be reduced in the future because of lack of fuel . nowadays , the fuel we used to operate car ha showed the bottom . i think it will be disable to use in the near future , so we will have to find altinative thing . another transpertation can be appeared or people can use more public transpertations than car . we could n't expect what will be the solution to solve lack of fuel , but expect the nember of car is reduced . the second reason that i think is that car can be product based on trend like other product . when l went to seatle , l saw an interesting sentence on a woman 's t-shirts , it wa saying `` computer is a trend '' it look like non-making-sence thing , but l thought it wa possible . like computer , car also a product making by a factory and following trend . the color , shape , brend people prefered are always changed by the year 's trend . it 's possible that people do n't want to have car anymore and prefer another more awesome product . for these two reason
