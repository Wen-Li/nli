we all know that young people are more energetic and more healther than older people . i can feel that in my life experience , my mother stay at home every weekend , i ask her why she do n't go outside , she always give me the answer such a `` no . .. i feel tired `` or '' no . .. i 'm not interesting about outside stuff '' . beacuse of these reason i believe that young people can enjoy life and do more activity than older people do . on of the reason is that older people get tired easily , they may even have some problem with their body system . in such case , they can not go mountain climbing , go disco with friend , go shopping for 5 hour long . they ca n't bear these carzy activity , therefore they will miss some chance to know more about vivd life , and the other reason is that young people , like me , we usually go for a trip with our friend in the spring break or summer vacation , we see or gain more information by this activity , we know more culture from other country and people , that is older people prabebily ca n't do . i believe many parent , includ my parent told to their child , participate in more activity and enjoy life when we are still young , because after graduate from university we have to concentrate on our career , try do be a succesful people in the society . after age 30 , we focus more on our family ( especially woman ) , after 40 we do ore best to earn money yo support family , after 50 we have no energy at all to enjoy our life .
