i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for the following reason . first of all , traveling with a tour guide is easier and more efficient than any other way to travel . the group led by a tour guide usually have a well-designed schdule and member in the group are able to visit a many place in a short period a possible . moreover , even though the member do not know the language spoken in the place they visit , they have le trouble with the help of the tour guide . for example , when i traveled in the united states ten year ago , i joined a tour led by a tour guide . the bus that exclusively drove for u led u to the famous sight-seeing spot in new york city , such a the empire state building and the world trade center . dinner wa planned at famous restaurant in little italy . at night , we all went to see a musical show , which wa at the time very popular and wa hard to get the ticket for . if i had not joined the tour , i could not have seen the musical show . this example clearly show sthat traveling in a group led by a tour guide is better . second , traveling with a tour guide give people opportunity to learn more about the local culture and history . for example , i hired a tour guide when i traveled in st. petersburg , russia . there are many famous building and museum in and out of the city , and i wanted to visit all of them especially the largest one in the city . on the day we visited the meseum there wa a long , long line in front og the main entrance , but the tour guide led u to another small entrance of the museum and we were able to get in without waiting for a long time . inside the museum , she led u to the room with famous painting and decoration which all the tourist must see . she also gave u lecture about art , history , and king and queen that all related to the museum history . by her explanation , i wa able to understand russian culture of the time . because she wa a russian guide , she knew very well about the area . after our tour finished , she took a group to the restaurant where pucikin , a russian writer , would have meal everyday . the experience wa unforgettable . in conclusion , i definitely agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
