i agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i have two following reason : first of all , to enjoy life lead young people to think by theirself what to do to enjoy and how can they make it . because to enjoy is not the thing given by other people , young people have to abount how doe they make the thing ejoyable . to think by myself make charactor of young people agressive . it is important for young people to make and produce their own charactor a early a possible in their life . to think that way is very useful for young people . second reason is that the feeling enjoy is gotten by various kind of the experienments . this process that young people challenge and experience many thing and fell enjoy through such challlenges and experiment is very useful in the growth of young people . in fact , older people may challenge and experience many thing also , but in view of the importance gained through such experiment , it is more neccessary for young people to enjoy life . as i mentioned above , i definitely agree with the opinion that young people enjoy life more than older people .
