i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . being in a group and visiting a new city that i do n't know much about with a tour guide will assure me that i will not leave this city that i am visiting for the first time without missing out on any of the important feature . for example , all the historical area in the place , landmark , important musiums , and famous art gallery or even nice restaurant . the tour guide will also be very informative and educating . they will be able to tell u about the history of each piece of art work that is found in a the famous art gallery and answer any question that might rise in my head or that i am curious about wich will make the trip more beneficial . additionally , being led by a tour guide will help me in managing my time since all tour guide willl have a set or a planned schedule from the begining of the trip and until the last day in order for the visitor to get the most of their trip . along with that , the feeling of being part of a group will eliminate lazyness from some individual a they will feel obligated to attend the tour everyday . another benefit to having a tour guide is minimizing the chance of getting lost espicially if it 's a new city that i am not familiar with . i have heard about many story of people getting lost in new city that they are visiting for the first time while trying to get back to their hotel . lastly , being with a tour guide will help me save financially since i will have a designated bus with a driver that will aid me in traveling for one site to another without having to worry about the cost of renting taxi for every trip .
