i agree that it 's more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . because learning idea and concept is easy to access the fact than learning just fact alone . for example , let 's ausum that the teacher explain the chord of music . the fact is that the term of auggmented traid . in this case , teacher said just that defination of the triad . the teacher said that it is composed of two major chord . so i think most of the student do n't understand that term . but rather than fact , teacher might explain using principle of that chord throughout the playing the piano . teacher make student hear the compose of the cord . then most of the student understand more effectively . second , understanding idea and concept is not taken away from brain recognation . understanding simply fact is tend to get away from the recognation . because there is no logical thing and relevant with the other principle of the fact . third . understandig idea and principle of fact is more likely to trensfer the other subject . because foundation of the fact is more important than it 's own fact . for example , once learning a principle of triad , then student can make any kind of triad and chord in basic of idea of preiveous learning chord . to sum it up , accoding to above reason , iearning concept and principle of the fact is more important than learning fact alone .
