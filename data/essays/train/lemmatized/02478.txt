i agree with the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because of following reason . the first reason is that the population of the rich country will rapidly decrease and the number of the people who can buy car will decrease . for example , the birth rate of japan is approximately 1.1 . the tendency of this low rate is similar to other rich country such a european country . the second reason is that the public transpotation system is rapidly developing and therefore people will choose this system rather than buying car because the fomer is much cheaper than the latter . this tendency will be enforced because the price of oil is rapidly rising . for example , the japanese prime minister abe said that the government would permit the construction of special express line called shincansen in hokkaido area which is famous a the domestic place for vacation . this convenient shincansen will make japanese not to buy car . the third reason is that depression in rich country will decrease the motivation to buy car . for example , the deep depression in japan limit how much they ca use freely . so it is more difficult for them to buy car . within 20 year , we do not have the motivation to buy more car because of these reason . that is why there will be ferer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
