i agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people because there are several reason to explain this firstly older people health will not be well compared to youger people by this most often they can not go for out of station for picnic , excertions or tour but younger people visit all the place and enjoy the beauty of atmosphere . they even learn how to survive in different weather condition in future if they have to face . secondly , older people can not able to learn new thing faster and they can not able to update their knowledge a compared to the younger people . younger people ha that stability that they can change themselves from changing world . they can even give the world a new product for changing world a concerned to older people their brain doesnot work properly after certain age and they can not develop new product for the changing world a compared to younger people . another main thing about the older people is that they stick to their old taste that doesnt exist in the present life this is advantageous for the youger people that their taste exist in the present life and they can enjoy more than older people such a movie , club , pub . but in case of older people they can not enjoy the taste of present life . younger people can participate in sport such a cricket , soccer , baseball a it is starting age for them but in case of older people it is not possible for them because their health condition must not satisfy the requirement of the sport . in the present busy life older people are not able to survive the fastness of the current world a in case of younger people they are able to survive and their are becoming the creator of the present world . for all this reason i agree younger people enjoy more than older people .
