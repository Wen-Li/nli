i agree with the statement , `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' if we have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , we would be able to `` think out of the box '' when coming to conversation with other people who are may not be related to your one specific subject . it will also be and advantage to u if we have a broad knowledge over many academic subject when we are applying for job , making a decision in our future or maybe it will even help u to meet and make new friend . if we are only specialize in one specific subject , the job which we can be applying or be doing would be limited . for example , if we are having a discussion with our old schoolmate , naturally not everyone would be studying or working on the same subject or carrear . so if we only have a knowledge of only one specific subject , then we may not be able to join in a conversation , and we might be completely lost . i think that if we have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , other people would think that you are a more intellegent , even you may not be good or perfect at each and everyone of the subject , you would at least know the basic of it and it will be a lot better than people who are really good at one particular subject . we may be better than others , in that one particular subject , that we hae knowledge in , we may not be a good and a useful from others point of view comparing to the people who have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . therefore i think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
