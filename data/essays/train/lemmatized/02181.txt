i am in complete agreement with the point of having a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i feel that is is better to have some knowledge of all the subject than to have a lot of knowledge in one specific subject only . tommorow , if some one appraoches me and asks some question which is related to some very bizzare topic , i may not able to give him or her the exact explanation . however , i am sure i will be very happy and satisfied with the fact that i will be able to atleast give him or her some basic information about the topic and get the work started . i think this point of atleast providing some basic info and guiding the start of the topic is far more better than completely being blank about the topic a the topic may not fall under your subject . we have all heard about the popular proverb `` jack of all trade but master of none '' . i prefer to be the jack and not the master . sometimes it is the demand of the situation or the job profile of the person . you never know what will your own kid ask you when he or she see something for the first time . not only in term of family and educating your near and dear one but also in a competitive atmosphere at work if one show his ability and knowledge in a humble way , he or she is bound to be appreciated and promoted . the best example can be the competitive examination in india which are conducted to fill up government post . these job are so demanding that they cover almost each and every subject from the scratch to right till the graduate level . that again tell u how demanding the job must be because you never know in which department or discipline you will be posted . so it is always preferable and expected of you to have a prior and basic knowledge of all the major subject that will be put in practice . so basically i feel that if one is asked to talk on a bizzare topic or an unknown topic then he or she should be able to talk about atleast some basic point than just going blank . it is nothing wrong in not having any idea of an unknown topic but it is always at your advantage to know different subject . you never know when and where will you need the information . and then you will be thanked not only by other peole but also by your ownself . i dont think there is any better definition to the word `` self satisfaction '' than this .
