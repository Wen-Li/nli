the question asks about tecqnology . in my opinion academic subjectsis better to have borad knowledhge than specialize in one specific subject . there are severl reason show at the bottom , why i disagree . first , the world is developing really fast . a centry ago people think specific subject is more important than acadamic subject . also number of people still think specific subjuct is more important than academic subject . i would say that is wrong . if you have job like writer , musical job , artist or singer that migt better to have broad knowledge of may specific subject . but the world is developing really fast people need to follow the tecqnology . there are how to learn many academic subject . school in one of good case . most of high school in korean which i wa from , learn more mathemathic , physic , chemistry , biology or computer . i believe the school is better to learn knowledge than others . second , i will give a different example about korea korea ha good it tecqnology . so most of people working in computer part or science part . there are severl example about academic knowledge . the company need employee also the employee have to have enough knoledge . in case i have a computer company . i need a 5 people need to work in my factory which make cpu . most of people know what is cpu some are not . people call cup is the brain in computer which mean it is the most important part in computer . so i need to make the most important part , need to find people learned about ' how to make cpu ' . before learn that subject they need a lot of information about compter , that have to learn in high school but it might be a basic thing . go to far , unibersity or colloage . good unibersity or colloage need high grade . most of course in high school are academic subject . world is developing people need to follow that other way we can not developing more and more . what i am saying now is the learning . in the learning i am saying ` academic subjects'
