i dis-agree to the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' i believe that when one travel , one need to explore the place to the fullest . travelling is a passion which teach you to explore , learn and experience . although i agree to the fact that tour guide have a first hand experience about the place and they have been time and again experiencing the place , i believe they are doing their job . but the actual thrill which i believe about travelling is the experience of finding it urself . when with a tour guide , one doe not necessarly make an effort to find about the detail of a place or the zest of it . one just go by the tour guide and assumes that he ha covered everything . tour guide is like a book , i agree , who open out the entire picture to the traveller whom he is guiding , but the benifits of a research which one get by meeting the local people , their food , culture and place and the rest through book or guide is phenominal . the tour led by guide ristricts the intensity of exploring a place . one ha to go with the pace of the rest of the group led by the guide . this prohibits not only the learning or exploring pace but also the freedom of other decision you want to take during the travelling experience . i a a person love to meet people , learn culture and custom of others by being around them and by interacting with them . for that reason , i totally would like to be on my own or in a comfortable group who ha similar thinking and love travelling . i believe that when one is spoon fed , one doe not make an effort to learn beyond the paradigm . similarly when one intends to explore a place and it people , a group led by a tour guide doe not do justice to the place . the hidden fact that the tour guide conveys can also be inferred from a book or a tour guide . travelling is a form of freedom in my eye , and i believe the best result and the knowlege of a place is when one make an adventourous effort to explore it .
