in newspaper we oftenly read that today 's youth would be the so-called ` fun generation ' who is ignoring the problem and need of their community . in my opinion , that 's a generalisation which doe n't fit with reality . young people can and are engaged in a wide range of field . in germany , there is for example the ` volunteer social year ' that young people can choose to do after they finished high-school and before they start higher education . in this framework , young men and woman are caring for a period of twelve month either for elder or disabled people or are engaged in cultural or political organisation . further , it ha become relatively frequent that german high-school absolvents go to another country or continent to do some social work . in 2005 i attended a world youth congress in scotland that gathered active young people from all around the world who are involved in developing project within their community . there were lot of example of young people who are doing fantastic work . . a young indian girl who creates a library for girl or a sierra leonean who conduct workshop for a reintegration of former child soldier to civil life are just two of them . i think that today 's young generation is combining the principle of fun and care for their community because they discover that it give pleasure to help . they have the educational background and the necessary awareness to be able to recognize how their own behaviour affect the development of their community - at least they should have it . but in the case that this consciousnes is not yet existing , there are other young people lobbzing for it . an example are the karlsruhe student days one world where high-school student get familiar with topic around globalisation , environmental protection and human right by attending workshop which are conducted by member of active youth group .
