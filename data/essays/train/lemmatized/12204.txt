i am absolutely convinced that it is much more important to specialize ourselves in one specified topic if we are strongly interested in it . this idea is deep rooted in me , because i am sure that a person will be able to achieve higher aim if that individual decide to focus his study on few specific topic . nowadays there is a strong competition running both in professional field and in academic field . that is why i am convinced that only if you are able to perfectly manage a topic you can succed in your field of interest . moreover it is necessary to consider that , if you have a broad knowledge of a lot of different subject , you can not have a deep knowledge of anyone of them . you probably will be able to talk about a lot of different thing , but you will not be able to deeply analyse anyone of these . however , it is just a matter of how deep is our need to command and masterise a specific topic . our society is a very superficial society , with the massive use of the internet we have been teaching to surf on information and just to obtain what we need from these information , without analysing the different item stending behind a subject . otherwise it is very important for a student who want to achieve high aim , to analyse many different aspect of their field of interest . i am convinced that it is charming to analyse a problem and to study it from many different point of view . this will give people a strong opportunity of improvement and of growth , both a an student and a a future worker . specializing in one topic , and leaving all the other subject , is a very strong challenge , and actually it is a risk because you have to take a decision about the main field of knowledge you are going to develop probably during you whole life . but , if you like challenge , probably you will obtain higher aim . life is full of choice , and this is a very difficult choice for you career , and for you life . but i think that challenge and choises make life colourfull and funny .
