first of all , there is one important thing i think i should point out : my opinion on that issue depends deeply in the meaning one give to the word `` success '' . what 's the real meaning of it ? i suposse it would be a good task to discus , because there is no doubt that this is an ambigue concept . for me , success ha a lot to do with having an idea or a goal and working a hard a neccesary to reach it . we can learn a lot about history , and history tell u that from the beginning of the time people whose name and life are nowadays known had been those who in any way tried to do something different and were brave enough to continue until the end . i supposse it is no the easier way to live when you decide to break the rule , to take risk , to struggle with difficulty around you and not give up even when your closest friend or familiy lost their faith in you . because most of the time , succesful people suffered incomprenhension from their contemporary , at least in any moment of their life . because of all these reason , i can affirm i completely agree with this statement
