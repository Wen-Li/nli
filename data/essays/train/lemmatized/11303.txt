it true that young people have the abilty to take part in different kind of activity , especially some exciting one . but at the same time some old people can not enjoy them . however , it is a little bit haste to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . faced with the working stress of morden time , young people seem to have much more pressure than older people do . young people have to get up early and go to work in an rush hour . and if there is traffic jam , which is common in big city , young people will suffer more from it , both physically and mentally . moreover , young people have to breed their child and also take care of their old parent , and therefore they will have le time enjoying the nature , having outside sport , and even breathing the fresh air in the country . however , old people have more leisure time a compared to young people , and therefore they have more access to enjoy the life . because old people do not have to endure the working pressure , they have various kind of activity . for example , they can plant tree , raise their beloved flower a well a taking care of their grandchild . also , they can travel a far a they can because there is no time limitationfor them . they need not to go to work on time , and they do not have mountinous working to do . enjoying the nature not only do good to their physical health , but they are even good for their mental health . i think the only difference between young people and old people is that there is a splendid future waiting for the young , while there is a glorios future behind the old . no matter young and old , they have the same right and responsibility to enjoys their life .
