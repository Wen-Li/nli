i agree this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . our common sense is not to try towad risk area . however , no try new thing mean no new happening in our life . as i read this statement , i remind the pastor cho ' story who established the full gospel church in seoul . he started samll church in country side which lived many poor people . as his ministry grew , he moved a little bigger church . his church number wa around 1000 number . god gave the vision to build a huge church which wa available to participate in over 20,000 number . he did n't have money a well a huge space to build it at that time . he could n't see any reasonable thing to start it . it wa big risk . it might be worse if it influeced toward his church number because all elder of church number were not agree with his opinion . however , he began it against all environment and condition . so some of church number left from his church due to risk and the expectation of harship for new church . but his church number became over 700,000 number becuase the location the church wa bulit , became the core of city of seoul . all so important building such a the building the national broad casting and govenment , were established there . the other reason is that all most people try to do what he or she knew well . that mean that there are so competitive in that area . if he or she is not outstanding in that area compared with others , it is rare to get success . let 's think about one example . there are a lot of pizzah store in our area . many of u know how to make it . it is also not much risk for managing compnay because it is famillar for each of u . however , it is easy to make it a well a to be known how to do it .
