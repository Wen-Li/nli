cities twenty years later how will our city be in the future ? how will people live twenty year from now ? these are question asked for so many year and we can see many different answer , theory and approach through out history . when trying to answer these question , the key aspect of city such a traffic and car use come into the picture . i believe that , in term on car use in the city , there will not be significant decrease in the number of car used and even more car will be used in twenty year . there are several aspect effecting the car use today . the main element is the car-dependent life style of modern people living in the city . i believe that the city life of the near future will a car dependant a today or even more . cities evolve and continue to get bigger counting on the mobility of the people . as new suburb are created and city with multiple city center away from each other , are developed ; a the current situation in istanbul nowadays more and more people will need to use car . the only reason for fewer car to be used in the near future would be the concept of working from home using the internet . people can argue that when people will have the chance to live and work in one place - the home office concept , they will not need to use car . however the concept of a home ofiice is not that new and in the past 10 or 15 year many people tried to work from home but ended up going back to their office . big company are not supporting people working from home , on the contrary they are trying to create better and more confortable working environment in and around the city . based on what i see in my own country ( turkey ) and many other developing country i can say that more and a lot of money is invested in the car industry , highway , tunnel and bridge making it easier and necessary for people to use car . therefore i believe that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today .
