i personally think that young people give a lot of time helping their community , but we must specify the age of these young people because when i think about young people i include people from 18 to 30 year old . lets think about all the volounters in their contry or in africa , i really think that 's huge . in fact , if we see more closer all the association or organosation we would find a lot of young people helping the next , trying to give to the people who have very little the help they need . as well all the soldier that go and beat to defend their contry are really honorable . i think that you really must have something in you that push you hardly to do those thing because it is really difficult . we should be very altruist to go and fight with people who need support . i 'd say that one of the beautiest quality for a person is the altruism , it is something really good for a men to have and use it . moreover , we can think about all the great fight led by thew young people during the history and now , for example the pacific fight of martin luther king or all the parade made by young people to stop the war in world . eventhough not only young people help the today society finally , even if a lot of young people are not helpful a other we should respect everyone for his business , because not everybody ha the same quality .
