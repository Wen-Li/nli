personally , i am agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . my point of view depends on two argument , the first one is that i believe there is no profit without risk . the second one is that repetition of a task or a job turn out to be a routine . the common saying of the business argues that there would be no profit without risk . when opel , the german car manufacturer , first introduced their small car model `` corsa '' , many people asked that why someone would purchase small car . but corsa had reached tremendous sale number in all over the world . opel took the risk of producing a small and unusual car and sold million of corsa all over the world . on the other hand , we can see lot of failure story about new product , job , even marriage etc . the main reason for failure is the involvement of risk and the amount of risk can never be calculated accurately . however , some people prefer to do what he \ she already know how to do . personality , culture or economic condition can be effective for not taking risk . doing the same thing for a long time result in specialisation in any task . however , it also result in repetition of task , in another word , it cretaes a routine . as a result , the dilemma of taking risk or not depends on whether you are a risk takei believe i am a risk taker and would prefer to try new thing and to take risk up to some degree in order to be successful in my life .
