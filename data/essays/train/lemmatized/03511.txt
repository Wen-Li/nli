i think that there is a difference between how young and old people express the way they enjoy life . not everyone express this kind of emotion by accompanying it with the stereotypical connotation of `` enjoying life '' such a carefree day , endless laugh and no responsabilities . for this reason i do not agree with the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people . as a matter of fact , i think older people can develop subtler , more refined and , why not , more precious way of appreciating life . young people , most of the time , are bound to a definition of fun that is imposed by the medium , which involves concert , all-night partying , strenuous lifestyle and the idea that `` someone , somewhere , is having more fun than i am '' . this make most young people feel compelled to do more and more in order to show others that they are enjoying themselves rather then actually cherish their experience . older people learn in time that enjoying life can be associated with more relaxed and `` tailored '' activity , such a hobby or brief holiday . i think that it might be even easier for some older people to enjoy life firstly because they can count on more financial stability and secondly because they have a lot le time to dedicate to themselves , which make this time a lot more valuable . hobbies are activites people cultivate over long period of time , and the passion with which they nurture them is a very good example of how much a person can enjoy him or herself . i consider holiday a another good example . when young people go on holiday , they tend to lead a lifestyle very similar to that that awaits them at home - if not more stressful ; going out every night , staying up very late , `` trying a bit of everything '' . older people have le time to travel but more money to spend on their trip , which enables them to choose destination and vacation type that will make them get the most out of that limited time and , at the end of the day , `` enjoy life '' more .
