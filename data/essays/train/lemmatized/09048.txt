the idea and concept world or the simple fact world . when anybody think about what type of education preffer for the young student , he or she asks about what world like for them and what kind of live chosses . the life world is divided in two form of understanding the live , one of them is focused on the fact that the student need to know to be succsesfull , that suport all of thesse activity . on the other hand , the other form is based on the idea and the concept that the young student need to understand for their real development . the people who think that the principal focused that need to have the school is lern to the student all the fact that ocurred in the world because with that , the student could be better and could be find a job in somewhere and doing something because have the knowledge that permit to do that whaatever the student like in the opposite , the people who think that the important lenrned for the student in the school is to have an criterion and the posibility for distinguish the important idea and relevant concept any activity or intellectual development , preffer that the professor insist in teach about who anybody need to think and how is that people need to undertand the importance of the idea . so the most important question is if one of both concept is the most important for the development of the student or if the student need the cojunction of both concept to find a real development and a real knowledge for the life and for the oportunities of work that he or she find . i think that the better teacher is a man that teach about the idea and concept but that idea and concept are explinned by the teacher with a real and historical fact because the estudent learn the concept and never forgaot the fact .
