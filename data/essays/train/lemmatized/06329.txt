i believe those who think there will be fewer car in the future are wrong for several reason . it is usually fancy to think that the world will change in radical way in twenty year , and by radical i mean our great dependence on car for transportation . for that to happen we must be introduced to newer mean of transportation that will be cheap and available and that should provide several advantage such a being faster and not having traffic problem . the only innovation that might help reduce the number of car is teleporation , that is transfer of matter from one place to another via light wave . however , this is unlikely to take place and catch up in twenty year . another possible invention that might take up the place of car might be small airplane that use highway in the air , but since we will very probably still call these vehicle ` car ' the total number will not decrease . and a in my previous discussion , the price of these vehicle will be too exorbiant to make they good buy , at least for the average consumer . the only argument that might favor a reduction in the number of car is the impending scarcity of petroleum and the entailing increase in oil price . this argument can not hold because scientist will have invented new energy source that can replace today 's oil . in fact there is one more possible reason for people 's finally giving up their car and deciding to walk to their destination . people , especially those living in big city , may say that they are fed up with traffic and regret the year they lose in traffic , and thus discontinue driving forever . come to think of it there is still another possible explanation for fewer car . maybe people will become very concious and conscientious creature in the following twenty year and say that they have polluted the environment , stressed themselves out , and harmed their physical health more than enough . this way they will send their car to junkyard for recycling and contribute to world economy . surely enough , each of these assumption is beyond the reasonable limit of the mind . therefore , i can safely asume that in twenty year there will be more car in our street that there are today .
