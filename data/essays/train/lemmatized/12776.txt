in my opinion , and experience , old people can enjoy life a much a the younger . i belive that people can be of an old age , but still be ` young of hearth ' a far a i have seen is mostly related to how the person life his life and how he think on himself . many people belives that to enjoy life one ha to be young , the truth is that many of the people that think that way will not enjoy life when they get older because of the way they think . as exanple of this i could relate about my grandmother : from what my mother ha told me of her i know she always feared to be old and tried always to hide her age and she did all this because in ther mind she wa getting too old to and wa afraid of being useless . i have met other people like her , and aging is not good with them . in the other hand i have my grandfather : he never cared much for his age and always said he wa a the wine : ` getting better with each year ' and is truth , is a sense , since even tought he is 5 year older than my grandmother he is in much more active and seems younger than her . constantly we have example of this kind of person , people that doe amazing thing even at their advanced age amazing all of u , younger people , that cant do those thing . i think that also the character of a person is very important , some people are jovial and carefree and if they keep those trait a they get older they will be able to enjoy life a much a they did when they were younger . for example some people say : ` im 55 year old . im too old for those thing ' others will say ` im only 55 year old . why ca n't i do that ? ' and if they dont see any obstacle in their age then it will not be any obstacle for them and they will enjoy life at it fullest not mattering the age they reach .
