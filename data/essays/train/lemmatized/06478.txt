it is a common prejudice that youth is a prerequisite for joy . even if this believe is usually not consciously articulated by the people holding it . as a matter of fact , only the old can actually answer this question because they have been both - young and old . from an analytical point of view i see no logical reason why youth should go along with happiness . obviously , most of the young people are still struggling to get what the elderly have already achieved : a good job , a house , a wife and so forth . therefore older people have a good reason for being more calm and patient . this could enable them to see life from a relaxed point of view . doing this is surely of great help for anyone who want to enjoy life . on the other hand , in case an old person ha not succeded in life , this might make him pessimistic . whereas for young people there is always a good chance that great change take place in the future . as they can not rely on this feeling that everything might improve in the near future old people need to come to term with what they have . so in the end it boil down to the art of being content . any man or woman who master this task ( regardless of their age ) is in my opinion able to truly enjoy life . old people have more time to practice and a bigger need to suceed . that is way i think that they have an advantage in this context .
