knowledge of the student determines his ability . sharp ides can interrupt in the student mind if he or she is strong in concept . student thinkin ability ha to be fast , sharp , innovative.a good student is one who can resolve the issue in quick n better way . the way a student approches the task is also important , it can b done in two way , analytical way n the other is fact way . it is very important for the student to try to think in different possible way he can . if the student ha gone throuh the concept in the tradionanl way then his approch will be narrow so i prefer the analytical understanding rather than fact way . innovative idea lead to success in a short period of time . concept of the subjet can help the student in many way to resolve the problem . but fact also play an imprtant role , if the student is not aware of the fact of the topic he is dealing in then he might not be able to solve the issue . so a student shuld first go through the fact and then try to think over them in an analytical way . considering a the fact that i hav seen my senior design a 4 stroke engine in the college science carnival . he wa not a brilliant person in the class but when it came to the practical section he wa awsome . wen he wa rewarded for his work he ststed that his area of interest wa design , which always wa foccused and innovative . ho wa very clear in his concept , which ultimately lead him to success . so i prefer firstly to know the fact and then to analyize those fact in an analytical way for success. a combination of both will lead to success in a very short time .
