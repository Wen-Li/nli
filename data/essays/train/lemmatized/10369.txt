in this competitive world , lot of company are rised and lot of company are disappeared . some company , in order to make a great amout of profit , use unethical way to produce their product . i really agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . some example will be showed in my essay below to prove how much i agree about the statement . almost every day i will watch tv show and follow by a huge number of advertising which are shampoo , conditioner , bank , restrant and more . the one i think most attractive is `` vs '' , which company made hair shampoo and conditioner in britain . in this advertising , every model 's hair will look very shinny , soft and healthy . i tried one set of this production , after i used them it wa good , my hair are soft but not shinny . another advrtising i want talking about is restrant . everytime i saw the advertising about the food that drogen restrant made wa nice and delicious . their pic showing their food in the nice color . and the restrant look in the pic are big and nice . but after i tried this restrant , i can say i do not want try again . the food are aweful and restrant are small . . as a conclusion , company now used all their ablities and income on their advertising how to attract more customer .
