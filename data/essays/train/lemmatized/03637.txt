i strongly agree with the statement . most advertisement make product better than they really are . first , advertisement enphatize the quality of their product with catchy slogan : for example it is likely to see a picture of a beautifull woman with the shirt or dress they want to sell taking your attention away from other information . sometimes advertisement give true but incomplete information : it happens to me with adsl connection . they assured free assistance calling a free number , but when i called that number i heard a recorded voice telling me to call another number with expencive fare . second , they usually do not talk about disadvantage : for example it is easy to observe advertisement about sport car and seldom do they give information about how much gasoline they need for running one mile or about tax owner ha to pay . in addition , advertisement often do not give any advice about where or when the product can not be used . that is very important in particular if item are medicine or noxious substance . for example it happenened that , after the ii world war , large amount of pesticide ddt against insect wa used in agricolture , and many people used it also on his body in order to keep dangerous insect away , in the spite of it toxicity . cocluding , i do not saying advertisement should be banned , however i think that advertisement information and suggestion from product advertisement should be taken carefully
