a lot of people are saying that , in twenty year , car might start disappearing slowly . but is this prediction relevant ? our modern world is going to face , in a few decade , many issue related to oil and the fact that our civilisation is nearly a hundred percent based on it consumption . indeed , oil resource are not eternals and some consequence of it incomming lack are already being faced : price are going up and important political decision ( such a going to war ) are being taken . moreover , virtually all scientist agree that the greenhouse effect is going to change our world if we do n't do something . all those thing might lead to the slow discrease of the number of car . they pollute too much and might become too expensive . but , to me , saying that this change will occure within twenty year is false . indeed , specialist estimate that the oil resource will still last for fifty year . moreover , developping country , like china or india , are becoming huge customer of the car industry . all this tend to say that the number of car will still grow for , at least , twenty year . .. but yet , some change can be seen around the world : new type of car are being created . thus , i think that the car will never desc : it is just going to evolve to meet our need ! cars will be running with new type of energy like hydrogen or solar energy . they might become smaller that the car we know , include an autopilot mode , have a totally different shape or even fly . but still they will be car ! the concept of car will never disappear because people need their independance , they need to feel free to go where ever they feel like and on their own . this is to say that public transport wo n't ever outcome car . .. so the car of the futur wo n't , probably , look like or even run like the one we have now , it might be a plane , a car and a boat at the same time , but it will never disappear . all this make me think that saying the number of car will decrease in a twenty year time is irrealistic .
