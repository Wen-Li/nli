`` { successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well } '' suceesful people are those who gain fame , prosperity in their life and they are know for their work globally . i do agree with this statement a people who are sucessful for instance taking an example of the richest man in india , like reliance anil ambani. , ha always tried out new thing in his buisness , his father wa into share but he expanded his buisness by establishing a buisness in internet , mobile phone , this made him in to a very rich man , and subsequently he is investing his money in oil company like cheveron worldwide . now take another example of another buisness tycoon , say ratan tata in india again , he ha always been in the steel buisness and i do say he ha done good in his carrer but again to compare relliance is far mor ahead tha tata . lets see another example ,, laxmi mital had started his carrer with a small company but since he did try out new way , today he is the world 's richest man . a successful person would like to explore new idea and work accordingly , this help him to gain recognization globally . he would like to expand his buisness in various field and for this if he need to invest in new project , he would never hesitate . i believe destiny also play a major role in a man 's carrer , if for example the man wa very well doing in his past year but now he is facing major downfall , this can be due to his hard luck. , a he is the same man who wa once a upon a time a very successful person but now he is no where . if people stop trying new thins and work only on what they have been doing then our nation or say any country would never progress . they would be at one point only , but with risk and challenge we are able to get thing which we could never imagine before . considering another example , even the president of a country come of with idea which sometimes are benefical to the nation , and if he didnot the nation would never move ahead . people inorder to progress have to take such challenge in life and face inorder to move forward . to conclude i do agree and truly belive that for being a successful person , one need to try new thing and take risk .
