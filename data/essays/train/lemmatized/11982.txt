successfull person try new thing do you know any people who doesnt like to take risk in the business ? successful people try new thing and take risk much more than people who are not like to take risk too much . every business man take risk but this risk sometimes can be so significant amount and sometimes so le amount . for example my father is the owner of a big company which is so important for the local economy of turkey . in the biggineng while he estublishing this company he got significant amount of loan from the bank . and he hadnt got too much money to pay it back . first everything didnt go well because of some mistake . therefore the money which wa taken from the bank a a loan didnt get sufficient and he had to sell his house . after that he succed to establish his company which ha been producing food under the name of eti for year . right after he graduated from the university in us he satarted working a a bank manager in his country . as a manager of the bank he got some award from the union of turkish bank cooporation . during his golden year in his work he decided to establish his own company and quit his job . after some colculations he got succed and now he is working a a bos of his own company . and i have never seen him thinking about his past maybe because of thinking future all the time he is well prerared and know what the future can bring and how to handle the stuation . all in all successful people like my father always try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well . because of their idealist structure . in every period of their life they want to achive something and believing them self make them stronger .
