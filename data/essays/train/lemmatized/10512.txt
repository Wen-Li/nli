some people believe that it is more important for student to learn fact . i though believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and conscept for several reason . the main reason for my view is simply that , understanding idea and concept concequence learning fact . what i mean by that when student understand idea deeply and coherentily they could possibly find out the fact behind these idea . because behind most of the idea , fact . the second reason for my view is that the more student undersatnd concept and idea , the more will be able to obsorve , study and analyise fact . understanding alwyas more effictive then lear . because when you learn we just take the idea or concept a it written for u . however , when we understand any idea very clearly , we would increase our ability to anlayise and study the fact that is realated somhow to that idea . the last reason for my view is that wehn the student understand the idea and the concept rether than just lean fact , they perhpse would not forget them in the long-term . moreover , they could devolpe their knowledge around those idea and concept that they understood before . in counclusion , i totally agree with encourging the all the school instituations around the global to focus on improving the understanding skill in the student . also , try to help them to find their on way of thinkning amd analysinig the idea and the concept rether than just teach them in general fact which probably they are going to forget in the end of the simister .
