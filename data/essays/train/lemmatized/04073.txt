i agree with that statement . most people do n't think like that but i think thats true . there are many reason why younger people enjoy life more . firstly , the best jears are over for them . the most of them have seen , done and lived anything so live ha to offer no rising for them like it ha for young people . the firts kiss for example is a very beautiful experiance for young people and thez get butterlys in their stomache while doing it but for old people it 's onlz a normal process . the same is with getting the driver licens . young people ca n't wait to be 18 and get it and drive their own car . in compearance to that car driving is not a exiting for older people than for younger . secondly , young people can go out with frinds or go to the disco and dance all night long or go to a bar and drink something or someting like that , what old people can not do just becouse the most of their frinds are dead or to old so they can even not walk . furthermore , many old people live in '' house for old people '' ( altersheimen ) . there they have the same process every day . they wake up at the same time , eat at the same time , go to toilet at the same time , wath tv at the same time and so on . that seems to be very boaring to me . life ha to offer much more to young people . every day they make new and unknown experience
