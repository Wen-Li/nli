i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , people in japan study a lot of fact , such a history and math instead of idea and concept class when they were in elementary school , junior high school and high school . it is too much time to learn fact . they should study class which understand idea and concept . second , almost people have pc , tv , tv game and cell phone , so they do n't like thinking something . children often play the tv game in their house , instead of go out with their friend .
