my first response to this question would be '' yes , i do agree with this statement . '' and the first explanation that come to my mind is that young are le involved in the common problem than before . the young of today are more selfish , they try to resolve their problem before resolve the others ' problem . maybe we can blame education : parent do not show them the right example and they do not know what a real charity is . more and more , young are only interest in their pleasure like seeing their friend , playing video game . .. the notion of altruism ha been lost trought generation and the charity 's action are le and le done . for example , they are only old people who are going to the neighboors ' meeting to discus about the problem in the community . young people are not interest in that , and if you ask them why , they said that they always have something better to do . but we can not generize this fact , because some young are still devoted to help their community . some of them spend their free time to help others , by distribuing food for example , or by cleaning the beach . .. and some of these young do that because they want to feel better , to feel like they are nice and helpfull . but i think that the majority of the young people have too many thing to do to think of helping the community . nowdays , study are long and complicated , and do ask a lot of homework . this may be why young do not spend the little free time they have thinking of their community , but thinking of them and take a break . defenders of the community will say that it is not a reason , and maybe there are right , but i really think that the preoccupation for the community come when you are older , because you must enjoy your yough to feel ready to help others after .
