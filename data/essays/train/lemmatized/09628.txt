some people would think specialize knowledge is the most important , however i prefer to choose the broad knowledge of many academic subject . there are theree reason for this : to have many information , to have wide view point and to make own new field . first of all , the foundation of our knowledge wa decided be the quantity of the imformation . for instance , i major bussiness administration in my university . if i do not study about not only foundamental bussiness theory but also other advertizement theory , i can not know deeply about marketing theory . likethis , bord knowledge is essentioal . secondly , if a persson consentrate on only the specific field , they will not be able to have wide view point . in jeneral speaking , like these kind of people can not understand other people idea so they will have bias thinking way . adding to this , these kind people like to be minority , so they will have difficult time in their life . finally , in order to make own new field , it is better to have wide knowledge . noneless to say , new theory is made by the combain of the fandamental knowledoge which saomeone have . if a person specialize in a specific problem , there will be limit of them . because , new field is introduced by creative thinking based on the wide information . from these reason , i think if a person concentrate on the specific field , there are more le potentioal in their future . truly , studying only one subject which a person really want to study is important thing . yet , when we think about this problem from long term . clealy , having vast knowledge of many kind of academic subject is more good for the person 's future .
