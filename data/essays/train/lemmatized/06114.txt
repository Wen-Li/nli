i do agree with the statement that in the twenty year there will be fewer car than they are today . there are many reason for this like the environmental impact , the distance to be travelled , the traffic problem , cost of the fuel , increase in the labour charge for fixing the car , the policy of the government , etc . these are explained a below . first , from the environmental point of view car are a major source of pollution pouring heavy amount of carbon monoxide in to the atmosphere . so many people are these day much aware of the environment and are intending to live in a pollution free city and town . the people stopped buying car in many of the country these day and are resorting to other mean of transport like train and bus which carry many passenger at a time having a negligent effect on the environment when compare to car if all those people travel in each . second , these day since the city being fully developed and no place being left in the city so many of the firm are being shifted to the outskirt of the city . many people will find it difficult to travel to the outskirt of the city in a car a the distance is much longer and they also find it safer to travel by train and bus . it is also cheaper when compared to travelling by a car . the railway and the public tranportation these day have been developed a lot and it is much safer these day to travel by these source . third , the traffic problem and the cost of the fuel . as the population ha increased the number of vehicle people used ha also increased by a considerable number a a result the traffic in the town and city is very heavy . many people found that it is very stressful to drive in such a heavy traffic and the accident have also increased . moreover the cost of the fuel like diesel and petrol is increasing day by day and people are finding it much difficult to pay so much for the fuel . in the twenty year the fuel may cost twice or thrice of the present cost . the labour charge for fixing the car have also increased by a considerable amount and in the future they are may be five to six time more . finally the traffic in the city and town is very heavy and the people have to get struck inthe traffic for hour and hour . the parking lot alloted for the car are filled by half the customer in the shopping mall and the people are finding it difficult to park the car . the goverment also imposed amny restriction on the owner of the car like car should not be used for more than 10 year , they have to have the pollution check certified every two month , etc . i hope that people will stop buying car in the next twenty year basing on alll these factor . but however the travel by car is very convinient a we can travel at any time we need .
