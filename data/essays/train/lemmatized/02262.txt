according to me successful people always go for the new thing instead of going for the thing that are well known . they will consider the idea of the known thing and try to go in a new way . so i agree with the sentence that successful people take risk for getting thing to be done . suppose if we go for a well known matter there will be no chance of taking risk . we know what the result is going to be . we are not taking the risk in that where a if take the risk and obtain the thing or work done it will be satisfactory for u also . when i wa in school my friend use to read only one publication where a i used to read three publication . i used to answer for most of the qusetions asked by the teacher . my friend used to say me that it waste of reading all the publication available in the market . at the end of the examination i wa the top student in the class . but when i wa preparing for the examination my friend told me that i am going to fail the test and they asked me to read only the prescibed textbook instead of going for other book . but i know that i am going to score high in the class . i took risk and i wa successful at the end . but one thing we have to keep in mind is that we should be careful while we are taking the risk . we should work hard for getting the desired reults . most of the successfful world famous scientist also took risk and obtained fruitful result . if we dont take risk we dont have a scope to work . so most of the successful bussiness person and other people who are successful in life will take some risk to achieve the good result . if we want to do something new then we have to take risk definately . so it better to take risk in a proper manner and obtain the good result .
