in my point of view , i beleive that tour itself are for a purpose . in order to make them worthful , guidance is necessary . overriding reason for my beleive is that , tour teach u more than the book . most of the tour are based either on learning something , which is unknown or simply an historic purpose . some place of interest may contain different kind of monument and article in the meusum 's that have lasted from our ancestor period . in such a visit , the tour guide help u understand the importance of it . they make u deeply learn the fact of each of the article that were preserved and tha reason behind it . moreover , the tour guide also create an environment of fun and joy . in tour that are for an official purpose , they help u in directing the best way to reach on time . later , they take u to the famous place in the city like shopping mall and multicuisine restaurant etc . apart from all this , tour of educational purpose like for instance , study on bird , tree etc , in forest they guide u about the safe and the unsafe location , so that we can caution ourself while moving around . finally , i assume that by travelling with a guide would help u a lot , because they spend their valuable time for u . and not the least , travelling in a group give lot of fun and entertainment and
