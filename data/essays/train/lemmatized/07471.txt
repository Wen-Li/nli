if someone only know a lot fact ( like date , name , location , time period etc. ) , he is definetly predestined to be the next candidate on the show `` who want to be a millionair '' . but if he doe not know the supporting idea and concept that actually connect all the single fact to a logical whole , he is of no greater use for anything else . in my opinion , it is our understanding of idea and concept that determine our ability to think analytically and to develop new idea and concept of our own . i therefore agree with the statement . students go to school and to college in order to get prepared for their professional life in the future . in most case , their career will not depend on their knowledge of certain fact but rather on their ability to understand and grasp the why behind those fact and eventually create something new on their own . consider a business economics student : if he is going to work in some business in a free economy , he need to be able to understand for instance the competitor ' success with a particular product . it doe not help to do that the competitor produce that product and that it successfull in doing so . rather it is necessary to understand the concept behind the product , that make it successfull . in other word , he need to know why the product is sold so well . therefore , it is important that student learn how to analyze fact and situation . accordingly , teacher have to emphasize on critical thinking and understanding rather than learning by heart . now consider a biology student . if he want to work for the research and development department of some big pharmaceutical company , he must sooner or later be able to to improve existing medicine or even invent one himself . he can only do so by firstly understanding the illness and what it doe to the human body . or he ha to understand how an already existing medicine work and in which way it could be improved . the former student therefore relies on his ability to understand a concept in order to improve it or create a new one . again , this clearly show that it is most important to train student to develop a keen analytical sense . these two example can only give a small impression of how important understanding idea and concept is in contrast to simply learning them . but i am sure that focusing on understanding will help any student who want to work in a challenging surrounding .
