yes i do agree because when student understands the idea he life the moment in his mind he feel what is happing , he can imagine it he can belive in it but when he learns the fact he feel it just passing by his brain it coming from 1 ear and gettting out from another and it soon to be forgotten but when u understand you will have a moment with that idea and he can relive it when ever he want and it will not be forgotten because he ha a moment with that idea a history that would n't b easy to forget and he will be happy just knowing that he ha all this knoweldge that he can relive it but when you learn the idea u just feel like it another dumb thing getting in and getting out , understanding is another thing understand is fun understanding is what live depends on . when u understand u become a lagend , maybe an another albert anchistian it depends on your dreems and expections , living the moment i what live is about , belive me . i 've tried it , i would love to understand thing , but there is thing in this life we can ' understand it above our ability , we are not god or jesus we only human when u do n't understand that doe n't mean your stupid people come in diffrent shape and abilites , but when u do n't understand anything in this life then that is what i call an abuse to life it self , life gave you this amazing gift it a called a brain try to pay life back with something nice like understanding liveing life it self , understanding is what life is about . i would love to just sit down and understand all day long but like i told u we come in diffrent size and shape . understanding is a privlige and a gift u should benifit from it .
