generally it is argued that what student should understand . the idea and concept ? or fact ? even though fact are crucial for learning , the time of learning fact is not the time of being student . during being student , idea and concept should be learned . facts come after idea and concept . if you do not understand the meaning of idea and concept , you can not realize the fact or you can not comprehend the fact . for example in food engineering department when the lecture teach student about the haccp ' fact , after graduation upon working , this teaching lead to problem such a making the product decay . the fact always change under some circumstance . while it is true that the fact are very important to learning , idea and concept are a important a fact . they force student to think analytically . in this way student can gain their analytical ability . therefore they can consider problem with a different perspective when they encounter the problem . they can find the fact with using their analy the above said lead me to conclude that during student life understanding idea and concept is very important for student .
