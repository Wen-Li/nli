ya , i definately agree with this statement . particularly i believe that , the sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . in this aspect , a sucessful people mean that , they already familiar with most of the issue . they mostly concentrate mainly on new invention or new thing to show that or to prove that they are also good in all the subject or thing . that too , the selected thing mostly will have greater risk and fluctuation . but , his/her sucess mainly depends on acheiving the selected thing or goal . in my view the sucess in any person hide mainly in selecting the new intersting thing and the way he/she acheives it . even if he/she fails in trying new thing , they will be well known that , the method he/she adopted is a wrong one , and he try for the another . and i strongly believe that , mostly sucessful person try new thing rather what he/she already know how to do it well . right ? if the same known thing happened to do repeatedly , he / she may get sucess in that particular thing only , and he/she connot try a new thing . in this senario , how can one think that he/she is a sucessful person . and i strongly disagree with the statement that , successful people do or attempt old thing what they alredy know how to do it well . the sucess in trying new thigs and acheiving them , prof him a more successfull person than before . getting sucess in new thing that are risky prof him/her a lot a a successful person rather in successing the same in a well known thing and which is not risky . let u consider with an example , now we all well aware that , thomas edison ha invented electric bulb . he adopted several experiment in the procee of invention of electric bulb . earlier all of his experiments are failure . but , atlast he succeed in his invention and also learns that all his failure are the wrong method that shaould
