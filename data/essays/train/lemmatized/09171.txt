in the last couple of decade , - uninvited - the field of advertising ha expanded vastly into the everyday life human being . no matter where people are ; at their home , on the street or in a movie theater an advertisement will be waiting for them to promote a commodity , no matter how good or bad it is in reality . given that the power of advertisement is obvious in our age there appears to be no reason why it would not be able to sell product which do not deserve to be bought , given their quality and price . thus the advertisement often do make product sold by making them seem better than they are . the first way of making a product look good is the use of clean image and role model , introducing the product a a saver of the individual . for instance in wax commercial the product seems to remove all the hair from the body never to return . the viewer see the image of a top model who probably never had much body hair at all , looking at her eye and telling her that she could be smooth like her if sheused the product . imitating someone we like or trust is an old habit of human being , thus the customer buy the wax and in a few month she realizes that the wax actually feed the root of the hair and just a few week following the epilation she will have even stronger body hair , harder to remove . the second way that advertising make bad commodity sold is repetition , so a to say the frequency of commercial . whenever a new product is introduced to the public the advertisement are shown dozen of time in such short time to brainwash the viewer and finally making them think why they remember this product so well . in time they begin to believe that they remember it probably because it is a good and they feel the urge to try it at least once . that is how they go to the mall and grab the advertised product . a very good example of this can be observed in turkey where the singer ajdar ha sold hundred of thousand of his album just because his rather funny song were repeated in almost every 2 hour on tv , while the turkish popstar tarkan suffered from a conflict that existed between him and his advertising agency and barely sold fifty thousand with his flashing album . advertisements are everywhere wheter for the bad or for the worse . they have already sneaked into the mind of the consumer with the support of a long history of visual communication skill and trick . therefore it seems like anything that is bought for any price may not be the best choice .
