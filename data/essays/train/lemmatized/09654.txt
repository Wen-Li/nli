as always , people have been enjoying their life in their own way and value . i think this is true kept constantly for a long time and for good from now . additionally , i belive that life is always joyful thing wherever it is over time . first , if anything this is a delighteing era unlike the period our parent got through the diffucult time in the past . there are many activity and the resource that old people can enjoy around u in this comteporary era . for example , we , recently can meet some movie focused on the old person and it is most remarkable change of our culture considering the fact that the movie usually belong to younger people . and we can also know that there are many active community built byr the old and for the old . these facility , absolutely help them to enjoy thier life . secondly , i am compelled to emphasize the improvement and the development of medical area . this big improvement acheiving over time make it possible that human can live longer enjoying their life when they become older . personally , my father is 95 year old and my mother is also over ninety . even though they are quite old . they go out to play golf and swim regular basis . to tell the truth , i do n't need to even show my parent ' case . probably , other people can also find old people who still enjoy active sport around them . i believe that all of these is possible due to the regular check up in the hospital and assistant of cutting edged medical science . thirdly , is it really true that young people enjoy life more ? of course , i admit they are usually healthier and have a lot of energy which is admontly advantegeous for enjoying life . but we also should know and realize that they are short on experience and some people are callow youth , which lead them to some mishap and fall in to bad and serious temptation that are located in our society . for example , everyday we meet the news that young people ruin their life due to being footloose and the behavior with abandon . so , younger age is not only good age for enjoying life but also careful age for avoiding the unpredictable result of enjoying their life . conclusively , i do n't agree the idea that yonger people enjoy life more than older people do .
