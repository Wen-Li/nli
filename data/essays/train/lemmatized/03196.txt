overall , i agree with the statement . progress of individual and of society a a whole ha always been based on taking risk and exploring new option . not only would the known world not include america , had christopher columbus not taken the risk of sailing thousand of mile in a frail little boat , we would also still be traveling on foot instead of using car , plane and submarine . while trodden path can tak u through everyday situation , success requires u to see and , more importantly , use oppotunities . however , the key to success is not taking every possible risk , but to recognize and take those risk that one can benefit from most . a successful manager will not avoid risk , but rather weigh them against their potential benefit and then decide to his best knowledge . a successful general will not seek to avoid confrontation but choose a battlefield that give him advantage over his enemy . on the other hand , someone driving at night at a high speed without headlight take a considerable risk without apparent peronal benefit and might be called a stupid rather than a successful person . taken together , i think that an intelligent balance between risk and benefit distinguishes a successful person from the average or outright dumb . simply taking risk doe not .
