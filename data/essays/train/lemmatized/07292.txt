yes i do agree with the statement first reason is that the idea are source for new invention . if we face a problem , then we will make our mind active and start to find out variety of solution for the problem by doing this we will get lot of idea and they will be more useful for u for the solution . the concept give u the clear vision of the problem that is the way in which it should be solved and even we can add new concept for it with our new idea . the idea not only give u the solution but also a perfect meaning to the problem . every problem ha a concept which is naturally made by u but when new concept are added to the problem , then the problem can be made more easy to solve . for example if we want to solve a mathematical problem which consists of twenty step to get a perfect answer . then we will start solving it by different method that we get by our own idea , here the fact will have only one solution to the problem but when we use different kind of concept and make different idea we can get the solutiohn within ten step . the student have the ability to think more fast and accurately a their vision will be always concentrated on developing new idea and concept rather than the fact . mainly the young student will get more idea and variety of concept . a the fact will be always the same and there will be no change or alteration can be made in them . the idea will eventually increase the strenght and personality of a student . for example the scientist 's will have lot of idea and concept but not fact because they will invent the thing by their imagination . these imagination are retreved from new idea but not from the fact . the most important thing for a scientist is the concept in which he invents the thing . if he go with the fact then he can not invent new thing a the fact will give same old invents . hence the student ha to give more and more importance to there new idea and concept . finally fact are always fact but the idea and concept will give more enthusiasm to work on and find new concept . hence i strongly recommend to give more importance to idea and concept rather than the fact .
