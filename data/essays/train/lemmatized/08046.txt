people have different opinion whether traveling with group and guide is good way or not . i strongly believe that travel is in a group with tour guide is more beneficial because we can save time and money and also that is safety . let me explain for supporting my opinion . first of all , traveling with tour guide who is already know about travel place allow u to save time and money . even though some people worry about tight schedule of group tour , i think that economical advantage is eclipse the weak point . for example , suppose that you travel around where you have never been before , you might be lost road and you do n't know where is best place for traveling . so you need to solve the problem . considering limit time on unknown place , all of thing you face with problem is waste of time and money . if you travel with tour guide , you could le the heavy problem and you could save time and money because guide will lead where they already know and where is best place for travel . next , travel with group and guide allow u to safety . although that is unappealing when it come to challenging aspect , in strange area , the most important thing is safety . for example , if i go to where i have never been before , there are possibility to be exposed to dangerous thing . without assistance of tour guide , i could not avoide that . in addition , a i include in group , i feel more comfortable and stable because there is le chance to be a suspect ' target . if i really want to challenge in other country , i would like to travel where i have already been . therefore , a far a i concerned , keeping my self is the prioty thing for traveling . in conclusion , i prefer to travel with others because of saving time and money , and also i am worried about my safety . moreover , in circustance under safety , i can really enjoy for traveling .
