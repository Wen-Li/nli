some people can belive that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however i strongly belive that it will be the oposite of this opinion . i will give some example to support my desicion in the following paragraph . firstly , if we want to do a prediction , we have to look and learn from the past . for example , at begining of this century there wa a limited number of car . even the car is used only in the war or in the millatry service . begining of 1950 the car ha entred our live and it become most valuable thing that we have ever had . indeed between this small period of time the number of car wa ingreasing enourmously . today , even more car ha become and more and more take place in our live . the amount of car also are increasing more rapdily than before . i think it increase exponentialy rather than linear . secondly , car ha an social effect of our live . people belive and jugde people if they have lot of beautiful car . people start to believe that the number of car is realated to the richeness . as a result riche people buy more car and they change their car frequently . as a part it is very normal that the number of car is ingreasing rapidly in our community . at the end , the technology is growing rapidly . it ha an tremondous effect of increasing number of car . i think in the future we will see the car not only in the earth surface but also we will see in the sky also . in conclution , i strongly belive that in the near future there will be more car than we use today .
