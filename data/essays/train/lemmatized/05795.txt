i totally agree that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . professionals use good packaging , good image to make that product attractive to u . furthermore by the help of commercial we get use to them . good packaging make product seem better . we are always affected by the big , colorful , fancy and bright thing when we are trying to make a choice between two different thing . we also choose what look nice a a package , but sometimes the result can suprise u . when i wa a chind i wa given a chance to select the president i want from two different choice . i chose the red one and then when we opened the box i realized that the light yellow ugly wrapped one wa a better president . packaging in advertising may make you select wrong choice . seeing good outcome of that product in advertisiment campains may not be correct . we are all afected by the image of that product but infact there may be nothing to do with that image and the product . for instance , we sometimes see an advertisement about a product and we think that if we wear that shoe we can jump a much a the basketballer . but infact it is not true that what advertisement show a , it show u that product is a super product and it can help you jump more ofcourse it is not true . professionals in advertisement business are using medium to show u and remind u that product more often then we get use to that product . as the time pass we slowly start to think that , it is shown everywhere , everybody is talking about it so it must be a good product . i remember when i wa affected by a shampoo adertisement because i wa seeing it on every wall and watching it commercial each night . when i bought that product i realized that i wa not any better that the regular shampoo furthermore it wa not making my hair i smooth a i used to have . in conclusion , i believe that professional are using advertising a a dangerous and powerfull tool to influence people 's opinion in order to make them believe that the product is better in one or other way from it competitor .
