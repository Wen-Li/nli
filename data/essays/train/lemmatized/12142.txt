i will agree with the given statement which is given that young people enjoy more than older people do . because the young people are ntrested doing new thing that they had never done before . they will take risk in their life and they think that risk make man enjoy and happy . the young man enjoys lot better than older people because they have no tenstions about their family they are always free from family problem . if they get free time they will think to go tour or bar and restaurant so that they can really enjoy there . one example i can give that if u see if the young man went to the bar or pubbs there we can observe that he really enjoy their life by dancing by singing loudly by commenting the others . he will enjoys and entertined the others where a an old man ca n't do all this thing because he wa having lot of problem and also his age factor because he think that if he do all this thing what the others will think about him . the young man can take some risk but a old man can not take the risk because he always think about his family . for example if a young person who had drunked so much he wa not control . at that moment also he want to drive a car so that thisw risk can not taken by a old person because first of all he think about his family . but a young man have no tenstions . they are alway think about how to enjoy the life . by seeing all the thing which are above we can say that an young man can enjoy more and take risk where a the old man ca n't enjoy a if like the young man and he cant take risk .
