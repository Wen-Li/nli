for me , a a student , i often wonder about this statement . in my school you often have to learn a lot of fact . especially in lesson like history . for example the revolution in france in the 18th century . is it so important to know when every action exactly happened ? i personally think not . it would be more important for the student to understand how it came to the revolution in france and which consequence it had . instead of learning when the king wa killed by the people . i experienced this myself in history lesson . we had a great teacher who always wanted the student to understand the idea and concept of historical action . you never had to learn any date for test but you should have known when all the action had been you are writi then student would be more qualified for their job . because they do not only know thing in theory but also can practice it . on the other hand you sometimes have to learn the fact , because then you would not be able to understand the idea and concept . for example in chemistry or biology lesson . in chemistry you could work with a very dangerous chemical substance , with which you could hurt other student or yourself , just beacuse you did not know the important fact the the substance is toxic . in biology it is quite the same thing . you are not able to talk about animal in a specific enviroment , like a camel , when you do not know any fact about these animal . you would not understand how a camel is able to live in a desert like the sahara , if you had not learnt fact about the camel . for example how it can save water in his body in a hot place like a desert . as a conclusion i would say that it is both important for student to understand idea and to learn the fact . to understand idea and concept , you depend on the fact you have learnt . both side are linked with each other .
