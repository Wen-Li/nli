personally i agree with the statement that in twenty year there definitely will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are quite a few reason to my opinion . the most important one are : first , the global demand on non-replenishable resource such a petrol and diesel , is ever increasing , perhaps the overwelhming growth of the world economy , industry , car , etc ha caused such an increase today . however in twenty these resource will be sparse or too expensive to buy . thus , without the necessary ingredient - fuel , i think there would be fewer car than today . second , phenominal advance in technology and communication will defintely give way to other source of transportation . perhaps air travel , fast and efficient metro ( train ) and other more efficient and cost effective way of public transportation may be the norm twenty year from now . third , the increase in car and other mean of road transportation is a major cause of air and noise pollution today . this is not only causing serious environmental damage but is the cause of damage to the whole ecology - be it flora , fauna , animal , human , etc . such mis-endeavors are causing the governing body of the world to wake up and take notice . i suppose stringent regional and global law will either prevent people from buying car or at the least will restrict them from buying a single car twenty year from now . thus unlike today when perhaps a single person owns multiple car , such a thing will perhaps not be possible in the future . a lot of people may not agree with my opinion . perhaps because today none of the above seems possible i.e. more car per person , no law , etc . however if we all take a pragmatic view and think logically i suppose all of u will come to the same conclusion that there will be fewer car twenty year from now .
