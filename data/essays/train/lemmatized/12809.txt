i believe that young people these day do not give enough time to helping their community . in next few paragraph , i 'll provide reason behind my belief . firstly , young people today are raised in a small family , an average size of 3 or 4 . the figure indicates that young people would have one brother or sister at most . people raised in such environment will take le consideration of others . in other word , they will turn out to be selfish and self-centred . they do not know how to help or when to help others , not to mention their community . 20 year ago , when the average size of a family were anywhere from 4 to 8 , people did not have the perception of young people not helping heir community . young people back then were so used to live in a large group . they were naturally raised in a manner that they would appreciate their surrounding . secondly , young people nowadays are so tide up with their normal duty that they do not have to spare any time for anything else . they are living in a very competitive environment . they are constantly pushed to excel in academic , sport , and etc . whatever activity they are engaged in , they are under constant pressure to perform . natually , in order for them to compete with others , they invest lot of time and resource . i know a 8th grader who finish school at 3 pm . after she come home and had a bite , she go to see a private math teacher . after math , she go to see an english teacher . by the time she 's all finished meeting her private teacher , it 's already 11:30 pm . she come back home at 12:00 am , wash up and go to sleep . she doe this everyday . kids like her just do not have any spare time for anything else . even if they do , they wo n't be able to allocate enough time . due to above two factor mentioned , young people nowadays can not give enough time to helping their community .
