the success depend on what people try . for sure someone who do only one thing and the same thing each day will performe in it , but the question we can ask is will he also perform in other activity if he try it ? it is not really sure . someone who always try new thing is not sure to succed in all this thing . maybe this person will have lot of experience in several activity but he is not good in all this activity or he doe not succed in all the activity he try . for example somebody who try to pas a hard test to have access to a better school he is in but who do not succed or somebody who take risk and setlle a new business which fail few month latter . are these person succussful people ? i do not think so . but this point of view could be wrong for a person who succed in all the thing he or she try . the question is : is this type of person current ? i think that this type of people who succed in whaever they do is extremly rare . that why on my opinion , successful people are the one who can do one or two maybe three thing but who do it very well . as the matter of fact , people who are specialist into two or three activity always succed in it so can be considered a successful people . on other hand we can say that it is because they do always the same thing so ti is normal that they succed . to my mind , successful people are people who work hard to have what they want . they derserve their success because they have worked for it . if they try new thing and take risk to improve their situation or earn more money for example but after they work to have it they will probably succed . so the success depend on the work of people . the more you work , the more you will have chance to succed . without work , you can not go even more far . i really think that the work is the key of the success .
