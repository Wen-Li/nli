its true that young peole do not give much time in helping their community . in my opinion the author 's statement is true . and there are many a reason associated now a day young people are held up with lot more responsibility pertaining to many aspect . some need to look after their family , their elder for this reason few youngster have to attend a job in order to receive certain payment . while these group of youngster are busy working with the welfare of the family few other youngster indulge themselves in planning about their future and career . i a hurry to catch up today world 's pace young people hardly find any time to think about helping the community . people generally think that spending their time in helping out their community is a mere waste a they dont fetch them anything in their life . they feel that instead of wasting their valuable time in helping out their community they could better think about thier own future , they use their time and talent in designing their own future . for the young people to think something about their communiuties they should need some back up or rather some amount of encouragemant through their elder or teacher or friend . in this busy world people rarely think about encouraging someone in something a every one is busy building their own future . man these day tend to act selfish a he doesnt recieve any correct reward for what he ha done . when there is no one to recognise the part of work an individual ha done in turning out his community the man lack entusiasm in taking part in changing the shape of the community ther after . if any individul want to shape his community he ha to recive a lot of encouragement . if this is there trhen may be afew will lend their hand in tunin
