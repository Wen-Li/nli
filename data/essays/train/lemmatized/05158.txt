i like traveling and i have traveled many time in my life . from my experience , although i understand the merit of traveling alone , i agree with the statement : the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . especially i do when the visiting place is unfamiliar to me and the period is within a week . there are three reason for that . firstly , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is much safer than traveling alone . when the place is unfamiliar to you , it is very dangerous and troublesome . if you traveling alone , you should take all the responsibility for what you do ; eat , walk aroud , buy ticket , get a loss , transfer . however , the tour guide can solve almost all of the problem and sometimes the member of the group also can help you . when i wa traveling europe last year in a group , i caught a cold and a member of the group gave me medicine at that time . secondly , traveling in a group is cheaper than traveling alone . for example , the cost of transportation or entrance fee for museum are discounted in a group . thirdly , traveling in a group provide chance to get close each other in the group and that is a lot of fun . but i have an experience that some people quarreled and battled in a group tour which i belonged to . and i think that possible happens when the travel continues more than a week . therefore i added the premise that the travel ` within a week ' . accordingly , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide especially when i visit unfamiliar place within a week .
