the topic in disguise deal with , a person being generalist or a specialist . a generalist is a perosn who ha broad knowledge of many academic subject . a specialist is a person who ha deep knowledge in one subject . i think it is better to have broad knowledge in many subject rather than having specific knowledge in a single subject . a person with broad knowledge in many subject , a generalist , can deal with any kind of subject thought he can not go deep into the subject he ha good amount of knowledge about the subject . so he can deal with any of the subject . where a a person with deep knowledge about a single subject can not deal with different subject a he ha no idea about other subject . it is must to have knowledge of all the subject to get through the exam and attain grade . even in case of getting a job , a generalist ha more chance of getting a job rather than a specialist a a generalist can deal any kind of subject that is given to him . where a a specialist ha to keep mum when asked about any other subject . the company would definately require a multi-talented person rather than a person who ha great talent in a single subject . `` as every coin ha two side '' . we can not always say that having broad knowledge is vital . hence there is a saying `` jack of all trade but master in none '' . a multi talented person with no deep knowledge in any subject can not acheive success all the time . knowledge in depth is required when it come to certain area of science such a astronomy , medicine etc . in these area a person can not sustain with vauge knowledge . it is crucial for a person to have knowledge in depth . else these proffesions would turn out to be disaster . hence what i would like to conclude is , a person must have minimum knowldge about all the academic subject and must excel in one atleast to acheive success .
