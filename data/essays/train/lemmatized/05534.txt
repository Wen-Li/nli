i think against the statemente that young people enjoy life more than older people . to tell you the truth , my oppinion is just the oppsosite for the reason which follows . first , because older people have more money than young people in general , they can some activity that yougng people can not do . they earn money a official of the government , emplyee of company or some else while young people go to school and pay tuition . they can do somethig funny by using this money . let me show an example . older people can dine at famous restraunt or go lugujury trip that is what young people admire but can not attain for economic problem . second , older people feel more on the same thing than young people , because they have more experience . let me talk about my personal experience , several year ago i made a trip to rome with my aunt and see some sightseeing spot . when we go to some place , my aunt suddenly burst to tear and talk me about romance she made with her ex-lover in rome . she surely enjoyed the tirp more than me thanks to this romance . certaily , there are somethings that are said to be enjoyed by young people . for example , love . of course , love we made in our youth is sweet and precious momory for all of u . but who decide older people cannnot make love ? older people can make sweet love in the same way a young people do , and get wonderful memory . besides that woule be more enjoyable for their experience a i showed in the third paragraph . for the reason above , i think older people can enjoy life more than young people . they can do something young people can not do thanks to better economic situation , feel more owing to their affluent experience and do the thing that is usualy said a if the privilage for youth sach a love .
