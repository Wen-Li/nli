i prefore to travel with a tour guide exspecially we go to some country and also that is a first time to go there . when we go to some country , we have to speak their language . if we go by ourselve , we have to make a resavation for hotel , and also it 's hard to read and understand the menu in a restaurant . when i went to korea with my friend , we did n't join a tour . we had some guide book that showed famous restaurant and place in korea . when we went to a restaurant , the menu wa written in hongle , not even in english . we could n't read them , so we just point out the menu when they took order . the food wa n't that we expected . we can learn more thing from a tour guide when you go to some historical place . the tour guide know so many thing . there are some guide book to lean those history but sometimes there are not enough to u , and also the book could n't answer the question when we have some question about which we visit . we get more explaination from the guide . sometimes , the guide take u a local restaurant or store where local people usually go . when i went to france with a small group of people with a tour guide , the guide took u the restaurant where he usually go . the food wa cheap and really good . and the other day , he took u to a little town in the countly-side of france . it did n't show in any guide book . there are some winaries and store . we had a really nice time in france .
