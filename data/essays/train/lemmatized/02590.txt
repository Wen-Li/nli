enjoing life ` `` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' in my openion i think it 's not true that young people enjoy life more than older people . happiness doe n't come by age it come by satesfaction you may find a young man who can do every thing he want but at the end he is not happy . or you may also find a young man who he is not happy because he doe n't have the aportunity to get maried and to creat a familly . enjoing life is not about doing thing that will make you feel younger . you may find an old person who he enjoys eech second he spends in this world by seeing his grandchild . it depend through the person intrest . for example my father is an old man who have grandchild but he is enjoing his life by spending time with his family and taking care of his house . his happiness when he see his child and espescialy me because i am the youngest getting high grade in school . this is what happiness mean .
