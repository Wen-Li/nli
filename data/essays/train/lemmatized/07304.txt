i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . learning is a process of memorizing a given context or material . thus is memorizing is usually a short - term , learning fact will be short term a well . understanding a given context , help one to adopt to it a something natural to oneself and thus doesnt require memorizing . understanding a concept or an idea is long term . in my school time , during the mathematics class i wa constantly told by my professor to understand a proof or to understand a theorem , say pythagoras theorem . he specifically told u not to memorize them . the emphasis he laid on understanding wa because even today , 8 yr after , i am asked about pythagoras theorem , i dont have to struggle to remember it . as i understood the theorm and didnt memorize it , it became natural to me and wa embedded in my conscious and thus even today i can recall what pythagoras theorem relates to . another generic example that i can state is that india is cuturally diverse . thus people follow many different cutlures . its often difficult for child to learn why they should follow certain pratices that their religion demand . for example an hindu child would question his mother upon learning that his cathlic friend visit the chruch every sunday morning while he doesnt . the elder would then explain to him the reason or a concept behind the inception of a particular religious procedure which help the child to understand his religion better and cease the doubt that arise out of learning of a religious procedure . the understanding of culture difference not only would help the child appreciate this own culture but of others a well . thus understanding of idea and concept help in clearing out of doubt and foster better and effective learning .
