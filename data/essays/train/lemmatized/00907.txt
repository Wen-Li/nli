this statement is quite extreme . of course there 's people meant to be inventor like edison or da vinci . but those great person were living in another time . the last century have witnessed a large part of the most brilliant invention that can be made . now we 're living in a reproduction era . as we can create we upgrade thing from the past century in order to give them an other utility or aspect . make it thinner , stronger , more attractive or affordable but not revolutionnary . for instance , cinema wa n't invented by one person . it wa a hundred year of effort which gave it it actual shape , which , i think , is far from being the final one . in it first year people find it absurd and reserved to sideshow but daring director made it a real art . from da vinci 's '' camera oscura '' to lumiere 's cinematographe there 's a whole world of experimentation . we need this kind of daring person . how can we know that an object have reached it final shape ? how can we put frontier to creation ? thirty year ago , it seems unbelievable to imagine having a phone call outside . now it 's essential , people ca n't live without cell phone . that 's the evolution process of creation which is a permanent process . it 's not given to anyone to succeed in making new thing . it required courage but also lot of imagination and self-confidence . it 's a huge work on yourself and who you ( think you ) are . inventing reliable thing occurred once in a lifetime but upgrading is possible . we need both kind of people to go on evolving . some are meant to invent , so to upgrade of transform but both are important for our mankind . men ca n't live without creating of he 's giving up the greatest quality he had been given , the quality of dreaming of something else and make this dream come true .
