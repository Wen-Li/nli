today , the world ha grow on a rapid pace with fast development and high technology . through the innovatives of scientist and engineer , car become part of our everyday life . in my opinion , the number of car would increase instead of decreasing in twenty year ' time because car are convenient , traffic system are improving and lack of alternative . on average , each house ha at least two car in my neighbourhood . this example applies to most of the urban and sub-urban city around the world too . i strongly think that car are the most convenient and easy mean of travelling on road . compared to motorcycle or bicylce , it is le dangerous and it could accommodate more passenger . these quality are equally important to the people in future whether the distance between one place to the other is short or long . consequently , the number of car would easily increase . besides , car are undeniably the most important vehicle in the world when it come to travelling on road . as country all around the world racing to develop their traffic system , it is proven that car serve a the best travelling medium . with the government working on way to reduce traffic problem and improving the condition of road to facilitate more car , it is believed that the usage of car are highly encouraged . therefore , more people would remain or resort to car a their main vehicle when it come to travelling . in addition , there is no adequate alternative to substitute the usage of car . due the convenience and easy-accessible of car , many would resort to car instead of other form of transportation . for example , the train . although it is an environmental friendly type of public transport , the construction of the station and railway would cost the government an exorbitant amount of money . it is rather impossible to connect the whole country with train service . thus , car are still the main option for the people in twenty year 's time . despite the forever increasing price of gas or petrol , and also the number of road accident , in twenty year there will not be fewer car in use . with the cooperation between the government and the people , those minor factor could be resolve while the people could enjoy fully the benefit of using car .
