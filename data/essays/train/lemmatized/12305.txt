although i think it 's not possible to make such a strong division between idea and concept on a side , and fact on the other side , i would say i agree with the stament . the reason why i agree with it are mainly three . first , i think understanding idea and concept can be very effective in learning how some pattern can work in more situation , same situation or really different situation . for example : you can study history just a a list of fact , but they are not simply fact , because you may have some very important reason why some event occurred . the two world war , even if extremely different between themselves , show how the imperial pattern , the rush for colony and for money , can be the same . the same pattern , could be applied to many of the contemporary war . once you learn the pattern , the way an event can happen , you ca n't be sure you 'll be able to avoid it to occur , but theoretically you might do something against it . second , i think learning idea and concept can develop a more flexible mind in a student , who will learn how to think when he considers something , who will be taught how to consider certain circumstance not just an event , but a a process created by more interactive element . third , which in fact it 's a postulate of the second point , to learn how to think , how to consider some situation , will teach a student how to watch reality , and how to watch at it in a critic way , which mean to learn in not taking every fact a a truth , but to doubt about it . to learn a critic way of thinking mean to learn how to go deeply inside thing , evaluating why these thing behaved in a certain way or maybe why they did n't , and in fact it mean to learn not to believe in facade of fact too . especially in our time , where the mass medium communication ha a great importance , i think it 's particularly important a student do n't believe just at an event , but learn that the way an event is told can change very much the idea i can have about that event , which mean , they ca n't simply believe how an event occurred , but if it 's true how they say it occured , if it could have occured the way it did , and which mean also to understand if it 's really reliable what they can read on newspaper or what they can see on television . in conclusion , i would say that learning fact it 's obviously important , i ca n't know history , for example , without knowing what happened , but i have to understand why it happened , which mean , to give more importance to idea and concept than just to fact . i think this concept can be resumed by a sentence on auschwitz memorial monument , which say `` whom doe n't know history will be forced to live it again '' , which mean , in my opinion , not who know the fact , but who have understood why something could happen , to avoid it to happen again .
