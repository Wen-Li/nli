it would not be correct to state that in twenty year there will be fewer car than there are today . car ha always been the most widely used mode of transportation while compared to the occasional air , water and rail transport . the availability of cheaper and eco-friendly fuel , expansion and developement of infra-structure , car 's advantage over public transport , availability of cheaper and better car in the market strengthen this claim . price of fuel , which seems to increase minute by minute , seems to be a valid reason that could stop the increase in the number of car in the near future . but extensive research being conducted and other cheap and eco-friendly source of fuel making their debut into the market suggest that the use of car will get cheaper and better showing how much more car facilitates the way people commute . every city , town and villiage in today 's world are urbanizing and the infra-structure expanding which suggests that there are more facility vailable to a person at large . the necessity in the life of a person such a medical care , vacation trip , shopping - to name only a few - are more easily accessible by car . this along with tomorrow 's cheaper and environment friendly fuel form a sound practical reason for an individual to use car . one method of transport that would reduce the rate at which the number of car increase is the public transport . time in today 's world is money . everybody seem to want to reach their destination at the earliest possible time . with a view on the developement of road way in the form of broader road , better connectivity between place , the number of car , mostly the easiest way of transportaion , can only increase . there are many car manufacturer and the competitive nature of the car market is extremly high . this suggests that there will be cheaper , more efficient car available in the market at the near future . thus with this wide array of choice to the buyer , a car , is most definitely the most widely used form of transport and would likely remain so . hence car is likely to remain most widely used mode of transportation while compared to other mode of transport . the availability eco-friendly fuel will improve the current state of our environment . a car would increase accessibility of everyday requirement and otherthus will increase in number in the next twenty year .
