i think the community ha to help itself , it is not only a moral obligation of young people ! what do you mean for young people ? teenagers ? a 30 year old man is still young , but he is not a young man for the community ! all the people have to give time to helping the community ! all the people do not care about the others , only a few people , like the men who go to africa to helping the poor population ! they give all their life to helping the community . as you can see they are not young people , so all the people do not give time to helping , above all the young . but now the society is different , it is not like 50 year ago , there 's been a lot of change , the people need different thing , nowadays a young man need to study , to realise himself ! how can i help a person if i do not feel well ? i have to realise myself , i have to study , sometimes i have to relax , sometimes i need to have fun . young people are a particular kind of people , but i think they are the most important part , they are the future , so they have to realise themselves and a day they will be able to help other people , but not today , it is not the most important thing now ; the old men can help the others , because they do not have other thing to do , now they can use what they learn in the past ! may be in the past the young people had more responsabilities , i do not know , and i can not , but a i said before , the time ha changed , the time is a circle , today it is your turn , tomorrow it will be mine . i 'm young and i 'll have time to help the others , i wish , now i have to care about myself .
