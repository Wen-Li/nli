a number of people have asserted that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community . while the first reaction of some people may disagrees with this statement , there are some compelling reason to explore this issue in more depth . concering the status quo of today 's society , i personally agree with this statement for the following two reason . first , the atmosphere of competition is getting stronger in many field , such a career or study . people treat educational degree with more seriousness , and consequently , people are required to persuit higher degree than past day . nowadays , parent are aware of this change in the society . as a result , they expect their child pay exclusive attention to their study , or specifically , to everything which is helpful to their education . helping the community simply turn to a waste-of-time behavior if it is not beneficial to the study . in addition , the security problem also reduce people 's willingness to help the community . there are more crime or robbery act happened at the dark corner of the street all the time . parents are worried about the child ' safty , and a a consequence fewer and fewer parent or adult will encourage their child hang arount outside a long a the neiborhood is alarme with a signal of unsafty . there is one true example happened to my mom . last year she just walked home after the work , she unfortunally robbered by a young man . her bag wa gone a well a some amount of money . my mother wa terrfying , and she started warning me that i have to come home no later then six o'clock under on circumstance , and tried my best not to hang around the community becasue it wa very dangerous . all of the reason have influenced my perspective concering this issue . with no doubt , there is also an argument to be made for the opposing position on this matter . nevertheless , with the reason i have presented above , i believe my argument is built on a solid foundation .
