vehicle prefrance in order to travel is usually a problem for the people . people used animal like horse , camel for traveling but with the rapid growth of technology nowadays people are in love with car . in my oppinion people will reduce the usage of car in twenty year because the air that we breathe is getting dirtier , the oil that we use in order to get energy for car is reducing and technology is still improving rapidly so there will be more appropriate vehicle for transportation in the future . first , with the usage of car the air is getting dirtier day by day , the carbon monoxide , emitted from the turbine of the car , is polluting the air . in some country like the netherlands government started to encourage their citizen for using bicycle in order to travel . by riding bike people , not only will get fit , but also they will breath more clean air . second , and the most important reason for my expectation in reducing car usage , is the oil resource will vanish in the future . more and more people are using car nowadays but our source for oil is limited . the oil reserve are becoming le that is why the oil price are getting higher . in my country some people can not afford buying the oil in these price . they have car but they are not able to use them because their financial situation is not well enough to buy oil so often . third , the scientist will find more suitable vechiles in order to travel in the future . in an article i have read , i saw that some research in the us did find a vehicle which can fly a well a riding on the ground . so with the developing technology some other device can take the place of the car in the future . tu sum up , i think le people will still be using the car in the next two decade . you will think that the car are safe , econemical and fast but they are also leaving a bunch of carbon monoxide for u to breathe , the oil price will get higher day by day and the technological improvement will make faster vehicle . so in my opinion people will forget their love towards car in the future .
