i believe with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . primary reason for such attitude would be drastic change in their lifestyle , constant peer pressure , too much focus on shaping their own carrers and change in social value . i would take some of these issue to prove my stand . young people are now under the effect of corporate culture everywhere . whether this be their schoo , home or office . this demand them to be at their best everytime . they are expected to be first in their class , decide startegies of business management , earn money . all these lead them to focus more on shaping their own identity and rather contributing towards their community . young people put in much more effort in term of physical work then being put up by people of same age generation ago . this leaf them absolutely with no time for contributing towards their community . with such mad rush behind money , young people have become highly self-centric . they are not worried about suffering of their community , let alone doing something to remedify it . young people with their living habit , social setting and behavior pattern like to remain detached from everyone else . leaving community , young people find it difficult to communicate with their parent and family member . this is not just because of communication gap but a well they are not concerned about their state . in most of the case they are non existent for them . with such apathetic attitude towards their parent , spending time for their community can be easily ruled out . idea to help and connect is dying . a perfect example of this could be of how we like to make new friend through internet but young people are hardly aware of suffering of r next door neighbour . perhaps an example of apathy of young people towards their community can be best seen with recent katrina hurricance in america . there were hardly any initiative being taken by any young people . hence people do not give time to helping their community .
