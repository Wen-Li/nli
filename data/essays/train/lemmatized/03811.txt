yes i do agree with the statement above that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . advertisement wa created whenever business wa first developed . to be able to sell a product , first of all , a salesman must show you an exceptional image that pair with the product . for instance , a brand of make-up product commercial on tv would have the most beautiful model you have ever seen just to attract your attention , the point is to brainwash people 's mind and make them believe that buying this product would make them look exactly like the model on the advertisement . secondly , a salesman must show you how good the product is , for another example , a type of fast food company would show you how big and juicy their burger is by making one abnormal large size of burger to appeal on the advertisement to send a message to people that the majority of their burger ' size are just like that . finally come to the joke-type advertisement . most people fall for funny commercial , humor make a different in people 's opinion about the product . just like there are two guy , one is funny , one is dull , which one would you be friend with ? advertisement took the advantage and tried to make their commercial funny so it attracts people . they no longer need to lie , no longer need to make fake image or pay top model , all they need to come up with is a funny idea and apply it into a commercial , such a the body spray company . it smell good , fact . it attracts woman , semi-fact . all they need to do now is to make it funny and attract most young adult to buy their product . they are getting better at advertising every year , but the truth is , advertisement will always make product seem much better than they really are ,
