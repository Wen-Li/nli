in my point of vew a a young person i would say that , obviously young people enjoy life more that old people do because all the advantage that you have a young person in term of movement , flexibility , energy to do thing , how enjoyable thing look to you etc . also to me it seems borring how the older people live and this is in part for how the tv and the society present u , ( young people ) , how we should live life when we grouw up , no more playing arround and doing fun thing but working and working all day to get to your home and only sleep . from the other side i shuld n't be able to say exactly which of both life are better enjoied , because a i said i am still a young person and i do n't know what is to live a an older man and what activity do they have to enjoy themselves because a all the different par of live there is alwise something to entretain you , for example when you are a baby what you enjoied most wa all the little teddy berars , when you are a kid all the toy and little car made you enjoy life , when tou are a teenager the videogames came to your life to stop your borring aftrenoons and night and now at my age what i enjoy most and what make meenjoy life is to hang out with my friend , have some drink and arrive late home . as i said previously futher on in life there should be some other thing that entretain you in life and not only base it in work , thigs such a real car , woman and even get married and have some kid to form a family and to able to mantain it and see your child grow , and maybe when you are and old man your entratain would be that your son and grendsons come to visit you and your wife every weekend . in conclusuon i woul 'd like to say , that is imposible to determine which , young or old people enjoy more life , it all depends in what you do in your life , and simply that enjoy everithing you do .
