i fully agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know . taking risk to achieve something big is what these successful people believe in . they have big dream . they feel that without taking risk they can not fulfil them . they are not afraid of failing and they expect positive outcome from these risk . typically the people who fall under this category are the bussinessmen . for example to sell his product a successful businessman would use a method like this . he doe the entire campaigning and advertising of a new product that he ha to sell in a different way . he keep offer for his customer like `` buy one and get one free '' .so by doing this he attracts the customer to his product and thereby increase the sell . he doe n't think about the money that he is going to spend by keeping such offer but he think about the money he is going to make by using this `` buy one get one free '' offer . so the risk here is to give such kind of offer . so this is the outlook of a suuccessful person . they see the positive side of everything . they actually do the same thing but they do it differently and thats what make them different from a ordinary person . now if we think about a not so successful businessman in the same situation he would n't have taken the risk of giving big offer from the fear : what if the customer dont buy my product ? i will be doomed . so he would follow his usual way . even if there is no loss there is no extra gain is what this businessman think . but the successful businessman doe not fear about the loss and consistently think the big profit incase his idea succeeds .
