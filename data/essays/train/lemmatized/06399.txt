everyone can enjoy life whatever the situation is , how old they are and how much money they got . the important thing is that if a person is aware of enjoying time is an essential of his/her life . in my opinion , i strongly believe that the young people enjoy their life more than older people do . i am going to explain my reason of this belief in the next section . firstly , young people are more open to new idea and mostly they are willing to try new thing that they did not experience before . trying new thing like paragliding , a game , swimming in cold water make someone 's life more excieted . having fresh body may also help to exhibit these new offer and wish . since the action is more easy event in the youngness . secondly , young people have not so much responsibility like paying house credit , buying newer car or going to more expensive place for dinner . thus , they can take more risk than normally older people do . then they can move more easly then older people do since they have not settled down totally . adventuring new place also give pleasure to everyone . a cheap trip to north america is an opportunity for young people while an older person would asks which hotel to stay , how long vacation is need . lastly , young people do not have proper job , and they have plenty much time for doing something else . assume that , i have plenty time to spend on my own . i would like to do my staff that i have already delayed but after finishing them i probablt will be get bored and think about what to do else . this brain storming give new idea to try . but this need time to do and all other staff should be completed before it . despite of having enough money and being mature enough , i believe that young people enjoy their life more than older one do in the way of i tried to explain above .
