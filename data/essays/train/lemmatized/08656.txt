after pondering this question thoroughly and prudently , i finally reach the point that it depends . if a student want to go directly into the workforce after graduation , it 's may better for him to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . on the other hand , if another student want to become a specialist in a given domain , i think he 'd better specialize in that one specific subject . nowadays the number of college student who hunt for a job just after graduation keep increasing . mainly because they are aware of that different job require different knowledge or skill . some job require a student can use a computer fluently and skillful , some may hope a student to be capable to speak different kind of lauguages , and some others may just use those whose have the intensive ability of coorporation and sccialization . to mee to various requirement of job , student should have broad knowledge of many academic subject . take my sister for example . before graduation , she did n't know what job exactly she wanted to pursue . but since she had broad knowledge gained from many subject in college . she sent innumerable application to very diverse company . guess what ? all of those company said ok to her . and then she could choose the best one from them . but if a student , like me , dream of becoming a specialist or even a scientist in a certain realm , he should and must specialize in that one specific subject . the foremost reason why i said that is , only this way , can a student make great consentrate on that one subject and learn more about it . like me , i always think i will becom a specialist in ee , so , now i put all of my focus and energy on that subject . by doing more research and reading more refference book of that subject , i obtained a profound understanding about it . although i ca n't assert that i am a master today in ee , i have took the most significant step to be a master i think . taking into account of all that mentioned above , i draw the conclution that this question depends .
