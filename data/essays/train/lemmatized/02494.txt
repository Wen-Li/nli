a far a i concerned i agree with the statement successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know . first we think that who are the successful people ? how they success ? is there any special trick or any other possibility ? so many question are arrived in our mind . let we know about successful people mean who succeded in doing thing . how they succed in doing thing ? they have the strong determination that `` must and should i will do this work '' a far a possible . they are not compromising at any where in the work . one thing we have to remembering that all successful people may not be a perfect . definitely it is true the successful people be in a good position and have a good respect . rather than these people some of u are doing thing repeatedly , that mean they do thing what they know only , so there is no chance to implement their view and idea . they are at a place where they are in the previous and all at a time . successful people also doing thing wrongly . but there is a difference that when they do thing wrongly they will find where they will do wrong step and correct them and succeded . for example if we are reading a theorem they thought that how it came , who will be derived this , is there is another way to do this on this they will refer many book , article , newspaper , and in many other source . at lost they will find the answer and with this appropriate answer they gain more knowledge , they have the capability to implement their idea in many oter way . finally i conclude that the successful people try newthings and take risk is best due to this they had the capability of doing thing , they will improve their knowledge a no one can expecting and have many oter advantage than doing thing repeatedly what they know .
