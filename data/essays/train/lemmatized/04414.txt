it is of my opinion that helping community is quite important for me . with the concerning of the young people may not have enough time to devote themselves to helping their communites , i have several reason and solution a the following first , young people are energetic than the elder , they spend a lot of time in studying a well a playing . they learn all the time and have the will to learn . if they are asked to manage thing with their neighbor , they will not refuse and hesitate to do . in this prime time , young people like to help with each other to solve the problem . next to go would be , the definition of the community may not simply mean the surroundings they live . it can also be inferred the place they study and work . young people like to join club and learn something new in order to satisfy the thirst toward knowledge . they concentrate with a specific field and lauch their effort to achieve their ideal goal . all these accomplishment need time and thier endeavor . moreover , they learn in helping . such a decorating a club center , recruiting new blood to the club , and even taking care of the sick classmate or neighbor preoccupied with business . however , though they are so active in their community affair , there definitely are blind spot that they probably fail to focus on . for example , young people who live outside may encounter the gap between them and their family . for example , when i wa an undergraduate who live far away from family , being not able to go home per week make some communicational problem with my family member . as a whole , young people do have enough time to helping thier community . t
