some people may think that the current usage in car is not sustainable from an environmental reason . however , i disagree to the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year time , based on increase in the world population and improvement in the quality of life among the developing country . first , the population of the world is growing on a continuous basis , and it is not sensible to assume that number of car will not grow at least in a linear manner , simply because car is necessary for transportaion . facing necessity , the environmental issue need to be dealt elsewhere , not by decreasing the number of car , but by replacing the car with environmentally friendly fuel . the current development in the area of battery and solar energy seems promising . second , many third world and developing countires are growing rapidly . 15 year ago , car wa owned by limited number of people in china . today , road in big city like shanghai are congested with car and you can barely move . buying car is a current new trend in china among young people . they have become able to purchase car because their income basis ha improved . countries in the middle east and russia are following the same situation . going forward , country from africa is expected to follow . people have a necessity to transport , and once you obtain a certain level in your quality of life , it is extremely difficult to lower them . i believe that the only possibility to have le car in the future need to come from a technological invention that replaces car to other type of method . however , twenty year is a relatively foreseebale future , and the fact that we are not aware of any invention lead me to believe that car will keep on increasing in the future . therefore , i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today .
