in student 's life learning is very important ; the tipical day of a student consists mainly of learning . although almost all student learn a lot and consider learning an essential factor , it is important to analyze how they learn . that is , one should consider the objective and the focus of a student who is learning . quite often student learn new topic but forget them after a while . the reason for this might be the way how they were learning . in my opinion , it is much more important for student to understand idea and concept that is it for them to learn fact . in the following i will give reveral reason to support my statement . firstly , learning doe not mean learning by hard , that is `` memorizing fact '' , but understanding of idea . if a person learns by hard , he will tend to forget the notion learned a soon a he doe not need or treat them anymore . secondly , learning should not just be finalized to get high score in a short time , but should enable student to apply the concept they have learned and extend them also to other situation . tirdly , learning constitute the basis of research . in order to be able to make research in a given area , it is essential to understand all what is connected to it . if i consider my experience , i think that understanding idea is really essential for your profession later on and i would suggest to support student . for instance , common discussion help student to verify if they understood a concept correctly or not . in some other case , it could be helpful to apply a concept in a study , in a use case or in the laboratory . in summary , i am convinced that learning fact is not sufficient for student . it will not enable them to proceed on their own in an area . on the contrary , i consider understanding of idea and of concept a beeing essential in the learning process .
