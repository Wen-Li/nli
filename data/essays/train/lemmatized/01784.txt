i agree with this statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they alredy know how to do well '' . i support my answer by giving a simple example . consider the case of micheal faraday , the person responsible for today electricity we are enjoying . if he think like a common man that the light we get from the candle is enough , we would not have enjoyed all the benifits we enjoying today to lead a comfortable and a peaceful life in this present it world . he started his assumption that oppositely charged electron can travel towards each and finally he struggled a lot and shown the world that electons can travel and enlightened u not only with the his theory but also with his innovation . without faraday there is no electricity today . he crossed all his way from the abuse of the critic to a person who ha become a father of all electrical engineers and who made all the life of the world comfortable today . so can you disagree with above statement after coming across faradays life ? is it not risky working with all the electrical element a a play toy ? look at another example of yuri gaugarin , who is the first person to step on to the moon . is he not adventure by totally taking risk and going to the space which is a lot and lot of million kilometer away from the earth ? i think in this way he could easily recorded a a successful by taking risk of his life . i think by this example you can totally agree with above statement that `` successful person take risk to do innovative thing . these people dont do the thing what we do , they simple do thing what they feel like doing and finally they are the people who lead the world . if you the example of a successful business technique now adays they simple do advantures or take risk in introducing new innovative product that are likely to be welcomed by the customer . so i conclude by saying that now adays people welcome change than the regular stuff we use everyday from the clothes we use to the eatable we use . so i feel like sussful people are in major proportion in people who do thing in not a regular the others do .
