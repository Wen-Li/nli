i agree with the statement , that there will be fewer car in twenty year for the following reason : the first reason is that the price of petroleum is still rising in the long-term , because crude oil is getting more rare . so , because the price of petroleum is getting higher , driving is getting more expensive over time . in twenty year , the price of petroleum will be much more higher than today . maybe , the car then will receive their power of other raw material , but today , it is not sure that there will be a substitute for petroleum in twenty year , which is a functional a petroleum . another argument for the decline of car are city . because people still migrate from the countryside to city , they are getting bigger and bigger all over the world . as the city are growing , the traffic chaos is growing too . today , in many city it is much cheaper and faster to use the public transportation such a metro and bus . this effect will get stronger over the year a the city are growing . the other point is , that le people will live at the countryside , in region , where a car is a necessarity for the daily life . the pollution of the environment is the third reason why the amount of car will be smaller in twenty year . as long there is no other source of power invented , petroleum will be used in car . but in these day the concern about the environmental change in the last year are getting bigger and it is proved that the burning of petroleum contributes to some effect for example the lightening of the ozon . so probably stronger environmental law will be made , which could have affect on the amount of car driven if they make it more difficult or more expensive to drive . because of the reason given , i think that there will be fewer car in twenty year than there are today .
