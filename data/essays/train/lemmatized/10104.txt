the answer of this statement depends on personal life exxperience and different culture background . some people agree with travelling in a group meanwhile others have a negative attitude . howere , in my part , i prefer to make my trip alone than in a group a my inclination . among countless reason , there are two conpicuous aspect a follows . the main reason why i disagree with the statement is that it is not helpful for cultural exchange . if you join a group you can only go to the place which the tour guid lead s you to and hve no free time to communicate with the local people . in contrast , travelling alone you get the access to the local people ' s life and culture . trought talinking and living with them , you hcan shre different culture and perspective on life . that will only present you a new culture or tradition of life , also cast a new light on your old viewpoint on the culture and world . there is another reason deserves some word here . travelling in a group led by tutor is a waste of money in some condition . becuase the guide depends on the money you spent on the trip to survive . they usually convice the traveller thing that have no value become the necessarities and buy them . in contrast , if trvalling along a person can use computer to get the information about the unkown place . through internet a traveller can find thing they rreally need , such a local tasty food , the ticket for museum and other basic necessiries . they save money and spend for the trip . of coures , travelling in a group also have a couple of advantagges . in some area , travelling with a tour guid is much safer than alone . and safe is the foudation of every trip . but the disadvantage carry more with than advantage . based on the aboe reason , i can easily come the conclusion that i disagree with make the trip in a group led by tour guid .
