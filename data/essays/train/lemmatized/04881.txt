it is difficult to open a newspaper without being faced with a new comment on what will happen in the future with car . nowadays , everybody have their own car , and they use it to go anywhere . no matter the distance , they need to go by car . but they do not have a normal car , they have the best one . today lot of young people use their saving to buy a new car while they have not paid their house ! is this issue really that important ? it is a it ha divided society into two different point of view . on the one hand , a large part of society hold the opinion that car are a positive thing a they reduce the time people spend at the bus stop . they argue that they do not have to go to the bus stop , then wait there for , more or le , twenty minute and finally get off the coach and walk during a long time until their destination . going by car let them go faster from their home till where they need . besides , having a car give them more independence . i mean , they do not have to depend on the schedule of the public transport when they make an appointment . on the other hand , others feel that so many car in the town ha many drawback . for instance , the number and duration of traffic jam is increasing . not only the big city support this problem , but also the small city that can not afford with all those car . moreover , the pollution is becoming a seriously problem . the atmosphere is being damaged by the pollution . so we have to be responsible with the environment in order to save our child 's life . on balance , the number of car is increasing each day . that is why i do not agree the statement . i think that in twenty year there will be more car in use than today , in spite of the development of plane , train , and so . the automobile industry ha had an enormous development during the past two decade , and the demand of not only simply car but also luxury car is increasing .
