this philosophic question , to know who is enjoying the more life between young and old people , is a current one . an often answer is that olders have more experiment , and had to solve more problem , to reconize each new hapiness moment and enjoy it a it should . but , i do n't think so , because to my mind it 's only a way to not be threaten by our futur . in my opinion , young people are quite naiv and not realy aware of their environnement . for them everyday is a new one , they are n't boried accumulating problem , their owne are essentialy about their boy or girlfriend . .. moreover i think that a lot of olders , like my grand-grand-mother , wa realy traumatished by the second world war . and , even if they did n't done it , their child to . because , in many family this feeling of constent threat and fear from the human genre wa quickly transmited from parent to child . but , nowadays , we could see that all over the world , young try to make extrem action , like being violent , practicing extrem sport , preapering atemotats , drinkng alcool and in many other way . .. so can we say that yongs are happy and enjoy life ? i realy do n't know . my final opinion would be that not more than the older . ..
