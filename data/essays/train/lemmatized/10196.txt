in my opinion this statement is true that successful people try new thing and take risk rather then only doing what they already know how to do well . any new invention start with new thought , new creativity , planing and hard work towards the goal . for example newton , he wa a scientist he gave u a lot of new principle on science but before him no body wa thinking in that direction . after his , people fallow his principle and doing further more for new creation and invention . that is thue trying new thing is better becouse if you sucssed in any concept you will become famous very fast , with new concept you can earn more money and can lead a good succesful life . for that you must be creative for new idea and concept . we can take a example of macdonalds , initialy it wa a simple food chain but due to do right efferts in right direction , and trying some thing new , made them a gaint food chain . so in my opinion succcesful people try new thing , altough there are lot of hard work , passion , time and money required towards the goal . in conclusion i will say that if u want to be successfull person , you have to keep trying new thing rether than only doing what they already know how to do well .
