people often argue about what is more important for student to learn : idea and concept ; or fact . based on my four year of experience a a teacher , i strongly believe that it is far more important for student to learn idea and concept . facts change very quickly , whereas idea and concept remain useful for a lifetime . one of the most important objective of education is to prepare the student for their future career . i believe that student who understand the idea and concept well have a much better chance to succeed in the future than those who simply learn fact . this is especially evident in discipline like science and engineering , where there is very little that one can do by simply memorizing fact . a student who only learns the basic equation about electricity can not solve problem that involve combining various concept or idea . it is far more important for the student to understand the fundamental concept and idea , and develop an ability to make use of these concept to develop his or her own solution to practical problem . similary , in history , it is a lot more important to understand the context of a war , rather than learn the simple fact that the war took place in a certain year . for example , it would be a lot more useful to understand why and how hitler came to power in germany , rather than the date of particular event . another factor that illustrates the relative importance of understanding idea and concept over learning fact is also evident from the rate at which fact are changing . the rapid development in science and technology change the so-called fact at such a high speed that it doe not make sense for a student to spend too much time on learning fact . as a teacher , i often notice that many text-books that i have begun to use for my class only a few year ago have already become out of date ! ideas and concept , on the other hand continue to be valid over much longer period of time . moreover , in many case , it is even possible for the student to apply a concept they learned in one area to some other area . facts , on the other hand , can not be easily transferred from one area to another .
