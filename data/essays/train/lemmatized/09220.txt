the marketing have devoloped very fast , the company every day are discussing what they have to do to sale more and how they can attract more consumer . the advertisement is a good technice to obtain their goal . the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than the really are '' is a true . the advertisement make the people believie that the product are a they show in the television or in the magazine . i have lived this expirience with a shampoo . i have a very curly hair so i need a shampoo that do n't let me see a a lion . when i watch in the television the advertisement of pantenne 's shampo that let your hair very curly but not a a lion i thought it wa the best solution to my hair , so i went to buy it inmediately . the first time i used it wa a dissaster , it did n't work a they show in the advertisement and also my hair began to fall . in that moment i undestood that you can not believe in the advertisments . other example to support my opinion is when i went to isla margarita in venezuela . i chose the hotel that i saw in the web page , it seems very comfortable and beautiful , but when i arrived to the hotel , i wa very dissapointed because it wa n't what i wa expecting . the room wa very small , the air conditioning wa damaged and the food wasn ; t good . the same day arrived i changed to another hotel , which wa spectacular . the advertisments make believe the consumer what they not really are . the company are trying to attract consumer by showing them false attribute of the product and by this way the company will have to replant their advertisments , because it would cause damage in their image and the people will not buy again their product .
