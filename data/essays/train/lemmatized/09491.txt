i agree that people should have knowledge of many academic subject , rather than specializing in one subject . having knowledge of a lot of subject help a person be ready for anything that come up in his life . whether it a problem in math , science , etc. it help a person over come them with ease . if u specialize in one subject , for e.g. english , it is hard to solve a solution in math , therefore finding it very hard to co-op with math . while a having a range of subject , it will be easy to solve . another thing is that having a wider knowledge on more subject , open a lot of opertunity door for a person . if someone want to be a pilot , he need to know math , physichs , and english , but if you are just specialized in english , well math , and physichs will be hard subject to work with . i am not saying that specializing in a subject is a bad thing , but it doe n't give you a lot of oppertunities . also having more knowledge on different subject help a student in college co-op with all the subjets that he/she is doing . while a a person specializing in one subject will find it hard to co-op with the other subject that he/she are taking . specializing is good when a person ha a vast knowledge on the subject that , he/she want to specialize in . in conclusion i find that having more knowledge on a veriety of different subject help the person in real life , and academic purpose . it will reflect on that person a being smart , and being to co-op with many thing in life .
