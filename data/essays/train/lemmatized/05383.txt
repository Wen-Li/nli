study of many academic subject is good ? we usually study many different class when we in the high school , is it really good for u ? study broard knowlege of many academic subject is really good ? i can n't agree with it . in my opinion , study a specialize in one specific subject is more useful . when i wa a child , my teacher aways hold the point that all the child should study all kind of knowledge . but i never think so . in my viewpoint , study too much different knowledge in the same time , i will not concentrat on . i believe that study one thong deeply is suitable for me . and people in the sociaty , thery will find the jib which they study in the university . but if you studay too much academic subject maybe you will hard to find job , the reason is the bos in the company will think that you study too many different academic , you should not study them deeply , so they will not consider to use you at first . and study too much academic subject will also ues too much money , not everyone can do it . i still remember one of my friend she study a lot of subject , but she did not have the good graduated point at last , because she did not have enough time to rewview them . so study many of academic subject may be is not for all of u , and that is also not have such advantage for u , so i decidecid to sudy one subject deeply , maybe is easily for me , and easiler for most of u , we also canhave much time to enjoy ourself , spend more time wih our family , commuincation with each other , so i prefer the second one , study one pecific subject is more useful .
