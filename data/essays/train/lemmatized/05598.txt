i agree the question because the student to learn fact they understand idea and concept . idea is base to learn the fact . for example if i do n't know the concept i do n't understand the fact . perhaps for a limited fact i do n't know the concept but i know the fact but accoting to me this fact are very limited . since we study idea and the theory after we study the fact . another example is the gravity theory : newton since study all theory then he proposed the experiment and after he studied ena known the result of the him theory . there are o lot of example who they suppose my agree for the question . the concept are very important they are interesting for the all fact . in conclusion before to study the fact all person undertand idea and concept .
