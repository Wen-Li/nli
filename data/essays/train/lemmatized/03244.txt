i agree with the given topic that student should understand idea and concept then they can learn the fact when one to know about any thing he ca n't directly learn from them fact because he ca n't undersatnds the fact clearly . fi any one want to know about any thing first we should know what is it and how it doe and so on . .. if any person is asked to do the problem first he understand wat the problem is then only he can do the problem , with out understanding the problem he can not try for that . let me take an example of newton third law `` fr every action there will be equal and opposite reaction '' before leading to the fact one ha to understand the concept better then the fact . for that one ha to undesatnd the main idea of the law . we doe not know the exact fact around that another example take science experiment in lab first the student is adviced to understand the main idea of the problem , so by doing this he can pdo good work in the lab and he can know the fact clearly , wats going on ? . if a bug arises in the program , it is a fact that the bug arrised , but with out knowing the idea we can not locate the where i.e in which part of the program the bug arised . and also if manager see the bug he doent know what to do , he call the programmer who is family with the idea and concept of the programme . this is one of teh fact where the concept and idea are most important , if a student understand the main idea and concept he can be familier with the fact . ther are fact which do n't have the reason one among them is `` burmodas triangle '' here we know the fact that any thing going upon the area is vanished , but we do n't know whats happening there , in this kind if we know the concept and idea cleary some what we can try to figure it out . in our daily life we will be hearing a question `` what the concept you are using to fix the bug ? '' one can unerstand the fact clearly if concept and the idea is clerly known , so according to me one should learn and undersatnd the idea , and concept clearly
