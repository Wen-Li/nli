i completely agree that young people enjoy more that the older people . there are many reason why young people enjoy more . firstly young enjoy more because the have more energy . for example they can go to a disk and can spend long time in dancing whereas older people do not have enought energy to dance for such long duration , the can do the activity but for small duration . another reason why young can enjoy mre becuase thy have a good health and can enjoy variety of food like burger , pizza which older people can not afford a their health doe not permit them to eat this kind of food . another reason young can enjoy more ecause they have more friend and of the same age . they can go for outing , long trip and also risky practice like rock climbing . long drive may include driving bike on long journey which and old person can not do . another point that support my agreement is that young people have curiosity to know anything new and also doing thing which seem interesting to them . for example there is a prgram called fear factor . young people will try to participate in those program and would like to do those stunt but old people ca not take such risk of doing stunt a it may hurt them more . one more point young people enjoy more because they want to experiment everything they see . this is not the case with old people a they might have done those experiment in they young age . for young people many thing thing may be mew but for older one it may not . last point why young people enjoy more that older one is that they ar surrounded by same age group people most of the time , so when their freinds do something intersting they also get a feeling to do tha same thing and sometimes it happens that their friend want them to be a part of such activity and they get involved in the enjoyment automatically . at the end it can be conclude from the essay that young people have many reason to enjoy more than the older one .
