accoding to the adage `` in the middle of risk 's there will be a success '' success ful people will try new thing and take risk . when we call a person is successful ? if a person achieves his goal , tagets , destity by overcomming all the problem , risk , difficulty that he had face then we call that person a a successful person . trying new thing is the common characteristic of a successful person . as an instance mahatma gandhi who is called father of the nation is a big successfull man . he is the person who achieved his goal of getting independence for country between lot of risk . one will be surprised by knowing him how he faught for the country . he had done many new thing during the freedom fight for the country . another instance is mr.murthy who is the founder of company `` infosys '' he is the successful person who achieved his goal of establishing the multinational company , which had changed the structure of the indian market , and had given chance to evolve the computer industry in india . with out doing any risk , or with out trying any new thing he would not achieved this status . success is always with risk , if any one who want to get success in life he should definitely do some kind of risk . in the modren world we are having many sophiticated technology which would not happen with out doing any risk . innovation is another key for the success . trying new thing will give the person a chance to open in that field and create a new thing which can change the life . by trying new thing one can experince a lot more in the life and also will become forerunner for others . we all achieved this modren world by trying new thing for instance advent of internet had changed the world , i think no one would not expected this drastic change because of the internet . finally , in my opinion successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
