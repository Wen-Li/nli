i totally agree with the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community . they pay little attention to the need of their community , acting a if they were not involved . i think there are three main reason which explain this opportunistic behaviour . first , the governements and the school do not promote enough the importance of helping the community . i know only few school which make the social service a part of their curriculum . i think that a soon a possible people must learn that the community service is a civil duty . we all belong to the same society , and therefore we must share the task . that is why school and university should consider the comunity service a a prerequisite to be admitted , and also should induce their student to do it during the accademic year . the second reason why young people do not give enough time to helping their community is that they do not have time . the modern society is mostly based on some value which do not include the community service . the main purpose is to make profit which mean that the main value is money . nowadays the competition is radically increasing and therefore the efficiency is becoming crucial . the sooner you are graduate , the sooner you start to work , the sooner you get promoted , the sooner you make more profit . from this point view , it is obvious that young people see the community service a a waste of time . that is why , in order to resolve the problem , the way of thinking should change . unfortunately i think that this will never happen . the global economy promoted by most of the governements inevitably lead young people to act in an opportunistic way . the only chance they have no to be left out is to be efficient . efficiency do not leave time for helping the community .
