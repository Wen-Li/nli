the difference between the young and the old people i agree that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . because the young people have more aim , plan or work for the future and they have enough time for doing these . the young people are ambitious more than older people are . when they begin to some work they want to finish it but the older people can give up easily . they can live without doing nothing , they can sit or they can listen oldie . but the young people can not live without doing nothing , they always want to produce something , they want to progress . i think the young people do not want to sit like the old people . the young people are so energic but the old people are so lazy because the performance of their body is low and because of this they can not do the thing that make them tired . the young people have got special ability because the performance of their body is high . they can play football , they can swim , they can run fastly but the old people can not do these because of their low body performance . the young people like to watch the tv but the old people prefer to listen to music on the radio . there are many differents programme , magazine , film or competition on tv but on the radio there is only song and talking . with this example i can say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do . the old people want to sleep but the young people doe not like and want to sleep because the young people have so much thing to do . they may have homework , project or meeting but the old people may not have these . recently , the young people put off the important thing of them but it is not true for me because their time is running out , they should know enjoying the life like the young people . briefly , the young people enjoy life more than older people do because they know to enjoy the life , the old people put off everything and do not know to enjoy the life .
