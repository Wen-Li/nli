success in life is determined by the work you do and the amount of time you put toward that work . everyone ha a dream of becoming successful one day and achieving all their goal in life . sucessful people do n't just become sucessful overnight , they work hard and have strategy which they follow very closely . according to me , it is important for successful people to try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . people who have the courage and the will to become successful will take risk . life never work the same way all the time . what one ha learned might not be useful in the real world setting . they might have to change themselves or modify their idea to make themselves eligible for the real work setting . for example , a successful chef that person must have taken all kind of risk . if the chef is a vegetarian chef , he/she would have taken the risk to work with non-vegetarian food . if the chef had only been working on vegetarian dish and never tried cooking non-vegetarian dish he/she might not be a competitve chef . taking risk and trying out new thing make people look and stand out a better and more knowing candidate . trying new thing might not always result in a success but it is worth an experience . it is this experience that teach people great lesson in life . for example , the most famous thomas edison wa asked a question when he applied for a loan to a bank one more time for his experiment which were failing . he wa asked , what is the guarantee that this time your experiment will succeed . mr. edison replied that he ha 228 reason why they will not succeed . this reply show that successful people take risk and fail but still take risk because they know exactly what they are doing and are confident enought to justify everything . if successful people like mr. edison never took risk we would n't have bene able to see these innovative invention around u . success is marked by one 's effort and hard work . in order for those effort and hard work to work a person must be willing to take risk to become a better and a competitve candidate in his/her field of expertise . also , to gain an experience and achieve more in life .
