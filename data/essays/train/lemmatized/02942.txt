i quite agree with that opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are some reason why i agree with this opinion . you can find new interest , new friend and can take advantage to the other people . first , you will find new interest if you studied many kind of academic subject . some university force to student to study only the subject which the student major . it is also important to specialize in one subject , but it must discrease your unknown ability . and it can connect to your future . the knowledge which you studied is never be bad thing but very useful when you graduate from the university . second , you can find new friend . if you take only the subject you major , the range of friend is very narrow . if you major business but interested in history , you should take history class . there are many student who have same interest and you can not meet them in the bussiness department . they can be your best friend and can be good rival in your life . finally , deepen the knowledge about many kind of subject advantage to the other people . i 'm studying english because i want to communicate with many people around the world and get the fine job which have the opputunity to use english . however , there are many people who can speak english in the world . i thought haw can i take advantage to ither people who can speak english . so i decided to study many kind of academic subject . if you have a lot of knowledge , you can get the job which you want to . to broad knowledge of many academic subject is obviously increase your ability and the path which connect to your future . so i agree with the statement perfectly .
