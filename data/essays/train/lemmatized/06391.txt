i can agree with the statement . but we can not see the matter from a single point of view > there are in fact two contrasting force governing the number of car in the world . on one hand , we have western industrial country . their whealthy life style ha to face the problem that the increasing cost of fuel creates > actually many country use more fuel than how much they can produce . for this reason , they buy petroluem by saudi arabia or iraq , who can produce a lot of it . but it cost ha widely increased in the last year due to the tension that terrorism and the isralian situation created . moreover , a a non renewable resource , it quantity will decrease over time . for this reason , i think that in the western country the number of the car will decrease in the next twenty year according to the increasing of the cost of fuel . we can-t forget that in the other hand there are the newly indutrial country , like india or china . this country experienced in the last year a real industrial revolution that brought their whealth to increase . as a consequence , the new middle class in this country began to use it new economical power to express it social status , like the middle class of the western world did before . in this new trend , having a car wa no more a need , but a symbol . but this brought them to face a problem they never faced before , that is the air pollution created by a car . in these country in fact , and specially in china , this problem ha led to physical hillness in the last few year , and in my opinion it will increase in the next . so we could see a decrease in the number of car in order to resolve this problem , or at least we could see the same scenario of the western world to which developing nations could be brought by the increase of oil demand . according to all these instance , i think that , for different reason , there will be fewer car in use than today .
