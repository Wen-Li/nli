the more technology develop , the more people are required to have a lot of work to do . of course , the fact that young people do not want to give time to help their community is a bad happening . however , if they already get streessed out by overloading work , how can they care about their community . first , most high school student living in korea should stay in their school for almost all day . they have a lot of strees to have to enter the good university like seoul national university . they are forced to study hard in a school . actually , the forcing that they should study hard and hard is decreasing lately . but there are still many student who are forced to study in their school from eighty am to ten pm . if they spend most time which they can have in a day on studying , i doubt that they can help their community or poor people , even if they are truely interested in it or want it . moreover , there is another serious problem . most parent and most atmosphere in society have been instructing young people a selfish way . they say that helping other people or communites is useless because that can benefit them . most people estimate a stuff what byproduct it can make , especially money . people think that if some event can make a lot of money , it is definitely worth to consider . but if that can not make money , for example helping poor people , free service for disable people , and aiding senior people , most people tell their child that they do not have to spend their time on it because it will not help thier ability or career . if their child concentrate on it , their parent think their child may not keep up with other student and then they will be defeated in competition . looser mean people who failed in their life . to conclude , it is not that young people do not want to spend their time on helping communites , maybe it is just that their parent and the society do not want them to spend on it .
