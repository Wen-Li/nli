nowadays , competition among company is increasing . companies use any mean possible to make profit . advertisements are used to reach their target and to sell their product regardless the quality . i do agree that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , advertisement present only a picture of product . televisions are one of the main way used by company to conduct advertisement . products seem very great when watching television . there is no way to touch the product . one can not have physical contact with this product . subsequently , it is hard to verify the product 's quality . i recently ordered a cell just by calling the phone number i saw on television during advertisement . the cell phone seemed very good . it had many feature . but , i did return this product because it wa not working . it wa quite different from what advertisement showed . second , advertisement are conducted to make money . companies pay a lot of money to get their product known by customer . televisions or medium in general do not care about the quality of product being advertized . it is therefore a contract between company supplier of product and television company . the contract ha to be fullfiled bu each party . customer ' interest are not really a concern . companies expect to sell their product towards advertisement . most of time , these company will refuse to replace a defective product . customers are therefore victim of false advertisement because of company that are only motivated by making profit . making profit is common . because advertisement make productts much better , customer have to pay more attention . they have to make sure that producs are of great quality . products should therefore be sold with mandatory warranty period in order to prevent customer from false advertisement . this is very important today .
