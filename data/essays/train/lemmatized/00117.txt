i agree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . when we travel to some new place for ex pushkar which is in india , this place is totally new to me and i have no idea on what exactly i should be seeing and look for . the significance of this place is known to me but other then that i have no clue what exactly it stand for . tour guide are those people who will know the in and out of this place and they will have wide range of knowledge about this place and it tourist point . so once when we reach this place and visit place like brahma temple which is one of it kind in the whole world , from these tour guide we will get to know more about the temple , the history , other significance etc . apart from the temple they will take u to all the other place which is famous or ha some other historic standing . and being in a group it always fun because we can have lot of interaction and have load of fun . apart from this if these tour guide are travelling with u from our starting point ( the place where we departed from ) they will take care of all the hotel booking , our lunch / dinner , the number of day we need to stay , the amount of time we need to spend at each place and etc . so we tend to benefit more from them and the extra cost we will have to pay for this will be negligible . when the tour guide is taking care of all the above thing we a tourist can just relax and enjoy the trip . the whole travel is organised in a proper way and it becomes a wonderful experience to be remembered for life long .
