i agree wit the presented statement . the express purpose of advertisement is to induce a change in consumer behavior towards favoring the product presented . most advertisement arises from the need to create product differentiation - a process by which product that are in essence the same ( for example , two hamburger , both are made of bread , meat , cheese , etc . .. ) are presented to consumer a different ( wendy 's , mcdonald 's , burger king , etc . .. ) . product differentiation is necessary in market rueld by monopolistic competiton : several but not infinate supplier , demand is not the only determinant of price . in order to charge a higher price , a given supplier ha to modify his product in the eye of a customer : in come advertisement . soda manufacturer have developed many brand ( coke vs. pepsi ) , small modification on existing brand ( coke with cherry , etc . .. ) and have to keep advertising to create the impression on customer that a branded product is different from , say , walgreens-brand cola , and pharmaceutical company have to convince customer that advil is superior to generic ibuprophen . by it very essence , product differentiation ha to make a product appear better than the competition , desite the fact that they are the same . beyond product differentiatiob , advertisement is used to introduce new product . new product have to overcome consumer 's initial guarding against the unknown using technique such a celebritiy sponsor , or displaying other costumer satisfied with the product ( or wearing the product with a smile ) . the implied message is , you will be like a celebrity or you will have the same smile or be a satisified a the portrayed individual . this in essence make the product seem better than it really is : there is no way a given product by itself can guarantee my satisfaction , a i have to provide a response , determined by my own notion of satisfaction . part of the purpose of advertisment is to modify this notion . advertisement is also prone to `` reporter bias '' , that is , only good or positive result and characteristic are advertised and negative or unfavorable result are of course hidden . if the battery life is poor , no mention is made of battery life . for well known health hazard , warning have been introduced to the advertisement , which is an admission of the fact that the product is being portrayed a beneficial ( marlboro can attract woman , according to commercial , but of course can lead to cancer ) . now , a product can be advertised in a way that is more honest an up-front with the cusatomer . usually , this only happens when this is required by law ( for example , drug ) . however , the very nature of advertisement lead to down-playing the importance of these apparent flaw . in all drug commercial , mention of side effect come well at the end of the commercial , are of course spoken over a powerful image of a satisfiedsenior playing with his grandchild , and spoken quickly and in a soft tone of voice . the underlying message : yes , drowsiness , but who care when you can play with your grandkids ?
