should we study in the specific subject a some people content ? i agree with this point insofar a that a a college student the major course is important for u . however , those people might begs the question by neglecting the fact that the `` ture education '' mean having many different area knowleage . when i face with this situation , i prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic . in one important aspect , studying other subject is clearly accurate in the extent that every subject could connect with each other . they could not stand by their own , for example , without the knowledge about math , chemistry will not do the correct the data from the lab . in addtion , for `` ture education '' the more significant consideration is that in the modern society , we need many differert subject knowledge to have our own become more competitive when facing the development of the technology . any observant person could list the adequate to illustrate this point , consider the development of the computer . if we do not know how to computer , which company might employ u and how we get the so many information around the world ? aside from the two proposition mentioned above , one caveat might come along with having too knowledge of other subject . specializing in our major subject provide the u to get the certain job in subject . the contrary side of board knowledge would mirror a too-narrow view about the true education and it adequate objective . i would admonish that extending the point too far may risk having a chilling effect on the university study . in sum , even though i prefer to have broad knowledge about the different subject , no area of the education could operate in a vacuum . to becoming `` true education '' , we must strike the apt balance between the major study and the pursuit . whether mean of education is justifiable must be determined on case-by-case basis by weighting the benefit of the individual and society .
