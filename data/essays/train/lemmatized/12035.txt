advertisors never tell the truth and nothing but te truth !! i know that advertisors have to make the product seem a good a they could . thus , it 's obvious that they make product seem much better than they really are . let 's think about the task that advertising wa created to accomplish . it should make u , by convincing or persuading , buy a certain stuff or service . to do that , advertisors must use any gate to penetrate into our mind , inspite of the credibility of the presented information . thus they mention just the adventages of the product , and hide any inconvenients . once i wa really impressed by a perfum advertising , and i buyed it . according to the add it 's a long lasting seducer . nonetheless , according to my experience it `` s not lasting . furthere more it can be the easiest way to loose a woman in ten day . ( sorry `` how to loose a woman in ten day producer '' ) . some advertisments could n't be believed at all . i mean those which show thing which are not sensible , nor scientifically accepted . in fact there 's an advertisement on tv which show what they called a leather spray . believe it or not , this spray-according to them - is able to cover any surface of damaged leather leather with the same material . all that in spite of the color and the texture of the leather . one point that i would like to mention is that advertisors are like lawyer . you should n't be innocent just have a good atterney . this rule work in the advertising world . the product doe n't need to be perfect , an efficient advertise would push you to buy it for the first one . on the other hand you will not keep buying it if it doe n't satisfy your need . in a large spectrum of add , truth is the last thing to care about . most of the product appear on the net or the tv screen much better than they could be in our kitchen or our garage .
