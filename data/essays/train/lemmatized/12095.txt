i disagree with the idea . i want to travel alone . i have 2 reason for this idea . i do not have a lot of time to travel . also , i want to visit a much a the sight-seeing place i could go in limited time shedule . the first of all , i work for a company a a full time worker . i have the annual summer holiday . however , it is difficult to spare time for a trip . in this situation , i would prepare the travel before to go travel . that 's why i do not need a tour guide in sight-seeing . i woud read , ask and resurch about this place where i am going to visit . i spend this tour guide fee for extra service at hotel or another service . in addition , my time to stay there is really limited . i do want to visit place which i really want to go . i can not control my shedule when i travel in a group . i will miss some of them if i go with the group tour . also i can focus on visiting when i am alone better than in a group . second , it is not free to move personaly . the tour guide is the controller in the grouop . also i can not change my sheule when we go in the group . i want to go where i want to go . that 's why i would like to go travel alone . therefore , i prefer to travel alone better than a group with a proffesional guide . my time is limited so it is important .
