in twenty year a lot of thing can happen , we can use car more or fewer than nowadays . but if a have to choose i will say that in twenty year we will use le car than today . i would support this answer by saying that in some year we will see some consequence of our irresponsable action towards the enviroment so this could be usefull a a warning that will help people to be more consciense and careful with their action . for example today we are confronting some of this consequence . such a pollution of the air , water , soil , etc , . we are getting many disease , cancer , intoxication also we are finishing with a lot of specie and every specie ha a porpuse or a roll in the circle of life so we are desorganizing it . a good example is the problem with deforestation that we have , tree are leathel because they give a oxigen and many different thing and with out them the circle of oxigen will miss a basic component . in addition in twenty year technology will be more advanced so it would be more responsable . there will be more facility for public transport . public transport is a good solution because we save time by moving a lot of people at the same time , we save money an gas that both are really important and also is le pollution because are fewer car . lets put mexico city a an example , it ha 22 million people a population and most of the have car and a lot have more than one per family , imagine the traffic that they generate this will be follow by a huge waste of time and gas , so in conlusion by using public transport we will save all this problem .
