i agree that there will be fewer car on the road than before a there are many factor that will lead to the decline , if the population is not changed by migration . few factor are , increasing cost of oil , environment pollution , trafffic congestion which lead to delay , parking problem , higher maintenance etc . the increase in cost of oil recently ha made people to look for more efficient mode of travel . the environmental activist are pressing hard to cut on carbondioxide emission , and the successful atlernate to hydrocarbon oil are yet to developed . now in the present circumstance , the city road are unable to handle the pool of car and every commuter is getting frustrated by traffic congestion and ha changed his life style to avoid traffic . they are resorting to public transportation , car pooling or taking up residential unit near to the workplace . one more factor that can contribute to the decline is the le space available in the city for car parking . it ha become nightmare now to find parking specially near corporate office and busy market place . the cost to maintain a car is high and going up when compared to motorcycle , which is prompting many to dump their car in favour of two wheeler a it is helping them to cut cost on fuel , maintenance , parking and above all reduces a lot of time in conveyance . gone are the day when people use to have car , primarily for their social status , a car have become increasingly affordable , a person with average income is able to maintain a car . in my family we use to have three car a year ago , but with unexpected surge in traffic , parking and maintenance we got rid of one car and the remaining two we are using it only when it is required . considering above reason , i feel there will be le car on road twenty year after , than it is now .
