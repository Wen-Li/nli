`` work is the way of life '' this is what i think for any young man / woman . yes i agree with the opinion that young people enjoy their life more than older one . life is a big experience , we encounter various situation both pleasent and unpleasent one , but they help u in maturing our quality to tackle various hurdle in life . in my opinion youth are the one who enjoy their life more than any older person . i always rememeber the day when my grandfather told me to enjoy every part of this young life with full enthusiasm and cheerfulness . he also said me that `` life is not the bed of rose , often there are thorn '' so enjoy your every part of this life may be you get number of problem . you are young , this is the time which will develop the fruitful experience in you and shapened your ability to see your professional life , married life . i think that only a young person firstly enjoy his college life , where he get true friend there , he will enjoy every moment in college function , party , late night out . after completing your college life now you enter the world of professionalism , it doe n't matter you are in which post a a manager or a engineer . a young person will definately enjoy the responsibility to complete a project , risk taking nature and willingness to succeed than other . then come your married life , you can share you every moment of love , sorrow , you get a partner for whole of the life time . what all you enjoy with your partner at the begening of married life is always play a important role in anybody life . this is the time when you get the responsibility of your child and family . you have to manage all the thing job and family simultaneously . lastly i would like to say that life will show you different stage , childhood , younger , then older age . it depend on how you enjoy the life . life will always tend you to face various situation . but it is only the true experience and you inner emotion how you want to enjoy your life .
