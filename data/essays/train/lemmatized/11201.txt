although it must be said that there are young people who do n't care about their community , i think that , in general , new generation are keen on helping their town and do it in a variety of way . there are many young boy and girl who spend a lot of their time working for the poor and the disadvantaged . for example , in my country there are several association that recruit personnel to drive ambulance and one of my best friend , who ha a very demanding and time-consuming job , work there without compensation at least once a week . another friend of mine spends every sunday serving meal to poor people in a church , and he often tell me that performing this service for the benefit of his community is very rewarding for him . but there are also other way to help people ; skilled professional can be of great help in certain area . a classmate of mine , who graduated from a medical school , is now part of an association called `` doctors without boundary '' that sends doctor around the world to help poor community in le developed country . she wa sent to africa and provided medical assistance to many people . i think that a person like her is a clear sign that young people are willing to help the others and therefore can be relied upon to become active member of our community . in fact , if a young doctor is willing to help people in a remote country , one can be sure that she will be much more keen on contributing to the well being of her community . as for myself , i try to get involved in pro bono activity , too . since i am a lawyer , i wa able to spend the past two year assisting poor client who were involved in various kind of litigation without charging them . so , the example i see around me are , in my opinion , eloquent sign that younger generation are not le willing to help others in their community than older one .
