in our country we have an old tradition in our education system . even if you are a primary class student or a university student you will experience the same : `` we like repeating word , lecture or whatever we told , without understanding the idea '' first of all , history class in the primary school , i remember our teacher told a lot about the war that took place between our country and a neigbour , however right now it is really difficult for me to remember the reason or the result of that war . because all we did wa to repeat several time the reason without understanding and get rid of this knowledge after the exam . another memory that also affected my life wa passed in the high school . we had an exam on math . in the result of the examination i failed because i could n't remember the necassary formula . however my best friend who also forgot the formula passed because she also learned how to get the formula . nevertheless i am still failing in my work because i do n't know how to find the solution . in turkey we have a saying `` do n't catch a fish for someone but tell how to fishing '' . as a result in my opinion it is really important to understand the idea than to learn the fact .
