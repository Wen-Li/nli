the role of advertising in modern societies advertising is one of the most popular area of the developing industry . in order to sell a product , one must put great effort to introduce the society , the new product . without an effective advertising campaign , this is a difficult goal to achieve . the aim of advertising is making the product better known , and better sold . seing a product commonly , creates a feeling of trust in many people . it may mean that many people are using that product and a there are no complains about the product , everybody is happy about using it . therefore one would like to give that product a chance . being well known is one of the best approach in being a widely trusted trade mark . the advertisments may exaggerate the quality of the product . this is a technique often used to effect the customer . many people believe in what they read in the newspaper or what they see in the television . for instance an advertisment of a detergent , may say that , the detergent can cleanse every kind of spoil , including coffee , tomato or grass spoil . although in the truth it may not be capable of removing the dirt completely , one could easily trust in that advertisment . after using that product , a good result may not be obtained . nevertheless a loyal customer may think that , the problem could be related to his \ her washing maschine . this simple example demonstrates that , the advertiser ha a point in making product seem much better than they really are . although ethically it is not right to cheat on people , no one can claim that the technique is not clever . in order to survive in the world of competiton , one should do his/her best to get a piece from the cake . therefore i agree with the exageration of product in advertisments .
