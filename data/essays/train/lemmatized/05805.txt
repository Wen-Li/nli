in my opinion neither young nor older people enjoy life more than the other , they enjoy it from different perspective . older people enjoy life in a more relaxed perspective , they know what life can offer , they have made choice and they have dealt with the concecuences of their action . they can now enjoy their success and have come to accept their error . older people can enjoy the company of their family and they can observe their young grandchild grow without having to worry a much for their future a they did with their own child when they were responsible for their successful education and upbringing . since they are aware that their time is limited they place more attention to those thing that are most important or personally rewarding , which allows them to be more at peace with themselves and enjoy life without so much stress . young people enjoy life in a more passionate manner , they are starting their life and have a great number of opportunity in front of them . they have the energy to engage in a large amount of activity and there is always excitement in doing something for the first time . young people know that they might make mistake , but they are confident in having enough time in life to correct their error or to change their behaviour , point of view or activity in order to have a better lifestyle . when you have the energy of a young person and your future is still promising and unknown you are more willing to trying new thing , experiencing life from different angle and this make life more exciting and appealing . older people could benefit from the exciting approach to life that young people have in order to continue taking advantage of life , at the same time young people might imitate older people in order to mantain better human relationship with their friend and family . sometimes older people lack the energy and enthusiasm to undertake new adventure and their only experience are those from their youth . young people often live life to quickly , without taking enough time to fully appreciate their experience , which can lead to missing important moment in their life .
