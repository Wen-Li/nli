i strongly agree that student should have a good understanding of the topic . they should have a deeper knowledge of the concept and idea . whereas learning from fact can be additional to it but one can not solely depend on that . various example can be given in support of it . a good student is one who thoroughly study the topic . goes deep into the understanding and then correlate it with his view and idea . in this manner he/she will have strong basic . for example , in science subject or in physic conceptualisation is the key factor . if we do n't study the intial step like in physic various theorem and priciples we can never solve difficult problem in future . a strong basic understanding of all area will help u to deal almost everything . furthermore , if idea are put on paper or us them one will come out with novel innovation . like while doing experiment we put some reported idea of a reseacher to our work . and we come out with entirely new result . so by putting someone idea which he had thought of we accidently or intelligently come out with a new concept . so surely studying well and applying idea can improve our capability . facts can be a guiding souce but true knowledge come from understanding thing . this can also be applied in other field of music , dance and art . in these field if do not know the basic concept of - do re me fa so , one can not proceed futher to specialise in music . on the other hand in art work like in painting one should know the standard of using a painting brush , how to use it at the first place ? . similiarly , in dance a in salsa or any other western dance one should know the basic way of doing it then only can learn other difficult step . so i would conclude by stating that one should make their basic strong in order face difficult challenge in life and this applies to all field .
