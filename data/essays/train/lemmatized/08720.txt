the world change very fast . the people change with the world and they have to adapt them in the society on the best way . young people nowadays have different task to do from the people who were young in the past . today the life is very frenetic and a huge number of the action and activity are really different respect 20 year ago . a young person have to go to collage or university , maybe he have to work if he want to pay his study or others activity . the free time is not a lot so , when a student is free , he use to go out with his friend and to think about the enjoy activity like to go to disco or listening to music . someone can think that it is selfish but i am sure that a young person must have a leasure time . however the time can be spent for the community . it 's quite true that a lot of young people do n't like help their community . the young newadays people are not all lazy . i can explane this point by a clear example . last week i went to a rock party which wa organized by one of my best friend . he worked a lot becouse this event wa wonderful , but he did it with others guy . the party wa a music competition . the people were a lot and everyone wa very happy because the player were fantastic and the organization too . in conclusion i think that today young people are different from the young people in the past so a comparison is not so easy . the free time is le and the thing to do are more . the young people mistake is to think that to do something for the community is bored . fortunately there are some people who think different !
