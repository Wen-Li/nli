most advertisement present u great product . advertisements use scientific explanation to make u buy them . however most people do not believe it . indeed , we live in a society where speed come first . virtual image is a perfect example . everything is made to gain time . the way of life , inflicted by society , kill the imagination . advertisements create many false declaration and we can see when we buy a product that it is completely different . it is generally always the same thing with advertisement . the more a product is shown on the television , the more it is to avoid . advertising is made to earn money , consequently the product can not be a great a it seems to be . in my opinion , the speed of image prevent u from thinking and will cause the disappearance of human quality .
