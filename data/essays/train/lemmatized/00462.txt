i disagree with the statement which is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i will disscus and give the reason a follows . first of all , travelling in a group led by a tour guide make you not to think . i personally think the travelling would be more fun and interesting if i make my own plan . if i travel in a group led by a tour guide , i end up just chatting with people and following a tour guide . after that kind of travel , i would not remember anything . for example , when i wa in middle school and high school , i went to school trip led by a tour guide . even though the place i went wa kyoto which is most beautiful city in japan and they have most valuable and interesting temple , nothing really remein in my mind after the trip because i wa just part of the group and following a tour guide without thinking . i think i wasted great opportunity by doing that . second , hiring tour guide cost more money . i rather spend same amount of money on eating well during my travel instead of hiring a tour guide . if i could get most of the information tour guide provide by reading travel guide or searching on internet , i do not think it worth to pay that much money for a tour guide . especially , now a day , because of the development of the internet , we could easily find information in free . third , travel in a group with tour guide make trip too touristic . most of the tour guide only take people to the major spot and suvenior shop they have commitment . but there are more thing we could see besides those sightseeing spot . for example , when i traveled to new york first time , i wa not led by a tour guide , but eventually , i get to visit not only most of the major spot but also happened to discover a lot of interesting spot none of the tour guide would take people to . in conclusion , i disagree with the statement the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . my favorite way to travel is either with family of close friend , and make our own plan . it give me more fun and opportunity for learning and experience .
