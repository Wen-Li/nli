big expectations i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my point of view , advertisement are the mask that product wear . with those mask on their face , you can not understand the product ' quality . because advertisement are just hiding the reality . to start with an example to illustrate the advertisement ' show side , there wa an advertisement of a chocolate and on the advertisement the whole school wa eating it because the chocolate tasted very nice and it included more calcium in it than it included the chocolate . however , when i bought and tried it , it wa awful and when i read the ingredient of the product , i saw that there is very little calsium in it . the advertisement wa just a lie . the chocolate on the advertisement wa wearing the mask that i mentioned before . moreover , the advertisement hide the reality in the sense that they do not allow - and can not-the consumer to try the product . behind the scene , they just appear a they would be demanded . may be if a consumer try the product on television , he or she will find lot of bad side of it . since it is the relationship between supply and demand , the advertiser just give what is demanded by curtailing the real ingredient of a product . all in all , according to my opinion , advertisement business is a show business . show requires lie , small trick and big and pink expectation . advertisement show give these tricky thing in such an intelligent way to it audience that they want to make that audience to buy and consume that product . whether the product is a it is shown or not is not their primary concern . so most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are just to attract people and make them buy that product .
