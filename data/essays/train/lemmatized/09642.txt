as we finish high school , we start having an idea about what path we would like to take for the rest of our life , so a we begin to attend college we have a , more or le , detailed idea of what it will be our field of study for the following year . i personally disagree with the statement , because i believe that we need to specialize in a particular field . what i mean is that , a soon a we have a clear idea of what our major is , there are several reason to specialize in one subject . for example class from our major make u more competitive in our field , because we gain knowledge on what it will be our future work environment , and at the same time it will make u more prepared to face problem during our career . at the same time in a constantly changing world , the more our knowledge go deep in a field , the more we will fit higer level job position , or the more competitive we will be in the application for graduate school . i am a materials science and engineering major student . what distinguishes myself from the other student of my major are the elective class that i took on specific topic , regarding nano-materials . taking high grade in this class enhaces my curriculum and make me more eligible for scholarship for the next year . at the same time a company interested on developing a nano-material technology would be more willing to assume me than another materials science and eng . student with another kind of background . at the same time from a non-scientific point of view , i have to say that i lack preparation on humanity knowledge , and i do not feel confortable when other friend of mine speak about art , history or literature , and if i could i would go back at college to take a couple elective class from history of art major .
