i disagree with that . i think understanding idea and concept , and learn fact are conected togather i am going to support my opinion by saying seveeral reason . first of all , a huna beens we have to live the the fact to understand the idea and concept . in fact , it is not a conditonal rule , but it is the common thing to be a human been . second , when people learn any thing , they have to do it in the real life to feel it and how can it effect his life . my third reason is , the people imgination be come larger and get more experments in their live . also they would be able tomore creative and make new thing that they felt it is important for the people live , and that is going to be by living the fact that had learn it and understood it . if thedo some thing on the real live , and they have seen some thing like it on television like poorness or to be hungry , they will be sorry for the people who have these problem , but when they do it on real they help them because they felt the painful that these people are going through . these are my reason that i thing the are very reasonable and if every school is going to do it , it would be so helpful for the teacher and very effectable for the studint life and imagination in this live .
