i agree that . in my case , i agree . there are few reason . first of all , having a lot of knowledge make me live easily and useful . for example , when i see a tv news program , i can understand almost of every issue and have my own opinion against them . secondly , having a plently of broad knowledge mean having a lot of topic to talk about . for example , when i go to a party , i have to talk to a person who i do n't know . at the time , we should talk something . if i know a lot of topic , making a conversation is easily . when we first meet a person , we do n't talk about specific subject deeply except some kind of academic meeting . ofcourse , a person who mastered a specific subject can help many person or thing . for example , doctor , lower , scientist , etc . however , i am not the kind of person . my way is that ask a specialist when i do n't know . so , they are . conclude , i agree that it is better to know many subject than to know one specific subject .
