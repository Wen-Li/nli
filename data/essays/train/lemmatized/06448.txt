some people probably would like to dream with the idea that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . even though i would be one of them , i can see the reality of the situation . because of economy importance , individualsim of people , bad public transport system and no better obiton than a car ; i desagree with the earlier mentioned statement . the car production ha a huge importance in the economy of many country and the world . countries like japan , taiwan and china , a big part of their economy relay each year of car production and at the same time many people in the world ha their main incomst from selling carrs . since car production is economically important in the life of many people , it production will not stop and sertainly not in twenty year . people tend to be individualist and usually preffers to think about his own conviniencea and there for people prefers to have it own car insted of using public transportation . this cause that a big and an increasing amount of car are been sold each year , and there for a bigger amount of car will also be produced in the twenty coming year . there are not too many country that choose to invest in public transportation . public transportation is usually in bad condition , wich make very atractive for people to use their money in buying car , wich will cause an increase in the car production in the coming year .
