products seem much better than they really are ? in my opinion i agree . in this day the best seem product is the best seller . for me they are three reason of why these happens . firts the price of the product . second the way of the owner present the product to the society . last but not least the quantity of money that the producer will spend on make the product . let 's talk about price . the money is he one that move the world . in united states the most biggest society class is the middle one , that mean the worker class . most of the population will be looking for the cheap product . the advertisement make look the product good and if the price is good people will buy the product . the fist impresion of the product , is waht we first look at . the promotion is very important , if the advertisement convince the person thatthe product is good they will buy it . also people do not have to much time to look the diference between of the product and if in the promotion say 's that is the best seller you will buy it without notice that dose n't mean that is the best one . the company cost for make the productis the most important thing fot them . alot of company 's preffer to safe money , than sale to the people a good product . a good example of that are the food , natural food is better but j artificialy flavor is most cheap , so flavor maybe it will be better but is not because is not natural . in conclution produce will be make them product seems better than other because is market competition . my advise is to always look the contain of the product if is foot , medicine or any supplemets . if is a traportation like car , equipment , etc ; look the material of what are compose that will help you to know wich one is better . mos importan look for second opinios or compare product so you by your own self determinate wich one is better fro you .
