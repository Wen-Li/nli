do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ? maybe some people nowadays do not realize the importance of community , however , i think people can not survive when isolate themselves from the crowd , because poeple need help from other people . so in my opinion , i totally agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , because they do n't understand helping other people is vital in the society . and here is my supporting reason a follow . firstly , i think it is an excuse that young people do n't have enough time to help , because they spend too much time not only in studying but also in playing , and they do n't pay attention to the environment they llive in . they should discover that here are many help from community like there are always some people who give help to clean up the trash . the second point i want to express is perhaps there are some young people do know that helping their community is necessary , however they just do n't have time to give . then , i think they should know how to schedule their time , and to use their time well . to sum up , in my personal opinion , i think all people , including old and young people , should give enough time to helping their community , because people always give help to each other . i hope young people can understand that point of view , and contribute their time to their community , and then make their community much better .
