last night while i wa preparing for my history of economic analysis exam , i really spent a lot of time in learning idea and concept rather than the fact . i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . there are many reason of this situation . first of all , idea and concept are more important than fact in the exam . in general , the question are about idea and concept . the teacher place them too much importance , they spent too much time about them in the class and moreover they want too much knowledge from student about idea and concept in the exam . for example , in my exam the question are generally related with the idea and concept rather than fact . therefore , i work for the idea and concept much . another reason is that in education system in my country , it is not very necessary to know the fact . on the other hand , the education system encourages the student to learn and understand idea and concept . ideas and concept have more page than the fact in course textbook and they are discussed in more detail than the concept . therefore , the student place a bigger importance on idea and concept than fact . understanding idea and concept is more important than understanding the fact for the student . to learn about the idea and concept can help student more in the exam and the education system also encourages student to learn them rather than learning the fact .
