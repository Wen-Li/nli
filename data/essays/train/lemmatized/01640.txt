i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , but i believe that this problem can not be limited to young people but extends to older generation a well . to begin with , from my experience , only few young people are involved in their community . peer pressure , the fear of seeming ` uncool ' to their friend or just lack of interest might be the most common reason . this is a very sad development , i believe , since community work brings people of different background together . community work can , thus , contribute to strenthening people 's sense of responsibility and their open-mindedness . nevertheless , i do not believe that the problem is limited to young people . particlarly in larger city , where life tends to be more anonymous , only few people dedicate time to the community . i do not think , however , that this development is inevitable . my experience is that you can get people involved if you are convinced of what you are doing and you can transport this excitement to others . for example , i have been working in my university 's amnesty international group for four year now . in our work we also regularly visit school to tell student about what we do and to gain support for our group . the student ' reaction are always very positive in that they are usually ready to help and support our work . as a conclusion , in my view , this example show that the problem will not be solved on it own . in my opinion , the lack of sense of responsibility for the community is not only a problem among young people but extends to our society a a whole . if we want younger and older people to get involved , we have a responsibility to offer opportunity and to be role-models . changes in society are hard to achieve . we should nonetheless make an effort - every single one of u .
