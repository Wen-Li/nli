there are plenty of case worldwide of people becoming successful without trying new thing , but focusing and putting the whole effort over specific and alligned task , instead of taking the risk of developing new thing . lets just consider a couple of example to illustrate my statement , the first one is over a well known name on the computer history , bill gates . mr. gates ha always been working on computer since the very beggining , developing a new system that allows computer to be `` friendly '' to the common user , produced and distributed by the microsoft company . in this sense , the product coming out from microsoft ha always been in the same line , avoiding the consumer to get into complex structure to undertand how interact with the computer . another example come out from a totally diferent field a is the one of finance . mr. george soros is a british man that ha been involved in finance transaction for a very long time , and getting profit out of it without taking the risk of expanding the investment into different sector , further that the capital market . these two example doe not mean that a person taking the risk of doing new thing can not become succesful , but shown a clear image that the path to success can be follow by just one line of risk , or if i may say so , by one line of idea . other example includes the music industry , where it is easy to find singer and group with just one musical hit , that launched them up to the hall of fame . this is the case , for instance , of rem . this group go directly into the music history record with only a few song recorded some year ago , but still on top of the billboard worldwide and even considered a major clasics fot the real fan . the fact that this group ha never change the style , nor even the field of work , can be considered a another example of avoiding new risk and tasting the good flavor of success , in this particular case , for a very long time .
