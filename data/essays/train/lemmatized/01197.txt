first of all , it should be made clear what we intend with broad knowledge and specific knowledge of subject . if for broad knowledge we imagine the situation of a student that attends spare course on random subject like in sociolgy and mathematics or in anatomy and mass communicationb whilst for specific knowledge a student that take course focused in social study , limiting the extension of his study only to course that are strictly related like sociology and antropology , i think i would prefer to have a specific knowledge . the reason is that a superficial overview on different subject can result extremely fragmented and scattered and it can bring the person to be unsure and uncomfortable with all the topic . moreover , without following any structure , the student can be lost in the vagueness and wide-spread extension of knowledge , he could wander from one field to another without catching a concrete point . therefore , i would rather agree more to a specific approach on learning knowledge . a specific approach focus the attention of the student only to some aspect of knowledge . this give to the student confidence with the topic and the skill to treat and work out news insight . nevertheless , if for `` broad knowledge '' we intend a structure of course that follows a project that go in and out from different science , i think i will prefer better a broad knowledge . i would explain this idea with an example of a field that is highly related and interconnected with different branch of knoweldge : cognitive science . the aim of cognitive science is to discover the functioning of the brain . in order to do this the only knowledge brought by neuroscience will not be enough . it need support from many other discipline very different in respect with each others . thus , sometime broad knowledge is necessary to have a better glance over topic that are too much complex and that can not be treated with a specific and focused background .
