young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , even two or three decade ago , there are many people who intend to help their commuinities . because about three decade ago , most of the country in the world were developing country . in developing country , their industry is establing on the product which need a lot of labour , more people attended a industry , more profit would be given . one person have limit to do his work in order to do plenty of task . for more productivity . people in this social structure sould come along with other people . but nowadays as industry of a country grows faster , the proportion of industry ha changed . society of fouded by knowledge come up ! this society doe n't require cooperaition like the ealier society , developing internet communication system doe n't require face-to-face work a much a society of labor . so nowadays young people do n't need that they should be helping their community a a member of their coummunity . and another important reason is competing is more serious than earlier society , many medium and company emphasize competence of their rival than cooperation , so young people think dedicated to themseleves except other member of community are benefitble .
