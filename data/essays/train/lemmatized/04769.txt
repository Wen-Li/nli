nowadays , the use of car is quite controversial . indeed , some people are defenitely still in favour of keeping them , whereas some others claim it use should be reduced , if not banned . the consequence this debate may have on the future use of car , and the reason of this debate deserve to be discussed . at frist glance , this issue may appear superficial , but it is an essential one , since it is related to one fundamental problem the whole world is facing , that is to say environment . indeed , the car is a major source of pollution . however , western countries'inhabitants are used to it , and would see it disappearance a a step toward the past . for a long time , car ha symbolised modernity , but moreover freedom . with a car , one can go wherever he want , whenever he decides it . in the united states maybe more than in any other country , car ha been praised a a fundamemtal element of one 's life . billy wilder 's moovie , ` sunset boulevard ' state that he just ca n't live without his car , since it would be like having his leg cut . considering these fact , it is hard to assert that in twenty year , car will no longer be used . though , there is no denying that it use will probably slow down . more and more people feel concerned about pollution , and a i said it previously , the car is a major source of pollution . these people aim at gaining some influence in the political field , in order to get the opportunity to be heard . in europe , their influence over the debate is increasing , and country such a sweden a more and more often taken a example , since it is a pionneer in this field . in the wake of this change concerning the environment issue , many country have already implememted different kind of policy in order to lower it use . despite it is often rejected by the population , we may hope behaviour will evoluate . in addition to that the lack of oil which is more and more discussed may lead to change towards the lowering of car ' use . so , a a conclusion , i would say that there will certainly be fewer car in use in twenty year , but we will have to wait for a little longer i think , to see the obvious change .
