in western society taking risk is very well known in sport for example . one of the most risky sport actvity ist high climbing . there are many reason why high climber take the risk to climb for example the mountain in the himalaya which are more than 8,000 metre high . some of them are fascinated by the height of the mountain but some search to find new risk because they already have climbed some lower mountain but now look for a greater challenge . so they are trying to find out to what limit they can come to and to see whether they can handle difficult situation in the high mountain . another point that confirms the statement is that an activity you are doing everyday in your life , such a working in an office , sometimes make you feel boring and you start to find a new job in another company where you can prove that you are able to deal with a variety of problem not only with one you have been working for a long time . for successful people it is more interesting to have a great variety of activity in their job than only having the same problem for all time ! they have already managed a problem and want to go on with others because they are more curious about how to find solution for other problem . the people who succeeded in one task will be more self assured about their ability and try therefore more new activity that always have the risk of failure . thus i think the statement that successful people take always more risk is right and understanding .
