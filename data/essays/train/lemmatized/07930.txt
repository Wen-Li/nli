i disagree with the statement , according to which there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . it is true that the use of car increase the problem of pollution , especially in big city , where life thousand of people . in this city often people have traffic problem . you are not able to go because of the excess of circulating car . and when you reach the place you were going to , it is always hard to find parking . another thing is the raise of the cost of oil . some scientist say that oil on earth is going to finish . but it 's also true that car producer spend a lot of money in order to find new fuel , le expensive and cheaper . then i think that many people consider car the most comfortable way to move from one place to another , and they wo n't adapt themself by taking the bus or the train , even if it would be cheaper . another thing is that train , bus and airplane doe n't cover all the goal that a person might have , and have precise time , which they have to respect . with the car you can go where you want and when you want , and for this reason many people prefer take the car , like i do . then there are also the emerging country , like china . cars sold in this country ha increased also by two-three hundred per cent , because of the industrialization . i think that twenty year is too little to see a decrease in the use of car . maybe it will happen , but it will take much more time than twenty year , also because of the interest of big industry , which influence most of the decision taken by each government .
