the question of taking or not taking risk is a controversial one . on the one hand some people thing that to be succesful they have to try different thing . on the other hand , by doing what you already know you may be more efficient and successful because you avoid risk . however , most people have an aversion for the risk , and taking all aspect into account , i strongly feel that it is better to keep doing what you have been used to do . to start with , it is true that if people do what they already know , they will be specialised in a task and therefore have a real social status . this status is one of the aspect of success . in our modern society , it is important to have a social position in order to be different from other people . futhermore , most people will agree that nowedays , professional ask , from their applicant , a specialised profil . in the same time , custumers have the same requirement . for instance , most peoplpe prefer a specialized doctor rather than a generalist . thus , study are more and more precised . eventually , the most important reason is that specialisation emprouve efficientness and avoid any waist of time . this ha already be prooven by famous theory like the adam smith one where he explain that specialization in the division of work , is a way to reduce loose of time . through the effect of experience , people know perfectly what they have to do and therefore are more rapid . this can also be called expertise . the examle used by adam smith occures in a manufacture where people repet the same mouvement all the day long and have a uniqe tast . this specialization lead this manufacture to competitiveness . in conclusion , my firm conviction is that success can easely be reach by specialization . by doing the same thing you can be an expert with a real social position and hence , be more efficient .
