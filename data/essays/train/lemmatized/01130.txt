i believe that is more important for student to learn fact in a real way , rather than learn only knowledge . an example to support this idea is the comparison between university skill and work experience . if a student learns about something practical it will be helped in the all day life and in the work life . on the contrary learning only concept and idea at the university is le useful in the real life . the experience that a person can achieve during a period of work , it 's something that you ca n't learn everywhere . throughout the education , student ( for what concern the italian system ) do n't achieve a many practical thing a they can bring from a business environment . for example i had a work period during the summer vacation in a marketing office of an international company , here i applied all my knowledge in the area . in this company i learnt practical marketing technique that my university professor have never thaught to me . then , when i came back to the university and the marketing professor give u a task on how to develop the brand image of a business , i wa ready and with many skill on this field . a thing that university should do , it is to develop a better program of activity that student should be obliged to undertake . for instance providing working period in a business , whether the university department is business and management ; field trip at cave , lake or mountain in the geology university and so on . in the real life learning practical issue is a very important part of people life . if a student practice his skill since he is in the early education , when he will enter the world of work he could be more prepared to struggle with the competion . therefore he could have a good curriculum in comparison with people that don-t have experience .
