there are some people who think travelling led by a tour guide is better , but others prefer to travel single instead of tour guide leading . but i would have to say , if i wa faced with this issue , i would probably follow the tour guide 's leading in a group . in the following discussion , i would like to reason and provide example to support my viewpoint . no issue is more important now than the one that refers to safety . history witness and present many example , that travelling by oneself may meet some danger or trouble . for example , we go to a le level country , such a china , and take money on hand , this behavors may suffer some danger . or when we travel an eurpeon country with unpolited dressing . do n't you think the example quoted above are very persuasive ? convenience is another head and chief reason that i have chosen to put it here . it is no better illustration that can demostrate the view . if the trip is not convenience , it will take the traveller too many energy to enjor their trip . even familier a a couple . they will be unconvenient on a busily trip . superior a leading by a tour guide , leading by tour guide or deciding trip by self also ha own demerit , too . deciding trip course may spends many time and may lose something interesting . leading by a tour guide may lose one 's freedom to find something else beside the tour . nevertheless , the advantage of leading by a tour guide carry more weight than that of the disadvantage of leading by a tour guide . so the most striking conclusion is obvious . to sum up , given the reason discussed above , which sometimes intertwine to form an organic whole and thus become more persuasive , we can safely to reach the conclusion taht leading by a tour guide in a trip is more safe and convenience . in fact , not only do i prefer to travel leading by a tour guide in a group , but also prefer to hire a personal tour guide for one 's own tour guide to serve himself a well a possible .
