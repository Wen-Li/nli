i am desagree with the statement because in my opinion when i travel i like to learn everithing by myself and made the trip so much interesting . for example i like to walk in the forest enjoy the bird singing and admire the nature place , using a book or map a a guide . like that i learn everithing and enjoy in peace . other reason is when you travel in group with a guide not all the group like the same thing , some of them want to go shopping , anothers , go dance in other word everybody want to go for a different way an see differents part of the place , finally you never can do that you like or enjoy a you wihs . if you go to a big city along or just with one person we always can share our interest an both do tha we want to do at the same time but when is so many people , some time we can not finish to explore the city because they are tired and want to go back to the hotel , or the kid want to go to the park . other problem is when you go in a tour gide you just go tu the place that they have in the package , you can not go anyware alse because is a new place and you do n't know how to go back , that is a risk . could you imagine that you go in a group with your boyfriend and you like to espend more time in an specific place and you can not because you are in group and have to go with everybody have to go ? i dont really like that , i am better feel free to go to the place that i like and if i want to dance do it , or run , jump , play or be happy . finally like i said in the bigginig is a lot better travel along than in a group lead by a tour guide .
