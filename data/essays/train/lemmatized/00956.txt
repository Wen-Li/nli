travelling is the best way ever to explore the world , discover new place and rest . some people prefer to spend that time in a group with a tour guide and other prefer to stay alone . i will definitely say that i disagree because , by myself i can visit whatever i want , i will never get bored by the discussion and i can rest whenever i want . first of all , the worse thing when you 're in vacation is to be obliged to do exactly what the majority want to do . because you are in a group of different people you can do what you want to do , of course . you have to go where everybody is going , eat where every body eat . instead of that , when you are by yourself you can decide exactly what you want to visit without being contrary . for example i wa in italy for vacation with a group of people . i really wanted to visit a very famous museum , but i could n't because it wa n't on the program of the day . secondly what is n't benefict for my vacation , is to get bored by the discussion . when you in the group , at certain time the guide tour have to talk about the history of the city , the people . .. most of the time those subject are n't interesting . i ca n't imagine myself in vacation laying on the beach while the guide tour is talking about origin of the beach in the world or something else . finally , the most important thing while you 're in vacation or when you travelling is to be able to rest when you want to . one day i wa in germany with some friend of mine and a tour guide . every morning at seven o'clock he wa supposed to wake up everybody for the break fast time . that made me so mad because i could n't rest at all . contrary , when you are by yourself , you do n't have to worry about the time or rushing anywhere . so you can have more time to rest base on the fact that you are your own guide .
