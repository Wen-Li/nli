yes i do agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , because of many reason . my first reason is , a tour guide is more familiar with the place that we are going to travel that guide can show u many place that we can not find easly by ourselfs . for example hidden historical place or same taraditional place or relogionus place , church . the second reason finans , when we travel aboard or for holiday to same where , if we have a tour guide we u , the guide can provide u usefull information about the our travel and some of this usefull information are , the hotel which we will go , the tour guide can provide u the chip and best hotel . for shoping also we can take hepl from the guide who can take u to the chip or a good shoping place . and my last reason , going a country which ha a different language can be hard to enjoy . but if we have a tour guide who know the language of country that we are going to visit , the guide provides u to many nice thing . for example we saw a castle in the city and want to learn about it . the guide can help u by translating information for thr castle . if we want to speak and learn about the thing and cultureof the country that we are visinting we need and translater because all these reason i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , but who is profeccional tour guide .
