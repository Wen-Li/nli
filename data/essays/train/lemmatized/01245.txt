the best way to trevel is not in a group lead by a tour guide . because every person need the oportunity to explore new placessby themself . with a tourist guide you will only see what the guide show you in fact you can find a whole world and new experience by yoursel that a guide will not show you . its beatifull when you can explore and touch thing by yourself without the nessecity of somebody telling you every little thing you are watching or doing . exploring and discovering new place it like a kid opennig a gift . it exiting and an experience that you will never forget . a tourist guide will alueys guide you for famous and important place for the society or for the world , that mean you can lost a lot of place that are out of the rout of the guide , you will be only listening and looking at the thing they told you to or the place they take you and you will be always with a group it also can be good but it better to experiment thing by yourself in my pinion you will never know the place you go until you interact with the people ore until you live real experience in that palce , i think that with a tour guide you olnly will see the surface of the place and you will miss thing that may be hide , the experience by yourself can be more funny and extreme . in conclussion i think that to really visit a place or to really know a place people should travel by themself , they will see palces that a guide willn not show them and they wuill live experience that are not for a group experience with themself , it possible to get lost but it will be an adventure that nowbody showld lost
