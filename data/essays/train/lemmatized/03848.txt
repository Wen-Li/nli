i am completely agree with this topic . actually not most every advertisement try to control our decision about their product . i will try to explain my feeling about this statement . the company of advertisement serve the other company which are interesting in their product ' gain . according to this they are looking for the way to sell their product more than more . actually the first way to do it improve their quality . but this way is ignored . so they use other way ! tring to believe u their product is the best . of course they do it by using adverstisements more than this thing , i want to add the most important knowledge which i have . i experienced an event happened to me two year ago . i entered in advertisement class . the proffesour displayed u some picture and wanted to talk about them . first one is just about parfume but it told to u more than being parfume . i leaned lot of thing about this advertisement . this parfume just for woman who want to look beauty every time and want to control men in their life . when i heard this , i wa in shock . then i contiune this class . i think it enlarged my view and developed my personality . now i can see advertisement main purpose about their product . i want to give an example . one of chocolate 's popularity wa very low and the company which produce it decided to get help from them . after this prose , lot of people buy this chocolate . the advertisement tought people when they eat it they will remeber their best day in their life . consequently lot of product seem to u more than they are . so the advertisement ' company can achieve their purpose .
