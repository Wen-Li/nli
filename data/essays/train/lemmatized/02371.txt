nowadays it is possible youth is considered selfish a regard a not helping their community , but i 'm not sure it to be completely true . as a young person , i understand that young people is receiving much pressure in their formation period , to improve their study and for getting good job . all we want to afford pretty house , good and travelling , what implies to spent spare time in course and studying . it 's possible i wold have been agree few month ago but i 've recently meet some young people very openminded and committed with world concern . those person showed me that there is a big web of facility for helping in our community or in a wider area . truly i can not compare today 's youth with previous one since i 've just lived this period , but i believe there are two main flow of people , possibly more and more separated . firstly those who have their personal challenge and try to achieve it a fast a they can , and others who include other strange people and social or ecological concern in their challenge . if i 'd compare both group population , it 's sure that personal challenge are predominant . it 's logical if we notice that we are living a period of luxury and marketing . but , on the other hand i also think there are many socially committed people with very good and new idea . i trust in this last group to educate the future next youth and to increase the people who dedicate some of their time in helping to the others .
