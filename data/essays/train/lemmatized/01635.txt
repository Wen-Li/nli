i disagree with this statement . my poit of view is different . .. i think that there are a lot of car today and there will be more and more tomorrow . . my opinion is that until the reserv of petrol will finish the human did n't stop to make a new car . the only way to stop this process is improve pubblic transport and make this more cheap than using car , but this will be not easy because it mean make a change in politic 's mind and in big company 's rule . twenty year it 's a short time for make this inversion i think !! for example i had every morning an hour of car for make 25 km it 's crazy but it is always le in term of money and time than taking a pubblic bus . we also assist at the evolvig of oriental state who are density populated and they are now using a bikecycles but not for even !! this will be a problem for earth healt . i hope that my generation could view a society with le car
