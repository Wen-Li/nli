success lie in what you have thought of and the respective positive outcome . success is a phenomenon usually that should be developed by each and every individual . success reflects the idea of the man in his behavior . success should always come taking on new thing in life . to say perfectly a sucessful person is one who succeds in trying out new thing and plan . trying out new thing is definetly related with risk taking . as complicated the plan will be risk accosiated with it will also be high . its not great on implementing the older idea but to go on for self associated idea . fear for failure should not be associated otherwise it will reflect on your work . for example if scientist doe not go for newly generated idea many familiar invention wuold not have been possible . such a computer , cellphone , telivisions etc.the amount of risk associated with it is also high . if suppose if a batsman think of hitting a six a a risk then he ca n't ever succed in his life . accordingly if he play without fear many milestone would be crossed by him . so both name and fame will be associated with him through out his life . so generation of new idea and the amount of risk associated with it give greater chance to develop in life . this not only support for development in life but also raise respect for u in the human society . majorly successful people are recognised due to implementation of their own idea and the risk associated with it . instead many people want to succed copying other idea and implementing on the well known fact . but success count on new idea and the risk factor . hence success accuont on the people who work hard to succed which is reflected in their idea .
