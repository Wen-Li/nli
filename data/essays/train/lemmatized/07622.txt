i would only partially agree with the statement since i feel that even though many part of the world could see fewer car in use in the future , there are some part of the world where there could be use of more car . i think that , in the developed country , where there is already a very high car per person ratio , the use of the number of car would come down whereas in the underdeveloped part of the world where this ratio is currently very very le , the number of car might go up infact . the passage below explain how . firstly there is no doubt that the shortage of fuel is going to be a big problem twenty year from now . this would contribute to lessening of car number and care usage in the future . also the increased level of pollution especially in country which are highly industrialized , for example many part of europe and north america , would lead to the reduction in the number of car with the objective of reducing pollution . the government in these country would also be able to afford excellent public transport system that would enable the public at large to commute confortably even without car . also the rising level of health consciousness could mean people preferring to use more of bycycles and other mode of transport that give some exercise to the body . however there are part of the world that are highly underdeveloped for example part of africa and asia and here the level of industrialisation are very low . twenty year from now , these part would be more developed and hence more money would come into the hand of the people there . these people would naturally like to enjoy the luxury of a car for the first time in their life . therefore , in these part the number of car could go up .
