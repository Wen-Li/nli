`` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . or is it ? to answer this question , first and foremost , one need to consider the purpose of the academic pursuit that an individual is following . whether or not that individual should specialize in his/her line of academic , remains dependent on what the individual plan to do beyond the academic and is not limited to the course of study only . considering the cut-throat competition we face in our everyday life and in one of it subset , our career , `` horse for course '' is the solution here . to have a better understanding on the issue , let take the case of a woman , who is studying medicinal chemistry and plan to be a researcher . in her line of work , to have any kind of success , she 'd need to specialize . for example , it would do her career a lot of good if she were to focus her research on development of oncology drug / anti-retroviral drug , than merely synthesizing molecule for generic use . in term of position , respect , money and career growth , she 'd be better placed when specialized than when she 's not . correspondingly , let take the case of a man who is studying to be a social entrepreneur . in his line of work , issue of business management , information exchange , community development , field research etc are commonly addressed to solve socio-economic problem . hypothetically speaking , if his business is of distribution of oncology / anti-retroviral drug , then he 'd need to know generically about those too . it will do his business and his credential a world of good if he ha both theoretical and practical knowledge of these issue on a broad basis , which impact the performance of his business . thus , the debate on whether specialization in academic is better or generalization , rest at the doorstep of the purpose of the academic pursuit .
