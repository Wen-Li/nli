young people and their communities young people have the ability and the time to do many thing for their community but nowadays they are busy in other thing like playing game , watching tv , spending too much time with friend . i agree with that statement because of the following reason : they think that the othe thing ( playing , watching tv , ... ets ) more important than helping their community ; and they think that the young people themselves need help from their communitis . many young people are interested in the computer and video game , internet , wathing tv and movie , and visiting friend and spend much time with them . so they are very busy with these thing and they ca n't find time to help their community . also the young people think that they themselves need their community help by giving them advise by the older people about studying in universies and how they can choose a good univerdity and a good major . also they want to learn from the expert . those expert are usually from the old people . moreover , we have to give the young people a feeling that they are men we can depend on them . and if they feel that , they may provide help to their community . for ecxample , if you deal with ayoung person a a chile he will hate you and the community and wo n't help you . for these reason i think that young people do n't give enough time to help their community . but if we provide advise for those young people they will help their community but when they get older .
