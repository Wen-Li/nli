in my opinion , i agree with this statement because i believe that understanding the whole context of an specific topic , in other word , capturing the idea and concept , would allow a student to develop a better meaning of what he is learning which could be reinforce with the different fact described during the course . for example , when i wa a attending class at university , i always tried to pay more attention to the main idea the professor wa trying to explain , which doe not mean that i found fact le important , but in my case , i knew that in order to understand and facilitate my studying for an exam , it would better if i could develop the topic thinking in a different way and not just memorizing each word he said or each fact stated . nevertheless , fact would help me have more specific detail about the class but if i have just learned fact or be more interested in them than in concept probably i would forget those fact faster and may have more problem in answering question that were not asked during the class because i did not understand what the main idea wa about or what the professor wa trying to teach u . another important example why i am convinced idea and concept worth more than fact is related with the way we understand how a singular topic in real life is being developed . for instance , most student have a knowledge on how a country 's economy work or why it is important to have accountant in a company without needing to study economics or finance just by understanding the concept of free market and how important finance are for company to succeed . students are going to have a better knowledge of what they are learning if teacher put mpre emphasis on the idea and concept rather than fact .
