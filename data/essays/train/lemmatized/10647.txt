nowadays , young people are the busiest people among their community . they are called a people who are promising and hopeful in the future . they are the one who can bring nnovations and have the ability to change the world more favorably . hence , we can not blame those young people being busy to work harder to keep up the steam . they do n't even have much time to helping their community . for those young people , 24hours a day might be even a little short . is it really ruthless to not give enough time to helping their community ? working harder and making effort continuously might be more beneficial later . they might bring a better world to live such a more comfortably and more favorably . this will cause the effect of happiness among many people . for instance , the world might turn into a very peaceful world with no war nor struggle anymore so that there would be no more tragedy of separating family . nevertheless , on the one hand , young people should give enough time to helping thier community first . every single work ha to be done step by step . it would probably be better to start helping the community rather than just concentrating on the future . if the community do n't exist , there will be no more social life in the world . the statement is quite true . in the 21st country , many people are very busy doing their own work or job . they hardly have time to helping out their community . their role is not only helping their community but also making a hopeful world . they have got lot of thing to do and accomplish . however , they have to bear in mind that working for community are not the thing of wasting time , it is worth it .
