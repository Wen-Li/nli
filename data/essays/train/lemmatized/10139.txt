many people like to go trip . nowadays peole can go anywhere they want by air plane or train , or even car . when you plan to go trip , which do you prefer taking part in tour guide , or traveling yourself ? in my case , i prefer second one . i want to go travel with my plan because of three reason ; do not have to follow dislike plan , can meet a lot of local people , and can save money than tour guide . first reason is that i do not want to follow some dislike plan that tour guide planned . sometimes i try to take part in tour guide travel , however , many time i find my dislike plan . if you take part in a tour guide , you have to follow all thier activity whether you like or not . on ther other hand , if you plan your travel plan by yourself , you can plan activity that just you like . second reason is that i want to meet a lot of local people . if i travel with my tour menber , probably i never try to meet , and talk with some local people because i would think that it is better to enjoy with my member than local people . although it is good to enjoy travel with tour member , my porpose or travel is meetting somme local people , so i want to travel with my plan . third reason is that people can save thier money if they decide to travel with thier own plan because if you want to take part in traveling tour , it is necessary to pay money , and it is more expensive than plan of yourself . nowadays people can find cheap tour guide plan , but if you can go to travel company or can use the inter net , you can find chear hotel or transpotation . therefore it is better to plan travel plan yourself . in conclusion , it is better for me to go trable with my plan than taking part in tour guide because it is not necessary to follow some dislike plan , can get more oppotunities to meet and communicate with local people , and can save money . of course , tour guide also have some good point , but it is more suit for me .
