i 'm agree with the statement . succesfull people risk , in their life , rather than the other people . normal people have n't risk in their life and they do n't like to try new thing . to be a succesfull person , instead , you ca n't stop yourself to do what you already know , you have to be ambicious and you have to be ready to take some risk . the person , that live their life like a movie , do n't do anything for change it . but the person that know what they want and fight to obtein it , they have to take some risk . the strong of the life is in the risk and in the new thing . we 've to try all the new thing but never forgot the old thing . if you are a champion in a particulary sport you have to continue the practice everyday , but that do n't mean that you have to do only your sport . the mind and the thought that the sky gave u are the most important weapon for the war of life . the ambicious person and the person that doe n't stop himself is the person that will win in the future . the influence of television should be used to talk with the person about this topic . the movie , the song , even the literature should be used to teach at the child the importance of being ambicious and the importance of tring new thing . the fear of the common person is the reaction of the other people ( friend or even parent ) if they fail their new experience . but it is n't a problem . if you do n't do anything , you ca n't fail . only who doe something can fail . and the sad of a failure is like the kiss of a wife . so when you 're sad for a filure in a new thing , you hold the hand of your wife a your smile will stais on .
