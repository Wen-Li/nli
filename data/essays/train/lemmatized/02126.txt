many people travel around the world in different way . and it is true that one of the best way to travel is going in a group which is led by a tour gide . however , i strongly disagree with this way of traveling . i prefer the way traveling by myself . and there are several reason for my way of traveling . first of all , if i travel alone , without guide , i can experience more valuable thing compared with guide traveling . i agree that traveling in a group led by a guide is convenient and can visit well-known place quickly . however , while traveling with tour bus you just take picture or walk around place . you do n't really have free time to experience something spcial . as the schedule is too tight , you will just look around many place . if i travel alone , however , i can spend my time freely and experience something unique . for example , when i wa traveling malaysia , i actually stayed with native people . eventhough we could n't understand throughly , we could become a good friend . from there i could experience the way of the native people 's life . it wa an unforgettable experience in my life . next , most people think that traveling with a tour guide will be cost effective but this is not true . if you travel alone you can actually save more money . as a tour is operated by a guide company , the company try to get more profit . so they increase the traveling fee . two year ago , i actually wanted to travel japan by a tour guide company . but before i book i checked how much money will cost for the traveling by using the internet . and it wa surprising that the fee which the guide company suggested wa two time hire than original cost to tavel . so traveling with a tour guide is totally not cost-effective way . in conclusion , the guide traveling is sometimes needed to travel certain place such a alaska . but in my opinion , traveling by oneself is the best way . because it give you much experience which is unforgettable and you can save a lot of money .
