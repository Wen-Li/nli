the main goal of every university is to form high performance student , and hence the question is to know how making these student performant and effcient in their future job ? thanks to a lot of theoritical course ? or thanks to practical course based on the observation of the fact and some experiment ? in fact at the beginning , the role of the school ha been tougth in order to share theoritical knewledge , and not to prepare student to their future job . why ? because some stuff can not be taught and should be learnt outside from the university , in an other context , which enbable to learn fact . therefore i am convinced that the first role of the shool or university is to provide the theoritical basis , which are necessary to the understanding of the fact , and the problem of the real life . consequently , i believe that it more important that student understand concept and abstract idea , because these are the root of the understanding of the fact . moreover , can the reality of the fact be learnt at school ? for instance , a job can not be taught really at school , because the school doe not correspond to the real condition of a job . the university can only provide tool , abstract concept to make the student more efficent in their future job . but they can not prepare them to manage the every day life of the job , in term of time managing , stress or communication problem between different partner . these topic are learned directly in the company , and the ability of a person to deal with these every day life problem is based on the experience of these person . a classroom on thesis apects would be completely irrelevant . that is why , the university encourage student to make internship . this show that school acknowledge that it more important that student understand concept at school and then confront these abstract idea to the reality of a job . in other word , i believe that a student should learn theoritical concept at school , because this is the right way to become an efficient worker : understanding idea and concept in order to understand one 's own world .
