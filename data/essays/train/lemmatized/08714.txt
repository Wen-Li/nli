i disagree with the statement made . although young people today seem to be self indulgent , pretentious spoiled brat , there are atleast some from this generation who do believe in giving back to the community and do so in their own way . there are people in today day and age who actually care about the comman man and the community a a whole and make it a point to contribute their part in trying to help their community . all this start in the home of the people . if the young people today have been brought up by their parent in a particular way , with a sence of realistion towards the hardship of man and if the value and habit of caring have been instilled in them since the beginning the definitely act on their impulse to help the community and the people in them . for instance , close to the area in which i stay there is a school for the mentally challenged people suffering from different and difficult problem . these people lead a mundane and commonplace life , in the school all day doing what they do . some of the doctor in the facility thought that it would be a good idea to take these people out everyday atleast for some time , it might liven them up . but since the school wa short on staff they did not have anyone to take them out , additionally the school could not afford to hire help a it wa running low on fund . still , they published an advertisement in the local paper which called upon young people to do their required job for no pay at all . to the surprise of the school and the community a a whole they got an overwhelming responce from genuinely interested youngster to do the job . this show the interest of the younger generation in the welfare of their community . in another instance , i also came accross a news paper article regarding a common problem faced by a community in a neighbouring town which wa solved by the local youngster . the problem they were facing wa of improper collection and disposal of garbage in a particular area . the people were really annoyed and even with repeated complaint to the local municipal corporation they were left without assistance . finally , a group of youngster took the lead in this matter and with in a week time the situation wa resolved by mean of thorough planning and execution of their plan to alleviate the situation . thus the people of their community were rescued from their plight by the younger generation itself . thus , although today cinema and medium undermines the youth for it lack of concern for the community well being , there are young people who are genuinly interested in helping their community a can be infered from above example .
