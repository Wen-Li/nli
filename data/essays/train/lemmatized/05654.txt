personally , i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . this is because young people are more energetic , more healthy and have more adventure . first of all , younger people tend to have stronger body ; they are full of energy . they can play a lot of exciting sport . for example , younger people can paly basketball , rock climbing , snowboarding and so on . however , these kind of sport will not be very good for elder because they tend to be tired very soon and they will not be able to enjoy themselves . moreover , younger people are able to recover very fast after big game so that they can be ready for their next activity . in addition to being more energetic , yonger people are healthier . they tend to have strong body because they are growing up instead of getting old . being strong ha the advantage of enjoy their life more . for instance , young people can eat almost anything they want to eat such junk food . this is because they do not have to worry about getting some disease . on the other hand , older people have to worry about their diet all the time because they tend to have problem with illness such a diabetes . having healthy body truely are the big advantage for young people to enjoy their life more . finally , younger people will have more adventure . this is because they have more time than the elder do . for example , younger people are able to change job once a year , and they are not worried because they can always find a job . even if in a labour work , younger people are fit . they can at least make their end come meet . most of all , they can spend their leisure time doing lot of activity such a travelling aroung . as for older people , they may not have a much oppotunities a younger people do . they have to be careful all the time and worry about losing their job . and they definately do not have the time to explore our modern society . it is clear that younger people will enjoy their life more . this is because they have more energy . also , they have stronger and healthier body . last but not least , they are able to spend more time on coming across their exciting life experience .
