traditionally , many people , including those who are going to advertise their own product , believe that adversiments make product seem much better than they are and this enhanced image from the advertisement help to increase the sale of the product . however , my opinion is that this common sense doe not always make sense . the cheif reason for my view is that ill-manufactured advertisement could have bad effect on the product image or sale performance . if information about a certain product which customer want to know from the advertisemet are not provided in the advertisement , most of customer may forget the product after looking at the advertisement . moreover , many advertisement could not succeed in focusing on the characteristic which the customer want to catch in the advertisement . the another reason for my view is that core value or quality of product could not be invented even though most famous artist or advertisement agent manufacture the advertisement . real value or real quality could be diffused by another type of advertisement such a blog in the internet , word of mouth , or article in the newspaper or megazines . some might argue that even though advertisement could be ill-manufactured or create diffrent effect expected , most of advertisement could create productive effets . but there are many example that show how much severely effect the ill-manufactured advertisement had . for example , a car manufacturer advertisement put a stress on more security-guaranteed facility in a small car . but most of prospective small car customer wanto know how much low the price of the new small car because the most of prospective customer will use that car a a second car and have already security-strengthen big car . in sum , i concur with the opinion that advertisement could create good effect on the product image or sale growth . however , i believe that this rule could not apply to most advertisement .
