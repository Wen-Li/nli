the issue at the hand is whether the advertisement make product much better than really are . this issue is very important because advertisement ha become important part in everybody life . i agree with the statement because they attract people to spend money whcih is offf no use . the first reason , advertisement are one way of communicating the inforamtion about a product . advertisements convey information about the product in a way to attract people by infering the false information . as a result the people who watched the advertisement tend to buy the product and come to know it 's of no use after spending a plenty of money on it . it may not affect the rich people but the middle class people would have spend this money on some other useful purpose . second reason , advertisement are important attraction to the people of different age . so people try to imitate the action seens in the advertisement which affect person performing it and also their family who depend upon him/her . this is happening because the advertisement give only the advantage of it than explaining the disadvantage . finally the company advertise for increase their buisiness than thinking of the people . for example most of the drink like soda : are harmful to the people health in many way due to toxic present in them . but they advertise these product with famous film actress or actor which attracts the people to buy the soda . so in this way advertisement will not convey the complete information about the product to the society . if the advertisement infers the complete information about theproduct the sale of it will decrease which will effect the company profit . now - a - day drinking of soda became a adiction to most of the people . in conclusion i think commercial will not convey the complete and better information because to gain profit .
