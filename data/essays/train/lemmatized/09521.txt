`` the world will change '' this wa what our teacher told u one day . for my part , i think there will be fewer care in the twenty year than there are today for many reason . first i think that the source of energy will decrease , especially oil . so it will be hard to provide oil to car . now the oil price is over 70 $ ! unless if they discover new source of energy . in addition to price of oil will get higher and higher . people will have problem in getting gas for their car . second thing , population of the world will increase . so it will be hard to drive because of traffic , and it will a take long time to move from one place to another . as most study stated , and a many people immigrating from poor country to the developed one . third , discovering new mean of transportation such a subway , or express trians will be a good reason that people will leave car . because they are cheper , faster , and safer . also , maybe there will be new `` generation '' of mean of transportation a rocket . who know ? forth , because of globaliztaion , i think , the price in generall is increasing . the price of food or housing for example is getting higher and higher every day and the salary is getting lower . as a result of that , people will not be able to buy car , or even to provide the thing that car need like oil or spear part i think the number of people using car will be le than today . but i hope that we will find new way to move from one palce to another in a safe way that will no
