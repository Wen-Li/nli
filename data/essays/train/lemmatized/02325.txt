i think it is both important , to learn idea and concept a well a fact . but a more valuable i would consider the learning of idea and concept . learning fact is very usefull if you want to attend a quiz show or if you take a test to be admittet at a college or university . these test often just ask question on fact , but people like me are not able to keep these fact . if i just learned fact in school , i would be pretty stupid , because i am not able to keep it , i just forget it again . i do not mean to it but i just can not help it . wheread if i leraned concept and idea i would know much more . facts are le important . if you remember fact you do not have a conection to other topic , for example if you learn that the world war ended in 1945 what doe it tell you ? not much , only that it enden in 1945 , but if you learn what cause the war to end and what happend after the war you learn much more . you can make connection to other country , for example what happend there after the end of the war . you would be able to relate these effect of the war to other war and draw conclusion from it . if a new war start you may be able to tell what happends when it end again , just because you learned these concept in school . but like i said above it is also important to know some fact . everybody should know when the world war begann and ended , but it just should not be paid so much attention to it . especially these admiting test should give more importance to the ability of drawing conclusion from an event than recalling the fact of it . to come to a conclusion i would say it is more important to learn idea and concept rather than fact , they should just be supportive .
