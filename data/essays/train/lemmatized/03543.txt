i agree with that statment , and in the following line i will support my idea . when we watch an advertisment about a product , in most of the case we asume that the product is better than it probably is . in effect , we think that the product ha a good cualities because we asume that the producer make a lot of exam to probe his product , but when we buy the product , and we follow the advetisments , we sometimes we can notice that the product ha not the sufficient advertisment that it supposed to be . for example , if you buy a pesticide , and in the advertisments say that you can use in home , and you used in the plant of your home , in a few day your plant probably die . the reason of thism is because the advertisments did not tell you that you can not use the pesticide in the plant of your home . as we can see , because the advertisments we assumed that the pesticide wa a good product , much better than really is . in conclution , i agree with the statement , because in many time , the the advertisments make product seem much better than they really are , and when we used , we noticed that the product are not good .
