people often discus whether successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i strongly believe that successful people tend to face and challenge new thing and task rather than doing one thing they can do well . first of all , those who are changing constantly can succeed now . some people think that doing one thing continuously is more efficient than doing many thing . however , it is now not available . nowadays , everything is so fast and complexed . so people can easily feel boring at same thing . for example , a many people know , the rock group ` radiohead ' is still popular . they have been singing for more than ten year . there were many popular rock group at that time . radiohead changed their music style and challenged new thing that people have never heard . if they had stock to their one style of music , they could not have continued their populization . furthermore , challenging new thing and face new task are more exciting and refreshing . only doing onething make people feel boring and lazy . people who are lazy can not be better than those who are exciting to do something . suppose that you have to eat hambuger everyday . even if the hambugers are delicious , you would be sick of having same food . moreover , while people challenge new thing people can learn new skill . we do not need to try something which we already know how to do well . also we need to try many thing because , nowadays , we need many skill . in the past time , the world wa not large for people . it wa local society . however , we can not succeed with only one skilled ability because the world are huge and complicated . if you know that how to use computer , then you need to try something else . it will give you new skill and more oppotunity to succeed . talking all of thing into account , it is sure that successful people tend to challenge new thing and face new risk rather that only doing one thing because it is more efficient , refreshing and skillful .
