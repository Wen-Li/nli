i do not fullly agree with this statement . undoubtely there are a lot of example in history providing the statement . one person i think of is albert einstein . he perfomed physic in a time , when the general opinion wa , that in physic more or le all ha been discovered . but he wa in doubt about some fact , which did not seem to be correct for him . by publishing his theory of relativity he risked to loose his reputation in the scientific community , a most of the other scientist declared him to be lunatic . and what ha become of is today ? his theory explains a lot of phenomenon like the gravitational force and his name is present to nearly everybody in the world . for another example you may think of the american expression ` from a dishwasher to a millionaire ' , which state the possibility to become successful in life by trying new way and hard work . exactly at this point i see a weakness of the statement : hard work . it doe not appear in it at all . in my opinion you can be succesful in life without taking unnecessary risk . you might be one of the leading scientist in your special field of interest . lets say you are a specialist in computer database . why should you take risk and , for example , start a business selling database , risking bankrupty ? it is possibly a sensible decision to offer your abilties to others which will pay you . perhaps you will not get a second bill gates but you also might become succesfull . another point of critizism of mine is the fact that everybody find success in different part of life . having a loved family can make feel successful . but i think you should not risk anything at all if your family is involved , because your child might suffer from it .
