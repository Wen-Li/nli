i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in twenty year than there are today . at first question i mention about if i am reading statement : what is the definiton of a car in twenty year ? are we talking about car like today ? with a gas enginge or are we talking about a vehicle with alternative enginges ? if so , for me this vehicle are not car . they are another kind of transporation machine and can not be summarized under the topic car . so , it might be possible to say there are le car in twenty year , but only because of a statistic trick . another reason why i disagree with the statement is the fact , that most people in this world nowadays still have no car . of course the most people in the western world got are car but what about all the people in asia and africa ? only in one of this area live more people then in the western world togehter , e.g. india . also the industrial revolution already started in those country and it is only a matter of time when they will get the same life standard than the people in the western world . life standard in the western world mean to be an owner of at least one car . today it is possible to see the statistic fact that one cititzien , e.g. in germany , often owns more then at least two car . so if only the people in india at least will own only one car the statement false . the last reason why i disagree with the statement is that the industrie need car to move their good between there production area . therefore it doe not matter if we are talking about a company that produce heavy product or just produce service . to connect the people with the product of the company it is necessary to use a car . the employee must be able to meet his customer and the customer need the possibility to get to the company for e.g. to buy something or to ask for service .
