being a member of the young people myself , i agree with the idea that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . it is sad that i have to admit it , but this word sound unfamiliar to me , and i must imagine something that the older people do . it seems to me that young people are not even caring about the community , or do not think about themselves belonging to it . i often hear that the connection between neighbor are very weak in japan , and i agree with that a i see many people not even exchanging greeting when they see a neighbor around their house . i live in an apartment , and sometimes see young people like me , but they do not try to greet me from them , so i always speak out first . i think this connection between people ha something to do with young people not helping their community so much . for example , whenever there is an event held by the apartment that i live , the people who take part in it are small kid and their family , and then the old people . the middle-aged people organizes the event . young people could also take part in these event , but they , or we , tend to spend time on other thing for our own fun . if we become more interested in the community , i am sure we could affect the community in a good way that can make the community more active . however , i also think there is a problem or a point that can be improved in the community itself in order to get young people more interested in the it . perhaps some young people think that they want to help the community in some way , but they do not know how , and think of it a something not easy to access to . if the community can make an atmosphere that the young people can feel comfortable , maybe they would show interest . in addition , i think the older generation should tell the younger one what the community is , and how they could help in order to make follower of their work . i want to start from paying more attention to the comminity and then help in some way .
