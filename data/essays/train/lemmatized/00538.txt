trying new thing have many advantage but it ha also lot of negative effect . i disagree to this statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because of the reason that it is wasting time , often dangerous . even though people can gain new experience through trying new experience , it is wasting time . keep working on something they already know how to do well is the way to be successful and saving time . if people try new thing , they always start and learn all thing over again and again . nevertheless , they can discover and get to know more deeply if they keep doing what they are familiar about . for example , me and my friend started to play flute when we were in third grade . i am still learning it but my friend decided to play another instrument next year . now , she forgot how to play flute at all and she want to play it again . then she have to go over it all again and forget about the one that she wa learning before . thus , trying new thing is wasting time . it always can be dangerous to try new thing . because they do n't really know and not skilled about it . about 3 year ago , i decide to learn snow bording since i only know how to ride ski . i thought that ski and snow bording would be similar but it wa n't . i wa really confident before i fell down several time and hurt myself so badly . in addition , people can fall into thing negatively like addicting because at first , they are not sure what it is and just start it . therefore , trying new thing can give risk . i would rather keep improving thing i am good and skilled at than trying a variety of experience because it is wasting time and could harm myself . safe is always first . doing what they already know how to do well is the way to be successful .
