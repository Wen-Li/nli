in the four-word short maxim , `` no pain no gain , '' contains the tremedous truth which reveals the secret of the successful people in the history . the people who brought progress to the world were those who challenged themselves to new thing through the painful situation , and not those who followed the typical rule accepted by the world . columbus took the risk of going to the sea in order to discover a new continent , and the wright brother , took the risky action of inventing air plane , the best inventory human ever created in the history . trying new thing despite high risk and pain are one of the common factor of the successful people . columbus not only took risk of his own life but the risk of hundereds men when he went on the unprecedented trip to the ocean with his follower . people did n't think it possible to discovered the new land , and even those who suspected the existence of continent were n't bold enough to try the risky business . only by trying the new and dangerous business , columbus wa able to succeed in acheiving his goal . on the other hand , others who did n't try new thing were never able to succeed but only made his success even more special . the wright brother , who brought a huge progress to human life for inventing air-plane , also took a great risk when they experimented their air-plane . even after their air plane fell and the incident almost took their life , the brother did n't hesitate a moment to try again to successfully invent their air plane . most people follow the typical rule accepted by the world ; few people go over the typical rule and make a great acheivement . like columbus and write brother , only those who go over the boundary of socially accepted and the risk , are the people who change the world , so called successful people .
