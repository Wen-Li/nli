i disagree with it . older people enjoy life , too . it is just look than young people enjoy life more than older do . i know many older people who enjoy life , my parants are also . they go to many place on every weekend . but i join young people am home , do homework . which do enjoy life ? my opinion is older people enjoy life more than young people . older people had worked for a long time , but young people just play . i t is not enjoyment . for example , now i have studied at college . this is to be going to enjoy in future . though some older people are unhappy with no maney , at last they become freedom from school , study , work , communicate with hate people and busy . only japanese are busy ? i do not think so . young people are always play , they can move and go somewhere . but older people 's body will be worse . it is only bad thing . but their mind are good . i have a dream that i will be like my grandmother . her is sometime like unhappy , but sometime not so . sometime she say me that my body have painful , i do n't like a husband . but sometime she is smile . i know she is happy , and i am happy , too .
