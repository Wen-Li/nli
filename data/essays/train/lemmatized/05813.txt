is it better to learn many academic subject or to limit oneself to a specific one ? in my opinion , there is no true answer to this question . a young student who doe not have a clue about his future job will need to get broad knowledge to make up his mind . contrary to him , a student who ha always known that he wanted to become a scientist for instance will have to attend special class . first , i think that most student who arrive in university do not know exactly what job they want to do , so they need to attend general class . indeed , they often expect university class to help them make a choice of carreer . in this case , i am convinced that getting a broad knowledge through different academic subject is well adapted since it give student the time and the information to make a relevant choice for their future . in like manner , general class are an asset since they provide student with the necessary base of general knowledge . a significant evidence is that a student who want to work on the stock market - which is a pretty specifical and technical field - will have to attend accountancy class to know how the account of a firm work . likewise , a student who is planning to set up his own business will need to have a clear view on the ground like marketing , law , finance , management and the like . second , when a student is totally convinced that he will do one specific job in the future , i think that studying one specific subject can be more strategic . indeed , to become efficient in one kind of technical job , you need to get specific knowledge by attending a specific class . for instance a student who want to become a dentist will have to do hard study to be able to exercise this job . in order for him not to waste time and to go straight to the point , he will need to learn subject taughts in one specifical class . all in all , it depends on the carreer you want to have .
