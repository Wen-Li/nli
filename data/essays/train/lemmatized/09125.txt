if you had asked me this question five year ago , i would have said , that there would be a sharp increase in number of car during the twenty year time . since , i wa not aware of the fact that car have plenty of negative influence to the environment that we have been living . in addition to that , petroleum price are increasing extremely sharply . nevertheless , i , now , absolutely claim that the amount of car will drop significantly in twenty year time , may be shorter . therefore , i strictly say that there will be le automobile in the coming future . the reason that i wa thinking that the number of car would increase wa my desire to the car technology and the possibility of a reduction in price . i wa believing that car design were wonderful and everybody wa aware of this fact . thus , each and every person would buy car a much a they can . another reason for this belief is that , since the brand are getting larger and rivalry is increasing , the price of the car would fall . i did not come to a conclusion about the price opf the car . they are decreasing a the day pas by . however , i had seen that the automobile desire wa only my characteristic . most of the people istead of buying car are now investing on other property , such a flat or cooperative . why i am now thinking in this way , that the number of car will decay , is now i am aware of the effect of car to the envoropnment . furthermore a considerable number of people are also agreeing with me and they are all aware of this damaging effect . therefore , most of the people will quit using car , at least they will use public transportation , which is a good alternative for private car usage . since most of the people will be carried just by one bus or other sort of transportation , it will be more clean . another reason for thinking in this way is actually a lesser crucial point that compared to the one mentioned above , which is the high price of the oil used for car . after the sharp rise in 2004 , the car usage decreased enormously . especially in le developed country , driver quit using the privae car . it seems that the current price will not vary during the coming future . hence , this will influence the number of car used on road . if we take all of the factor mentioned above into consideration after a detailed observation of each point , we can come to a conclusion that , because of negative effect of the car to environment and high gas price , the usage of the car will drop . for the following twenty year time , i am not expecting a sharp fall but degree bu degree . if the usage of the public transportation is enhanced and if the people are warned and educated due to the side effect of car to the environment , this fall may be faster to a certain degree .
