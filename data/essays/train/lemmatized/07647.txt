many people think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . after weighing the pro and con , i will argue in favour of this opinion . first of all , i believe it is necessary to mention the main purpose of an advertisement : it is used to sell a product . in that way , the advertisement ha to be original , that is what i personally think , colorful to involve people to pay attention to it and to the product , and sometimes humouristic . today , there are a lot of agency which create advertisement . thanks to the development of computer , the agency can use new efficient technique to launch an attractive ad . but they do not care about the truth . .. secondly , the message said in the advertisement is also very important . for instance , agency try to prove that without this product you can no longer live ! you must absolutely buy it ! they also aim to prove with a well-invented sentence that the product is not expensive when referring to it incredible advantage ! a message that i really hate is the following : `` more white than white '' . naturally it is used to describe the effect of a powder . i can not help thinking that such an ad is a lie . in this case , the advertisement make the product much better than it really is . .. i find useful to underline that a great number of `` discount product '' in supermarket have a very good taste , for instance , and yet have not necessary been the object of an ad . after closely examining the abose argument , it is clear that i do not agree with everything created by advertising agency . yes they have to develop a good image of the product , but unfortunately , it go too far . i like watching ad on tv or even in the street , but i always be reluctant to buy product whom ad seems to exagerate .
