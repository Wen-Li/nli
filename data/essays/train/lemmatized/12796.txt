nowadays , the society is changed and it 's becomed a society which primar value is time : people never have time . this lessance of time can be read also in human relation . this behaviour is clear in young people . regarding their behaviour , something is evident . young people opften have not respect of others and never have time to spend for the community and helping it . sometimes it seems thay live in a word apart . they do n't look to the need of people around and they even never think to make something to help them . many example occurr everyday to support this idea . the first , about the respect for other people , can be inferred , for example when young often smile about other people 's desease ; it happens to see an old woman in difficult to cross the street and near her a group of adolescent , looking at her ; well , it is really unusual seeing them helping her to bring the bag or simply to cross the street . another sign is about volontars ; many of them are old people and there 's a little quantity of young people . for example , in my city , every sunday there 's a group of people who spend the day to make something helpful for society : sometimes we go to clean the park , or other day we wash the wall from wrintings ; well during my experience i never met young people . another example can be simply inferred from school 's world : at the beginning of the year , teacher invite their student having meeting to plan activity in group : i always went and i found only the teacher . and it is worst if we talk about meeting to help student at the first year . concluding , it is really difficult involving young people in useful project ; i care this is a sign of proceeding time and of parent , not able in teaching an important life 's value , whinch is to collaborate with other people and to be ready in helping the next .
