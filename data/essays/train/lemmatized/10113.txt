the humankind always need to take risk to reach good life standarts . therefore taking risk is a very important aspect of human life . succesful people should try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . some people think it really good idea but on contrary to those some people think that it not a good idea . i personally agree with the first idea , these are my following reason . firstly , taking risk is a good idea because if you want to do something well you should take a risk . if you want to earn more money you should get risk . for example i read in the newspaper a businessman ha a succesful company but he bought a new company although he doesnt know anything about it but now its the well known company now . secondly , it your luck to being a succesfully about your business . taking risk always earn u something . sometimes you can lose but you shouldnt finish to taking risk in your life . we can see that in our world who is the most rich or succesful man or woman came to these day with which risk theytook many year ago . in my country everybody say `` if you dont think to take risk in your life you always be with the same forever '' and i really support that sentence . finally , all in all a i said before taking risk could improve our everything if we can do it succesfully . succesfully people should try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . but he or she should take care about his or her main thing which they can do succesfully , they only should take risk about it . because it important for them .
