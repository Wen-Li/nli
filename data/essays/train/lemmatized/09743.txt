i strongly agree with the statement that it is more important to understand the idea and concept rather than just learning about the fact . i would say that student should come up with an idea to invent a new product and think about the concept behind them rather than going through it blindly . firstly , i would like to discus that being a pharmacy student , i would come up with an idea of inventing a new anti-cholesterol drug which would be suitable for so many people who is sufffering from the high cholesterol problem which are related to the heart disease , diabetes and other dangerous disease that is killing many people . i believe this would be a good step and look for the consequeses before go through it further . secondly , i would describe about the concept of inventing a new drug into the market . i would do the research and i would go through many pharmacy book which i have studied during my graduation and look for the concept behind it like , the adsorption , distribution , metabolism and elimination of the drug and also for the adverse effect , contraindication and the interaction with the other drug . i would also look for the dosage form to be manufactured before stepping forward . thirdly , i would like to mention that before putting the idea further , i would put all these particular on a new drug approval form an submit to the drug approval agency for getting it approved before doing the clinical trial and enter into the market . in conclusion , i would say that it is very important to understand the the idea and concept for every student to go further into their research and learn the fact about the their research .
