nowadays , it is known that a lot of car are being used and that company are selling a lot of them because people can buy them . moreover i think that people want to buy them thereforet it would n't be a normal fact that the number of car decreased in the future . nevertheless could you imagine that it happens ? it would be a terrible new for me because i lovew car ! first of all i think that car are very important for u and that everyone would have to have a car because it allows you to drive wherever you want whenever you want . in addition , i think that the number of car will increase insted of decreasing because some country had already allowd 16 year-old boy to drive . that mean that more car are going to be bought . another reason why i think that there wo n't be more car in the future is because the market and company are improving their model . that 's why people are more interested in car . additionaly the market produce what the people want to buy . finally i must say that i have already pas my car exam and i also have bought a new car . i love my car and i think that it allows me to do a lot of thing that a could n't do such a going out at night with my friend without paying a taxi or going to the beach with my girldfriend . in conclusion i do n't agree with the sentence because when i wanted to buy my car a recieved a lot of information about the topic and i really think that it is imposible that the number of car decrease in the future because everything is improving the car-market .
