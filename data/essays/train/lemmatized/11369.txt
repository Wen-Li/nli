i am living in acommunity were every one want and need to have a car , you can find that all teenager count the day when they are going to reach the legal driving age just to have a car . the car rate is already getting higher , because of the obsession of driving and showing off . in my country we have ; thank to god ; good incom , so every family would easily offer beying more than one car one for the father onther one for the mther , and onother two for the driving son and daughter ; therefore , we have lot of traffic concidering that it is a small country . there is statistical evidents that the rate of vighecils specially saloon car is increasing ; for instance , in one of my college class i had an assignment wich wa about reviewing some statistic about the rate of car accident in kuwait `` my country '' so i reviewed them with the group ; unfortunatlly , it turned out that the car accident rate ha increased since the year 2000 to 2004 up to 70 % and the main reason is because of the number of car that have been dramatically raising . from all what we are wetnessing these day with all what technology ha been created , car are still the most stable need of every one and technolog wont be easilly able to create some thing that drive our attention from car . althought car are very important , people are still missusing them .
