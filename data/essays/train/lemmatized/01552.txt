i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . because the idea seems to be too shallow and narrow to me . i would rather say it depends on each individual whether they can enjoy life or not , than just generalize them by their age . i am going to state example to support the idea . firstly , there ha been increasing number of young people , who do not have clear purpose of the life , being at a loss what to do . these kind of people often do not even work , which naturally mean that they do not have enough opportunity to show their ability . that kind of life seems to be very boring and meaningless to me . although some people might enjoy their moment of the life by doing something funny and stimulas , my impression for that is they are just having fun temporary . i think it doe not mean that they fully enjoy thier life . as long a there are many young people living without a obvious purpose or destination , i think it can not be said that all young people enjoy their life . secondly , let me introduce my own experience about my grand mother . she life alone after her husband died , but she is so energetic and vigorous , and seems to enjoy her life very much . that is probably because she ha a lot of friend around her , who usually drop by to chat with her . i think being needed by others give people will of life . lately , she even started singing with her friend in karaoke , and is now putting much enthusiasm in it . by seeing my grand mother , i wa well convinced that older people can live their life with many enjoyment . that is the reason i think given statement is too superficial . even young people could feel their life meaninngless and boring , while there is enough chance for older people to fully enjoy their life . it is all up to theirselves .
