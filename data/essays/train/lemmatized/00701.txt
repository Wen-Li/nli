a studend must be continuosly feeded with learning and theory principally , then of course there is good time also for practicing his study but first theory must come . since the definition of student is coming fro the verb '' to study '' i think it wo n't be a great deal to make them learn the practice before they know how to apply the practice itself , it could result a mere misuse and no more . theory must be the basis first , especially for student that are supposed not having any experience in real life yet , an engineer must to know how to design and project a bridge before buid it otherwise many people will be in danger . for sure what it make the difference today is not '' to do '' but '' how to do '' and you will learn how only by studying different project and comparing them with other people who gained such a good preparation like you . i not saying that learning fact are not important in student career infact once they will understand the idea then they will start to apply those concept but since the beginning of student career they really need to assimilate more idea that they can even support , a much a possible i mean . these issue of course could vary depending on which faculty the student applys for . obviously , math or phsicology faculty teach more about idea than fact while in engineering or economics the student will study more practical case but the main idea remains the same and is that student are made first to learn theory in order to apply it succesfully in a more profitable way .
