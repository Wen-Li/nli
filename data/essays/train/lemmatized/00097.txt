i agree with the statement that product look much better when you see them during advertisement . first of all , i believe that in the society of today television and newspaper exercise a great impact on the common understanding of the concept of beauty and effectiveness . this is particollary true when you talk about advertisement . people believe that some product are better than others just because a certain movie star say it ! furthermore , considering that most advertisement are proposed by the television , i think that such a tecnology affect the real feeling on the quality of the product . secondly , i have to admit that product seen during advertisement look much better than they really are . they have more colour and they look more appealling than ever , expecially if compared to the one you receive ! finally , i believe that the industry of advertisement reached a very high and professional level . in particular , the advertisement highlits only the good thing about a certain product while the negative part remain hidden and you discover them only when you effectively have the chanche to use the product in your house . even if i strongly believe in what i have written above , last week i wa simply too influenced by an advertisement seen on a tv and i bought the product advised therein . such product wa a knife supposed to cut any kind of meat and , believe me or not , the advertisement wa really convincing , showing a guy who wa cutting any kind of beef . unfortunately i received the package yestarday and i found that the knife wa just simple a all other knife that i currently have in my house ! this is just an example of how much publicity can influence people . we should try to keep in our mind the principle described above in order to avoid any risk , but sometimes it is simply too hard !
