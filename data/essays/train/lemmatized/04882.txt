some people argue that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . to be frank , i agree with the idea . i have numerous reason to support my argument , here i just illustate some of them . first and formost , there will be le and le resoures in the earth in twenty year , such a gas , oil . and the price of these resource will grow up qiuckly , which made the private car le and le popular . so the rail-way and subway transportation will play an improtant role in the future . so the number of private car will be reduced greatly by the market rule . what 's more , the bus and subway will be cheaper and more efficient for the people in twenty year with the development of science and tecnology . at that time , choosing trave by car , particurly private car , will be not a wise decision , because it cost more , gain le . one strong argument for my conclusion is that there may be more convinent tasportation way in the world in twenty year . for example , the bike with solar energy system may be invented in the future , which will replace the position of car a the main method of traveling and transportation . so , in a word , i believe that new tool which is better for tansportation will be invented in twenty year . last but not least , the car have bad effect in the environment . they cosume the gas and output the harmful gas to the environment . so the use and the number of the car may be controled by the goverment . and the people will also pay more attention to their health , so , more people will choose bike a the main transportation tool , not only for the cheap price , but also for rding the bike ha good effect on people 's health . so , in conclusion , i agree with the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i reinforce my stand point by list the major reason above .
