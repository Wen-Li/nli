i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . some people migh disagree of this opinion . for example , package of pharmaceutical or food product . these package are defineded that there is explanation of the specific inoformation by fda . my friend is db ( diabetic disease ) , and she always checkes package of food how much carbohydrate are contained in it . this information is the most important one for her . she does't care about design or picture or tv advertisement . however , i have an experience that one advertisement made product seems much better than it really is . for the hotel , their product is building and room and service . they want to ` sell ' their room for customer , and they try to make their customer will be comfortable . the customer 's satisfuction lead next ` sale ' . i decided to go summer vacation with my friend when i wa collage student . i checked book of travel to reserve a room at hotel . we tried to stay at expensive hotel because we would graduate after this vacation . so this vacation ha special meaning for u . we found one picture . this hotel 's building is europ style and also they have a lot of sport activity like a teniss or swimming pool etc . after we arrived that hotel , we realized the picture of hotel is no reflect what they are . any other customer doe n't play tennis because this teniss court ha a huge hole in the center . we spent a lot of money for this therefore , i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in fact , manu company spend a huge amount of money for advertisement to their sale will grow .
