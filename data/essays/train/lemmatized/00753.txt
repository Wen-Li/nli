i disagree with this statemant which say that understanding idea and concept than learning fact . when you listen to somebody 's lecture or opinion , you might have question about it . then , you might start researching what the fact is . imagine that you are in class , being taught about history . your teacher tell you one event with reading a text book . you become interested in that historical event . it is prooved the event is true , i think , however , it is not the only anwser , because no one saw it acutually . you can start research to find the fact . you might get much defferent information about it . that is the fact about that historical event . however , a you learned the fact , you can have your own opinion about it . i believe that having your own opinion is the most important thing . understanding the idea and concept is impotant , because it give you a chance to have question . learning fact mean that includes understanding idea and concept is more important . moreover , you can see the fact and have your opinion about matter .
