in my opinion , i strongly feel that one should be a specialist in what he/she doe and this specialization can only be achieved when he/she undergoes systematic education in that specific subject . there are lot of pro and con associated to this topic of discussion . to begin with , i would like to mention a few advantage of not specializing in one subject . by having a broad knowledge , the person keep his option open and wait for the right opportunity to strike at the right time . as an example , when we apply it to the context of acquiring a job , this leaf him/her with some aspect of certainty that if the job market/behavior change it orientation because of certain issue , he/she still ha the ability to get himself/herself a decent job because of the knowledge gained in many academic subject . when it come to a specialized person , i feel that he ha many advantage over his couterpart . being focussed in one particular field , one can dedicate lot of `` time & effort '' and be motivated to work in this field . he get to learn this from people who have specialized in this field . he is almost certain that he know the industry causes-needs situation . he is trained to deal with every possible shortcoming in his filed of specialization . he ha the confidence to independently deal with the problem . apart from all these personal advantage , he help the industry in recruiting the right candidate for the open job position . this leaf the industry with some sort of relief of finding the right person for the position . on a person note , i would like to focus on my academic background and discus the reason that help me adhere to my opinion . in the final year of the undergraduate study , i had to complete a project work . i developed interest in this field and succesfully completed the project work with good grade . but at the back of my mind , i had this certain level of incompleteness because during the course of my project work , i came across certain issue which needed more specialized education . it wa at that time , i decided that i should be enrolled for a master program to get my doubt solved and to gain better perspective into this specific subject . on the other hand , i could have completed the task and very superficially call myself and expert . now my thirst of knowledge ha further increased a i feel that i should not leave my education midway and continue with a doctoral degree which will certainly make me an expert in this field . therefore , i feel that being perfect in a field help rather than getting involved into thing which you are not very good at . as it rightly said `` jack of all trade , master of none '' .
