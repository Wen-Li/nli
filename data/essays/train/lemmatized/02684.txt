although it might be very difficult to know how people act in future i cast doubt on this statement for many reason . first of all , if people will drive fewer car there must occur a big invention of a thing in future that is more usefull and at the same time cheaper than our car . looking at the current technology i do not think that it is possible to create wonderfull thing within the next twenty year . another important point is that third world country , like india or pakistan are just at the beginning of using car . they are many year behind the sophisticated country like for example germany or the united states . so in these country the car usage will be emerge in high rate . moreover an invention like that should also be not very harmfull to the environment . otherwise the kyoto protcol which wa signed by most of the world nation could not be fullfilled . and because of there are no recently environment friendly invention of power delivery i do not think that it is possible within ten year . of course world leading scientist are working on more environment friendly thing than petrol , but these progress are made only for car and not for other form of transportation device . finally one could say that it is impossible to invent a more sophisticated transportation device than car within the next twenty year . so we have to surch for other possibility whz the usage of car could decline . most obviously would be the point , that we simply do not use a many car a we do know . therefore it must be better for people to not use there car . but a the human being is said to be lousy , that seems very unreal .
