i agree that travelling with a group which is led by a tour guide is the best way for many reason such a : the tour guide know many place than we do , give u more information about what we are visiting , safe our money a well . first , i prefer to travel with a group and which is guided by a tour guy because this going to give me a chance to know a much place i can know . also , the tour guide know what are the best place we are visiting more than we do . however , travelling individually make the trip more flexiable . the second reason why i prefer to travel in a group is that the tour guide try to provide u with more information about place we are going to visit with . in addition , the tour guide know that our time is valuable and we do not have that much time to waste in our thing . this is what make travelling with a group enjoyable . third , travelling with in a group safe our money and the cost of this trip doe down . for example , i have travelled many time by my self for a ten day to egypt and i have spent more money than my family did when they visited egypt with a group guide . for this reason , i have become to an idea which is travelling with a group is cheaper than by myself . finally , i encourge people to travel with a group for these reason . and , travelling in a group going to make the trip le costly for them .
