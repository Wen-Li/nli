is it more important to understand concept than learn fact ? this question is mainly about the opposite educative system in the world . anglophone country such a england or the united states give more importance to fact whereas french educative system highlight the major role of concept . the french educative system is well kown for the large set of concept you have to learn before being able to practice . teachers evaluate one 's ability to increase it theorical knowledge rather than the way he performs . this system allows student to understand all phenomenon and to konw how they work . for instance , comparing the french set of law to the english one underline the major difference between learning concept or fact . in the french code of right , numerous article are written in order to take into account all citizen behavior . on the contrary , the english legal system focus on real case that happened in the past . this lead me to the second part of my study . to contrast , anglophone country believe in the pratice . in university for example , student work on case study more than on concept . they consider that student will better react to their environment if they have already experienced all alternative . in my opinion , i agree with the angliophone educative system and with the importance to learn fact rather than concept . i consider that our future life will be full of positive or negative experience and that we will need prior experience to reference to . as wll a i am concerned about education , i would say that french system should take example of the english system .
