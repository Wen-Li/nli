many people want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . they think others will show respect to them because of their broad knowledge . of course , to know a lot cost time and energy . it 's a provement of one 's ability . if one doe have broad knowledge but not specialize in any subject , doe it good for him or her ? i do n't think so . if one ha broad knowledge of many academic , he or she would n't have enough time to specialize in any of the subject a the human-being 's ability and energy are limited . but the fact is , most people should or would have work in a certain period of time . a certain work need one to own a specific ability to solve certain problem . that mean the one who have lot of knowledge of many subject ca n't do anything at all . their knowledge are too superficial to deal with any problem . so this kind of people are likely to loose their job a their knowledge ca n't help anything . they are like some old-fashion liberaries . another inefficiency is that they do n't gain a much satifactory feeling a the people who are specialize in one specific subject . their broad knowledge may come from book , lecture or internet . but they just recite the thing which are provided by others . they ca n't make up anything or develope any idea a they spend all their time in searching other 's comment or point of view . in contrast , the people who are specialize in one specific subject can think of idea they are interested in more thoroughly and deeply than others . they may gain something by their own . we all know that creation can make one pride and content . of course , repeating others ' thing ca n't be called creation . so the people who have broad knowledge can never feel this kind of feeling . what i mean is not to suggest people to study only one subject . to know many thing can bring benefit to u . but at the same time , you should specialize in one subject or you 'll find there is nothing you could do in the future .
