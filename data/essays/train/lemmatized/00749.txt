i agree with statement young people enjoy life more than the old people . the young people can enjoy more than the old people due to the following reason . first young people have more place to explore when compared to old people . to explore these new place young have lot of energy and enjoyment by exploring that place . incontrast old who might have already visited that place will le entusiasm and excitement when compared to the young people . second , most of old people will be suffering from chronic disease like diabates , bloodpressure , and heart related disease so old people suffering from these disease can not enjoy a much a young people who are more resistant to these chronic disease . moreover financial problem are more for old people when compared to young people because old people will not have sufficient energy to work so they cant earn money to spend it on different amusement for enjoying thier life . on the otherhand young people with lot of energy can work more and can earn more so that they can spend on different amusement to enjoy thier life . so old people can not enjoy the life a much a the young people because they have financial problem , they may be suffering from chronic disease moreover they dont have so much energy to enjoy thier life when compared to the energetic young people .
