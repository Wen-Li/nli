i partially agree with the following statment , inorder for student to understand an idea and concept they need to learn fact before that to get there own idea and learn what is wrong and wright by living the scene or acting it . any person can understand an idea if it there own idea sharing idea that came from a fact would be extremly helpful . i 'm a student and my opinion in how a student can get to know thing and understand easily is by fact and real life story somthing that ha happened to someone or something . if we compare a person which is highly experienced with a person that is not experienced but got taught that experience who would get more idea and get good in it ? obviously they lived it and felt it . on the other hand , if idea come from student own knoweledge it would be a great idea if they would discus it for them to exchange and share idea amongest eachother and may be very exciting wheras , learning fact from old histrorian book that is 100 year old would be extremly not intresting and the student would find it difficult to understand and conctrepate with others about it , more importantly fact and idea about fact are realstic student would beleive it straight away because they may have herd it from friend or family . idea and concept are not limited i can sit in a room and give many idea a i can and give concept all day long because an idea is based on how a student think and what possile matter can be done so it with no limit wheras fact is somthing real and may be limited because a they say fiction cause on and on cause you create thing by your imagination while the fact is based upon a real thing that a brain would believe and end of story . furthermore , i would like to all this is important to all of u because it increasing our knowledge level but thought of something that nobody ever thought of is nearly impossible .
