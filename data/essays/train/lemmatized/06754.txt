i strongly believe that for student understanding idea and concept is much more important than it is for them to learn fact . unfortunately , student are often forced to study many fact and event that they will forget in a short time and wo n't be useful for their future career . on the other side , when they understand the main concept and the basis of a phenomenom they 'll likely remember it for a long time . in my opinion the goal of an effective school system is not not fill in the mind of student with many insignificant tiny detail , but to teach them how to develop their own thinking and how to deal with difficult situation . this is what i 've learned from my personal experience : when i went to secondary school , i had two different art professor ; the first one wanted u to know when and where a paint wa made and the tecniques used by the painter . i wa n't interested at all in this kind of information and a a result i didn ' put a lot of effort in studying that subject and now , after a few year i do n't remember any of the painter that i studied with that teacher . the second teacher wa completely different ; she used to put a lot of emphasis not only on the single paint ; but especially on the idea and the feeling of the author ; she wanted u to learn not the detail but the most importantn characteristic of each artistical movement . i wa really fascinated by the method of teaching of the new professor and i think it wa also effective because now i can still remember what i studied with her . therfore , from both my belief and my personal experience , i can say that it is more important for student to untderstand idea rather than learn fact .
