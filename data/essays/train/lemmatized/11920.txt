there are a lot of reason to support this statement , but , in the other hand , there are also a lot of reason to show big disadvantage in this type of knowledge . firstly , at the day of today , it 's very important to have a good specialization in evry type of work . in fact more and more specialization are required in job related not only to high tecnologies but also in all type of work , from office worker to scientist . if you are specialized in your work you will reach better position and certainly you will have a big pay . but there is also a big disadvantage in this type of specialization . in fact in that way you often do n't know some important thing also related to your work a a result of the type of study that you have had . and there are a lot of situation in which only a more large view of the problem could solve it better than a specialized one . another big disadvantage is that it 's certainly better to have a knowledge of a wide range of subject because it allows you to understand real society and the real knowledge of human being . it is useless have a very specialized understanding of complex argument if you do n't understand all others thing . so i am convinced that with a broad knowledge of many academic subject you can live in a better way , because you are really aware of the society that surround you . for example , having only knowledge based on technic you do n't have cultural information about art and literature and so on . and , in conclusion , the clever man is not the one that know all of something , but the one that know something of all .
