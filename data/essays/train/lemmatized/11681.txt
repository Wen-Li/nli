the issue at hand is whether successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this issue is important because it discus the mentality of successful people and what they did to earn their success . i agree that successful people try new thing rather than doing what they already know because that is the basic theme of sucess . according to me succes many a time mean to be just different-a class apart . many scientist would have not succeded if they would have not thought differently than others . many businessmen would have not succeded had they adopted the same production and marketing policy . because of the above mentioned point i think successful people do new thing . secondly doing new thing also help different other people who were not helped before , making the initiator succesful . for example , mahatma gandhi tried a new thing called satyagraha and and non-voilence and helped indians to come out of the clucthes of the british regime . he became successful because he tried a new practice in the history of indian independeence instead of watching in silence , a thing which an ordinary person would have done . hence at time helping people in a new way also make a person successful . lastly a person who take risk and try new thing get an immense sense of fulfilment . in this way he becomes successful in his own eye . doing thing which already one know make him bored and the job monotonous . sometimes one tends to lose interest in everyday routine work , so trying new thing or new method would often make even a lay man successful in his own small way . in conclusion i would again assert that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this is because only doing new and better thing help them become succesful and different from others .
