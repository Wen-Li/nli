the youth of today 's generation is much more involved and busy with his individual life that sometimes he fall short of the day . this change is prevalent in this generation . but one should serve the community a he is also the part of the same community . i am in agreement with statement . the busy schedule of day to day life and their hectic time table hardly leaf the people today to think of any other activity rather than managing themselves . besides this people are very selfish nowadays and are only concerned about their own comfort and hardly concern to help the community . communities are also imporatnat part of society . but the people will not realise this fact until it is made apparent to them . some are busy in building their career , some are busy in the study and some in thier professional life and they hardly give importance to the community service . though these community are established to help them they hardly care about it . but when it come to benifitting from these community there are first in the que . they are also wealthy people in the society who are only busy in enjoying their life 's and spending money lavishly rather then spending a little for a good cause . lack of time is not only the reason why people do not pay attention to extend help to the community but also lack of interest . its time now that young people should understand the importance of helping these community a they are part of it and helping the community will also get them good popularity and success . helping the community is a feel good factor still for many people a they actively participate in helping the community by doing what all they can do . serving the community is like serving to god . the need of the hour is young people apart from doing their regular work should also feel that serving the community is also part of their schedule and then only they can prosper .
