from my point of view , young people enjoy their life more than people do . first off , confronted to le responsabilities than the grown-ups , they have plenty of time to enjoy life . thus , they just see the nice side of it . indeed , young people are usually neither married , nor parent . moreover , they do have parent who care for them and pay for them when they need . on the contrary , older people are le looked after and a part of their family is dead . they have to care for their survival . for instance , they must be sure to have enough money every day . all of this considered , young people have le to think about and that mean , they have le problem about everyday 's life . moreover , they do n't have lived much because of their age and everything ha to be discovered . thus , they will have plenty of project to acomplish such a travelling . when concerned about their future , they would make a lot of plan . as for me , dream are very important . the goal you want to reach when you are young heve to be kept when growing older . for instance , i would like very much to study abroad and dicover a new culture . i am very attached in making souvenir . i think when you are in an other country a every thing is new you will make a lot of souveirs in a short time . furthermore , you meat a lot of different people , actually imn my mind , young people are very interest in nez experience whereas , older people have already made the larger part of their experiment . eventually , being young is a very confortable position . you can always relye on the perspective that you can possibly do in the future what you do n't have done yet . to conclude , i would say that feel very happy to be young .
