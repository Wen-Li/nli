nowadays , you have to take risk and dangerous decision if you want to succeed . i obviously agree and i find it normal that your are more successful if you take risk than if you only do what you can do . exept if you are a genious , you can not succeed without taking risk . for example with a clothes shop . the owner take risk by ordering new collection of clothes every year . he do not know if he is going to sell all the clothes he ordered and he do n't even know if the customer are going to like the style of clothes he ordered . so he ha to take a risk by imaginating what clothes will be fashion enought this summer . he is taking a risk so it is normal that if his prediction were correct , he receive more money by selling more clothes . he can be successfull thank to the risk he took . but if he hire someone to help him selling the clothes , i reckon that it is normal that the person he ha hired do not succeed because he did n't took any risk , he is only doing what we asked him to do . however , the fact of taking risk consern also taking risk with what is legal , and what is not . unfortunately more and more people become successful because the took risk by doing something forbidden . for example , someone who will sell drug take hudge risk but he can easily become very healthy . in summary , even tought i agree with this statement , i would permit myself to correct it by chanching the fact that it is not successful people who try new thing and take risk , but people who try new thing and take risk in order to become successfull . once they are successfull , they should stop taking risk because risk can ruin them either .
