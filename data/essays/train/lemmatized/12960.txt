as we all know , life is changing very fast and new invention are rising now and then . some may say that some of the older invention will come to an end and some would say these invention will still remain . one of these invention are automobile . in my opinion i dont think that car will fewr after twenty year from now for several reason : first , a car is an essential thing to have nowadays simply because one could not do anything with this precious gift from science . the main reason that gave the first idea of inventing the car wa the difficulty man had faced during his daily life either because of the distence or because of illness . some may argue that there were animal which can support people , i think that dealing with a thing that ha sens is really hard specially when it come to meuls or horse . another reason is that people cant stand - and i 'm one of them - living without having an automobile . in these day and in the comming year , an automobile will be a sign of leasure and wealthiness ; some may prefer to say , but generally speaking it is an important invention that scientests have done . i think , like other people do - that technology is very costy . if we assume that car will decrease because of a new thing that scientests have invented and this invetion will decrease the ammount of car to the half , a simple reason will be that this kind of invention will be very expensive and not all people can manage to have it . from what i stated above it clearly show that i have a pissamistic point of view , maybe because i dont belive in science , or simply because the increasing number of needy people who are the source of new automobile .
