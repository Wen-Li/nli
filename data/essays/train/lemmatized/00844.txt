i agree to the given statement . succesfull people try new thing and take risk . all the people could do wat they have already known , but the people who try for acheiving and observing new thing were vrey greatful . normal people are different from scientist , who always trying to invent new thing . as i am interested in research , i prefer peole trying new thing were great and they would be the succesful in their carrer . for example : there are 2 type of job offered for different people . one is related to their knowledge an the other somewhat related to brainstorm and work hard to prove it and show better result . so many were interested in selecting 1st job , but few people who were really looking for good carreer select second job and try why it is difficult . not only job , in practical life also people wont risk to do thing they dont know . for example i n a school , quiz show , is taking place . teacher asked question if the student dont know the rigth answer , no one risk to press the button and answer . they probably think why should we take risk ? they simply say that we dont know , and they didnt even try for the answer . this is not hte right thing . some student try to answer the question and even it wa wrong they should not feel antyhing wrong . and this is the right way . now they attempted wrong and next time they rectify their mistake and able to remember the answer correct and these student score good mark . and these student will come up in their life brightly an these are succesfull on their career . so , i probably conclude my opinion by mentioning that risk should be taken by people in their life which lead to succesfull person in their career . what we have known is known , that we can not do any thing . what we dont know is considered and try to know something better and be a successful person .
