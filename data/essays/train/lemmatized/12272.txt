with the time , advertisement have been popular because they sale product in the market . therefore , i agree that they make product seem much better than they really are by improving their appeareance and convicing the people who buy them that they can be useful , knowing that the reality could be another . advertisements improve the appeareance of the product by making it attractive to custumer 's eye . then , some product like shampoo or soap seem to be good eventhough they are not , but publicist have the ability to trick the customer with some white hoax such a showing people who have wonderful hair and skin in television and meke them lie u by telling u that the product really worked in them improving their life quality . as a result , we decide to buy it and just try it . to convice the custumer is a goog way to enhance the product popularity because this is like a chain , in which the information can be spread easily . therefore , to anunce that a product have many advantage than others such a heathy food , which is a popular subjet now , can convice people to buy and really spread the information to their family and friend , so finaly everybody belive in it . in conclusion , the mayority of advertisement have been maken to attract customer attention by enhancing the product appearance and finally convincing everybody that they are useful , so the possibility to sale it in the market is always greater because people always belive . perhaps , we enjoy advertisement and we like the world plently of lie .
