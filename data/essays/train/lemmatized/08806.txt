to my mind , i think young and old people enjoy life from different way . first of all , it is true that young people enjoy life because they are very optimist . . they do not take care about problem of the world ; they just only leave their life . . for instance , at the age of 20 , young people like me are very happy . we think that we are invincible and we think that in the future we will not have problem like our parent for example . then , a lot of people and not only young people , think that having 20 is a good thing , this is the best periode . . this is the age of love , sexual experience , jod experience , holiday experience without parent . .. in fact , it is the age of discover . .. everything is new and interesting . .. so there is no way for young people to learn about life , only just by enjoy life . but if young people enjoy life , there is also old people who enjoy it . that 's true . .. when old people retired from their job , they have a lot of moment for them . .. they can travel . .. they are not obliged to wake up every morning in order to go to work . .. and most of the time , they enjoy life more than youger people . for example , my grand mother is very happy to be in the category of the old people . .. when she wa young , she could not travel because she had to work . .. and before , life wa not the same a nowadays . .. but today , with her association of her subburb , she can travel where she want . .. in addition , since she 's retired from her job , she ha travelled every where ; egypt , spain , italy , turkey . .. and so on . .. she travel a lot . .. and a lot of retired people or old people are in this case . .. so we can say that to be old it is a sort of a second life where people discover again some thing , where they learn again about technology , science , culture , and also about young people . . so , in conclusion , we can say that there is not a lot of difference between young and old people and personnaly , i have never met a personn who did not enjoy life . i use is to say life is beautiful so enjoy it . ..
