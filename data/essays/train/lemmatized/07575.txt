actually i disagree , since learning fact is the main part of building an idias or concept , which will be reflected on the amount of fact they learned . the much you learn and study about fact and information , the much the clear idias will be ready to speak out about . many people sponsered an idais that do not stand or reflect any fact , these will be very fragil and will not found any field of practice since it not factual concept . so in order to be in the way of good learning way we have to make sure we study the important basic and learn more fact in order to be able and more confedent to have a new idia and getting more advance in the field of knowledge . for me , understanding idias is secondary to learning the other part of fact and information since not all idias are correct or in other way it is still a theory rather than approved fact , so concentrating on this veiw of teaching the student will be more important to be in the side of producing a logical and practical type of mentality and getting more beneficial idias a we reflecting all on fact and concept . further the more , it is really interesting to explain that fact and concept are only the way to understand all idias a with out these fact we can not progress to a matter of making theory and adopting a new concept in any field of life . students are more willing to learn when they feel they are standing on a solid base that help them to understand more idias and they can learn fast when they feel more confortable with the way of getting the informatin and this will be through learning fact first the understanding the concept .
