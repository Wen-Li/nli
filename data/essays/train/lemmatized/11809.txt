in my personal opinion , i agree with the statement , that define successful people a the person who try new thing and take risk rathern than only doing what they already know . i consider that succesful people share this definition , in the sense , that people that doesnt try new thing , experiment , or adventure will suspend or shorten out their knowledge , convertenting them into not succesful people and standard people . if you have that spirit of investigating , like in trying new way of finding certain knowledge , you could consider yourself a a succesful people . other important thing , is that if you are scare of trying new experiment or new method , that at first could seem rare or odd , you coud never have the believe that you are going to succes in the life . if you study the history , you could find some example of scientist like gramman bell , franklin and mark twain , that assume many risk on their investigation and tried hundred of time their experiment , here they never settle up . now their discovery and their knowledge are recognize in the world wide , and they were successful and recognize scientist . this scientist never decline in their idea of investigating new thing , this characteristic permit them to go beyond the other people that dont try or investigate new thing . always , when you tried new thing , you have a porcentage of failing in what you are doing or of getting your objetive , but imaging if you take the risk and invent something that nobody have reach to . i can support my afirmation , with some particular example in my life . in order to have all what i had , my father had to affront new thing , sometimes he fail on what he started , and other time he achieve the goal . because of this argument , i consider him a a succesful man in life . in conclusion i consider that by trying new thing , you could convert into a better huamn and also a successful person .
