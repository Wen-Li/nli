i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the main reason of making product seem much better than they really are is achieving maximum profit out of selling the biggest amount possible through putting an over rated image of your product in your consumer ' mind . companies make their product seem much better than they really are to an extent that they create an illusion in the consumer 's mind by playing on his emotion and feeling . they create an idea through the advertisement into the consumer 's mind that their product is the answer for his problem . excessive competetive advertisement make a lot of distraction in consumer ' mind which obliges company to make their product seem much better than they really are and to an extent of making their product better than all of the other competetive product ; in other word to make their product `` the unique product '' . many advertisement give their product an over rated image which obliges other company to give their product an over rated image or else their product will be considered weak among the other over rated product . although some advertisement do not make their product seem much better than they really are but most of the advertisement do .
