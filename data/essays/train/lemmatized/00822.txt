some people agree that it is better to specialize in one specific subject , however , i think it is better to learn broad knowledge of many academic for the following reason . first , having broad knowledge allows u to work more effectively in business . when i wa a university student , i majored in economics at hitotsubashi university , in tokyo , japan . hitotsubashi university is famous for economics , management , and laws . but in hitotsubashi university offered me broad academic course , such a science , environment , and mathmatics . so i learned science and environment a well a economics . after graduating , i ha worked in osaka gas comapany . so i had to get the knowledge of nature of gas . though it is an area of science , i can learn it easily , because i learned science before . if i had not learned science in university , i should have troubled studying nature of gas . this experience clearly show that getting broad knowledge is more useful in business . second , learning broad knowledge provide u the oppotunities to think broadly . as stated above , i took the environment class in hitotsubashi university . so i deeply know that the environment preservation is essential . and because osaka gas company started to sell the environment friendly boiler , eco-will , which is cogenaration system for redidential , i applied to work for osaka gas . because i consider osaka gas a a environmen-friendly company . in fact , osaka gas is environment-friendly company , my desicion is justified . if i had not studied environment course , i might not recognized that osaka gas is good company this example strongly show that we may a well study broad knowledge . in conclusion , i definitely believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is more useful .
