there is no doubt that car is the mainstream of transportation in modern time . although still car are incredibly increasing nowadays , i believe that use of car will decrease in the future time . i will present briefly two reason to support my opinion . first of all , polution problem it occurs is a serious issue in the past and also future time . goverments are making a strict schedule to control car and pollutant it mades recent year . many experiment and result already showed that serious air pollution caused by car can cause lung cancer and lead human to death . it is a problem that conflict with human health even to human survival , strong limitation of using car will made in the future time . it is not a matter of only human matter of earth 's . furthermore , new transportation that is more convenient and do not make any pollutant will invent in the future time . already many scientist and expert of car started it ' invention . recently invented electronic and hydrogen transportation is a fine example of thisinvention . they use electricity or water for their fuel to run which doe n't make any pollutant to the air . one problem is it 's price but development of technology will solve it naturally . invention of car wa a revolutionary one to human kind . however it threaten human life recent time . limitation of it 's use and invention of new transportation is necessary . i believe that human will chose to stop using car naturally in the future time according to above mentioned reason : it 's pollution problem and appear of new transportation .
