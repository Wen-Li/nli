`` young people enjoy life more than older people do . '' this is a statement many people from different age group claim to be true . but i believe that this statement is not true . young people can enjoy life , most of them do . but the problem nowadays is that all the young kid and young adult have a desire to grow faster and mature earlier in order to be allowed to do more thing . as well , many of them take several thing for granted , such a child 's game , situation and experience that you only experience in your childhood . they believe that these situation such a climbing the tree or sleeping in a childrens ' house will always be there for them to take . so they desire to grow up earlier in order to do the thing they watch in tv , such a having a girlfriend/boyfriend or going to college . this fake believe robs them from their true fun , which at their age should be table game , or play station . for example , my younger cousin who is 9 want to grow up a soon a possible . therefore , he ha bought ( with his saving ) thing that a grown up should have like a cellphone . this obsesion to mature ha shifted him away of the true enjoyable situation a child should experience . as maturity come in a time for everyone , adult know that their time on earth is limited . thanks to their previous eagerness to grow up , they did not have the chance to experience all the situation life had to offer . hence , this time , they will make time ( if they need to ) in order to enjoy themselves and live life to the fullest . although a an adult , one ha more responsabilities and concern , everyone try to make the time to relax and enjoy life . this desire for living life to the fullest together with the new oportunities they now have is what allows an adult to finally achieve the joy they 've always been looking for . as joy is something everyone always desire , they will try to repeat their fun everytime they can . overall , the statement that claim that young people have more fun than older people is a fallacy due several fact . firstly , younger people try to run past their childhood in order to reach adulthood and have more freedom . but at this time , they are losing every oportunity to enjoy thier life . secondly , adult now that their time in the world is limited , hence they want to live to the fullest a they can . the truth is , adult due to their knowledge of life and time , are the one that enjoy more life .
