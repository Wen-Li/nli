i am disagree with this knowledge based on many academic subject . i believe people should be specialize on one subject . as the whole academicans know , specialization just include of this academic subject 's improvement . in the world history , development really related with specialization of person . for example alexander grahambel just have experience based on telephone so that he could not be interest problem politcs within academic level . especially this specialization getting more important when the academic area becoming more developed . after the industrial revolution whole academic area clearly and quickly improved . this development process directly ha relation with specialization 's expanding in academic enviorements . thus , too many academician found new toll , methots mental way for developmets of those specific area . i think human owes to those specialized person for our current developed level . we are appreciate those person
