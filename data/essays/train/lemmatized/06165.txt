the main tendency acting towards the reduction of car is possibly a process of technological change . cars are progressively substituted by other machine , built to help people moving around . there are several force behind this tendency . firstly , new technology are produced to overcome problem of pollution . moreover , another problem raised by the diffusion of car is the recurrence of episode of traffic jam in the big modern city . clearly alternative way of moving around these area have been and will be continuosly searched . the last but no the least point is represented by the rising cost associated with car locomotion , first of all the cost of the petroleum . it is likely that trying to reduce cost private firm will introduce on the market alternative techologies apt to move in city . the main tendency which act against the decline in car in use is associated with the growth of developing country . firs of all , in these country , such a china , a similar culture and economy a those of western country , based on consumerism and private interest , is developing . therefore similar kind of good are likely to be demanded to fulfil similar need - such a that of moving around by car . moreover counttry such a the arab emirates are plenty of natural resource and will not face the problem of rising cost mentioned above . actually , while the technological change is slow because it is not possible to shift merely to an existing technology , the growth of developing country is steadfast . furthermore developing alternative way of motion is extremely expensive even if compared to the cost of energy , which can always be discharged on consumer by mean of price inflation a the opec oil shock experience show . to sum up , i think that a boom in car use is imminent in the next twenty year .
