i totally agree with this staement . there are so many item i have bought seeing there advertisement but most of the time it is not a good a it wa shown on the tv . for example once i bought a face wash.according to the advertisement it make the skin very soft and a shade lighter . forget making the skin lighter , i even got skin rash . i beleive it all business trick . in this world of competition where all the company are fighting to prove there product the best . advertisement are very important medium . all the company want to make profit and do well in the field . but i beleive they should not do this . .. because indirectly they are cheating there customer . ok say , once you can buy the product by seeing it good advertisement , but a soon a use it , you know the quality of it . i feel that they should focus more on the quality of the product then the advertising the product . if the quality of the product is good and it is worth using customer will definetly buy it . i do agree that good advertisement force the customer to buy the item the first time so it also very important to have good advertisement .
