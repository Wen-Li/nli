i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are two reason for my opinion : the pupose of the advertisement is to sell the product , and the audience do not see directly the product on their eye . first , the purpose of the advertisement make the good seem much better . the advertisement company should present the good to sell , not to show the virtue and vice of the good . when people see the advertisement , the good seem perfect and make people the happiest person in the world . when i wa a middle school student , i really wanted to buy a new computer ; i actually did not have good knowledge of the computer . when i watched a fabulous advertisement of a computer , i pursuaded my parent to buy the computer on the advertisement . finally , my parent accepted my seggestion and bought me that computer . however , i found out my new computer used not genuin program on the computer . i pursuaded my parent with the computer because the computer had everything look best even though it wa very cheap . i wa very disappointed about the advertisement which described their product a the best at that time . second , the audience doe not see directly see the product on their eye . people say that the good on the picture or the tv look different when they see it directly . my sister had a similar situation recently . she bought a bag on the website which looked fine . however , she did not even recognize the bag because the color of the bag wa different from the picture on the website . it wa not the seller 's fault but the camera 's fault . i read an article related to these happening ; seeing an object on the picture and seeing the object on the naked eye are different because the camera lens produce the photo with mixing red , yellow and blue which cause distortion of color . moreover , the advertisement company devise the best angle of imposing light on the product that the product look better . this problem mean that people should not precisly judge a product only according to the image presented on the picture or the tv . depends on my experience and scientific knowledge , it is clear that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i hope that the advertisement company try to show the virtue and the vice of their product rather than only show and exaggerate the quality of the product . moreover , i wish that scientist invent more accurate way of taking picture or recording that the audience can face the good more accurately .
