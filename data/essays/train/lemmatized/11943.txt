i really agree with this statement , in life the people who try to discover new thing taking risk have one motivation to still becomen better every day , is like a kind of auto motivation . for example in a medica doctor student , the professor ha a study plan , but if the student limite to follow that plan he will only adquire the minimal information to become a doctor , but he do not will have the hability to success from over the other student so , the professional doctor not notice him presence to ask him to mbecome a part of their team member . people need to take risk , try different thing , need to look not only that they have in front , they have to explore the world and improve new technology with this kind of activitis they will success more than others that only do that they know how to do well , they never become a greater person , at work they never grow up , they will be confined to their site for their lifetime . an example of a success person who take risk and to more could be bill gates , he wa a simple and normal student that love the computer but one day he ha a dream , he begin to contact people , he do thing , he promote his product and now , he is one of the most successful person in world , because they dont want to do every day only thing that he know well how to do , he want to improve new thing , and he did it so in conclusion it is pretty obvious that the people who do more that they suppose to do , become much more successful that the people that only do what they already know how to do , and for this i invite to everyone to do more everyday , do all that you want to do , explore the world , enjoy the life , and success .
