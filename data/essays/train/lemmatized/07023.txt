i support that successful people try out new thing and take risk than only doing what they have already know how to do well . i believe that success , in any form give human being a different way of thinking and doing thing . success may be in any form i.e. , it may be in the form of money or fame or in any other form . this give a man to think in a different way from the usual thinking and trying out thing differently . they try to do thing in a new fashion and not in the way that they have already done or in a way that they knew . there are some characteristic developed in these successful people along with the success . these successful people dare to take risk and work out thing differently . for an instance , there a difference in doing the thing by a very rich man when compared to a poor man . here , success , in the form of wealth change the thinking of the rich man and he try doing thing in a different manner . for example , the rich man go to a very costly restaurant , clothes himself heavily , move in a costly car and dines at different place . a middle class man can do all these act performed by a rich man , but he doe not exceed his limit . this is success in the form of wealth which make the rich man to work out thing differently . consider success in the form of fame . the highly famed people doe thing differently when compared to the normal people . they arrive to new idea of working thing out . in this case , due to the fame of these successful people , they dare to take risk in any form a they are famous . and if anything undesirable happens , they are backed by their fame . all the people that are successful , try to work thing in a different manner and are prepared to take risk rather than doing thing in the manner that they already know . their ability of thinking that they can manage the consequence of the thing workedout in a different way keep them going on doing thing in a different manner . they are ready to take risk a they are successful and a they think , they can handle the situation and the result of workingout thing differently .
