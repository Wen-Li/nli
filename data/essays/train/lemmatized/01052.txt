young people are different from before . in the past young people were working for own community ; however many thing to have fun with friend especially in tokyo . in my opinion , i am agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i have two reason that support my position . young people started to hang around in big city not near by their house and they ca n't think about other people . there is a city whose name is ikebukuro . this city ha many arcade park , caraoke , poll barn and so on . the city is best place to hang out or date for young people . i also the one who think same way with young people think . in my ecperience , i wa always haging out with friend at ikebukuro and come back home late . at that time i have never interested about my community . i wa thinking that it is n't fun at all if i help my community . is there any benefit if i do so ? i couldn `` t understand people who help their community . i think there must be more people who think same way with mine . i think young people became more selfish than before . they work just for their life , not for their family and they ca n't feel any love from family . this lead to hanging around only with friend . in my experience , i wa always hanging around with friend . i could n't feel any love from my family . therefore , i could n't have any interested about my community ; however , people helped me during examination season for college . they gave me a lot of information about college and especially my family helped me to find a college which fit my preference . i wa doing this job by myself but i could feel love from my family and people who are in my community . in conclusion , young people startet to hang around only big city not to involve their community and became more selfish than before .
