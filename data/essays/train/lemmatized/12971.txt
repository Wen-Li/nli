i agree with the following statement . because i think the sience and tecnology are developping . the oldest age , people could not speak word and they did not have clothes and shoe . then they could cook a little bit . but nowaday , we can have a lot of clothes and shoe . and we can cook lot of food . because people and siences and tecnologies have developped each other . if people did not find siences and tecnologies , we can not live such now . so i think we can not live if old people could not find siences and tecnologies and they did not developped . `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i think so . because people and sience and tecnologies are developping now . for example , now computer are one of the most useful thing . and there are a lot of the most useful in the world . i think car is one of the most useful thing . because , when i want to go shopping and fishing and driving , i can go to there soon . but i think cara are developping . so i may think next car is faster than now car . and i think next car are flying car . so i think in tenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i don not think people will hate car . people like car . because car is more useful than peple walk . so people will buy the next new car . and people do not need now car . if next car is faster than now car , and more useful , i will want to buy a new car .
