have you ever heard about the word like `` pal-bang-mi-in '' ? this word is from korea , and it mean that good at a lot of thing . as we can know that old saying , the society prefer to be good at many thing rather than good at only one thing . there are three reason that why we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject . first of all , various knowledge make people can talk with others freely and flexible . if someone specialize in one specific thing , he can not talk with other thing freely . for example , i am a person who ha lot of interst with only reading book , and do not have any time to watch a tv . however , when my friend start to talk with tv program , or movie star , i can not join with them . secondly , it can help you to understand many thing at once . considering only one thing can not help people to think other thing . however , when you know even a little part of a broad knowledge with others , it can help you to know how others going on . also , you can know that the progress of the society or other thing . lastly , you can learn many thing easily a many a possible based on the broad knowledge . when you know about a little in something , you already know the basic of those thing , and know how they organized , so you might know the direction of their way . however , if you do not know about some material even a little , then you have to start to know those thing from the beginnig , and it will be harder than start with basic knowledge . to sum up , i would recommand that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . it can help u to have conversation with others freely and flexible , understand many thing at once , and learn many thing easily a many a possible compared knowing nothing . it is a real information age nowadays , and we do not need to specialize in one specific subject any more . the age changed , and we should change to know broad thing and start with get broad knowledge .
