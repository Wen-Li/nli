the environmental concern we know nowadays such a the melt of the ice cap or the thickness of the ozone layer make u wish that there would be le pollution in the future . this result could be reached thanks to a breakdown in the use of car , which pollute a lot because of exhaust gas . however , i do not think that in twenty year the use of car will be le important because car bring u a comfort that no other way to travel can equalize . first of all , car are very comfortable . thanks to them , we can go quite fast wherever we like . nowadays , in every country in the world there are concrete road which enables u to travel by car . this is a common point of all earth citizen . moreover , it is a private place . it belongs to you a your flat or house doe . consequently , you can adapt it to your taste and make it look like a you want . for instance , we can often see car painted with funny colour or with a lot of stick on the window . you can also decide whether to clean it or not , whether to allow pet to get in , whether to listen to music loudly or not . on the contrary it is impossible to act this way in public transport like bus . you have to bear people 's attitude even if you disagree with it . finally , i reckon that only environmental concern can prevent people from using there car which would have been replaced by eco-friendly bus for example . however developping country can not afford and implement such progress . so , inhabitant of developped country wo n't agree to give up with the car comfort while people in developping country still take advantage of it . so , to conclude briefly , i think car will prevail for quite a long time : twenty year is a too short period to make people understand they have to stop using their car .
