in my opinion , i support the idea to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . there are two reason why i support the idea . first of all , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject to help u to think about thing wide angle . for example , if i have different opinion from my friend , and get fight from it , then i think it is very important to try to think in different angle . in other word , to avoid to think my claim is always right . another reason why i support the claim is because it would help me to live in society with enjoying . to have various knowledge may provide me to communicate with people easily . because i simply imagine that if i have various knowledge , then i wo n't have much tough time to concider what shoud i talk to people . it will provide me many friend . i do not think to specialize in one specific subject is bad . actually , i respect people who is professional about specific subject , because it is result of their concentraining and devote time to study about it . that is great effort i think . howe , i think to have various knowledge mean similar to be flexible person . i would like to be flexible person . what is flexible person for me is , to think about wide range , and can think about by standing other person 's position . then my world would be more expand and life will be more enjoyable . above all , i support the opinion to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than not .
