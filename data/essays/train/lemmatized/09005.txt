understanding the idea behind a fact is much more important than learning the fact by itself . this doe not only apply to strict science like math , but also to subject like history . in math , there is a set of given truth from which the rest are inferred ( prooved ) . the statement obtained from this basic set are formalized in theorem , which , in turn can be used to proove further fact ( new theorem or corollary ) . people lacking the understanding of the basic set of truth or how the theorem were prooved would not be able to achieve further learning . in subject like history , while knowing the fact is very important and one may think that their whole field of study , understanding the reason that gave place to an event may give a kind of knowledge much more usefull than the mere fact . this knowledge may help identify situation that may lead to problem in the future and prevent them . so , while knowing something took place by itself may not be of much help in the future , understanding the factor that gave rise to the situation and what their consequence were , could be very important . the gain we may obtain in the future by understanding idea and concept is the main reason we study . facts by themselves may be useless , understanding the concept behind them is what is usefull . if understanding and the reasoning that go with it were or no consequence , having an encyclopec knowledge of thing would be sufficient . and that is not the case , since we have institution whose only reason of existance is reasearch , that is , understanding concept and idea , to generate new fact and knowlege that may better our society .
