bettering ourselevs is inevitable thing for our living . we usually major in expartize in college and also can get a job by using specific subject . however , i agree wiht this statement for some reason . first of all , many kind of knoledges give u meaningful life time and the ability to get along with others because we often face on situation that we can not expect . for example , when people suffered from illness , and you face on such circumstance , if you have knowledge regarding illness although your major is not related with illness , you can save his life . such matter is sirious issue so we can save them a soon a possible . secondly , whenever we study something including expertizes , we should know other subject . for example , when you study law , we have to kow the situation of society , economic situation , political situation and so on because such thing affect law a lot . considering situation of society , sometimes we have no choice but to change content of law . with out considreing such thing , we can not make rule like law . thirdly , broad knowledge affect character of people . for example , to better yourself , you have to listen or read many kind of opinion . of course , it is important to have your own opinion but we should consider various opinion to make yourself better . having broad knoledge is the same a having many kind of opinion . in conclusion , i agree with this statement . as above , having broad knoweldge give u many advantage . in additon to that , it is said that information is increasing because technology are developing . therefore , we have to have the ability to distinguish whether or not the information is correct . at that time , if you have broad knowledge , you can feel easy . what is more , it become more belieavable . we always brush up ourselves so we try to acquire not only specific subject but also broad knowledge .
