the life is change : my parent when they were child do n't enjoy life a young people live today . on the one hand thirty year ago the life wa very different between today because there were n't all attractive that there is today . for example today the young people go to the disco every saturday night and become to home at the end part of the night ; my parent usually tell me that when the week end came they went to the cinema in the afternoon and after they returned to home ; often they went to restaurant after the cinema . moreover today young people have a cellular : partents can call everytime their child but i think that this element could create a limit for the comunication between child and their friend or family . on the other hand the world change day after day and it 's wright that the people accept the news and the differents ; i think that the parent must control their child for not exagerate in request . on balance i think that it 's wright that young people enjoy life because a lot of year ago their parent enjoy life too .
