i do agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than they are today . world is moving rapidly towords technalogy . people now are getting tierd of car . because first they are very expensive to buy . second , a person spends alot of money for petrol . rood are very busy . car brings alot of damege for exaple acidents that kill people . the smoke that come out of the car brings alot of damge to your health . technalogy move really fast . from now untill twenty year alot of thimgs are going to be invented like insted of driving in the rood people can fly with their own plan . alot of other way of transportation are going to be used . people now use train or the under ground train . alot of country now use train or motorcycle insted of car do to the grown of their poupolation . i think people can manige to live without car . one hundred year ago people used to transport by animal such a horse or camils . do to techanolgy i think that people will invent something that doesnt do harm for people . a person wont think that after twenty year any thing will change , because it only twenty year , but the fact is that twenty year are alot for a person to invent something . how long did it take for a man to invet a space chip ? not more than twenty year . my point is that alot of people no what is good for them and what is bad , even if they didnt notice it emidutly . with no time there will be something insted of car that people can use to transport with it in much easier way ,
