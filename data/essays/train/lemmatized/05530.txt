if i travel in a group , i will enjoy the travel a lot because the tour guide know many good place to see . however , i disagree with this idea . in my opinion , plannning the travel is also enjoyable thing in the travel . if i travel in a group , i will not search about the place where i am going and the memory will not last nor vivid . if there is no one who help me with planning , i search detail about the country and the experience will be helpful even in other situation . when i traveled in okinawa with my friend , we planned our schedule by our self . we hired a taxi and went to many place such a a glass-making shop . to tell the truth , the plan wa not perfect . we had no time to go everywhere we planned , and finally we got lost and we had to ask help to the people in okinawa . that wa not enjoyable memory , but through the experience , i felt the kindness of people in okinawa and wa touched because they were so friendly . of corse there are some possibility of danger . we could get lost in the place we are traveling , like me -- i wa lucky though , especially in foreign country that is a big problem . if there is a guide , we are reliefed when need some help in our emergincy . however , if we are with other traveling people , we will not be able to feel the real culture in the place . we might be friend with other traveling people if we go in a group , but we will never make friend who live in the country . thus , i prefer to travel by myself or only with my friend . from searching the place to making plan , including getting lost , everything is the precious memory .
