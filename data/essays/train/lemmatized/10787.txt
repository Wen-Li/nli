life is a god 's gift for any human being on earth . its in our hand how well we shape it . although enjoyment of life varies from various walk of our life i would agree that young people enjoy life more than compare to older people do . i agree with this opinion because of couple of reason . as i am a youngster i have full of energy , energy to play , energy to travel , energy to work hard . for instance a i am a youngster i can play different kind of game ( base ball , hockey , football ) with my friend tirelessly and enjoy the game by running , jumping kicking etc which old people can not perform and they do n't enjoy game a we do rather they can only be only spectatures . i can travel to different place which have varied environmental condition and i can enjoy every minute of the vacation , that involves a lot of physical fitness and substantial stamen which a probable think older people do n't have . i can perform various activity like riding bike with one hand or foot on the seat with out any pain and enjoy every moment of those . i can go as a youngster i have the chance to wear different kind clothing , eat variety food item , go to party and more over i can do a lot of regular exercise to keep my body fit and fine such a bicycling , swiming , regular work out in the gym . all these activity can not be performed by older people a we do ; a it involves a lot of man and will power . also we can participate in every extra cirruculum activity such a singing , dancing , playing guitar , and enjoy the happinies by performing them , but it not possible by older people . as a youngster we have opportunity to meet with different people from different walk of life and develop new skill from that experience . as we conclude young people ha more energy to do thing .
