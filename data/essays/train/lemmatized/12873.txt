in my opinion , according to the statistic in the past decade imigration to the big city from suburban area is rapidly growing . i think that car become more popular relaed with this city lifestyle . meanwhile number of big metropolitians are increasing year by year . i would like to draw an attention the reason of imigration such a huge potential of unemployment , not enough support for agriculture and farmer , a huge gap between urban and suburban area education system across the country . so in big city personel car become a requirement for those people . as i mentioned before living in a big city force you to have a car to do everything you want in this lifestyle . besides it also account for traffic jam and big mass caos in city that make people unable to live in . on the other hand there are different kind of public transportation . in developed country we can perceive widespread usage of public transportation . but if we look at the developing country personel car usage is hiher rate becuase of insufficent public transport system . for example , istanbul is the biggest city of turkey ; since last year i can not drive to work because there is always an enormous traffic on highway do you think it would probably changed ? no i do not think so . whereas technological development also provides a appropriate platform for people to attract and make them to buy a new car . to sum up , in our rapidly changing and developing world to live witout a car would a utopia . the more money you earn , the more luxury you need .
