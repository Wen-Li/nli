i have to agree with that young people enjoy life more than older people do . the young people ha good health , strong body and they are very active . young people ha good health and they do n't need need to spend time in the hospital and taking midecin . they enjoy their thim in many intersting thing such a swimming , traval , football and so on . on the other hand , the older people spend most of their time either in the hospital or taking midication for their illniss . they do n't have much time for fun . young peole are strong . they have strong body which help them to carry hevey thing . they can carry their cheldern and play with them . they lift wight if the need to exercise . but the older people are weak to carry hevey wight . some of them are not be able to move his body . young people are very active . they can work hard and making mony . they can play sport . however , the older people is not active . they are very slow if they move from place to other . in the end the live is short and if you are young enjoy your live .
