young people only care about themselves . their family , friedns , and school are what is important to them , not some community service they would not even get paid for . this is one stereotype that most adult or elder people believe in . however , a a teenager , i disagree with that for there are young people concerned in helping their community . yes , it is true that young people , majority of them being student like myself , focus more on their academic and work . nevertheless , academic is not the only brick that build up one 's character . several school , which acknowledge the different value for composing an ideal person , provides the opportunity for their student to help their community by going on field trip to a local site or encouraging student to join club that do community service regularly . in my school , international school manila , this happens every single year - i have participated in both the field trip and club activity , such a visiting the orphanage for disabled child ( chosen children village ) . through interaction with people , who have lower living standard than themselves , student definitely learn `` the other side of the world , '' of which they have not been able to see yet . in addition , helping those people inspire a great sympathy that the student body can not gain by spending hour on the desk , naturally leading them to return to their community . even in these day , when young people give more significance to their study , there are still some out there , contributing their time to help their community and earn a pure happiness in return .
