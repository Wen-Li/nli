i 've always been interested in all the environment arund me and every unknown thing it would be a subject to be discovered . if you are intrested in only one subject you could have a great improve of the knowledge of it , but it 's a problem for everything else . i think that bigger is your knowledge a better it is . in fact , if you have some trouble of any kind you can know what you are in front of and you could study and solve it . then , if you know more than one subject , you can discus or argue them with other people and you could improve your self knowledge . many academic subject are also linked , than it 's easier comprend them if you know all a bit of all of them . an example of my istitute ( and many others ) are historical art , modern art , antropology and product design . another example , in the music , all the style are linked and many style born by the knowledge of other style . also , in order to have a nice life , you are advantaged becouse you have a big range where you could find a job that you can enjoy . and in this society the our job is the basement of our life . i have no others opinion for the discus , but i hope that i 've explained all you need for the comprenction of my idea .
