ideas and facts i desagree with the statement , because the fact are important a the idea and concept , the are connect because the idea and concept give the student the fact , they are always behind , in any explication and understanding of idea and concept , we have to consider the fact , to have a deeper reasoning about what we want to learn , but why some people not consider fact a important ? many people think that the concept or meaning is the only thing that matter , because they are superficial and do n't look behind to see the facts . for example , in a high school , the student are only interest in learning the concept a it is , not to know what cause it , or why it is there , this lack of interest on going deeper on the information they have , led them to not be well prepare to present some knowlege test , but also the teacher do n't pay attention to this lackness in their student , so the student only understant the idea but not learn the fact that remark that idea . it is important to always have some fact , so that we can make a better analizis to the theory , that involves the idea and the concept , analyzing all the thing we have in our head , to make a better job . this doesnt mean that the idea and the concept are not important , thay are very important because with them is that we can take in account the fact , so undestanding idea and concept are very , very important , to have a clear thought of what we have . this is like when a bird born , at the begining it is only interest or focus on the food the mother give him , but later need to know the fact that involves how the mother obtains the food , how she procceses it , and how he can do that . are thing that maybe at the beginig it doesnt put attention but at the end would be very an important thing to him . can be concluded , that the fact , and the idea and concept , are both very important to have a better knowlege about something , that when we see the concept , we also have to consider the fact that are behind .
