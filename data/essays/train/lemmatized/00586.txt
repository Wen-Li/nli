teen age is the important part of one 's life . when asked who will enjoy life more between youth and older people , i will incline to youth because of their energy , enthusiasm , tenderness , dareness and zeal to learn new and pleasant one . teen age from14 year to 28 year is completely filled with energy and dare blood . in that age they have oppurtunity to mould character . even they can do anything like naughty thing in class to enjoying party with friend . they will dare to do anything whatever they want because of their physical strength . another thing is in teen age they fill with enthusiasm . they want to learn new thing and they will success too if they have interest . for this reason they want to know and learn new thing they enjoy alot . also youth spend most of their time with friend rather than with family member . with friend they always think of entertainment than study . that make youth to enjoy life than older people . in class too , they will enjoy life by joking or immitating lecturer or making sarcastic statement on fellow student . they will have strong desire and capability to do those thing . due to the coordination between friend they use to dowhatever they want which we will not see in case of older people . students can not only enjoy life like this they even enjoy in academic prospect too . for instance take a student who got good credit in a class . that give him alot of enjoyment and happiness . the hardwork he ha done for getting that good grade may be immense . so finally if he get fruitful result of what he had done to achieve that thing his enjoymrnt will be at it peak . older people can also enjoy life but due to family problem , health problem and lack of strenght they can not enjot life a much a a teen would enjoy . at last by the above example and point i personally think youth especially between age 14-28 year can enjoy alot than a older person .
