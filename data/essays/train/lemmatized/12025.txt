this is an interesting question . i do not realy think , that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than today . one of the reason is , that earth population is growing every minute . more people need more car . today a family with four person ha typically at least three car and that will not change in the next twenty year . maybe we will not have enough place and street for all the car , but than we will have to find new way were we can drive our car . that could be street above our city or in the underground . an argument against my oppinion could be , that we will not have enough energy for all the car in twenty year . this ha to be considered . oil is getting fewer and fewer and therefor more expensive . in the near future nobody can affort driving a car with gas . but i think the human beeing ha a lot of idea to keep the comfort of driving car . maybe we will use bio car , or oxzgen car but i am sure , we will use car . another argument is , that car production is a hugh industry worldwide . millions of people are working in this industry . what would happen to them , if we would produce fewer car . i do not realy see an alternative to car . using the underground train , or a bus is not a comfortabe a driving with my car from door to door . if i go with the train for example i have to take the bus to come to the train station . at my destination i again have to take a bus or a taxi . such a short journey to an other town could take a lot of time and also could be very expensive . with my car i can use my navigation system an go from door to door in half of the time .
