nowadays we can find lot of product in the market . in order to sell these product , there are also many advertisement . i do agree this this statement which say that most of advertisement make product seem much beter than they really are . first , for example when you see in television some product , it attracts you . then when you go shopping and you bring this product at home . but , when you taste it you are very disapointed because you do not feel like the person on the advertisment . you feel unhappy . it is true that sometimes i buy product that i have seen in advertisement . for example , last time i bought some yoghurt i saw in advertisement , and it wa said that it is not too sweet . i do not tell you my dissatisfaction when i put one spoon fo this in my mouth . but it wa too sweet ! thus , the advertisment lie . secondly , some advertisement draw you attention because the picture you see is very pretty and attractive . so you decide to find this good you see and o the market where you can bring it . sometimes what you see do not correspond to what you have seen in the advertisement . i would like to state you one of my experience . i am not one of those who like to watch television but when i put it on and decide to see some program i look even advertisement . anyway , i saw a vaccum in advertisement and decided to go and see it . of course i intended to buy it . but i do not because it doe not look like what i saw , however it wa exactly the same product . to conclude , i would just want to you aware of the fact that often advertisement are not true . their aim is to make you buy thier product and to show attractive thing . consequently , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
