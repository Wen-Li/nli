in my view , successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . being successful mean standing out of the crowd , which also mean doing something different than most of the people . many of u like to keep doing something the same way they always have , for example a doctor always give the same medication because it work and it ha been proven safe for the patient . in contrast a successful doctor might try a new combination of medication to treat a patient . there 's the risk that this new combination simply doe n't work , or worse , that it make complication and therefore put a life at risk . but it could also cure the patient , which the old medication would n't have . and the doctor would be successful . there are numerous example like that in medicine . another example is an example of early history . first people were hunting and collecting food such a plant , then someone must have had the idea to try and cultivate the plant a well and to have domestic animal . maby they had problem first , but it worked . population size increased because of the better food supply and people did n't have to move around like they had to , when looking for new hunting ground . people who tried that first successfully had an advantage over the hunting people , who were dependent on a good hunt . another example are invention like train . of course , technical improvement were a key factor . people already had mean of transportation like horse , but some people wanted to try something new in order to reach another place in a faster way . so they invented the train . at the start most people were afraid , they belived that the great velocity would make them ill . but after a while they got used to it and train and those who built them got successful . could you imagine our world without train ? i ca n't and i 'm happy that some people like to try new thing and take risk , otherwise our world would stand still . in conclusion these example show that taking risk is a major point of being successful , without taking risk and trying new thing everyone would be mediocre and no progression would be made whatsoever .
