i ca n't make a clear decision wether i agree the statement or not , because it depends on the product and especially on the brand . i think that product and brand being popular and well known wo n't cheat with their advertisment . one reason is that the quality of most of this product is so high that there is no need for the enterprise to lie . a second reason is that the enterprise harm their image if they promise something their product ca n't fulfill . but on the other side new or unknown brand which will conquer a market ca n't survive if they wo n't get human attention . that 's why many enterprise have to make big promise to attract the consumer view . examples can be seen daily in tv or in the written medium . in our day i think i tend a bit more to the fact that i wo n't agree with the statement . in the time of internet there is a high transparancy concerning the quality of good . statements of people who used the product could be looked up and so if one product ha bad critic the enterprise could be kicked out of business . furthermore there are several institution like the german `` stiftung warentest '' which test product to give a neutral statement , and people give much upon their opinion . last but not least the legal situation for business is more difficult . so there is only a small path between what is legal exageration and what is illegal cheating . so the risk to harm the business , for an enterprise , is big enough that most of them wo n't make their product better than they realy are because there is a lot of danger in being punished by the state or even the consumer .
