i agree with the statement . first , in the tour we can make new friend . in my case , this summer i went kamikouchi by tour , and then i could make lot of friend . fathremore , i wa able to get the information of other tour from the new friend , and next summer i will go with them . second , we can go trip without preparing , even the place we do n't know . forexanple , if we wish to go egypt and we do n't have any information of egypt , maybe we can not find the way to go egypt with own our self . but if we join the tour , tour guide will get information for u and introduce lot of place in there . in addition i can go trip alone . i do not have to find friend who are intrested to the same place . all i have to do is choose the place to trip and find the tour to complete my hope . so , i think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
