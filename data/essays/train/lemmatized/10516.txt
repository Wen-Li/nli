environment protection ha been a big political matter during the last decade . there were time when law were enforced to reduce pollution such a the waste from car . but the kyoto protocol , which a lot of county all over the world signed and agreed to , is not taken so much care of anymore . all the same , people are starting to realize about the necessity for pollution reduction . this ha to do with the sign of our nature that we encounter nowadays . glaciars are melting , the climate is getting warmer , the ozone in the atmosphere is shrinking , the forest are dying . everyone know that it is proved , that all of that ha to do with how we treat the environment . so the connection to the number of car is obvious . since car produce a lot of pollution , they need to be reduced in number . not just the awareness of the people will help though . cars are expensive , so the finacial aspect of having a car could be an important matter too in 20 year . from what i know , a lot of town in switzerland are thinking about charging the carkeepers to drive into the town in order to prevent traffic jam . furthermore , the parking space are gonna get more expensive since the space is limited . this is not going to change in the future at all since the population in a lot of country is increasing . another aspect is the improvement of the public transport system . in switzerland , there is a fantastic system . trains and bus are almost never late and there are very few area that ca n't be reached with public transport . i am aware that this is not the same in every country but if people fear that a lot of job will be gone if people do n't buy car anymore , they have to see , that on the other hand , improving the public transport is going to create a lot of work too . in conclusion , i think that there will be fewer car around in 20 year . i belive in it , that people will take their responsibility to protect our planet for the next generation to live on .
