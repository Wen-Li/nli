for my part , i do not think that young people enjoy their life more than adult . i have in mind further reason to explain that child or young people also have some problem . fisrtly , i think this kind of statement is obviously done by an adult . why ? because adult or old people have , must of the time , a certain nostalgy of their young year . i mean they tend to have better souvenir than what really happenned in their life . the truth is not in the memory . secondly , adult often forget that young people have problem , and sometimes it is not minor problem . they can meet some difficulty at school . if child are not good student they might meet some difficulty to have friend or good relationship with their professor or even with their parent . even worse , young people are used to face the violence . parents and adult often bear in mind what wa the school 20 year ago , that is to say safe and quiet . it is not the case todayany more . children face racist and rude word from other student . thirdly , and it may be the main point , we need to wonder why when you are young you always want to be an adult . i remenber when i wa ten or eleven , i wanted to be older to be allowed to watch tv in the evening or to be able to do everything i want to . we have to bear in mind the childhood and the pre-adult step are really very hard . young people must build their own identity , but in the same time they are under influence . according to official figure , suicide is one the main death cause after car accident . it show how it is difficult to be young . as a conclusion , it is obvious that yound people heve more leisure time and holiday than adult . but they also meet situation and problem to sort out . to be honest i think people are able to enjoy their like along their all life they just have to do the right choice , be happy or sad .
