it is often said that only doing what we already know how to do well is safe and stable way without risk . however , if i were asked to tell my opinion , i would recommend to try new thing and take some risk because it will provide u with new opportunity , betterment of performance , and increase of life ' quality . to begin with , trying new thing give u new opportunity such a a new achievement which wa never explored before . for example , if bill gates had not dropped out his school and worked a a normal salary man , what do you think would have happened ? i ca n't imagine the presence of windows , which bring u high benefit in our daily life , without his challenge and braveness toward his vision . his success on business is based on his try . secondly , a company can survive and flourish with new idea . samsung is well known for semiconductor business . when other competitor are satisfied with 4m flash memory chip , samsung made a big decision to develop 16m flash memory . even though there wa a big risk , the revenue and value of samsung drastically increased after they launched new flash memory . then , it ha been able to lead the semiconductor industry by trying new thing and developing new product . finally , trying new thing is able to give u new perspective and progress . in my case , i wa quite satisfied with my job several year ago . my salary wa not low , i had been appreciated quite well . however , i started feeling that my knowledge and experience were getting limited , and it seemed i wa not progressing any more . so i determined to shift my job . as i tried to find new and better job , i realized that i acquired new perspective to the business field and increased the value of myself . now i am eagerly excited about my future life even though there might be risk . all thing considered , trying new thing will enable u to meet new opportunity , maximize the performance , and live with better quality of life .
