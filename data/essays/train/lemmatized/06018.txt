i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . usually teacher tend to show the answer to student when student do not know the answer because they may think that it is better for student to understand or is easy to teach for teacher . however , student need an ability to understand idea and concept . also , when they become a member of a society , it must be needed to state their opinion . there are some factor what is important for student . fist of all , getting an ability to understand is more important than other skill . for example , when student study about math , it will not good to student if teacher give the answer to them immidetaly because a skill of understanding or thinking is getting decrease . i believe that when student think deeply about how they can solve the question , their brain work more activity and this action lead to the improvment of their brain . second of all , understanding idea and concept are more necessary than other learning in the business situation . for instance , when you become a member of a society , you must give your opinion or are required your idea because most of company need a person who are independent and have a good personality . so , if you usually know the fact , you may not get uderstanding idea because , you usually think about it after you knew the answer . therefore , i believe that people often are needed understaning idea and concept in business situation . in conclusion , i totally agree that it is more important for sutdents to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because of getting skill and necessity in the business situation .
