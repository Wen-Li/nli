i think that at high school a student should study a many subject a possible ; it is very important for a student to have a broad knowledge of many acedemic subject because , following this way , a student can have a global wiev of a lot of real topic , he can study different subject and then decide what he like , what is the best or the most interesting subject for him . at university , a person who have studied a lot of subject sholud be more motivate in what is learning because he is learning what he really love . i think that after high school it is better to specialized in one specific subject also because nowadays it is very difficult to find a job and the `` world of work '' is bacoming more competitive and it need specialized employee . for example i am going to apply for a finance degree on my graduate program and then i would like to work a an analyst in a famous bank . i am sure that my bachelor degree in business administration ( undergraduate program ) is not enough for my future job bacause at the moment i am not specialized in anything and i can not apply for an analyst position in a bank because surely there are a lot of people more specialized in finance than me ; my bachelor degree in business administration doe n't provide me a specifc knowledge about the financial world . this example is about an undergraduate university program and a graduate program , because this is my own experience , but we can use this way also , like i have mentionated at the begininng , for a student that , after high school , want to apply for university . if you study on a phd program you have the possibility to become more specialized , but you should follow this way only , for example , if you want to become a scientist . finally , i am sure that it is important for a student 's education to study a lot of subject and then , after theree , four , five year , decide a specialization in one specific subject .
