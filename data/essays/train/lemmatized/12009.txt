i agree with the statement that most advertising make product seem much better than they really are . it is obvious that the world of advertising is not the real world . one may ask , why this business is still running so well , although everybody seems to know that all these advertising are fiction . in my opinion it is not worth discussing this particular circumstance stated in the statement . much more interesting is the fact that the advertising industry is such a lively and successful industry . to question that , will lighten up the reason , why the untruth of advertising finally doe n't bother u . everybody know , that there is a lie lying in advertising in general . but i think , there is something like an agreenment going on in modern society , an agreement between people and the advertising company . advertising satifies longing of mass of people and it became a space or a tool to express , exchange , consume and play with way of lifestyle . and this is the keyword for explaining this whole situation . in my opinion people enjoy to get informed in this way . this can be seen from different view . on the one hand it 's a way of freedom , based on his or her own responsibility , on the other hand it a subtile way of leathership that te advertising company were able to grasp . so there is a world that consists out of longing and desire and there is no point to discus the fitting between the advertinsing and th eproduct itself . this industry care about lifestyle and that it .
