i do certainly believe that there ha been a marked shift from the past in the attitude of young people with respect to their community . though it will be unfair to generalize this to all young people , but most of the young people today show little concern for their community they live and dwell in . the younger generation today is much more concerned about their own future and well being and in this pursuit , they sometimes tend to neglect their community completely or are just not able to afford much more time for it . they do not shy away from exploiting the resource of their community to climb up the ladder of their own success . in my day to day experience , i have seen teen and student just littering away the waste in the premise they live in . they sometimes tend to scratch and damage the property which is there for evryone to use . i am not sure what pleasure do these people derive by doing such activity but the fact of the matter is that they usually do it . if they can not help the community atleast they should not damage it further . to quote a personal experience , there wa a friend of mine who wa being offered the post of district magistrate of the town he ha lived in from his birth . he did all his schooling from that town . he wa a bright student and that is why he wa able to get the post of district magistrate . he always used to carp about lack of infrastructure of the town like frequent power resource , insufficient water supply etc . thus , he wa never satisfied with the authority . but he himself got the post and got the opportunity to do something for the community , he just declined the job for a more lucrative job offer abroad . thus , when the actual time came to perform duty towards his community , he didnt take up the responsibilty . this go onto explain that young people usually d not give enough attention and help to their own community . but , a i said before , this pattern can not be generalized to whole lot of younger generation . i believe that the success story of people who do give help to their community will inspire those who shy away .
