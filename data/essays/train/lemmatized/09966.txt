i believe young people nowadays still give time helping their community . young people these day still have the same attitude towards community service . most of the youth spend their vacation or weekend on vary kind of service . community service is the main part of it . they volunteer to do so since they know they have got no paid . this show the agressive attitude young people are taking towards doing such service . there are some reason can explain why young people nowadays stiil constantly helping their community . first of all , they believe that everyone still have the passion to make the world better by using their own power . this thought had been in everyone 's mind since all of u wa borned . everyone want to help in any kind of way . therefore , teenager join community service not only at school , but also among their neighbor . needless to say , the youth nowadays still care about our society . they devoted themselves into many service including helping the community . in both government 's and company ' perspective , they tend to give teeanger chance to achieve their goal . there are many opportunity outside that offer young people to help , such a local non-profit organizations and non-government organizations aften have a lot of activity that prevent job or chance to help communiuties . the school also help giving oppertunities like garbage cleaning around the school neighborhood . it is obvious that people all want to help especially young people . over all , although everyone try to help , it really depends on every indivisuals whether they take action or not . i believe that every teeanagers nowadays have motive to help desparatly and also take their action immediately . they indeed put a lot of effort in many kind of community service nowadays .
