i strongly disagree with this statement , and i believe that it is not going to happen in the future . every year , the technology is improving and provide higher convinence to peole . therefore , there will be more car in twenty year . nowaday , most people use car for transportation , and own at least on car for each family . as well a that people are inventing more efficent and convinence car for people , and that make more people tp own car . because of this technology improvement , i believe that more people will use car in the future . from my own experimence , car are the most convinent and confortable transportation . there are number of people use other transportation such a bus , train , underground and taxi . however , those are the public transportation and there is no private area that give me the feeling of i am not safe . in any countires there are theifs and pocket pick , especially on the train , and which worry people and give the feeling of not safe . as well a that it is not comfortable to sit next to some stranger , and some time other people s conversation can be distructing if it too loud . in addition to that being in the small area with stranger is not comfortable , and we would never know what is going to happen . over all , i believe that car are more convinent and more people will use car in the future . it is ture that driving car might be not safe , if we have a accident , however , at least we know the people inside the car and dont have to worry about other people s eye . in my opinion , there are many variety of car and the popurarity of car are increasing every year . some people buy car only for their pleasure , and they are becoming more professional . from those example , i believe that the number of car s use are going to increase and more car will be created in the
