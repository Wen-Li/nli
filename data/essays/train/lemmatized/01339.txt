i prefer to travel in agroup led by a tour guide . as you know , evrybody can enjyoy a trip evrywhere in this global society , so there are many choice for their own . especially , its deponds on people what kind of the style they like it . i want to show why i choice the opinion . firsty , it is very convinient if we had a guide . we do n't need to plan ourselves where we go . it sometimes make u stressful and kill a time . the guide know where we want to go and can explain about it perfectly . we can enjoy the trip without worrying . the last time i travel in korea by myself made me so nervous . i could n't speak and read their language , so communication is so important . if i had had a guide , the travel would have changed well . second , if we are a group led by a tour guide , we can exchange information of the travel . the travel will meke up a lot of wonderful excitement . it will be happy if we could share the impression with a group . inaddition this , the guide can show best possition to look at the building if we want to go to the a favorite site . following the reason , i agree with the opinion that the best way to travel o on a group led by a tour guide . travel sould enjoy with many people . from my experience , i want to go many travel and talk to friend sharing the memory . that strory lead me another trip .
