i believe that an engineer or a medical doctor , or any academic person should have a basic background of many academic subject related to his or herscientific interest . however , the level of that knowledge is very important in case of evaluating this issue . it is definetly impossible to sepecialize in every particular subject at a professional level . i strongly believe that people who defends having a knowledge of many academic subject will fail one day if they insist on practising all those subject in a professional manner . no doubt , you will neither enough time to practise them at all nor the effort to perform to practise all those professionally . however , once you have a fundemental background in many topic , you can develop or improve your skill and experiment in any other specific subject . thus , you can have a basic knowledge in number of academic subject and you can keep the potential of this subject to be turned into practising them in professional way . the best and most appropriate way is the selection of one or two specific subject to specialize and to build skill on them . on the other hand , having a basic background and knowledge in some other subject will increse your reputation in academic world since you have some word to speak regarding on lot of particular problem might be occured in any area . to conclude , an academic person should have the basic idea and the concept of all subject related to his or her area . but he or she should select one specific subject in which he or she will be widespreadly known .
