some people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . however , where i live , older people are very healthy and acitive than they used to . in my opinion , older people enjoy more life than younger people do . the first reason of this is that because older people have more time and money than their couterparts , they can do a lot of activity they want to . for example , my parent are both retired . they have a lot of free time than i have . in addition , they worked for more than 35 year , so they have a large amount of money they can spend . that 's why they travel almost once a month across my country and they have already visited all the prefectuers in my country . on the contrary , i have to work every day and i have le available time and money since i got a job last year . i wa not able to go somewhere even in summer vacation . another reason is that young people have more concern about their future , compared to the optimistic opinion showed by older people , which lead to the young people 's negative idea about their life in general . one illustration that make this clear is that most of the young people concern about their pension they will receive in the future . now that the aging society in my country is getting serious , young people may not receive enough money to live on after their retirement . therefore , most of them have to save money for their future life and they can not afford to enjoy their present life . my consideration with respect to the available time and money a well a the negative idea about future life , i think that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
