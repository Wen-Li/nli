do young people enjoy life more than older people ? or doe age even affect the satisfaction of each individual ? these are two question that will be discussed in the following essay . several argument will be presented and evaluated . first of all , the assumption can be made that younger people , especially in germany are offered more opportunity than ealier generation could ever experience . the educational path provide a large variety to develop oneself and to choose a career that suit one 's interest . next to the formation of the academic curriculum , possibility to create free-time activity are almost endless . should this freedom which is offered to the young people however , have an influence on how satisfied they are with their life ? older people in contradicition are more limited concerning the above mentioned aspect . many did not have the possibility to select their work a well a preferred lifestyle according to their major intersts , due to the second worldwar . this issue might lead to the fact that they regret that they were not offered such a large amount of opportunity . furthermore , health issue might lower the quality of life with increasing age . i believe that the question should not be if older or younger people enjoy their life more , but rather if age is one of the significant factor that ha an influence on overall satisfaction . in my opinion , not age but rather the optimistic or pessimistic point of view each individual ha , decides about his or her quality of life . this characteristic is absolutely independent of age .
