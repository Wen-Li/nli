people ha differnts idea about successful whether it is to creat a new thing or to do usual work . doing what we already know how to do well doe n't make you different and doe not make happy comparing with creating new thing . in my opinion i stongly agree that successful is to create new thing and take risk for several reason . first of all , it is a great thing to be promenet and different than others . for example , if some body creates a treatment for canser and another one doe his regular work who is succeede ? . ofcourse the first one because he creates new thing which help sick peapole . so this person must be famous and every body wont to work with them . in addition , you can tase the real successful if you took risk and adventure . person ha to love his work to creat new thing and to be succeede indeed . by taking risk you learn new useful thing that help you in your life . my brother wa in running race and he not only won but also created a new recorde number . he wa very happy to take riskes and score new number . last but not least , trying new thing help you to get more expeirnce and self-cofidence . by doing this new thing you well be proded and every body love you . in conclosion , i wiil be a dentist and i will create new thing for my world because that 's the real successful . i hate to do my regular work without trying to do new thing .
