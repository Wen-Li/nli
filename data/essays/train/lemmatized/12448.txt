many people have asserted that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . although it would be easy to reject this statement , it 's such a complex one . personally , i agree with this statement . in the following paragraph , i 'd like to present some example to support my point of view . first of all , a successful person should have the following good quality : creativity and to do something to the best . for example , edison invented the electric light bulb . he tried so many time , and eventually , he succeed . without his tring and breave , we might used candle to light up until now . after he invented the electric bulb , he found that the form of the the electricity might be a problem . so , he tried direct electric and alternative ealetric , tried to find out which one wa suited for today 's usage . trying something new is always important for advancing our life . so , the people try something new and take the risk could be called successful person . for instance , the invented of the computer amd use it to get on the internet . nowaday , computer almost involved in every event , such book ticket , buy clothes , and obtain information . without those man tried to invent computer , we ca n't do those thing i have describe above . they might be failed , but in my mind , those who could try new thing and take risk are the succesful person . althought there is also a arguement in the opposite position to be made on this issue . nevertheless , for the reason i have presented above , i believe my point of view are the most valid .
