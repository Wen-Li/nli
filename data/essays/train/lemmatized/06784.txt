is that possible determine a period of life for enjoying life ? do young people enjoy life more than the older one ? i bilieve enjoying life is a metter of state of mind . why ? i met a lot of young people who were only concerned about the future without living the present , in other word young people not applying the `` carpe diem '' philosophy , and i know what i 'm stating because i 'm one of them . we carry about the future problem that may can not even occur , we do n't have time for nothing that 's not correlated to study achieving good mark and working . and a i stated , from my experince these behaviour are incriseangly common . now , what can be said about mature and more savy people ? they are often not so young and the have learned a lot from the difficulty of life . from that , these `` lighting mind '' can really understand what is really important in life and what worth to be worryed about . as a result , by using this knowledge and life experience this people can allocate energy and time to readily come up with good solution for the problem the encounter . for example , an experienced manager seeing his stock going down doe n't get too much worryed because he know that 's part of the game and he will be likely to wait for better to time to sell his stock . probably he will play golf and enjoy his time while the youngers are desperate thinking about how they 'll manage to get rid of imminent loss . in sum , in my opinion enjoying life it is for sure not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind , and it depends on maturity and having a good vision of life . please be optimistic ! please enjoy !
