famous french army general and president charles de gaule once said : '' the best way of studying how to command is to study a broad of knowledge of many academic subject '' . why did he say that ? and is this only good to learn how to command , or is this true for everything ? that is the question to answer . i would say it depends on what one 's expect it 's knowlege is needed for . on one hand , if it is for everyday living , i suppose this is very right : for exemple , during the day , we all meet many people who with we talk about very different subject ( economics , social issue , work , family or simply last night tv program ) . in this case , the more on different subject we know , the more people will appreciate to talk with u . if someone want to know your own point of view on an specific event , and if you answer him '' i do n't know and i ' not interested in that '' , we can guess he will not ask you anymore . .. ther is anothere exemple : most politics program are based on economic or social problem to solve . if you do n't have any idear about it , how will you understand the debate , the different opinion ? and how then , will you make your choice for the next vote ? moreover , i beleive , we all still have a child slleeping in our brean : so like child , we like discovering new thing , being curious , this is another good reason to study many acade ; ic subject . on the other hand , i beleive it is difficult for a teacher or a scientist not to specialize in one subject . same thing for peolple who have very specialized job such a engineer or finance administrator . .. how would these people be expert if they had not specialize in their owm specific subject . how would a teacher answer to all the question student ask him every lesson ? as it seens impossible to specialize in all the subject , i suppose these teacher , scientist or expert have no choice . however , i beleive , they still also studied other subject , even if it is not with the same accuracy . also , i think they are interested in many other subject and they can talk about other thing than their owm specific subject . i think there is no better way of studying , it depends on what you will have to do later in your job . but me , i definitely followed charles de gaulle advice . ..
