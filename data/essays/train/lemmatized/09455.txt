i absolutely agree with the fact that many advertisement make product seem special , even though , maybe , they are not . i understand that the purpose of an advertisement is to actually show the product with it best quality , but i think that many time this is n't really what is done . first of all , it is frequent that the advertisement present the product a the best one on the market , comparing it with other similar type in commerce . for example , there are dish washing soap that are presented a miracolous , but i do n't think that they would actually be able to dissolve all the grease and dirt on a frying pan , after the preparation of a bacon and egg breakfast . in addition , behind the preparation of an advertisement there are many people , such a designer for graphic , music expert for the sound and so on . all these person work to make the advertisement a appealing a possible . they know the target of people who to direct , and who will probably be the future buyer , and consequently study a way to show the product that will be specially interesting for those . the third reason why i think that advertisement are not always straightforward is that many company decide to pay a famous person , such a an actor or a singer , to make their product more popular . in this way all the fan of this person would be encouraged to buy what he or she is presenting . i think that no woman on earth could resist from buying a jewel presented next to brad pitt 's face . in conclusion , i think that people should be aware of these strategy and decide wether to buy the product or not just thinking by themselves , ignoring the sometime `` false '' advertisement .
