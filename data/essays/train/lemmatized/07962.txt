i am japanese and i grew up in japan . so i have japanese culture . when i went to over sea , i wa able to learn about different culture . and i had enjoyed studying about that . and i thought if i come here and stay to study english , i can enjoy my american life . but actueary , i think that american culture is rude . because , for example , american macine always ha broken very soon . last month i bought a new motercycle and old car from my friend to go to school . but now my motercycle and car ha broken soon . and take repair . but ha broken again . in japan . japanese is very polite . so the macine which made in japan is very good and not have broken soon if we buy new one . i think japanese culture is too polite by american people . but i can not understand yet that have broken soon . i think which made in japan is very good . on the other hand . i have to understand about american culture if i continure staying here . when i can understand about american culture , i may enjoy the american life . i hope that come soon this thing . and i am going to learn another country culture and enjoying . some people have other culture each other . and i would like to think that american culture also ha good point for me .
