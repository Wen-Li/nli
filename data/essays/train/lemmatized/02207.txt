in japan , where i live , some people agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . but i disagree with that opinion because of the following reason ; it is not enough time to learn many academic subject indeed ; people can not understand many academic subject simultaneously ; people can live by using only one specifc subject . it might be true that it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . however , those who say that we should follow that opinion fail to address several important issue . first , we do not have adequate time to learn many academic subject in school . for example , my brother , takahumi wa very interested ethic in his high school day because he thought that ethic wa one of the most important subject that people should learn . but a he had to learn about twelve subject simlutaneously , ethic wa held once in a week . under this situation , he graduated from his high school without understanding ethic fully . i believe that high school should give student many time a week to the specific subject which student want to learn . furthermore , people can not understand many academic subject simlutaneously . for example , my sister , takako liked to learn world history in her junior high school day . but after entering a high school , she said to me that she wa bad at world history . i asked her a reason why . she told me that she have to learn many subject in her high school and do many homework of them simultaneously and she do not have enough time to read text book of world history during her freetime in advance . finally and most importantly , however , people can live by using only one subject . for example , i entered tokyo univeisity which is the most difficult university in japan in 1992 by taking examination about six subject , that is , math , english , japanese language , japanese history , world history , physic , science . then , i learned many subject in my university . but after graduating my university , i 've not used the knowledge of most subject which i learned in my school day . as i am working at the investment division in a financial institution , it is adequate for me to work there by knowing the specific knowledge about math . i feel strongly that i should learn much more specific knowledge about math . so , people should consentrate not many subject but one specific subject . therefore , on the basis of the fact discussed above , i find that we should agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
