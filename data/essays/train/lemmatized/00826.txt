in our modern society with globle economy improving rapidly , it is very important to educate high quality student catering to the desire of the society . from my point of view , i totally disagree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact which will be discussed in the following paragraph . to begin with , pure learning idea and concept make student confused about the subject . for instance , if a student just know the definition of something , he would think it is unchangable . but when he meet the change of this concept , he will be confused about this . it is beacase he doe not know about the reality . if he already ha learned fact about this , he would face this in a proper way and not get into puzzle . in addition , student always get more interest in learning fact than just knowing the definition . in contrast with just knowing about the idea and concept , learning fact is more useful and attractive for student than learning some idea and concept just for understanding . that is to say , learning fact about the definition is more interesting than knowing the concept . finally , learning fact could make student think in a realistic way and it is good for their future . it is absolutely much more useful for student to adapt the society and live in the world directly and more successfully . because they already known the fact . besides , student also can use the idea properly or invent their own new idea . in summary , it is obvious that idea and concept are much more important for student to learn than just understand for the reason of the clearity of the reality , student 's interest on the subject and the benefit for their future . therefore , it is strongly recommanded that student should learn fact from the idea and concept . it is very good for their mental healthy .
