the way of doing academic research is always developing and dividing into new branch throughout many year . as scientific and technologic innovation develops very fast , thing to be researched are getting more complex and hard . due to this , academic subject are increasing and their context are complicated . in my opinion , specializing in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subject for several reason . first of all , by specializing in one academic topic you have the opportunity to discover new thing in science . when you are interested in a specified topic deeply , it is possible to consider the detail carefully . for instance , human genome project is divided into several group and every scientific group research a detailed part of the project . by doing this , they can rapidly get result and combine them . secondly , working with specific subject give you the chance of developing new scientific group and working in coordination . research group have the opportunity to study properly and organized . if one scientist have broad knowledge of many academic subject , he can not afford to concern with all problem and fails . consequently , specializing in one subject for academic research is important to the development of science and technological innovation . as we share the problem , we will be succesful quickly .
