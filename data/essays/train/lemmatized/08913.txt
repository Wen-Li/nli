understanding idea and concept and learning fact are both very important for student . ideas and concept derive often form fact and fact are always influenced and produced by idea , so i think these two element are closed correlated . for example , student can learn a lot by studing history , which is a complex mix of fact , idea and concept . they should learn what happened in the past , the fact , the war , the movings of people , but they should also know why these fact happened and possibly try to connect cause and effect . if you just learn abstract concept and idea it is not easy to put them in the concrete life . ideas and concept have their origin in fact that have happened . so it would be insufficient to learn them and not to learn the fact that originated them . for the same reason i think it is very important to learn the fatct together with concept and idea that help to understan why fact happened . i think that if you sudy just a list of fact without to try to find the reason and the consequence of these fact you can understand properly the importance of fact you study . i think that also in scientific field fact and idea should be learnt together . if student learn just theory they miss the real importance of idea and finding . they should understand what the idea and concept they study mean in the practice , how they can be used and have already been used . so i think it is very important to consider both point and that student should learn idea , concept and fact together
