when i wa lazy student , i always tried to make out why did my teacher be insist to teach this idea and concept . now i grow up and get the main idea step by step . concepts and idea must be learned clearly to predict the fact . first of all i totaly agree with this situtation . not being understand idea and concept and then predict or learn fact mean want to run not being learned how to walk . for example there are two student in same class . they are good friend in there . student a try to understand basic thing and after all the notion . he want to be the top in class . but student b just try to understand cause and effect . his intend is get enough mark in class . do you ever think why do teacher try to teach notion . i did , the answer is research or develop something much faster or bigger . i mean their intends are not just student get the highest mark . when student learn idea , concept etc. he/she can do develop that subject . he/she really be the competent of this subject . in addition , student who want to be an engineer , he/she ha to learn all about the subject if s/he really create a unique thing or innovation . to sum up , you have to make our way between these student a and b. which one do you want to be ? just get enough mark on exam , make your gdp 2.01 and go to and ordinary college or be the top student in class , make your gdp 3.0 and go to harvard university . i would prefer the second one cause i want to be top .
