i agree with the statement , `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . firstly , fact change during time . secondly , application is important for everyone than memorizing thing . lastly , understanding idea can help people on different situation . firstly , fact change all the time . for example , in the incient time , people thought that when the poplulation is higher , the food production will be higher ; and the growth of food is slower than the growth of population , that lead them to control birth . however , they had not predicted the development of technology . consequently , fact are changing . therefore , we could not learn all of the fact . the important thing is we should understand the idea and the concept , then we could apply in different matter . besides , a i mentioned , we should apply pur knowledge rather than memorize the fact . for instance , we memorize the gdp of every country , but we have no idea about the gdp ; what affect the gdp and what doe it show u . as a result , we can not learn fact that we do n't understand and we can n't apply . if we can not understand the idea of the fact , the fact would be useless . therfore , we have to be able to understand the idea and concept than learn the fact . finally , since we learn how to apply our knowledge from understaning idea and concept . we can have ability to solve problem because we have difficulty all the time . for example , we can understand the concept of developing film and printing picture , so that we can adjust the colour , light , or the size we want . by showing this example , it can help u to understand that it is important for u to understand and apply through different circumstance . in conclusion , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because the change of fact , application of knowledge and the advantage of understanding idea .
