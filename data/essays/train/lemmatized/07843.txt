understanding is an important aspect of the student education nowadays . it is very important to understand idea and concept that should help the student to be aware on it subject . in some area in the world and at a certain level of the education , student learn fact and do not try to understand the topic . this ha a great consequence on the ability of student to express themsleves on any topic . understanding concept and idea help student to implement the idea and concept they understood by trying to make realistic a possible . in the same way , student ability to to think is reinforced and their critical point of view would arise . for instance , when we explain a concept to a student and then we ask him to use that concept in his real life experience , he would be able to do it perfectly and at the moment we are sure that he understood instead of just learning the fact given by a teacher in class . furthermore , a student who understands idea and concept should be able to give his own point of view in different manner . based on my own experience i encooutered some student that learn fact and are not able when you ask them thinking question related on that topic to answer correctly . one day i helped a student to learn his biology lesson on root system , they learned that are two type of root system . i asked him to give me the difference between those type and i wa amazed because he wa not able to do that , but when i asked him to give me the two different type he started to give me all the writing of his notebook ; this mean that the student did not try to understand but only learning . in conclusion , based on my explanation and support above mentioned , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
