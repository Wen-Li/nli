there are a lot of larning style . depend on the purpose , the leaning style would be different . each person ha different poit of view ; however , in my opinion , i agree that to understand idea and concept is more important that to learn fact for student . i believe that the important poimt of learning is how we can use that knowledge in our life . if we ca n't use the knowledge practicaly from study , it is no meaning . i think that to understanding idea and concept will help to use the knowledge more efficient way . first reason for my opinion is that we can learn a lot of thing more deeply from understanding idea and concept . for example , when i learn history , if i think about the reason and concept , such a why our ancestor had a war or why they made a the low , i can learn a lot of thing from the past . i believe that such a knowledge would be help to choose for the future . the second reason for my opinion is that it is more easy to memorize . for example when i studied to enter university , i just memorized a lot of knowledge such a historical date or vocabraries , however i forget these knowledge easily . i believe that if i did n't think about connection about fact , it is easy to forget and such a knowledge will be patent knowledge . if we think that we better use our knowledge more practical way , i think to understand idea and concept is necessary . from understand these thing , our knowledge will be use usuful thing .
