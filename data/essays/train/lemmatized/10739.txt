there are two kind of people in the world : people who try to find their right place to live and enjoy doing something similar everyday , and people who after having a time doing the same thing over and over , one day they decide to leave all those important thing and start again new project . in my opinion , this second group of people are the most successful . people who give up job or activity in which they have reached the top or perhaps feel that they do not receive something valuable a exchange and suddenly decided to jump out to other activity are admirable because they have the courage to start over with the only goal of achieve another success in the future that let them to fill their emotional and economical need . of course , the decision that they make is not ease , it envolves a great amount of valour , discipline and optimism ; however the advantage of doing something new again are important , such a they have more knowledge and experience to start , their passion of doing someting that they enjoy make them feel pleasant to work long hour preparing everything to reach a new goal . sometimes they have to take risk , but they know how to measure that risk to succedd . learning new thing every day make them happy and it become and incentive to go further , at the end they become more achieves and proud of their goal . this is he way for which many successful individual reach the top of the hill in their life . as a result , their accomplish many economical and emotional satisfaction . i stongly agree with the people who suddenly decided to change their activity to improve their emotional and physical health rather than to live regretting of their conventional skill , colleages , bos or their life . i think that i am one of these people and i will never regret of what i left because what i am accomplishing is more greatful and pleasant in my life .
