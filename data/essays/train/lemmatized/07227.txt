the statement said that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i disagree with the statement because if you travel by a tour guide , we can not learn a much a individual travel . first , if we travel by a tour guide , we can not go everywhere we want to . because the tour guide ha a plan and also we can not spend a much a we want in one place . we have to fallow the tour guider everytime . sometimes we can not go to the place that we want . if we go travel by ourself , we can go to the place everywhere we want . also we do not have to worry about time . but there is good thing about the tour guide . that is the tour guide explain that sometimes people do not know . second , if we travel by a tour guide , we depend to other people . because we can not make a decision by ourself . we always have to ask other people 's opinion . for example , if we want to go to the restroom , we have to ask the tour guide . and it will cause that everybody ha to wait for them . because we can not walk by individual . this wa real happen to me . when my family went to travel by a tour guide , i wanted to go to the restroom and i asked my parent to go to the bathroom , but they are not let me to go to the restroom . then , i had to hold . so i thought travel by a tour guide is not very smart . especailly , people have a litte child . third , if we go other country to travel by a tour guide , we can not learn language . for me , i am interesting to learn other language and while i try to speak other language and the tour guider helped me , it bather me . i try best a i can . there are good thing about a tour guige , too . the tour guide prepare everything we need such a hotel , meal , or plan during travel . also , the tour guider translate when they go to the foreing country . this is good for people who do not want to speak other language . in conclusion , the best way to travel is not in a group by a tour guide . it is fun to travel by ourself . it will be like adventure . traveling by ourself ha a lot of advantage . i think we should not depended other people , because we will not grow . if we travel ourself , we will grow by step by step . but we will not see it . we should try travel by ourself . especally , who travel a lot by tour guide .
