it is often assumed that working thing the right way , the way we are taught , is a major key to success . i believe that this statement is right . however i believe real success happens to those who bring in new idea and take risk . it is true that when people are taught to work on something and do it the right way they will be efficient and successful . for example , someone who ha been taught how to make cooky and how to run a shop could open a cookie shop and be successful at selling cooky . i can see no reason at all why this person would not earn his life by selling cooky . however , take someone pretty creative and who enjoys taking risk . this person would open a cookie shop and sell cinnamon flavoured cooky a well a cherry flavoured cooky , and this way differentiate itself from other cookie shop . there are two ending to this story , this new business is a complete failure or a real success . this person ha taken risk and invested in it new idea without knowing if these would meet the costumer ' taste or not . and if this creative person succeeds , i am convinced that it business will outline the common cookie shop business . another success that is engendered by taking risk is the self satisfaction that is brings . being successful for it own idea is far more gratifying than doing thing right . great success that qre famous worldwide are always born from an innovative concept , and this in all area . famous film director would not be so famous if they did not introduce a new vision of film directing . in finance , broker that earn the most are those who take the most significant and relevant risk . bill gate would not be worldly known ( and immensely wealthy ) if he had not invested in a revolutionary idea .
