`` the world is a stage , and we are all player . '' as shaekespear told , we are the player on this huge stage , who try to enjoy in their short life span . in this case young people are more lucky than older people because they have more life enrgy , and they did not see the bad side of life yet . my first reason is that the vivid energy of young people is higher than older people , for they have le responsibility . the older people have to sustain their life themselves , and sometimes they have to look after the young . for example , older people have to work and gain money in order to get their basic life need such a eating or housing . however , the young people do not have to gain money . they can get from their parent what they need . so , young people can use their all energy to enjoy the life , and they are more happy than older . furthermore , the young people do not have more experience than the older people , including the bad one . the older people made mistake in their past , and are afraid to do those mistake again in their future . while they are preventing themselves from bad event , they miss the enjoyable thing on world . on the other hand , the young people , who have le experience can move further step in the enjoyful life , for they are not afraid doing the wrong thing . they even do not know what is wrong . while old people are being stuck in their bad experience , younger people live in the sunny side of the world . to sum up , being a young person i can say that the young people enjoy life more than older people do , because we are loaded with more energy to use for being happy , and we did not see yet the reality which make people unhappy .
