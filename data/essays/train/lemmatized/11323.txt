a biggest characterstic of a sucessful person is tenasity , which mean not to give up . this characterstic play a major roll in the time of troublesome situation to try out the new thing and taking the risc for betterment . trying new thing and taking risk make person more strong and strength to face any situation . and also help to improve the knowldge in different field . whereas doing the thing what they already know can lead them to improve knowldge in same field . i agree with the point that successful person try new thing and take risk rather only doing the thing they know . in my life i have seen many example of it . one of it wa - my friend who had a electonic shop in patnership with one of his friend , they earned nicely . but once they had a big loss and saparated . my friend didnt give up and tried to do bussiness in some other field and started new bussiness of transport and became successful in his carrier . same time his friend used same shop and still is in same condition . the moral is not to give up and take risk and try new thing which improves knowlde and give an idea to start newly with intreast . i believe doing the thing already which we know make u unaware of other field and decereases the motivation level of work . trying and doing same attempt to improve in carrier can reducess the intrest to work . i want to conclude stating that it depends on the person toperson and their choice what they want to do and what is best for them .
