while some people may believe that most advertisement can make product seem much more attractive than the really are , i feel that some case can be made for the other opinion against that augument . in short , i disagree with the statement . it is true that some advertisement can do it . for example , the enegy drink in japn is typical product . the ingredient of those dirnks are usually only sweet water with some caffein . but people are made to believe that they can get energetic by drinking them via advertisement . by contrast , there are also opposite case to the effect of advertisement . as a matter of fact , i can reffer to the case of pocali sweat which is the most famous sport drink in japan . for japanese people , pocali sweat sound fresh , healthy , and sporty . the advertisement of the drink emphisized these image on tv and so on . however , when the maker of this drink expanded the market to outside japan , the company wa obliged to recognized the problem . because the word `` sweat '' doe not sound good for english speakers , the maker ha failed to advertise the product successufully , what is worse , the advertisement ha harmed it image . as another example , i have personal experience regarding advertisement . in my school day , i opened the food stand and sold ethnic meal in the festeval . then , i have just emphisezed the ethnic trait of the meal , but have failed to convey the image of deliciousness . to sum up , because the fact mentioned above , i do not think most advertisement are always effective to make product seem much better than they really are .
