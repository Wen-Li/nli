i believe that the most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , and this can be inferred from different reason . the first of these is that we are living in a very competitive world and this get the people to make bigger some detail more than what they are , to involve the client to buy the product . a tipically example can be found in a lot of good for child , where really little feature are presented `` in scale '' , for example the ability for the toy to rise it size or the ability to make strange movement . another reason could be a legal process . the productor are covering himself by legitimating something of the good . in first this could be a bed advertisement , but could also explain the particular nature of the object , really fragile , a quality that could be research from the client . there is also an `` internal '' reason if we want to say so . the manager want to present is creation to the stakeholder and need to have their approvation to start the production . in this case the interest of the productors is directed to the owner of the company , not to the client , but is important too , of course . the last reason is similar to the first , in this case we can find person who are presenting only the positive point of the product without talking about the negative . the mission of this manner is the same but here the people are n't creating anything , they are omissing a part of the complete reality , differently in the first case where the people could also present the negative point because there are a huge amount of positive point which cover them . a tipically example of this manner can be found in the most of the new invention where it 's needed a positive consideration to be lunch , like the titanic in which wa n't presented the lack of ship to escape , looking only to the big fashion-style of it .
