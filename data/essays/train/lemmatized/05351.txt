during my study i learned a lot about advertisement . our professor always said that advertising should convince people to buy a product - but not just one time ! this mean that if the advertisement promise something the product doe not have the customer will not buy the product again . moreover he will tell his friend about the negative experience with this product so that his friend also will not buy it . years ago i would have totally agreed with the statement , but with this backround information i have to say that i have a different point of view . i think that most ad try persuade the customer to buy their product by showing them how the product can satisfy their need . it is for sure that they do not show the negative point of the product - but i am of the opinion that nobody really would expect that . i believe that today customer know how to handle with advertisement . they know that they have to compare the product-specifications to make a proper decission . furthermore i think that not a single customer belief everything which is mentioned in an advertisement , because they know that everybody want to sell their product . to sum it up in a nutshell > advertisement is to persuade customer and so they will just show the positiv point of their product - but i am convinced that those are nearly like the product is in reality . in addition to this all customer knew that they should not belive all the thing they see on television , read in newspaper or hear on radio , because no product is perfect - even if they promise it . and , a i mentioned at the beginning > when an advertisment really promise something , that the product can not fulfil , customer will buy it just one time . and no one can afford to loose all customer after such a short time .
