the topic debate at university about the specialization reveals the complexity of that question . historicaly , science appear during the 19 th century , and explain evering fact analysing it particulary . so , we can see the apparition of a lot of speciality which are interesting in only one part of the analysis : psychology , biology , economy , sociology . .. before , this subject were a part of the global analysis of the life based on religion and philosophy . the scientific rationality is interesting in the fact , but it can not forget the final meaning of his research . so , the university are fronting face to this question : must they specialized their student in one scientific subject , or must they conserve the axiology of a global understanding ? the specialisation is a problem because it doe not allow the student to understand why he is doing what he is doing . his vision of his subject will be poor if he is not concerned by the other speciality method , and aspect . for example , if you do economy without notion of sociologic consequence of the economic decision , you can not be efficient in your work . it is the same case with every speciality because analysis is only a way toward a global understanding . if you specialize yourself in only one specific subject , you will be narrow minded , and bader than peole who know some other subject . however , we need specialisation because it is a way to learn a job . the problem of learning many acadmic subject is that you dont have a speciality which is a prove of your level . to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is necesary before to know a specialization . weber show the differents between the american and german university , and the solution is between this two case . until 18 year old , you should not be specialized in one specific subject . university should begin a specialization around the third year . it is a determinant choice in the quality of furtures worker .
