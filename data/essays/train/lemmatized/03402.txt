i agreed that young people do not give enough time to help in any community which they find themself or belong . young people of nowadays are so much occupied with alot of activity . young people spend alot of thier time in doing irrelevant thing such spending alot of time on the internet , playing computer game and other activity . young people of nowadays believed that this is world in which everybody ha to mind his or her own business so there is no importance in focusing in th issue of another person . they belived that helping community is an old people work because they have alot of goal to achieve in there life time so maybe when they get old someday they could help their community . young people also belived that they needed money to help thier community becauce they they do not have enough fund to contribute to the project lay down by the commuinity so they tend to step back . i can also state some student do not have time to help the community because they do not have necessary time to do that . imagine an undergraduate student who is enroll a full time student , after the class , he ha to study perhaps need to do extra job to assist himself financially . yong people of nowaday believe that community ha nothing to offer them while should they spend thier time helping the community instead they prefer to go to night club and have fun with their friend . most of the younth are ignorance of the word , contribution to the community , they do not have the necessary information on what is meant by helping thier community . in conclusion i will note that young people of nowadays are not giving enough time to help thir community base on the point made above .
