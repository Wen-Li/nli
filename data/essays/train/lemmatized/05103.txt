i do agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give eneough time to help the community . but i also support the young by saying that in today 's schedule they have a lot of other activity which keep them very engaged , be it academic , work , sport or even the responsbility of supporting their tution fee . in today 's time there is actually a lot of pressure to perform well and stay ahead be it at sport of study or even extra curriculars . one ha to stay ahead hence it is abvious that the time for helping the coommunity could be curtailed by them . spending time in the community could actually be distracting for them and might start affecting their project of education or sport adversely . at this point of time it is more important for them to maintain a good record in college and their work place to extract long term benefit and lead a comforable life . moreover the community ha a lot of people to be taken care of by . there are so many men & woman who have kind of dedicated all their life or at least whatever time their schedule permit to engage themselves in community work and see whats to be done to maintain it standard . so when we already have poeple volunteering , why should the young also be forcibily brought in to it . i dont say that one should never be engaged in community work at any point of time , .l after finishing one eductaion , having reached a certain position at one 's workplace , it always worthy of being actively associated with the community and community work . moreover after a certain age one gain enough experience to sort the matter better and in a more appropriate and constructive manner , which could prove to be actually more beneficial to the community and the society a a whole than some youngster or amateur working at it .
