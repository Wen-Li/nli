i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because group tour imposes a lot limitation that one may not like . first , if i travel on my own , i can set my travel duration according to my schedule and convenience . when i travel with a group , i can only spend a certain amount of time in certain location . if i travel on alone , i can choose to stay longer at some of my favorite spot . also , i can enjoy my own daily schedule instead of complying with a group tour schedule . in most group tour , you will have to get up early and stay up late so that you can get to a many place a possible . second , i will do more research to learn about the place which i will visit . this will help me to learn the geographic location , climate , history , and culture of this place . when i just listen to the tour guide , i tend to forget most of the information but if i do research on my own , i will retain and remember them in the future . the place that i visit will be more memorable . thirdly , economically , i will be able to find economic transportation option , accommodation and even in dinning choice . nowadays , many can use airline reward to fly free or use hotel accumulated point to stay free or stay for a discount . this will surely help to save a large sum of money . also , if i travel alone , i have the freedom to choose the hotel setting and location that suit my need . in term of dinning , i can enjoy eating at my time and at place that i prefer . food choice is a personal one . i can surely be more adventurous if i can have my own choice . all in all , i think that traveling on my own will give me more freedom to explore in many aspect than when i travel with a group . afterall when i travel , i want to be in a relaxing mode and be of myself instead of being in a crowd most of the day .
