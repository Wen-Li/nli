it is difficult to answer this question . young people have all their life ahead , everything is new . they have their dream that they hold on to , and they are , usually , full of hope . older people on the other hand , have learned a lot already , and acquiered some wisdom . they see life and certain thing like love le complicated . they had their experience and are much cooler than when they were young . but young people have the advantage to be healthier and full of power and strength to live their youth and to make experience themselfes . older people are more likely to get sick and to feel tired and weak . so maybe their body are not what they used to be . but the expierences they made and what they have learned about life and about themselfes help them to take it easy . their mind is stronger . a old man laugh about this childish young guy who is so desperatly in love that he is not able to eat or to think , because he can only think of his girl . but he also envy him for being so strong and active and to have such intense feeling . this is something he lost on his way becoming a mature man . being young is an adventure , and you may enjoy it or you may regret it . it is full of action and impression , but for me , maybe because i m young and have not experienced being old , i still believe that the future , in wich i will be old , offer me plenty of happyness . it will be different , though . i am quite sure it depends on every single person whether they are happier when they are young or old . but i have to admit , that even if i think that it only get better , most of the old people miss their youth very much . but it can be joyfull to remember to ! i think you should enjoy every age . but a the youth is more intense , i think that for most people the youth is the part of their life that they enjoy the most .
