many people these day have different way of studying idea or understanding them and this ha become a great issue in our community and ha had great argument on this subject . i personally believe that understanding the whole idea or the concept is much easier and faster for teh student than trying to learn the fact of the subject for many reason 's it is easier to generalize rather than specifying , student will have easier understanding to the subject and will require le time to understand them , and when a subject is generalized it is actually more understandable by the student . for example let say a class of student are in a history class wich is talking about the second world war instead of the teacher specifying on on the detail and teh fact of what ha happened and how the war startted he basically generalizes the whole idea and make it easier for the student to understand and they will basically have le time studying the subject cause of the idea given by the teacher instead of the long and complicated fact . but even though understanding the idea is easier and faster way some time knowing the fact of a subject can be very important a well so it is not always just understanding the idea it also knowing fact about the idea . take the same example used above about world war it easier to just generalize and get the idea of how it started but it important to know the fact of why it started a well . well you see now that there is an advantage in just understanding the idea and a disadvantage a well . basically it is much easier for student to generalize and understand the idea rather than knowing the fact , but the fact of that idea might be very important and usefull to them .
