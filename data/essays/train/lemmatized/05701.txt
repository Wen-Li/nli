youngsters are the very basis of a society . it is them who are energetic and capable enough to manage a nation and move it on the line of development . it is them , who form the very backbone of a community . according to me , i dont think that it would be appropriate to blame all the youngster for not helping their community . well , we have every type of individual in every walk and every sphere of life and it would be inappropriate on our part to blame the complete lot of youngster for a few irresponsible youth . the youngster do actively participate in cultural , social a well a technological event in a community . for example ; a in my country india , economy boost is going on all because of effort of the youngster engaged in private sector management a well a technical task which is a help to the nation . then , we can also consider that many social activist are youngster who take initiative to wipe off the evil from the society . social refom project are mainly running in collage and school now-a-days . the youth of today is more aware of the right and wrong and at time , is even ready to teach their elder about it . also a we all know that the prominent literary artist , sport personell etc are the youth who , by their good work , bring name and fame to their community and society all across the world . although , i wont deny that certain youth do not participate at all in their community development , rather spoil their future by getting engaged in useless type of work or in antinational activity . or , such people would get addicted to drug or so . in the end , i would like to conclude that youth now-a-days is pretty responsible and aware of it duty a a lot and should not be underrated or underjudged . i would say they are spending almost whole of their time for their community development .
