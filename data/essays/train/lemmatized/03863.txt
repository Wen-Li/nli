everyone during his lifetime ha to `` face youth '' . many people think that during this life period one life the best moment ever . it is difficult to give an opinion , but i think that in most case it is true : young people enjoy life more than older people do . first of all one ha to think about the great freedom that a young person ha . when you are young ( i am thinking about teenager and people around 20 year old ) you often have `` many right '' and not so many obligation . let 's think about the freetime and the money : a young person can spend his freetime and his money how he want to . he doe n't have to mantain a family or pay for the house 's rental . so he can spend his money to get the more fun he can . an older person , instead , ha to take care of his family , spend money for the house , the car and many other stuff that are necessary . second : to work is often more boring than to study . when one go to school or to the university he learns everyday something new : this is funny . instead a worker in his job often ha to `` repeat '' the same action . there is also another important thing to be considered . a young person usually look with more happiness to his life than an older one . a young person ha much more time to live than an older one : a young person is able to make project for his future and he is able to change them very often . this is not easily possible for and old person . for last . a young person life many of his everyday experience a `` first time experience '' . the first time one life a situation usually is the one which give him more feeling , sensation . something that for an older person could be `` usual '' ; maybe for a young person is not . let 's think about the first love , for example . of course there are many benefit of being old ( you have experience , you know `` how to live '' ) but i think that the most beautiful part of our lifetime is youth .
