the given statement is true and relevant for the use in life . it is agreed that if there are no risk in life , and that new thing are not trried , it would be a cotidian and common world where nothing new could be seen . it would be like a mechanism , like a machine type of work . you were designeds to do something every day , and that is what you have to do every day in life , like a computer . it is designed to be used for work activites and in some case for entreteinment , but there will be nothing new in a computer if there is not a creation of a new invetion or idea for the progress of that computer . off cource that there will be risk . if the product is not accepted by society , then it will be a loss of product and a loss of money , but that is a risk that must be taken in order to make a company grow . if people are closed minded and doe not agree with many new thing than the society we live on will not be in any way successful . it would be a conformist society that just want the necesary thing . it would in part also a sellfish society , where the people will ony worry for themselves and would just ignore the problem that the rest of the society , and even the world ha . which in a way , is not correct . there should be an improval in all the thing , a history ha shown u . time ha shown that if there is no growth then we would still be in the prehistoric era , where the people could n't even knew how to talk or how to exand their own idea . but we have seen that some human take the risk , and are also shown a an example of the growth in society , and the exceptional work that human can do . because of their risk we have seen an evolution in human day and life , if there wa not a risk , then not even technology could have started . industrialisation , technology , and many other thing that complenent the socienty we live on , are the cause and the effect that were reached by the successful on the risking of society . for exapmle , if an alber einstein would n't exsist , or a leonardo davinchi , what might have been of science and religion , and literature . what about aristotle , the founder of `` university '' , if it would n't have been for these men , we would n't have any education . they risked their own life on trying to make human life better in knowledge , and in the capacity of learning new thing . they gave away a great amount of time where they could have engoyed with their family , and even , they could have done something common . but in the matter of fact , they chosed to analyze thing deeper , and show society that life can be better , and that there will always be risk to take , but it will be on your hand to take them or not . it will be your desition to change your life and differ from the common way of life .
