using a formula such a ` it is better to ' is always a dangerous thing when we are not provided with more precise context . in this case , whether one should favor a broad knowledge of varied subject or focus on one specific topic is all a matter of what one is trying to achieve and in what field . take the example of medicine : some doctor opt for the broadest instruction possible so a to be able to deal with most common disease affecting all part of the body while others decide to become specialized in a particular organ , or type of ailment . which one is ` better ' ? the only possible answer to this question is that one need both at different time and that both are important . as a german and english undergraduate , i will deal with the issue in the domain i know best : the academic field of literature a it is taught in belgian university . it is striking to watch the evolution in the academic program from the 1st year to the final one : quite clearly we start by learning the overall framework . let 's take an example from my second college year : one of my favorite class ever wa called survey of english poetry which very much covered everything from the prehistory to the 1950s . now let 's take an example from my final year : ` shakespeare and the crossing of generic boundary ' . not only did this class focus on one particular author , it focussed on one particular aspect of this particular author 's work . the move from broad topic to specific subject is self-explanatory . so much for fact . i would argue that the best way of approaching the issue at hand here is to think chronologically . in a first phase , i would definitely promote the acquisition of a fairly broad knowledge of a high number of subject . having access to the widest possible variety of topic is one of the best way to learn what curiosity is all about - and i mean curiosity in the good sense of the word ( not nosiness ) . i strongly believe that curiosity is one of the quality required if one is to live life to the full . also , getting a sense of the big picture first is a good way to discern in a second phase what specific subject appeal to u most . i believe you need to learn the base of art history before you can realize at all that you like impressionism and pre-raphaelitism best . after this first phase , then , i do n't see what is wrong with concentrating on and digging deeper into a patricular topic . at college , we are asked on several occasion to make such narrowing choice : i wrote research paper on george gissing 's novel ` new grub street ' , uwe timm 's latest novel , a poem by john updike ( a poem by one particular author ) . and i think this is a very good thing too . my undergraduate thesis , in particular , helped me identify a pretty specific topic which i would like to research further and possibly turn into a ph.d. : the impact of indutrialization on artistic production in the second half of the 19th century in england . i do not regard this process a restrictive . this kind of specific research is extremely rewarding . in conclusion , i would say that both approach can be supported and that they should not be mutually exclusive . a broad approach is a necessary gfirst step before one can narrow down one 's interest further . and since we got eh bigger picture too , notyhing stop u from developing many different specific interest overtime . ..
