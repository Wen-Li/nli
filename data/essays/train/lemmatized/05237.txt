i think , we are a human society and the human knowlegde is limited . but there are a lot of exception . for me , knowledge in a yield is essential because it is the only possibility to prove we exist in our individualist society . in short men are complementary and they have to specialize in a yiel . if we compare a situation with an economic situation , we can notice it is the base of the capitalism principle . we can find an illustration with the theory of comparative advantage of david ricardo . it is a theroy which explain that a man ha to specialise in a yied where he is the best in view to impove his capability . however , it is not the same for alll the yield . during antiquity period , philosopher wa doctor , mathematician , scientific in the same time . it wa a point of view different of nowadays . if i explain my situation , i prefer control one think in a one yield better than know much imformations , on several yield but no control one think . we are more six billion of people in all over the world , it is impossible to know all . nevertheless , broad knowledge in many academic subject for example poilitics , history , economics , science is an avantage because in the gathering with our colleague , friend , bos we can hold a discussion and say our opinion . the person who said anything is not respect generally. `` who say anything , consent '' finally i think we have to control capability and improve our knowledge all the day . the education is a process even when we will a responsable parent . to conclude , with the evolution of society and the metality , we have to strengthen our knowledge to have to compete with the other . competitivness is essential !
