we live in a community that need some help from all the it individual , espacielly from the young people , were they give most of their time for playing game , going out and having fun . by that they totaly forget about their community and the duty that have to do for it . in our day today we have to give young people the maximume attention that we can offer them , because we live in a society that ha many tool to blind them and make them lose the right track . for example if we ask a young boy weather he like to go fishing or go clean the beach from waste , his answer is going to be `` let go fishing '' , he might not even know that there are some people whom actually clean the beach . this happens from the lack of attention that we should have given for them to know more about their community and the problem that their community face . another factor which make a young boy go fishing , is the number of place that we have for child to have fun and play and at the same time the absence of place that tell our child about out community and that we actually have duty towards our community . i strongly agree with the statment
