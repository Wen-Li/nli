the problem that the statement underline ha an important impact on my personal life . as far a i 'm concerned , i really can not disagree with the statement because i am personally involved in this subject . i have been helping elderly people since i wa 15 : it 's not my job and i do n't get paid for it but when i have some spare time i just do it because i enjoy it . apart my personal experience , we have to face the fact that young people ( or most of them ) are completely not interested in helping their community probably also because the mean of comunication , such a tv radio internet , do n't stress too much on this problem . my suggestion is trying to make young people more conscious and responsive by organizing event that involve all the community . i live in a small village and i found this idea very useful . last summer i organized a big event that took all the people together just to meet each other , simply to know the neighbour and discover that there are a lot of people that need help . there is also another example that can express how much this problem is understimated . during the summer period most of the people go on holiday and leave their elderly relative alone at home and they do n't take care of them at all and sometimes happens that they die and nobody know ( just read a newspaper to find it out !! ) that sound disgusting !!! we can not be considered human being if we behave in a way like this .
