i have seen many different advertisement from the watching television . there are many different commercial on the tv . the variety number of company or government use advertisement for sale or give information . back in this summer , i wa in korea for visiting my family and staying around for 3 month . i wa watching television program called `` home shopping '' . the program show diversed item everyday , all the time . while i wa watching the home shopping program , i started getting into it . i realized that the advertisement made me to buy item even if i do n't need it . why it happends ? advertisement is a way of business increase their sale of item . it 's very simple . the company need to sell their good a much a they can . the advertisement is a good way of increase their sale because it is easy for the people to contact and get information . for increasing their sale , the commercial ha to be mysterious or interesting . it cause people to have interest in their good . many people get hurt or regret of their deal because advertisement make product look much better than what they really are . when i wa 9 year old , i really wanted new shoe even though i had a brand new shoe . it wa not because of i hated my shoe . it wa because of the advertisement . the commercial advertising the shoe with my favorite animation . i affected commercial . i cajoled mother to get one of those shoe . i finally got the shoe but i definately not used it occastionally . i also wanted remote controll car . i wa entrancing in the advertisement . it looked amazing . i thought i will be really happy if i get one . i asked parent but they ignored . i cajoled mother to buy one for me . she spent a quiet money for that . she spent money for me even though we were not very wealthy . i wa having great time with it for couple day , but i apparently got sick of it . it looked amazing in commercial , but the car wa not really amazing at all . i felt guilty and wasteful .
