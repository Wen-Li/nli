i totally agree with this statement . advertisements make product look better than what they truely are . public medium and ad that show up on tv are the one to blame . they use the latest technology in tv production to make the advertisement look a attractive a possible to the audience therefore increasing the popularity of such product between the audience . more colour , impressive stunt , unbelievable manuevers are all aspect that make up a good commercial . lets take david beckham 's perfume advertisement for exampe . it wa shown on tv all over the middle east . it portrayed him kicking the ball half way through the soccer field and the ball amazingly wa netted in the far end corner of the goal . that kind of goal would have never happened in real life and the chance of it occuring might be a big , fat zero . david beckham is an icon in the world of soccer , he is a multi millionare , married to a former member of spice girl ( posh spice ) and play in one of the best football club in the world of football which is real madrid . every body in here were talkin about this advertisement and people including me qeued infornt of the super market to get a bottle of this so called '' amazing '' perfume a refered to in the advertisement . i finally got it , but unfortunately i wa shocked by the result . the scent of the perfume wa awful to me and to the majority of the customer that bought it . a public poll wa even made when the perfume wa released and the result supported my opinion greatly . eventhough the container that had the perfume looked fancy and unresistable , i wa shocked by it content . in the end beckham 's name and logo on the container will not make the scent a glorious a the goal scored in the t.v commercial stated earlier .
