i completely agree with this statement . in my opinion , most advertisement make product seem much better a that is what they are meant to do . advertisements make the product look much more attaractive and much more useful than they really are . a lot of company spend a lot of money only on this area . this is due to the fact that they have realised that most of the consumer believe the advertisement and will be under the infulence of them . however , a lot of the time it is very unfair to the customer a well . these advertisement can be very misleading sometimes and customer end up buying what they dont really want . i have seen it and experinenecd it myself . television advertisement have mislead me in buying many product that i did not want . another technique that many business firm use is that of using celebrity to persuade people for buying their good . celebrities with very high social status 's can be very persuasive at time and this is another case of misleading the consumer . there is not much anybody can do about this either . people need to understand that firm would try their level best to make people buy what they do not what . it is u who are at fault a well . beleiving these advertisement blindly would be stupidity on our part . we are the one who are spending money and we need to make sure that we do not wate what we have . i think most of the advertisement are very misleading and make the product look much better than they really are . nevertheless we are at fault a well and we need to make sure that we do not make mistake easily .
