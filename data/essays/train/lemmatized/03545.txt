the role of medium and advertisement on our life ha always been an interesting topic for me . the pushing medium play a significant part in our decision giving process and consuming pattern . i strongly agree that most of the advertisement imposed to u effect our buying decision and make the product seem better than they really are . first of all , the product advertised on several medium channel mostly do not reflect it real physical appereance in term of size , shape , or color . by the help of advancing technology such a computer program and new viewing technology in creative science , it became so easy to make adjustment on the physical appereance of a product . as a result the product seems much more attracting to consumer on tv or newspaper . but when you go to buy the product you realize that it doe not look a good a it wa advertised additionally , in term of quality what is promised by the firm is mostly not realized after the purchasing stage . it is easy to promise on ad rather than realizing it . for example in my country many home appliance firm which basically produce washing machine or refrigerator assure their customer that their good will not be broken for three year . and if these good are broken they guarantee affording the cost of fixation . in reality the item you buy generally break down in le than three year . worsely , when you email or phone them to transfer your complaint or dissatisfaction , it is a tiny possibility that you will get assistance . lastly firm are getting more wild on earning more profit because of the financial instability in the world . wars and economic crisis always fluctions in economy . therefore company in order to strengthen their financial standing and improve their profit margin . they focus on advertisement to increase their sale . as a consequence new way of advertising enters into scene which is lying people about their product and pushing them to buy without hesitation . consequently i strongly agree that in today world most of the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are since the advancing technology , ease of promising more and more and the financial status of the country and firm .
