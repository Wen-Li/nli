i agree with the statement that succcessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this is because , doing something new or taking a huge risk attract others , and by doing something new , people feel proud of themselves for doing it . by doing something new and developing , people with courage get attracted and becomes the follower of them . this give the power and make them be a `` one '' but not a a `` group '' . this also attracts the people who tend to follow the risk taker . for example , martin luther king tend to take risk by going for the black people 's right with no violence . this made him to take a huge risk such a to be killed by the radical people . however , his new type of trial , which is nonviolent resistance , attracted a lot of people and lead his work to success . also , when he got arrested , many people who had similar feeling with him , such a president kenedy moved to help him out of the prison . this show the attraction of the people who are doing something risktaking and innovative . also , by doing something innovative or novelty , people feel pride for it and therefore , their motivation increase . also by experiencing all the risk , hardship , and happiness together , they feel familiar and think them a a `` whole '' but not individual . takahumi horie , the founder of a japanese internet business company livedoor said that `` risktaking seems hard for many people , but going through the risk make people 's work more valuable and lead them to success. '' when he wa awarded for the most innovative person in a year , in japan . i think that risktaking people are more successful than the people doing something that they already know well . this is because risktakers often attracts people and therefore , have a lot of power . also they take pride and work a a `` whole '' but not individual .
