yes , i definitely agree with this statement that young people nowadays dont give enough time to helping their community . in this modern world , younsters seem to be too engrossed with their work . they are really striving for success . but while doing so , they forget their moral responsibility and duty . the older people really care about the society . most of them are philanthropist and are concerned about the development . they offer their help , wherever they can for the upliftment of their community . for example , in a locality , if there is a major power failure and the locality is plunged into darkness , it ll always be the older people who will report this problem to the concerned authority . the younger people feel that they have better thing to do in life , rather than performing act of altruism . such kind of an attitude should be done away with . they youth should realize that the future of the society is their hand . words like ethic , priniciples seem to have died out in today 's world . take for example , a student studying in high school . he is doing really well in his study and scoring high grade in all of the subject which are being taught to him . but besides this , he should also offer some help to his community . he can do this by helping the weaker student out with their academic . also , he should think about the student living in the sub urbs who can not afford to go to school . he should be inspired by this very famous saying `` each one teach one '' . hence he should take the initiative and rise to the occassion . he can offer help by taking lecture there , because education is the pillar of the nation . social service should be an integral part in everone 's life . therefore , i feel that it high time , that youngster start contributing to the community by offering their help in whichever field they can . be it in school , hospital or office . they should set an example for the generation to follow , by being benevolent and therby make this place a better place to live .
