the people should help their community . but some people do not help their community , especially young people . because they belive that they are happy in being this situation . but they are not . they can not see that because they lost theirself in this complicated world . because of growing very rapidly and basicly in that global world make them careless person . but i firmly agree this statement . this are my following reason . firstly , nowadays young people do not give enough time their community . they suppose that they can live alone with not communicating in this developing world . actually we can not accuse them completely . because in this information era when we live they are used to play computer game and surfing in internet . so they became people who do not go theater and movie and do not participate in social activity . and these condition help them to alleviate . moreover , young people do not give enough time their community because they think that when they could start to walk they are free . and they can do everything what they want . so they neglect their family and their friend . when all young generation did this , the world ha became worse place than before . they believe that they are free and they behave how they want . if they continue to do this , this stuation doe not progress and it collapse . we must be carefull when growing a child . if only we do like this , we can protect our future and our children's in conclusion , i firmly believe that young people do not give enough time to helping their community .
