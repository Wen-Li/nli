the best way o travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i agree this topic beacuse usullay when you go another country or city , you heard something or you prepared to travel . if you have a tour guide you dont need to look something about this place . tour guide usually know this place because they are doing this job . and they can know everything about this city : about history , shopping center , natural park , ... ect . so i want to talk about my expresions . i went to italy with tour guide . it wa fantastic . i went rome and it wa a so beatiful place . it wa historical place and they can make best ice cream in the world . when we went there we dont know what we gone a do and when we arrived rome internatoinal airport our our guide wa waited u . he came to near u and he discribe his self . and he told u let go to our hotel and be ready to rome . so we slept and next morning we woke up 6 am. and we took a perfect breakfast . first we went to lovers hole . he discribe about history and why all people throw quarter to here . and we traveled everywhere . also we have lot of free time . in those time you can travel your self . you can see everywhere whit this tour guide . but sometimes this can be whore thing in the world . some tour guide doesnt know anything about city or that place and they couldnt tell anything about city . it can be so boring . but usually tour guide selected person . and they know three or four langue . and usually they were born in yhis city or they were lived in this city . they can take special historical class for those tour . i belive the best way to travel is in a group whit tour guide . because if you dont want to join group , you can stay and you can travel by your self or usually they give you free time to travel in this place . this is the best way to travel .
