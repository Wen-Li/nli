speacializing in one specific subject , is much more effective than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject . in the early year there were n't lot of scientist and doctor . if i wa at that time i would have chosen to have a broad knowledge opposing to have one specific subject to spealize in . yet , these day education is improving and there is competion between people . therefore , i would rather speacialize in one area inorder to ` shine ' and be known for my uniqeness in this area . in the past year there would be one doctor whom you went to , it didnt matter what you were feeling , whether it wa a pain in your stomache or or a problem with your eye sight you still went to ` the doctor ' . nowadays , doctor are more an more speacialized . even pediatritions are now more speacilized where each doctor is concerned about one part of the human body . furthermore , have a look at teacher . in primay school we usually had a class teacher which taught u all subject . english , math , science and the rest of the subject . yet , when we moved to high school we started realizing that teacher were to a greater sense more speacalized , we had a teacher for each subject . not only that but take science a an example , not only did we have a teacher for science , but we had a different teacher for physics , biology and chemistry . moving on to university we start choosing our major . take buisness for example . you speacilize in major and you find the different smaller topic in buisness , which show you how speacilized it is . what i am trying to prove here , is that this decsion is already made , no one is able to take lot of subject and not speaclize in one major . you only have the opportuinty to choose one major , and sometimes you are able to choose a double major , since some subject are related to each other , like business and accounting . by speacilizing in one subject , you find it easier to find a job after university , and when you start working it motivating and self - fullfilling to feel that you know your major well , and this make you like your job and appreciate it . this is why it is very important to choose your major carefully , since this will be the subject you will speacilize in and live with . it is possible to change your career but i feel it a shame to waste all these year of studying and start from the beginning
