in whatever lesson , we learn idea , concept and fact . ideas present the topic and fact are an application of these idea . i think it 's more important for student to understand idea and concept than it 's for them to learn fact . the way to understand well a lesson is , first of all , to understand idea and concept and then , understand fact . it 's not reversible . for example , in history class about world war one , you have to understand why this war took place and why all the country were involved in this fight before learning fact : battle , event , great name , famous day . .. another example happens in mathematics class , you see that a theorem can be applied to particular case but you should have understod before all the concept which are used in the theorem . secondly , i think that , in a lesson , idea and concept are more significant than simple fact . indeed , fact are just application of idea . i mean that without idea and concept , you ca n't totaly understand a lesson . you can partially , of course , but it 's not the same . i ca n't really explain it but you feel differently when you 've understood all . i feel kind of victorious when all is clear in my head . you ca n't get all the detail explained if you 've just learnt fact because they are not enough to get to the heart of a topic . at last , what is the point of a lecture or a lesson if you just remember fact ? facts ca n't exist without idea or concept whereas idea and concept do n't have to be related to fact to exist . i know it sound weird but some field of knowledge such a metaphysics do n't really have any application . however , they exist . besides , we always can extract an idea from a fact , whereas the opposite is n't a easy a we think . for all these reason , i think that student should understand idea and concept before learning fact .
