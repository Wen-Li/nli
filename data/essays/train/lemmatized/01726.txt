human change from decade to another . their technology get improved , and also their birth grow more than before . the population in this time will be differ than the comming one . in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , since the population is increasing , and that will cause a lot of traffic problem such a crowded street , and the way of transportation . we can solve this problem by using train and plane more than car . in the other hand , people will not buy car more if they face a lot of trafic crowd . while the population is increasing , i think there will be a new law , and restriction of using car . also , the tax will increase on the people who have more than enough of car in their home . people will go smoothly for the train and plane for their transporations . this will reduce the crowd , and they can arrive quickly without facing any trouble . also , the development of the technology will increase , and the people will go to the technology and they will not take care of the car . according to my writing , i agree with this statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . the live is in progress and will never stop , and it will come complicated .
