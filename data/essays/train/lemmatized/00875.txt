to answering this question in an adequate way we need to analyse why society use car . based on this consideration we can try to figure out if there would be le car than today . the history about the car began last century . cars increased and are still increasing our mobility . i belive that there are to different mobility : the personal and the economical mobility . the personal mobility is something people want to have . it allows u to move from one point to an other point at the time we would like to . we do n't need to have a look on schedule . we are independent from others . to give up this personal freedom is hardly conceivable . on the other hand , car are so important for the world wide economy . they provide the mobility of person and of good . it is a cheap oportunity to move . consequently the whole economy would not reduce the usage of car if it 's not forced by other circumstance . using car increase the air pollution , reduces the world wide storage of fuel and accordingly rise the fuel price . this might be an effect to get the society considering their behaviour . recently the price for fuel went up dramatically . i do n't think that at the moment the society is using the car le then before . in switzerland , where i come from , there at the moment several dissusions about how to decline the air pollution and to improve the enviroment . this discussion is meaningless if just some people on the earth are looking for solution and are really willing to do it . especially for raising country it is quiet hard to think about such a problem . the need something to eat and have other problem at the moment . all in all , it need a world wide solution . i do n't think that the society would be able to find one without forced from other
