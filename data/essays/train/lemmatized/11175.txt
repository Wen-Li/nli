i this growing population and devoloping technology , people show up with more need every day . but these need can easily be displayed in an ostentatious way like making the product seem much better than they really are . even though the consumer already now that the product in not going to be a real solution to their question , they easily can get amased by the showy advertisement . i believe the best way to sell a product hide under the showy advertisement . lets say there are to different componies which are trying to sell their hair loss product . the x company say that this product is not only going to be the permenant solution but alsothe costumer will be able to see the result in 2 week , even though it doe not work like that . on the other hand , the y company just say that the consumer will easily see the hair lossing problem ending in 3 month , after finishing the first bottle of that hair solution . also they add that if the buyer would like to see the permenant answer they have to use 3 bottle . i believe it is not that hard to decide choosing the product that work for you . my answer would have been saying yes to the first company and buying their product which they empysize their product under the name of permenant solution . with that word group they can easily get the buyer attention , because the person who ha the hair loss problem do not want to face with the problem or spend their my on 3 bottle instead of 1 . as buyer we should not believe every word we hear on commercial . we should be more picky .
