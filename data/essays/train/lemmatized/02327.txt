ofcurse i disagree with thise statement because when you are successful in your work you have to continue on it , because in this time taking risk are very bad , if you fail maby you will be poor so you can feed your family or your self , then it will be hard on you to find a new jop because there are too many people are searching also for a jop . my other opinion is that when you are happy in your jop why do you have to take risk that you do n't no if you will succes or you fail , every body know that if he will succes ofcourse he will be happy , but when you take a risk and fail i 'm sure that he will extreemly sad and maby some time he will become ile so bad , and some time few of these guy who wa successful then he faild in his bisnans they die because they have lost too much , like what happend to a friend of mine , his father wa a successful man in his jop then he chosed to work in a new thing , in the begining he succeed then after two month he last every thing that he had . and guess what he died and i 'm so sorry for him . thats why i don ; t think that it 's a good ideia to take risk in some thing that you do n't know , i know that i do n't have knoledg enogh to give these successful men an advise but please listen to me if you are succese in your jop stay one it to have a beter life to live with your family if you have one . after that i hope that you all successful men will listen to me and then i 'm sure that you will thank me latetr .
