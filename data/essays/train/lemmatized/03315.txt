the statement agreeing with having a broad knowledge and not a subject-specified knowledge is to one extent wrong . having a broad knowledge on many academic subject might be a positive thing but in the end there is the need of some kind of specialization in order to achieve and get some result . during the year of formation ( middle and high school ) a range of subject is needed in order to give the student a chance to get a better idea on where they want to specify later on in their life . but once school is over some kind of specialization need to be required . children and teenager are required to learn no many subject not because it is better to have a broader knowledge but because they are not old enough to choose which specialized subject they want to pursue . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is the same a having shallow knowledge on something . with this shallow knowledge no result can be achieved and the result , in the end , is someone that know a little about everything and nothing about something specific . engineers , doctor , lawyer are all specialized in their on subject . this profession that are the most respected one are based on specific knowledge and not on broad knowledge . there is no time or real need for a doctor to know about law and how the judicial system work a long a he know about his own profession and how to apply medicine . there is something called general culture that everyone should learn and use in every day basis but it should not be the only knowledge a person ha . the general culture should be accompanied by some kind of specified knowledge on something that would lead to something . people that only have general culture do not have enough knowledge to pursue a carreer that would lead somewhere in the future . the nobel prize , for example , are subject-specified and there is no general culture nobel prize . the physicist that earns the physics nobel prize ha specified knowledge that accompanied with research and work in this subject led him to a discovery . in the end , what is needed in the world of today is a general sense of what is going in the world ( i.e. general culture ) with some specified knowledge in a subject that might lead to an achievement that would help the world in general . having only specified knowledge is also a negative thing because there is a dettachment of the real world that could harm a person and disconect him from the world .
