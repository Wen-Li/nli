there is no denying the fact that it is important for student to learn fact . however , i personally think that understanding idea and concept is much better for me . i can imagine that for some people fact are crucial in human life , but i think something else is better for me . facts are basic in the sense that they are stable matter and people can benefit from them . to illustrate , history is full of fact that a major part of people in the globe benefited and will benefit from . however , learning fact ha some drawback . for me , fact do not encorage student to use their creation or imagination and ability to agree or disagree with something . actually , there is no mental activity behind learning fact or expressing new capability that student are endowed with . on the other hand , understanding idea is much more crucial for me . understanding idea make me use my mind , imagination and mental capability . besides , it is an efficient way for student to talk and have a discussion based on an idea or concept . for instance , student may talk about an idea by a writer like the americcan bernard lewis in his book what went wrong ? . they may for exemple tackle the idea of islam and modernity or the difference between jihad a a part of militancy and resistence and the concept of terrorism a a terrifying matter . another exemple could be the clash between civilisation and how people came to hate each other through politician . furthermore , bernard lewisthe counterpart edward said with his book orientalism conveys more tention between nation . for me , student shouldknow about current and previous idea and concept to be able to be up to the level of the development of event in the world . as a conclusion , i really think that understanding idea is better than learning fact . therefore , i agree with the statement that say it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
