yes , i agree with the following statement because it is more important for the student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is the class that which will take the student to higher position in the future . in support to the above word saying that word like to present an example when the student understand the idea if he understands the class well he can only build the idea in their own way . if he understands the subject deeply then only he can able to express his idea , feeling etc . for example the student ha a science background then he should concentrate on the idea than on the fact in it because fact about the nature is inefficient it can not be determined this wa the example i described to support the statement . the student concentrate on the cocepts this he will understand the total theme of the subject if the student is from science department then by taking concept of small think he could make a fabulous think say for example by lowering the concept of sensor he could develop idea and could automate his by itself . the main reason for the statement is developing the habit of thinking in own way and give the idea of his own this will be possible only for the student who understand the idea and concept in depth . the conclusion is by understanding the idea and concept that the student will be successfull in his careerand in search of fact the student can not acheive success in his life . this is the reason why i should agree the statement that is more important for the student to understand the idea and concept . these are some of the specific reason and example i mentioned in this passage to support my answer .
