the understanding of both idea and content are important . there is therefore , a slight difference for me that make one more important than the other . first of all when we learn about fact , whe are using our memory to get some info on somethig that work , exists and doe not require any further experiment or resaerches . on the other hand , when student learn concept and idea , they may put them together with the pourpose of conducting some research . when student are curious and have enough information , concept and idea ; the result of their experimets could lead them to get some fact by themselves . thomas edison for example did not have the fact about what light represented , he had lot of idea and concept a the result of his various research . he wa curious enogh to be able to put all these factor together ( curiosity , idea , concept ) to be able to make a wonderful , revolutionaty invention . an invention that created many everlasting fact . all the modern and the new school method zero in on leading the student to the learning through his idea and the curiosity these may generate on him . nowadays , i have also have the chance to test myself and put into practice all these method . i am a person who like learning through experience and getting plenty of information by myself . achieving fact , or learning about fact on my own is important for me , but needle to say that all the existing fact you may learn about also give u abundant richness of concept , idea and kwoledge . in short , idea , concept and fact are all necessary , but what really make the difference is how effective well - structured concept can lead a student to a more self-exploratory environment . thank you .
