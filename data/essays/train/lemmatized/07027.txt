i disagree the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today in japan , there are following reason . first , the way of thinking is verifing now , so car maker should produce many kind of car to match the pople 's need . some pople use theircars only when go shopping , others use their car a a kind of hobby . they like suport car , racing car or off road car , etc . today , a tipical family living in japan ha one car . but it is said that a tipical family living in jpan will have two car in a few year . one of them will be for the father and the other will be for the mother . the price of car ha bacome very cheap because of technology development , a tipical family will be able to buy two car in a few year . in addion , in japan , we can not have second car now because we do n't have enough parking space in our home or we can not pay the expensive parking fee . but there day , the japanese real estate have become cheaper than before . if this situcation continues , we will be able to have enough parking space in our home or pay enough parking fee in a few year . at last , in japan , the goverment improves the railroad and highway by investing a lot of money these day . because the public transportation system in japan ha been imploved these thirty year , and then the govermaent now think to improve the railroad and highway mainly . as a resault , the terrible trafic jam in japan will be resolved in a few year , so the number of japanese who want to buy and use their car will increase . so , i totally disagree the ideat that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today in japan .
