the usage of car ha been increasing since the beginning of 20th century , with the fordist era - the easy and mass production of car in 1900s . however i believe that it ha reached to it peek and in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , because people are becoming more concerned with environmental issue , petroleum price are constatly increasing while it supply is decreasing , which cause financial problem and car user started to find new solution nowadays and public transportation is rapidly developing . fisrt of all , the global world is now aware of the environmental problem . for the sustainablity of mankind , the carbondioxide emmision must be dropped . billions of car in traffic , all around the world are producing carbondioxide and destroying the ozon layer . fortunately , there are many organisation , public group and volunteer that try to educate people on this issue and people are now feeling more responsible for the environment they are living in . i believe these effort will result in positive outcome in twenty year , and people will start to find new way of transportation in order to save the world . caring about the environment is not the only reason why people are trying to find new way of transportation . the constant increase in the petroleum price due to the decrease in it supply , also lead car user to search for new solution . employees of the same company or student of the same school started to share car nowadays . by this way , they can share the cost of the car . in additon , there are some restriction by some government that support this solution . for example in united states , people who pas across a bridge alone in his/her car pay more fee than the one sharing their car . in additon usage of bicycle , motorcycle and scooter also increased , and keep increasing . the last reason why i think that car usage will decrease in the future is because of the development in other transportation system . public transportation is getting more efficient with the technological development and it seems like it is going to improve even more in the future . for example in turkey , a economy improves , more subway line are being constructed . now , most of my friend come to school by subway instead of bus or their provate car . in addition to getting widespread in all around the city , the subway system is now much more comfortable and fast than before . societies ' increasing awareness in environmental issue , increasing price of and decreasing supply of petroleum and the improvement in the public transportation sysems will result in fewer car in usage in twenty year .
