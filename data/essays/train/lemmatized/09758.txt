the life is a relatively short period for some people . however , if you succeed in achieving the benefit at any age , it will no longer be a problem . enjoying the life at older age will bring you the feeling of a long life . it also come with the question of the difference between young people and the older one about the enjoyment gathered from the life . as far a i 'm concerned , older people enjoy life the way it ha to be and it brings them many advantage against younger one . at earlier age , people are not even aware of the time passing rapidly and have the lack of experince which will let them enjoy the life the way it is meant to be . on the other side , being older give you the comfort of knowing what to do and where to do . especially after retirement , you have nothing to worry about whereas younger people feel the pressure of the responsibility against their family and also the dilemma they usually come up with . moreover , older people do know how to spend their money to get the most of it . in addition to what i 've said before , of course there are many disadvantage of being older which maybe seems to badly affect your life . nonetheless , if you have the right point of view , you can easily see that those are not even taken into consideration . for instance , being le energetic is an important lack against the younger people . however , if you use it efficiently and effectively , it wo n't be a problem to cope with anymore . with that in mind , if you care for yourself enough , you can also stand against health problem longer than you think . in conclusion , i completely disagree with the statement provided . older people really know how to enjoy the life .
