well in this topic we see a narrow line between youngers and the olders . everyone think of the young people in this topic but probably they are not the one and it go to the olders . young people will enjoy but comparing with the olders life they didnt even see the whole way in the life or the experience which these olders get in their life . ok i agree that young people are the fastest and most brilliant in thinking compared to the olders . from these youngers when we ask them to face a situtation or to face a panic problem we get those answer or step in them only by depended on their mood or by their interest , but if we ask these olders to judge the same situation , they show u the right way or right step in that . this all not depends up on the person or not by the situation , but it all depends upon the great experience what they secured from their life and from all the situation what the faced and got through them . the young generation always think about the beneifits of the source but we wont get any thought about the disadvantage until someone explains about them , but this habit develops to the olders from their experience and from their wroung step what they made in their young stage . here the main enjoy in life is not those freakouts or not those hangout but it all about the sucess in the life or happy movings in the life , probably in this old and weak hand of these olders rise in this competition . the olders are the mine from which we can extract alot of the valuable thing and we can also learn alot from which help these youngers not only to move in right step but also how to enjoy the life .
