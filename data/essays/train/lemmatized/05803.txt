if you were to ask me whether young people nowaday give enough time to helping their community , my answer would be definitely be a solid `` no '' . at least it is the case for the young people of my country taiwan . there are two reason why i feel that young people in taiwan are not spending enough time in helping community . first , time have changed , the environment and the behavior of people have changed . in comparison with the time when there are many child in a family , most family now have only one child . his or her parent spend a lot of money and a lot of time providing his or her need . most of the young people in taiwan are being spoiled by their parent . the young people , therefore , are selfish and inconsiderate . they do n't feel it 's necessary to help the needy in their community because they do n't think there are people that need to be helped . it 's quite pathetic and sad , but it 's true . how would they spend time helping in the community when they do n't think there 's a need to it ? the second reason why i do n't think young people give enough time to helping their community is because there simply is n't time for them to do it ! even if they want to help out , they do n't have time to do it ! nowadays , young student have to learn a variety of thing in school . aside from basic subject like math , history and english , they have to perform well in other subject like music and art . students often go cram school to learn their art and music skill after school . when they get home , it 's usually around nine or ten o'clock . some teen even have to go to cram school on the weekend in order to get into better high school or university . their schedule are already filled with subject they need to handle in school , how can they have time to help out in the community ? the two reason i mentioned why young people do n't spend enough time helping their community are fair and true . it is really a sad thing to point out , and i truly hope this situation will change in the near future . young people helping in community is something that 's important and meaningful ; it would be a pity if no one help out in the community .
