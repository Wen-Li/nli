i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . the reason why i think so are many people who succed something mostly try new thing , try new thing can be found the new thing that no one know yet , and poeple can do thing that already know , but not everyone can not do new thing . first , in the world , most of people who succeded are tryed some new thing and succeded . for example the new invention like internet or computer made the campanies big and rich . second , it is not easy to try new thing or the thing that take risk , because sometimes they fail or very dengerous . so , most of people do n't want to do that . but other way , no one want to do , so if you do , you will find someting that the people who do n't want to try don'tknow . so , there are some opptunities that you can find something that no one know and it will be albe to connect to succed . at last , you can not be successful if you do what people already know haw to do , because if you can be successful to do what you already know , maybe everyone can be successful because everyone can do same thing . if you try something new and you can find something thatno one know , only you can do that and other poeple ca n't do same thing because they do n't know . so most of the big company try to search new thing that o to try something new and take risk is difficult , but it mean you can find something new and it may be able to make you succed . so , i believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
