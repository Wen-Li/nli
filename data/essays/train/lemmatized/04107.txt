i do agree with the statement that the number of car would reduce in year to come and they will be fewer than the present in twenty year from now , but restricting to the developed country . the number would be on the rise in developing and poor country . in the developed country that are already at a stage where there is a car for every individual ( adult ) and the pollution and traffic is at their peak there would be awareness about the vehicular pollution and trafic discomfort that lead to citizen opting to other cost effective and environmental freiendly mode of transort like the public transport system , metros , bus etc. that will surely reduce the use of the personal car . the information technology , boom in computer technology all these lead to reduction in the movement of men , where the work can be finished directing from one place . all these event might result in the usage of fewer number of car and effective transport system in twenty year from now . but this is not the case with other part of the world , the poorer country the developing country where the possession of car is synonymous with high social status and the personal vehicle is still a luxary . for example if in the developed country ther is a car in every home then in other country with far more greater population there would be a car in every 10 home . this is very much true atleast in country like india . in such country there will be a big boost in the number of car owned by the individual and it will then peak in the tweny year from now . it would take a minimum of 20 year for country like india to reach the position where the us presently is . not only will the number of car will be on the rise but also the transport system will improve further incresing the efficiency of travel and indirectly the number of car in use . hence twenty year from now the situation of the number of car and transport system would depend on the place considered . but universally the number of vehicle will be lot greater than the present number .
