with the rise of capitalism a the dominating economic sytstem around the world , advertisement ha emerged a one of the key element of economy , especially in the 20th century . producers use advertisement a a way of introducing a product to the customer , creating meaning around it , in order to distinguish their product from the other similar one on the market , to make them compatable and attractive for their customer . there are different way of promoting a particular product . topday the advertisement sector have developed a variety of way in order to promote a particular product . one of them is the the exeggration of the quality of the advertised product . the purpose of the producer for advertising a product is not mainly to demonstrate the real characteristic of their product , but rather to be able to reach more customer and a many product a possible . however , this doe not mean that all the advertisement are about a distorted picture of the product that they represent , what really count for a successful advertisement is it ability to appeal to the customer . one advertiser can create such a distinctive style and tell the truth about the product and be achieve success without illusion . provided that advertisement is in nature about the biased presentation of a particular product , one can not expect that an advertisement should be reflecting the true characteristic of a product compared to the others . the purpose of the firm a they are advertising their product is , first of all , creating an image of a specific product , which would enable them to reach to their customer increase their income . from my point of view , the advertisement tend to distort the true image of their product in order to make them look better on the market compared to the other product because of their biased nature but do not necessarily do this .
