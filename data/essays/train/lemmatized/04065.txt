ideas and concept are pretty linked to fact . facts can builtd idea and concept , but the reprocicity is real too . it is still the same conflict that we find between the theory defender and the experience one . sometimes , it is more important to understand idea than to learn fact . for example , in history , that not a big deal if student are not able to remember each fact that occured during the last century . but , they have to understand what kind of policy ruled a country and why , in the same last century . it is the same in other field a economics and so on . in that case , student do not have to be considered a dictionnary . there is no use for them if they can not explain why fact happened . in the other hand , student have to learn fact , because it is the only way to understand idea and concept and to be able to explain it . if idea or concept are tought in a such way that student do not have to think about them and to find a link between them , they should understand them and represent them in their own way . they have to make their own experience in order to get the meanning of the theory . finally , we can see that the more important is to understand idea and concept and learning fact is just a road to reach this goal . to my mind , experience is best way to understand theory . but , experience is nothing without theory or we will always make the same mistake . studies have to be made a we build our life . so student will have to learn fact for a long time i guess .
