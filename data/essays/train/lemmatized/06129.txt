people , espeally ordinary people , often discus whether successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already khow how to do well . i strongly believe that most honored people like to do something new one . most of successful people are curious . they always think about that which people are not intersted in. a people know , the chief of sony company is the best example . when he wa young , he thought he listens to the radio not only staying at home , but only walking down street . so , finally he made sony walkman . he became known person and successful person . they also have a dream themselves and they do that what they try to do new thing . they were embitionce . and if they decided somthing , they never give up . of course , all of them are not like that . some successful people like to do what they already know how to do well . but others are not afraid to faced with new thing . indeed , they could do that what they want . taking all of these thing into account , successful people would like to try new thing and take risk .
