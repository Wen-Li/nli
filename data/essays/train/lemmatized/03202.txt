yes i agree with above conversation that student have concept than learn fact . its important that student know about any topic the concept is importants than learn fact . at first i want to distinguish between to two fact . if the student ha concept he can have that knowledge or subject related to this knowledge lifelong . if the student had learned any fact it will not stored in his memory and he can not remember it so long time . if student had concept he can explain the related concept anywhere at anytime . the idea and concept generated by the student will be remembered a much a long time than the learned fact . if student builts a concept on related matter on his own idea it will be very useful for him future . student builted topic is related to his job then it will play a major role of life and he can settled in his life and knowledge about related topic will be improve his efficiency in his job also . due to this the student can well score or remember about that topic . but where a in learned fact the student can remember much time about the topic . the student who based on the leaned fact ha book knowledge or theory knowledge . theory knowledge will not will stored in the memory for so much time . here i want to say my opinion , that is practical knowledge is much more better than theory knowledge . by learning the topic it cant remembered so much time and it is very useful only for those student in exam point of view . the practical knowledge is well remembered and it can explained to his junior student also where a theory knowledge can not remembered by the persom after the exam is completed . for example let u take mathmatics subject . in this subject the whole matter is based on problem only . here only some formula can remembered by the person or student . the problem should be solved on basis of that formula related one . if the student will learned the problem it can not remember by that him so long time . if he built the idea on the problem he can remember the problem for long time . here in this subject it is improved that practical knowledge or concept of student are well efficiect than theory or learned knowledge . in my opinion concept is better than the theory or learned knowledge .
