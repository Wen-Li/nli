nowadays , there are numorous debats on whether or not understanding idea and concept is more important than learning the fact . from my point of view , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the following reason will support my opinion from three perspective . first of all , idea and concept are the foundation of the fact . in addition , in the most textbook , every chapter begin with the term and definition of the idea and concept . at the begining of every chapter the professor will ask student to understand every term and idea which is included in this chapter . because every subject have some speical term the student did not hear before . if they do not understand these idea and concept , they will have a lot of difficulty to learn the fact about these idea . secondly , understanding idea and concept will help student to learn fact more effiectively and efficiently . when the student understand and memorize all the idea and concept which they are going to learn about , they are get ready to accept the new fact related to these idea . forthermore , they will familiar to these fact by the mean of they understand idea and concept . all of these will help student to learn the fact quickly and correctly . thirdly , student learning fact indicate to memorize the concept correctly and accurately . in the school , the first objection of student are learning the academic knowlege which refers to the idea and concept . later , they will use these knowlege in the working place and connect the idea with the fact . therefore , in the school student should concentrate on the idea and concept , meanwhile , they can use the fact to help them memorize the idea and concept accurately . to conclude , understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . firstly , the fact is based on the idea and concept . secondly , understanding idea and concept is a good way for student to learn the fact . lastly , learing idea and concept will more beneficial for student achieving their academica goal . therefore , student should make a great effort to understand the idea and concept , then to learn fact .
