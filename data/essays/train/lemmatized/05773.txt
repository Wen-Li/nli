i am agree with the statement saying , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than it is today . '' the use of car is in the increasing stage during these day . however , i believe that this condition will completely change during next twenty year . first reason of reduce in use of car will be pollution of the environment . car is the main cause of pollution of the earth every year . this fact wa most likely ignored by the people during past few year . however , people start to recognize the importance of maintaining good environment condition and try to do their best for it . other reason that car will be le used in the future is the globalization . globalization mean that the world is not separating a an individual but conforming a one big community . therefore , other transportation , which is airplane or ship , to travel oversea will be more used than the car . car will be just used for the travel within the land or continent . in fact , people even start to use transportaion such a subway or airplane more than the car . the final reason that effect the use of the car is the development of the technology . i personally believe that the development of the technology will soon invent or create new way of transportaion . this new way of transportaion will be much faster than the car and have le harm on the environment . this will make the car to be not welcomed by the human society anymore . the change in the world occurs much faster than the past . in other word , there can be big change in a very short period of time . therefore , twenty year are definitely not a short time for car to be in a le use .
