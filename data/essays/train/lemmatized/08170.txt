i am agree with the given statement . according to day to day experience a a student i can say , it is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . firstly , let elaborate it by citing an example . in math subject there are few fact , based on which a student ha to do sum . but is that possible that only by learning the fact the student will be able to solve a given sum . untill a student donot understand the concept of solving proper type of sum , he will stuck up with the sum . by only learning math fact student will be able to solve only a particular type of sum . if he ha not understood the concept of solving it , he will not be able to solve the same kind of sum if the sum is slightly twisted . secondly , if a student doesnot understand any subject and just mug up the fact of the subject , he will not be able to retain it for long . it is a proved fact , that the thing which are understood are more retentive than the thing which are just mugged up . by understanding any topic of a subject a student can use it more practically . thirdly , let consider medical student . if a medical student just learn the fact about human body and donot understand it , he can do big mistake and it will be a question of life and death . if he ha not understood human body and just learned the fact , whenever he will find a slightly differnt disease , he will not be able to prescribe any medicine . because he might couldnot have learnt the desease exactly the same way . but by understanding he can make out that it is just a slight different menefestation of the same desease . thus in the light of above mentioned example it can be safely said that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
