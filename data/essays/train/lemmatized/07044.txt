i agree that it is very important for student to understand idea and cocepts a well a to learn fact . they both compliment each other . it is crucial in a student to understand idea , a well a concept . if student do n't understand the cocepts , they wo n't learn them . when student know the cocepts because they understood it , they wo n't forget them . by understanding the idea and concept , the student have the capacity and the ability to explain to others what they know and the area that they dominate . also , student that understand topic , have more chance of getting good grade in test , becaus they can give more fact an example of what they understood in class . that is why it is so important for teacher to explain with example and to give fact and make good point , so that the student can understand the area that they are studying completely . teachers should make question to see if all the class comprehended the point that they were trying to enphasize . when student understand the idea and cocepts the will have better result in their exam a well a presentation , report and other assigments . also they will have the capacity to help others that do n't understand the area . for student is also important to learn fact because before they understand the concept an idea they have to learn the fact of the subject . by learnig the fact they learn the reason why something happened , where something happened , why something happened and who made it happened . facts are also really important , and teacher teach the fact so that the student learn them and understand it . learning the fact make student know everything about a topic or a subject . after the student have learned fact and understood the cocepts and idea of a subject , they can have great result in their test , and in addition , achieve many goal in their carreers .
