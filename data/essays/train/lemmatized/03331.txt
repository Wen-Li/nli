i believe people become richer because they work so hard , people work hard they can get more oppotunities , not only they try new thing , they must do a lot research about how to lower the risk . to set up a big company not a easy thing , a successful people in charge of all of the empolyee , all the bos had in his head are how to lower a risk , because if the bos can deal with the company , the empolyees might lose their job , the guy might not become a successful people . people only focuse on what the successful people did , and forget to concentrate on what the people managing or marketing . a successful engineer do a research for long time , but they must study about engineering since he wa in junior high school , but people only remember he created a new technique , even though people want to try new thing , they still need a lot knowledge and experience . we can not only think about how much money the poeple earned , why they got a lot complement , we should start think about how much time they spend . in addtion , much people take risk to do their own business , they still can earned lot of money , become a famous person , but if they can not control the risk , they might fail in one day . lucky are not still with the same person . in concludsion , successful people know how to do well because they spend a lot time , maybe they still get experience from failure , they learned many thing before they successed .
