nowadays , the development of communication make the working at home possible . that might be a reason that some people say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , i disagree with it . the reason will be shown in the following . modern people regard private life a important . in other word , they love to enjoy life , and car is necessary to do so . in my parent 's generation , it wa common to buy home earlier than car . however , people of my generation tend to buy car first when they get job . therefore , the number of car in twenty year will not decrease . in addition , there will be enough energy to spend in the future . although there are not enough fuel in land , there are still huge oil and gas in the ocean . moreover , the automobile that can be operated by electric energy wa invented . it is just being advanced to be used by people . finally , there are many country that are still developing . for example , china , the country in which a major population of the world is living , is developing dramatically . it is necessary that the number of car in china will increase . in addition , there are many country that are developing like china : india , russia , brazil , etc . in conclusion , the number of car will not decrease in twenty year . the importance of private life is increasing , and there are enough fuel and many developing country . for these reason , i believe that there will be more car in use in the future .
