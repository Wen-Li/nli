nowadays young people are very busy with everything that is going on out there in the world . technology is one of the most important thing that is making them busy , such a internet , video game , television and alot more . it seems to be that they spend so mush time playing and using these thing without knowing how much time they are wasting . you see them play video game for hour , but do nothing for their community . there are so much to do and so much to give but ignorance is the problem . children must be tought in school how to help and give , but the first place to learn that is at home . parents doe n't know the importance of teaching their child how to help with their communites . children should do charity work and they also should help poor people and people with physical and mental disability . parents should plant in them the beauty of giving , helping and caring . also teenager , they should learn that to . now all they care about is what to wear and where to go and whats new in fashion . i know they are teenager and they should live their age but this doesnt hold them from helping their community . there are so many stuff to do for their community especialy her in saudi arabia . so i strongly agree with the statment . i think that we should take this problem more serious because the way young people are now is not the way we want them to be n the future . a a start i will talk to many people i know who can help me in this case and hopefully i will make a change in my community and i am sure that many child and young people will respond if we talk to them the rght way .
