attitudes towards the behaviour of young people of not having enough time nowadays for helping their community vary from community to community . i think that young people spend equally the same time a before except that their effort are not highlighted a they get out-numbered . previously within every commuinity a small number of people used to be there offering service thereby substantiating that with the increase in population the number of youngster have increased and their effort are cnot realized let take example of community service programme which are organised by the school and in some school it becomes a mandatory part of the curriculum this prof a great part of the student body participating in the community service apart from this we see student collecting fund every month for the maintainance of the of the community . most of the member of the community center are young individual obviously we can not expect every student to give in the same kind of effort in this area with the growing complexity in the student life the student eventually land up compromising on the time for the community work during exam but eventually compensate on this lost time by organising camp during their work therefore it would be wrong on our part to undermine their effort a mentioned before the form in which help is being given by them varies . perhaps the student might not be channelized in their effort to helping their community they need to be more organized in their approach . help can again vary informs some people dont offer help unless they are asked for it others however are generally helpful and offer help if need be even when they are not asked for it . for example an old lady crossing the road might be helped by an individual even without asking for it whereas others would normally wait for the lady to ask for help a they are hesitant in offering it a they think it might go unwelcomed fearing the senility of the lady i think today youngster are well aware of the responsiblities that are levied on them . its just the perspective of seeing thing that creates the difference . the young are aware that they are the president , doctor etc of toommorow and hence are actively participating in offering their service it just that we need to start appreciating their work .
