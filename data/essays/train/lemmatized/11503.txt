the idea that , it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than learning fact is not correct actually . the student should be objectively tought of the realistic event ond fact . then try to develop some opinion of their own . this method should be applied to their whole life in order to eliminate some problem . first , the idea and concept inevitably change from one person to other . they of course need to understand what other people think about a given topic or specific event . however , in order not to admit one person 's opinion without any septicist point of view , student must be given some factual explanation earlier . unless this is provided , they can not have their own opinion . the word they use would be somebody other 's . once this becomes a habit , they start to do this for their rest of life . htis is something very bad because they will never gain the characteristic of an individual of the society . second , not providing the student the fact , sometimes may couse some more serious problem . in many country some student are becoming part of the social tragedy . this is because they are not well educated in giving more importance to the reality . the reality is sometimes more diffirent than what it seems like . student should always try to investigate for the fact in order not to be pushed into such kind of problem . for short , student should always try to get the fact in their educational and social life . this never mean that idea and concept are not important . they have to arise their own idea with the help of the fact and then try to criticise other 's opinion . they should later decide to accept them or not .
