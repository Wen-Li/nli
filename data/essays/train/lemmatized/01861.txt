a broad knowledge is very important in human being because it permit to have a general background off many thing that involve our life . in my opinion a broad knowledge should be the first thing that we have to reach . after this , we can specialize in the specific subjet that we prefer . i also think that we ca n't choose our way without knowing several subject , because it is very difficult to know what we like whitout trying it . this is also the way that the school is organized . during our first year of school we study general theme such a history , literature , mathematics etc. that give u a wide formation . when we continue our study we more and more specialize in a subject . in fact at university there are a lot of specific subject and lack of general one . i think that this is well done because today the job are very specialized and industry for example need specialized people to reach some important project . i can give an example of my university : i study engineering and in i saw that a project always involves a lot of aspect of studying , so it 's very important another important point is that today 's work is often organized in team composed by various specialized people . these team can surely do something more because anyone give his better quality . but we can forget that the general thing learnt in first year of school form u like men outside the job . a general known is important in everyday life . in conclusion i think that is very important have a broad knowledge of many acadenic subject but this have to be the start point for specialize in what we love . and first of all we always have to remember that we will never finish to learn !
