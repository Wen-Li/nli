have you ever been on a bus when suddenly an old woman get in it and nobody offered their seat ? i guess that every one who ha seen it , at least one time in their life , will agree with me when i say that nowadays young people doe n't care about helping their community . rigth now it is not a normal thing to help old people to cross the street , or to offer them your seat in the bus . when i wa at school , i used to go to the local hospital for working like a voluntier . i really loved ! my dutties were to take care of some kid while the cleaner worked on their room . i spendt four hour a week playing with different kid . it wa n't a hard work for me , and it wa a very usefull activitty for my community . i think everyone should try to help their community , due to the fact that they will be able to have fun an at the same time make an excellent job to help other people . because all of this they may also feel better with themselves however , what it 's true is that in the 21th century 's young people normally ha a lot do . for example is pretty common for teenager to work during the year , or to play different sport . maybe those are the reason , but maybe what happen is that young people is becoming very selfish . if they have time to hang out with their friend i 'm sure they can also find time to help their community . not to much time is requiered . you can make a lot with a \ only a few hour a week . in conclusion , nowadays young people do n't give too much time to helping their community , actually they do nothing for their community , and this is very sad . i think school should have kind of a subject to show kid how to help others and how to be involved in their community .
