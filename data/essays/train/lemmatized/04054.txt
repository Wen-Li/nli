i agree with that fact the most advertisement product seem much better than they really are . it ha to be that way , would you want to buy anything that doe n't look good or seems not useful ? like it say , it 's `` advertising '' . for example , the m'c donald 's big mac seems really big , yummy , and tasty but the real big mac is n't really that big a showing a an advertising . they just put more stuff to make it look bigger and use frash ingrediants for the advertising . if it doe n't seem like that big and tasty , people wo n't want to eat . it 's all about the advertising that people want to eat and buy thing . and also , i think the better advertising satisfy people 's mind . for example , on the car advertising , who doe n't want to buy nice mercedes or bmw ? but all the poeple ca n't afford them . when you look at the honda civic 's advertising , it look fancy a mercedes , too . you know it 's not that fancy or nice a them but you just look at the advertising and satisfy yourself . the advertising us certain place , model , concept , lighting , and ect , to make the product look better . on the clothing advertising , someone who extreamly georgous model wearing silk coctail dress , you would want to buy it . that 's what model are for . in conclusion , the adversitings are not lying but it just ha to be look good . that 's what advertising are for .
