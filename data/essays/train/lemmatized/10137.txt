i believe that both thsese point are important at certain level of study . if a person is going through his postgraduation or phd study . he should be more specific towards his subject and intrerest . while during undergraduation study , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . while studying in undergraduate program , we should have knowledge of many academic subject . it help u to immply that knowledge in our specialization subject . i have completed my bpharm . in this under graduate program i studied all the subject like pharmaceutical analysis , pharmaceutic , pharmacology and biopharmaceutics . now i am planning to do my master in pharmaceutic subject . and these other subject will help me in any instance . because basically they all are related with research . pharmaceutics is related with new drug research but pharmacology deal with the effect of the drug on human body . so there is one kind of interdepandability present between other subject and specialized subject . now if we think about master and phd program . it is neccesary to choose one specific subject . it is better to gain deep knowledge in specific subject if your aim is towards research and developement . without the depth knowledge of subject , it is not possible to make our carrier in research . at this level of study we are given special training for work . if we take the example of doctor . the only doctor and surgeon with the master degree in chemotherapy can cure the patient from cancer , which is not possible for the general practitioner . doctors with specialization in anesthesia in medical field ha decreased the death and and coma case , which used to occure due to improper introduction of anesthesia . if we take another example of proffesors . the proffesor in history subject cant give knowledge about the mathemics subject . so i believe that the both kind of knowledge is required at different level of study . both have important at different level of study .
