the gap between young and old people is a kind of discrimination , which effect are increasing in our modern society . recently , the drought in france revealed a critical issue , by causing the death of old and lonely people . although explanation can be found to justify this statement , i believe that only the physical body is getting older while the soul could last ever . if we tend to define what is enjoying life , people would try to record happy memory . young people carry project and dream about conquest . the old people have the nostalgy of their youth and will help justify such a statement . being young is the time for first time and it happens once . .. categorizations are dangerous . what happens after the limit is crossed ? when doe a person begin to be unhappy ? after a certain time they are put outside of society : loss of a professionnal status , difficulty created due to medical care need . other culture , put the old people on the top of a pyramidal hierarchy in a society , ours could soon bring a a conclusion , that if being old is being unhappy , we could shorten life by euthanasy . unhappy old people is the easy answer to the fear of getting old and to death .
