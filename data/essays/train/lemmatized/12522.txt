enjoing life is not related to the age of the person but on the interst of the person . many young and old people enjoy their life but in different way . now adays many young and old poeple enjoing their life because of the avaliability of many facility like tranning center , theater , golfe course , libaries , shoping center and ect which is located every where and it is open all the day . so regardless of the age people could schadual their time according to their daily commetments and enjoy these place . young poeple enjoy the new technology more than the old poeple because they have more knowledege and more intrest in this kind of life style . for example , my child enjoy playing vidio game and watching movie and tchating in the internet with their friend and when i discus it with them they use to say that this is our time and this technology developed during our time and we have to enjoy it . on the other hand i dont enjoy playing vedio game and watching movie every week or even every second week because i do not have the interst in these kind of thing . students in the university and collage travel more than the old people and they want to explore many thing . some time they stop their course in the university and travel to different part of the world to enjoy their life . i think enjoing of life have nothing to do with age but it dependes on the person 's interst and what life enjoenment mean to him .
