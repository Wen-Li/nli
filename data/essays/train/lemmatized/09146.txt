from my point of view it is real that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . this is a strategy that is usually used in marketing to encrease the market of a particular product . the goal of this strategy is to give the idea that a product is really useful , and so it is introduced it in the daily reality , making it a common product . an example of it can be seen in the use of cellphone . it is real that they are really useful : with them you can call everyone everywhere . but in the present day they are loosing their original function of phone becoming an object of fashion among the teenager . so you can find everyday a cellphone that is better than another one that wa selled yesterday only because it ha some new unuseful function . another example is that of the ritch car . they have some accessory that are not really necessary , whose purpose is sometimes only to transform a car in a sort of mobile house . in this case the situation is somehow different from that of the cellphone , because the ritch car simbolize a sort of status simbol . so the point of the question is that the advertisement on the car make you dream of a product that is not useful like a normal car . in my opinion everyone would have a ferrari , but only because it is a status symbol , and not a car that can be used in the daily life ( it is not designed to go on city street , ot to go at the supermarket ! ) . in my way of thinking most advertisement are usually made on product that are not really useful but that only represent a fashion ( this is to say something that will be used only for some time ) or that represent object unreacheble . but thanks of these property these type of product seems much better than they really are , and have a great market .
