i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . for the argument , i would borrow the traditional definition of `` community '' a a group of people following a unique set of custom and practice which are visible in their general conduct , festival and lifestyle . `` helping the community '' , hence , should mean endorsing and spreading the belief of one 's community in the society and also , specifically helping member of one 's own community only . the world is fast moving towards a knowledge based society where boundary of community are becoming ever more blurred and diffused . in this well-connected world of today , external influence on mindset and culture are large and the concept of working for one 's community is disappearing fast in the young generation of today . apart from this , we are now living in a highly competetive world where available time determines success ; young people of today are not in a position to earmark sufficient time to devote to their community ' cause , else they would lag behind their peer . time crunch in general is a reson for the fact that people do not give time to their community . as for the point of helping one 's own community people over others , the youth today are more aware of the concept of `` global fraternity '' and of the total time a person spends in helping the society , it is natural that his community would recieve only a part which the latter may well deem a `` insufficient '' . in fact , i consider this trend of pushing community notion to the backburner a healthy one since afterall , the notion of community is a major cause of fueds and belligerence in the society today .
