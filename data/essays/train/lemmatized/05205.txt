i totally agree with the following statement . first of all , if you are someone who take risk , you are someone who like challenge , who are not affraid to experiment . from my point of new , it 's a main quality if you have project and want to be successful in them . for example , if you have a new concept for a business project , you take the risk your project wo n't work , but you also can be really amazed if it work : coming up with a new concept for project that work mean that you succeed in doing something new . in other word , beside the fact your project worked , you have a personal success feeling . also , people who come up with business idea ( for example some kind of restaurant such a the first fast food , the first bar where you can read while drinking a coffee . .. ) took the risk to give all of them and ending with nothing . but they tried , they believed in a new project and they finally succeeded so much that they became rich and also could , in the case of restaurant do franchising and extend what became a chain restaurant all over the world . however , some people prefer to keep doing what they already know to do , they do n't feel taking risk trying something new that may not work . this kind of people prefers the security , and i totally understand this feeling but from my point of view , if you keep doing what you know , you can end laking of confidence and be afraid of changing your life : keeping the same job and not trying to have a higher position , going to the same place not to risk to be desappointed by another place ( i 'm talking for example about a restaurant or your holiday destination ) . in conclusion , even if i understand the feeling of being secure , i do n't think this kind of people can be successful . so , from my point of view , the more you take risk , the more chance you have to succeed in your life
