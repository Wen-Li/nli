folowing the statement that `` the best way to travel is witha tour guide '' , i strongly disagree with the idea . i think the idea of traveling with a guide take all the charm and the adventure of the trip , also the guide are use to show only the most common ting on a tour , so many small and detailed thing get out of context . additionally , the idea of a tour guide represent a timed and rushy tour . initially , the idea of a tour is to take adventure or to just enjoy the beauty of itself . the idea of having a person telling you what to do or to read take my idea of a tour in other direction . i think a trip is meant to be enjoyed and a well to be shared with people you like . therefore , a guide would not only represent a person who you are not bind to but also someone who eventually will become a obstacle in your tour . then in order to enjor the charm of a trip is better to do it by oneself . next , guide are trained to take you to the place evreyone go or are the most common place , so in order to see more new exitement on a trip , you have to take your own baton . i remember the time i went to some island in my country , where the guide always took u to place that every one see on television or the museum . however , when i left without the guide , i meet more people and discovered place that not even the guide know . finally , i think the biggest problem with guide is the time . because they have to cover an schedule , you have to move to their pace and you can not admire what you want with your own time . i think it is better to enjoy one single moment that visit hundred without even taking a time to enjoy or relax . i strongly believe that a person should n't be attached to time in a trip because it take away the real meaning of a tour , relax . to conclude , i think the best way to make a tour is to do it by themselves . the big bussines of tour guide have destroy the beauty of the tour in many way and finally make it unplesant on some occasion .
