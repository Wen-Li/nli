i totally agree with the opinion that successful people tend to take risk . in deed , doing just ordinary thing is stable . at the same time , however , it 's not inspire the next . i suppose that if people do n't take any risk , they feel bored and have limit to more success . my grand father could success his job . he did a lot of thing in his job . at first , he started chinese restaurant . as soon a this is success , he started opening another restaurant which is forcused on beer . in my grand father 's era , beer is not a popular a now . he rialized this situation . then he opend his another restaurant called `` beer garden '' . actually he wa not first person who started beer garden , but his second restaurant wa more success than first chinese restaurant . i think he could success for the following reason . he did not feel risky at all , when he established his new business . whereas it seems that he wa glad to start new thing . it is important that doing new thing is glad to .
