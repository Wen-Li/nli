in business , it is said that `` change is the only constant '' . through out history , example abound where civilization have fallen due to lack of change . this applies equally to people and organization . without a periodic renewal in the way thing are done , there is a tendancy to stagnate and in certain case , deteriorate . i agree with the statement that successful people do take risk and venture out into new avenue , rather than doing repetitive task . i would add a supporting assumption that the successful people base their work on certain core and fundamental principle that can be applied across various domain . these principle include work ethic , moral value and judgement along with business and technical fundamental . apple computer 's ceo steve jobs is a prime example of a successful risk taker . instead of letting his upheaval from apple during the 1990s shatter him , he started a new company next , which wa subsequently acquired back by apple . in parallel , he started pixar animation , which is a completely different stream from what he wa used to doing . now , both pixar , with it animation movie , and apple , with it ipod , macintosh computers , are immensely successful company with steve jobs at their helm . at the heart of his success lie the drive to do new thing and doing the new task well instead of sticking with only doing one thing well . a similar example is that of lee iacoca with his time in chrysler and ford . the same statement applies to every professional . in order to grow within an organization , it is not sufficient to just do one job . it is important to take that leap to the next level , which might be a big unknown , in order to show the capacity to grow to that next level and onward .
