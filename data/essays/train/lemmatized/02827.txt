i agree to that statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . the main area on which the resoning of this sentence depends on the difference between the `` young people '' now and in the previous day . i feel there is a change in the responsibility level of the young people from olden day to present . there is much burden on them now , either in away taking care of the entire family or being a bread winner for the family . this make them to spend most of the time in earning money . so the young people are restricted in taking care and heliping their own family . the community form a group of family which in turn becomes difficult to takecare and provide help a he ha been fully bundled with his own family . in olden day young people are doing more of charity work and help other people and are le selifish . so they spent time in helping the poor and the people who are lacking in few thing with whatever they have . for example the person who is good at study ha put up center for educating the illeterates which is profit free organization . helping others wa prevalent in most of the young people in those day which inturn helped the community . but in the present day we see no caring attitide in the young people for the others in the community . as cited above there will be long barrier between each family in order to help each other because of selfishness , no caring attitude , egoism etc . for example the rich are becoming richer and the poor are becoming poorer . i feel that invloving in community activity is always better . the policy should be help yourself and help others . so that once we are done with taking care of our need , family need and if some time is present we can use it effectively by helping the other community people . we can understand their problem and provide a feasible solution to those . we can always indulge ourselves in the charity organization children rilied fund and red cross and many more with in our limit and help the world to be a better place . in doing so one will emerge out a a great person in his life and will encourage others with the same .
