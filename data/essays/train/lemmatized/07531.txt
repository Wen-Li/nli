i disagree with this statement . i think that young people nowadays have a lot more responsibility and many more thing to do besides school than they used to have twenty year ago . back then , pupil used to go come home , do their homework and then help their family doing housework , watching their little sibling or helping neighbour cutting the gras . nowadays , parent expect more from their child . they want them to be successful in sport , playing an instrument , or spelling competition . so i think , it all depends on what the parens expect their child to do . there are parent , who do n't make or let their child join activity group besides school , and others who make their child take part in more activity and competition than they want . thats why many young people do n't have the time to help their community , even though some of them would like to do that . there are many young people who are too buisy to help their community , because they 're put under pressure to be magnificent at school , graduate from college and get their doctor degree a fast a possible , which did n't always use to be like that . only rich parent could afford to give their kid a higher education , make them play one or even more instrument and offer them activity besides school , because they had enough money , to hire people , who cleaned their house , cooked their meal and watched their kid . in spite of that , poorer family could not afford that , so after the basic school education , young people had to work and support their community a much a possible . it 's all up to parent and the environment young people grow up in . some young people might still find enough time to help , after all the dancing class , gu
