nowadays , the world is moving at such a fast pace that it would be very difficult for me to agree or disagree on whether car can become fewer , since i ca n't predict what kind of turn the future can take . so many technology and various invention are taking place that it is definately possible for the car to be fewer in another twenty year . cars have become such a necessity in our daily life that , i feel that car could probably never cease to be fewer a life go on . cars have brought such a big impact on our life that it would be impossible to think of a life without car and basic transportation . cars are our way of life - a necessity , which we on any given circumstance ca n't live without . our life , thesedays , revolves around going from one place to another , transporting good and other facility and other various activity connected with transportation . to think that twenty year from now there could be fewer car on our road , than there are today is not impossible , it is definately a possibility a the world is progressing and coming up with so much newer and varied form of technology and idea . it would definately be a big misinterpretation of the fact - that the world is n't moving on , if i would say that car can not be replaced by something much more sophisticated and efficient for our daily life . in today 's world , nothing is impossible . there is always a possibility for the human mind to come up with anything impossible . so coming up with a replacement mode of transportation would n't be too diffcult . therefore , i would say , that maybe not twenty year from now , but definately somewhere in the future there will be a good and efficient replacement for our car , thus resulting in fewer car on our road .
