in our modern society car are used a lot and most of the people ca n't manage to live without them . i , however , agree with the statement and believe that car will be le used in twenty year than they are today . on one hand it could be inferred that the number of car will increase , because we have a very big car market nowadays . more beautiful and technological car are offered every day and the people are drawn to buy them . furthermore , also young people are encouraged to buy them because this way they can feel independent and free . on the other hand , however , car are beeing replaced more and more often by other mean of transportation such a bycicles and motobycicles . in my native country , italy , city are becoming very crowded and it is inconvinient to use a car , because of the traffic and the difficulty of finding a parking place . therefore people try to avoid picking up the car in the morning and prefer to use other mean . there are a lot of transport service offered for people nowadays , even for those who live or work far away . metros , busus and train are often used also because it cost le than buying a car . even though , the market tempts u to buy car advertising and promoting them in the most various way , i believe that there will be fewer car in twenty year than nowadays . in fact , i noticed that the mean of transportation and communication are getting better day by day , encouraging people not to use the car . it would be only a waste of time and money . additionally , people are becoming more sensitive in what concern our environment : driving a car pollutes the air and ruin the place we are living in .
