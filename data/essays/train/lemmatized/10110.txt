through today 's environment situation , i really hope that there are fewer and fewer car used in twenty year , because the car do pollute the air , but i think it may wo n't be true , there will be more car in use in 20 year . the first reason i want to say is , because of the economics . we know that in indurstry today , a world factury ha been built , and a a car , maybe the part of it come from many country . in 20 year , some country may develop it 's economics just by indurstry , and play an important part in the world factury . of course car-making is one of the most important making by the world factury , so the number of car wo n't decrease . second , a we know that in many country , car are vrey popula . in u.s. , for an example , even each family ha a car , but we should know that such a us , or germany , all of these country are developed country , and there are many developing or y developed country , the people in these country may do want to have a car . i have a chinese friend , he ever told me that , his parent have saved moneny for some year in order to buy a car . so it can easily show that in some courntries , to have a car is still the person ' in those courntries dream . what 's more , a the science developing faster and faster , maybe in 20 year , there will be the car that use electricity to get power , or other thing , just in order not to pollute the air , and also maybe there will be the car that fly in air , drive in the water , just like the car in many movie . so in a word , i think in 20 year , there wo n't be fewer car in use . in opposite , maybe even more and more car will be used , of course the car on that day are clean car . to say something more , if in 20 year , there are car just like i mentioned in the article which can drive both in the air and the water , i will book one .
