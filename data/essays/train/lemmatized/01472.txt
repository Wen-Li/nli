from school to the labor world , hu ; an people have many occasion to learn and learn more . then , people take time to continue discovering thing , like science , technology , geography , culture . .. all around u is there an occasion of learning more . some people prefers learning about only one thing : language , movie , history and so on and closing their eye on the rest of the world . is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject ? that 's the question . .. academic subject are related with general knowledge : from what we learned at school to the latest news on tv , we will be able to discus about the fact of a problem . as mr wilde said [ if i well remember ] , there are 3 kind of people : those who speaks about people , other who talk about fact , and finally people who discus the idea . the specialized person is able to speak , to explain the birth of the problem , the fact , the risk , the advantage and the drawback . but his capacity to know and to speak will be limited to some specific subject . otherwise , having academic knowledge is something long : there are a lot of thing to learn , from stranger language to finance , between musicology and archeology . is it really possible ? knowing everything about a subject is something possible : everybody ha a passion and wanted to know the most of thing about this topic . a musician want to improve his science by hearing music , learning to define the style , to increase the technic and will automatically become specialized in this subject . and it 's the same for a person who like it job : after maybe 25 year in the same branch , people have experience and specific knowledge . i think that a specific knowledge do not depends on a specifc willing , instead of the knowledge of many academic subject , which one is the result of a lot of work .
