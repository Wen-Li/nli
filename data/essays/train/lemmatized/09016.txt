i strongly disagree with this statement , a i do not see why it would be correct . it contains no arguements to support it claim . young people do give enough time to helping their community nowadays , a they always have . i do not see the reason for elder to belive in this statement , or to view our youth in a critical manner . yes , the youth might be somewhat different than the generation of people they grew up in , but it doe not need to be different in a negative way . their criticism merely demonstrates their inability to take responsibility or to adapt to recent event , which would bring about a difference in mentality in the next generation . most probably people making such a statement are not satisfied with their own contribution to their community and will try to ease their mind by making such a claim . often pensioneers who have nothing better to do , i.e. make no contribution to their community , make such a claim . this statement is in no way a constructive statement , a it give no suggestion of changing the circumstancers . therefore the person putting forth this statement is not helping his community in doing so . this statement is so broad , that it is hard for me to think of any specific example out of my head , but in general , the young people are the people which drive a community and contribute to it culture by their motivation . this claim is nonsense . it ha no arguements to support it and is terribly broad . the people who are supporting the community and who are to a large extent the community , by being active , are to a very large extent young people . this statement is often the result of an elder , not being able to adapt to recent change in the world , and therefore not being able to understand the youth .
