taking risk to be more successful or keeping the current success level not to fall down , not changing their business style is crutial question to business leader . i strongly agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , in a business world , self-achievement is considered the most effecitve faactors to motivate wokers . setting their own goal by themselves , planning to achieve the goal , and ass their achievement by themselves is done by the worker . if the assessment is enough for the bos to approve , the worker can promote . in the world famous car company toyota , this system work well . it will cultivate worker ' enegy toward their working and produce a lot of suceessful people . second , being creative the key to success . sometimes cocnservative people want to keep the current style , especially if their business is going well . howver , the time and the world are changing . today 's novelty is not attracitve next year in some business foield . being brave to make a decision to create a new plan based on analytical thought and precise reserach of the market will lead to the real success . when these theory is accepted , worker have no doubt to be successful themselves . third , cooperation is also key to be successful . if the company keep the current business , everyboday can do his job individually . however , once the company decides to challenge a new project , relationship in a team is the essential . cooeration is necessary . as i mentioned above , in either a the individual or the company , trying a new thing amd taing risk will challengin and bring some effect . i agree only people who are brave to challenge can be successful .
