travelling is an activity that most individual enjoy , may it be for it adventurous quality , innate curiosity for the unknown or the joy of simply having a relaxing vacation . this lead to the next question : is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide ? personally , i believe the response to this question depends on the individual , his or her expectation and above all , the opportunity cost that this person is willing to take . travelling with a tour guide can imply a series of opportunity cost that some people are unaware of , such a the beauty of the adventure and the immersion in the culture . on one side , travelling with a tour guide ha it pro . for instance , if there is a limited time to travel this can be efficient , le expensive and in essence the most importante place will be visited . there is no uncertainty a to where to go , what to do or how to plan the day . it simply is relaxing and enjoying your time . however , there are a series of opportunity cost inherent in this decision . for starter , who say that the tour guide will be fun ? a couple month ago i travelled to macchu picchu with two friend ; we backpacked . it wa an amazing experience because the spontaneity , the adventurous nature of the experience and above all the liberty to do what we wanted wa truly priceless . not only did we meet a series of traveller along the way , but we also got to immerse ourselves in the culture . i have to say this ha been one of the best trip i have taken in my life ; i would truly recommend anyone to be brave , take a risk and enjoy the beauty of true travel . from personal experience i have to say that travelling without a tour guide is the best way to go . it is important to go informed , but even the getting lost and not knowing where to go form part of the magical experience of travel .
