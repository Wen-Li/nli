i think it is very possible to be decreased the number of car or vehicle in the very near future . nowadays , number of the car increase especially in big city day by day . our life become harder and harder while this number increasing . people spend their hour on road just to be able to get to their office or school . tranportation can easily be a chaos . on the other hand energy resource are limited to supply energy for the unlimited number of car . excessive number of car also cause air pollution which is a big problem . scientist are also trying to develop alternative way for supplying energy such a car run with solar energy . but energy supply will remain an important problem a long a new car are produced . dozens of new car enter to traffic each day . but this can not be unlimited . even for today , people have begun to find effective way of transportation . these alternative way can be public transportation , subway or motorcycle . according to my observation most of the people prefer public transportation instead of using their own car . i think people will have to stop using car in the future even if they do n't prefer . because natural condition wo n't let them pollute the environment so much . maybe , it will be too late for taking this decision . there is no resource in the world that we can use unlimitedly . with the rapid improvement on technology , some genius solution can be found . maybe , we wo n't need car in the future and return our nature .
