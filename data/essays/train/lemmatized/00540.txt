i have two opinion on this question that i will developp . firstly , i think that it can be possible that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today . in fact , today we have an important life problem which is the ecologic problem . as the climate is changing and the earth is warming , a lot of person consider , nowadays , that car pollute and to put an end to the warming process , we have to use no polluted vehicules like bicycle , ... this kind of mentality is more current in the north of europe ( sweden , finland , ... ) . in those country , they use already le car than a few year ago and prefer using bus or others public transport . moreover , in france , we can notice that the cost of the petrol is very important and we arrive to a point that we can say that it 's a luxe to have a car a the petrol is expensive . we can imagine if nothing happens that people will developp the north mentality and apply it , to make benefit or just economy . and deffacto , the car number will decrease . but in an other part i think that it 's not possible that in twenty year there will be le car than today . in fact , i imagine that from today to 2026 car wo n't work with petrol but i hope with hydrogen , water or electricity or sun light which will permit to resolve the ecolicic problem we have to face on . changing the mod of carburation will permit to have a somethimng cheaper than the petrol so consequently , there will be more car in twenty year . finally we have to reppear that in twenty year , there will be more than 7 trillion people on earth so normally the car number on earth will growing .
