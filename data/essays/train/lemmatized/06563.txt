i do not agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . traveling is very personal and inter-personal experience . first , when we are traveling , we are departed from all that surrounded u in ordinary life . we meet different kind of people , nature and culture from what we 've accostomed . and the experience reflecet who i am , and who i have been . this kind of experience is so personal innately that a guided tour in a group can not give the essential . when we travel in a group by a tour guide , we can not determine even to leave or stay more at the place by ourselves . we can not imagine other alternative to guided by our heart 's going . second , if we expect something more in travelling than just sightseeing , we should meet the culture and people with landscape . you can say that a group tour is better to know more people each other . i can get friend who travel with me by group , but the people who travel with me by group are likely have the same kind of culture and environment of me . we usually live by one 's own view and sight and the view of value and world doe not change just a time go by . different and external stimulus can infulence our mind and behavior more significantly . guided-tours have traditionally too tight schedule to respond with the external environment or to communicate with people who live the tour place . in my opinion , the best way to travel is to travel alone or with someone who can share the personal and independent experience .
