given a choice between agreeing or disagreeing the young people do not given enough time to helping their community . many people maybe agree this topic . however , i wa totally disagree on this topic , and i have three point on it . young people will make their time to do more interesting thing that they like , helping community is a rule that every day and every minute should do , communities wa the person who live there and not only young people should care . firstly , young people will make their time to do more interesting thing that they like . for a example , young people play with their friend and they also know about where to play and which wa the best time or place . they care about their community , if there is no play give them play . they not only make friend , but also can help community . secondly , helping community is a rule that every day and every minute should do . for a instance , everyday we go to school , we might see our community what happens ? or what interest ? if in community who need to our help that we can call neighborhood to help them . it 's not cost a lot of time for u to help our community . finially , community wa the person who live there , not only young people should care . for a example , old people , young people and childrens are all living in this community . if some one need a help , not only young can help this person , old people also can help them with this time . it ' s kind of experience question on it . in a word , i wa disagree on this the young people do not given enough time to helping their community , because of young people will make their time to do more interesting thing that they like , helping community is a rule that every day and every minute should do and community wa the person who live there , not only young people should care .
