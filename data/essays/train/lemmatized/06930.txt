i do agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today despite the rapid increase of car consumption . my reason to believe so are stated below . first of all , more and more people are willing to take mass transportation to go to work nowadays than a few year ago . because the traffic jam is more and more serious , people living in the city prefer to take bus and subway to go to work to avoid such heavy traffic jam . with the scarce of resource this problem might not be solved in year . what 's more , to ride in mass transportation save people valuable time to do other productive thing . beside riding on mass transportation give city people more time to relax and think for their life on their way home and to work . secondly , government all over the world are becoming more aware of the pollution car bring . some government even set up rule to ban certain car to run in the city during paticular time . such rule forbiding the use of certain car will continue to effect in the long run . this will help to reduce the use of car gradually . thirdly , people today are more concerned with their own health than ever . some may even walk to work or ride a bike to work instead of driving a car . on weekend , more people go biking instead of go driving to rural resort to relax . taking the popular biking club for example , they are developing quite rapidly to support the idea a lot of people are holding today that it 's better to travel along with physical exercise . these kind of change help me to belief that there will be fewer car in the future . in spite of all the above , the rapidly developed mass tranportation system and the widely accepted concept that health is most important in one 's life both add up to my belief that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to sum up , with the widely spreading concept of maintaining good health , the utility of advanced mass transportation and the help of the govenment , there will be fewer car in 20 year use than there are today .
