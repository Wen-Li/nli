yes i agree to this statement . successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what already know how to do well . by trying new thing and doing it by own we can develop self - confindence upon u and by doing such thing we can remember well what we had done and we can not forget it . it brings more self-confidence , ability , attitude towards the subject . for an example i can say about great scientist like newton , einstein etc . firstly newton nor we doest know about gravitational force which wa happening around u then he wa the person who thinked about falling of the apple and what made it fall . by doing vigorous research on that concept he came to know that there is a force which is pulling the object downwards that wa known a gravitational force . people from then came to know about the gravitational force and had done many experiment on that . that state that successful people try new thing and take risk in which they feel very satisfied . for another example we can talk about child , they doest'nt know anything and they doest'nt leave anything in my view . so they doest'nt know whether it is going to harm them or make them feel happy . they do the thing they never let it go and if they feel happy they will enjoy . by doing the thing what they already know will have no enthusiasm , anxiety , intrest , on the subject . as we already know about the subject we doest'nt take much care on it nor concentration . that 's why i can say that there 's great satisfaction by tring new thing and if we achieve them . if we can not achive them we should not feel discouraged by ourselfes and come to know about it and copmlete it successfully . in my view not only successful people everyone should try for the new invention and try for it till they achieve , if we take risk only then we can come out of flying color in our life .
