i do n't think young people enjoy life more than older people do . usually , when we think to younger people , we imagine them in their life cycle span of adolescence and early maturity . in this period of life most of them do n't work , they are economically maintend by family and they study at school and university . being a student offer the chance to know a lot of people , make new friend and increase possibility to find a partner ; so young people have a lot of social interaction . with all this mate they explore the world and live new experience almost every day , for example their first tour at night without the presence of parent , the first party with both male and female , the first love , new strong emotion and feeling ; their mood vary continually and make their life full of excitment . looks that youth is best part of life but , personally i think it is n't so for two reason . the first because youth is also the most turbulent period of the entire life . all the biological change make the adolescent so insicure and from a psychological point of view he is so fragile . young people do n't only enjoy party and free time but they also suffer a lot . frustrations , delusion , psychological complex lead the young to experiment a lot of pain . the other reason i think youth is n't the most funny period of life is because every part of life can be funny , every period is important and ha it specifical beauty , even senility . this statement could sound too much rethorical at a first glance but i think it 's true . older people have other possibilitie of entertainment that youngers do n't have . for example having a job and being retribuited can bring mature people to have much more money to spend for their hobby . and they are also more wise and they sometime know how to cope better with life adversity .
