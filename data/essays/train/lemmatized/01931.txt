like we have learned from the book entitled `` the end of history '' , in wich the author held the thesis that after the fall of berlin wall the history had come to an end , trying to make forecast on such a long period a 20 year is very dangerous , but i feel fair comfortable with saying that such a diffused mean of transportation a the car will not disappear in two decade , and even that the number of car will actually increase . the car is the engine of modern economy , because it allows fast travel , which in turn mean that people with the right knowledge or skill can be quickly and easily collected in the place where they are needed , thus rendering easy both to use their existing knowledge and to build new . i am thinking about worker commuting to their job place or professor reaching university by car . public transport ha proved inable to be a full substitute of car in this role , and a new economic power like china and india emerge from poverty they will develop their car population a rich country have already done , and this process will take more than 20 year , in my opinion , so that the number of car will keep increasing over this period . of course my analisys can not foresee an eventual tecnological revolution that could render the car useless , like the car ha done with horse in the twentieth century , or a major economic breakdown which would render car too expensive to be useful , but such trend breaking event are unpredictable . if the actual trend of the world will hold , it can be asserted that it will take more than twenty year for the number of car to start decreasing , if it will ever do so .
