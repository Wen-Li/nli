as far a i am concerned , it is better to have broad knoledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . a student , in general , even if he ha the idea of what to do in his working future , not always his dream match with the real life . it can happen that the economic situation at the beginning of his study can be very different from the one at th end of his study . this can happen for several reason , such a polical , economic , and so on . if a student start to concentrate only on a specific subject , that can be for example , leterature , at the end of his study i will be very well educated on that subject , but in a world that is requiring people that have technological skill . it is important to say that a student that is involved in many academic subject will be able to mange all of it , but he will have always the possibility to specilize in one of them . i want to say that the best choise to do is to study many academic subject because it is always possible to specialize in one specific subject during the study period . on the other hand it is always more difficult to change it own study plan from a specific subject to many academic subject . only if a student ha the change to study different academic subject can also have the opportunity to discover his talent in subject that he did not know that he wa able to do . sometimes talent is hidden and only a good teacher can help student to reveal it . students , if they decide to study only a specific academic subject , will not give the chance to any professor to discover their talent . the italian university educational approach is based on many academic subject that can give student the opportunity to learn different topic also not linked from each one . only after the university , they can choose to specialize in one specific subject . i can see that italian student , in the end , are more prepared from usa student , these latter too specialized in only one subject and unable to face the real life so different and changable .
