in my country , the parent usually say to their child that you do n't have to do new thing for success , risking your life , but just do what you have done well so far . for me , however , successful people seem more creative and adventurous rather than conservative and tending to be safe . the world is relentlessly changing . without any change of one 's self , one can not come up with the change of the world , even if one already ha become successful . consequently , one will keep staying the past , and not be able to make an achievement meaningful for the present . in addition , if people only keep doing what they know how to do well , someone else will try to do what other people know how to do well , and he or she finally will become another master of it . after all , there will be no difference among them , and therefore be no new succeed for previous successful people . accordingly , in order that not only normal people become successful people but also already successful people keep up with their past succeed , they should make a new try . needless to say , already successful people have done like that , will do so for their future succeed . but , i do n't mean that the what people ha done before is not important so far . it can be great basis for new thing . so , it is also essential to respect what we have already done .
