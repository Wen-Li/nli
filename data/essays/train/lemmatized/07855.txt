i do agree with the point that there will be fewer car in use than there are today car which are useful in travelling is very common today a it is one of the greatest invention of the centuary . earlier it wa asl status symbol , but now a day almost every man who are doing job had a car . although car is very useful in many way the disadvantage it ha override the advantage . as it is one of the main cause for the pollution producing some hazardeous gas in the atmosphere . this make health problem to lot of people , people then realize that it is better to not to have car . nowadays car are one of the main cause of traffic chaos in main city , a survey tell that there are 100 car on road per every minute , if this situation continues there will be lot problem on earth causing global warming . today most people are educated and can understand the problem arising by the pollution . government and some other social organisation should take the responsibility to educate the people . goverment should pas some rule such a ` one car per home and if anyone having extra car have to pay some high tax ' , this type of step may reduce the usage of automobile . it is responsibility of every individual to protect the earth and in twenty year every person will be aware of this and will take care of his earth by reducing the over usage of automobile . in next twenty year there will be le usage of automobile . a the situation will demand every person to do so . otherwise there is danger for the mankind on earth . thus based on point that automobile such a car are causing a lot of damage to the environment , i think there will be fewer car in use than ther are now
