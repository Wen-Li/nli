there are no question that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . ther are tow major reason : my experience and famous study . to begin with , i used to use internet shopping mall because i thought that it could save time and energy . however , i spent more time and energy than i went shopping to store . when i bought somethings i relied on only advertisement . products always looked good in advertisement so i paid for that . however , when i recieved product i always disappointed . real product were very different from advertisement . as a result , i had to request money back . now i do not use internet shopping mall . moreover , according to the study , those who make product use computer and special thing to their product in order to look good . they say that people who buy their product do not realize different thing and even though they realize this the percent of money back is very low . since these reason those who make product try to look better in advertisement than real . in sum up with , according to the my experience and study , most advertisemensts make product semm much better than really are .
