although some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i do not agree with that . there are three reason for me to get this opinion . first , older people have much more experience than younger people because they are simply older . for example , when younger people make holiday in city they are often more interested in making party than to get to know more about the city and it cultural life . old people spend more of their time by learning something about the place where they make holiday . i think that older people see much more of a city when visiting it than younger people do because for me it is important to learn about the cultural life of the place where you in . furthermore , old people have much more time than younger people because they have seen much more in their life . in contrast , younger people are often interested in seeing much in a short period of time because in their view they have not seen enough yet . for instance , in most case older people take much more time when they visit a museum than younger people do . last , often old people have saved a lot of money while their time a employee . they have much more money to spend and they have not to attach importance on how to spend their money . in contrast , the younger people are at the beginning of their time a employee and so they have not earned much money that they could save yet . so they are not able to waste their money a old people can . in conclusion , this are the three reason why i disagree with the statement .
