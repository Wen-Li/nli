i agree with the statement . first of all , every body agrees that successful people are not ordinary people . because they 've found a way to get richness and success while orthers are still stay poor in either their money or their future . successful people usually think differently . for instance , an average person who make about 50 thousand dollar a year would probaby save 10 to 20 thousand dollar in their bank . what a successful person would do is using the money to invest onther than put that much money into bank . that 's how a small amount of money get larger and larger . successful people think thing in advance . they look at the market and they would know what hot deal are going on . they would find out which you can and which you can not do . they would figure out which worthes the risk to invest . in another word , they have the intellegence to distinguish good stuff and bad stuff . any way , successful people are usually business man . my friend john is a stock bloker who work on wall steet . he make money only out fo look at how the stock go . he usually work at home , seldom go out . but he know every thing . he get information from the internet . he 's just more than intellegent . once he know what the stock would go , he know for sure . he 's just like genius . successful people are bave . they would try thing new , not afraid of the unkown future because they have the courage and the confidence to do their job good . the know the will finally win the game and make their life better . for example , my uncle lee is a very successful person . he make a fortune every year . he 's always glad to try some new stuff even some of them are for teen . but he 's already 50 . he 's brave , not afaid of anything .
