thesedays , it is really tough to give time to help our community . most young people are busy to have fun by themselves or to get ready for their future . did you have enough time to help your community ? let me tell you how young people 's mind became evil . first , young people in korea love to get drunk . i saw korean times last week , and it said `` more than 77 percent of korean university student are near alcoholic '' . i do not think the `` near alcoholic '' have the time to help their community . second , other young people in korea are really busy to get ready for their future . they try their best to get all kind of license like mba , gpa . it is really hard to get a job in korea nowadays . that is why young people get ready for their future . third , young people hate to help their community , because they think it is bored and not necceary . their parants should tell them to help their community . last , it is really bad for their future if they do not give enough time to help their community . it will make them to be phycos . if they are not used to be in community , they will be selfish , mean , and evil . i saw a person who helped his commnunity when he wa young , he did almost perfect control with time . he never got drunk , got many license , helped his community . he is enjoying his life now . i am telling you that all young people should give enough time to help their community .
