i believe that specializing in one subject is better and more important in the world we live in today , than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . having broad knowledge of many academic subject can be very good socially since it allows the person to communicate with people on many subject . however it is not enough in the society that we live in today , since you can not have a decent job if you merely have broad knowledge of thing . jobs require specific and thorough knowledge of a specific subject or subject . working a a lawyer for example requires thorough and indepth knowledge of the law and general knowledge would not be enough to become a lawyer . specializing in one subject mean that that person is going to become really good at that subject and that therefore he may pursue it in the future . this ensures that this person will be able to find a job in our now very specialized world . someone who specializes in finance , for example , may work at a bank and then from there he can learn about many other thing , which help in everyday life , and he can gain knowledge from having a job . therefore specialization lead to broader knowledge in other subject . specialization , a it wa discovered and agreed upon by most economist including the `` father of economics '' , adam smith , lead to greater efficiency . this is because someone who specializes in something and doe it all the time discovers way to improve upon it and therefore becomes an expert in that field . this ha led to an increase in the specialisation of the workplace and job . that is way anyone who wish to succeed in life and have a job need to specialize in something . due to all of this broad knowledge of many academic subject is not better than specializing in one subject , atleast not at this point in time .
