i agree with the fact that young people do n't give enough time to helping their community . before i give the reason and example , i want to clarity the word young people . according to my essay , young people mean the people at the of 15 to 25 . below and after those age are out of the scope of my essay . if we look at the global trend in the world today , we see that it is mainly a world based on consuming more and more . consuming in the sense that , our happiness is getting more and more directly related to having more personal material under u . if it is not the same for every young person , it is the same among my friend . the main reason why i agree with the statement is because i believe that he world that we live in today is very individualised . the reason for this is the one that i explained before . in today 's life , we have huge resource of data , huge amount of toy to spend time and etc . people keep on spending time with those toy or vast amount of data that are available . for those people , having a time for other thing are almost inevitable . as an example , i can give people who dedicate their life to massive multiplayer online role playing games . i know my friend play these game for day continously just to have a better character in the game that result in a better reputation among their friend . in the scope of this example , for many people , helping out the community is just a waste of time . something that doe not posse any value in it . because they do n't gain anything materially by helping out people . in conclusion , i think the way young people see the world is the problem here . we live in a world which is dominated by consuming trend . the happiness in today 's world come from material happiness , and for many young people around me , helping out the community is most of the time nothing but a wastage of time just because it give nothing to their material possession .
