`` everything wa better in former time . '' i guess all young people know sentence like this from their parent or grandparent in particular with reference to the opinion that young people nowadys do give enough time and energy to supporting the community they live in . but is this true ? in my essay i will debate , if peolpe spend enough time and enery to helping their community . in particular i will highlight why the help of young people is bitterly needed a well a why also young people would benefit from helping their communties . in my opinion young people , particularly teenager and twens could and shoul help much more in their community . firstly , i think , nowadays budget of community are often almost empty , and a a result , much help is needed . lots of municipality do not know how to provide service , e.g. for older peolpe - preventing them from isolation - or for child . the only way of providing these social service often is unpaid work of resident . but a far a i know only le young people are interested in providing time and effort to help their community . they are more interested in having fun , traveling and planing their carrer . e.g. in my hometown almost all people working unpaid for the community are older than 50 . hence , i think the quality of community life would benefit from an increase of engagement of young people . moreover , i think also the personal development of young people would benefit from an increased social engagement . nowadays young peolple - at least in europe - often take anything for granted . they are not aware that we all depend on support and that lot of the thing they take for granted cause much work . by doing it on their own they would learn to worship this work . taking all these point into consideration it can be stated that young peolpe increase their engagement for several reason . bot , the community a well a themselves would probably benefit from it , however , it will need some time to realise .
