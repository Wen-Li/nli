in general i agree with the statement , that successful people try new thing and take more risk instead of only do what they are used to do . there are several reason why i do agree . in the first place , if you always do the same there is no development at all and your environment remains stable . it becomes boring and you do not differ from all the other people worldwide . success occurs when you do something surprising and new . one good example is columbus , who found america by doing something all the other men in his time hesitated . another example is the discovery of antibiotica , which wa made by accident and trying something new . success mean to differ from what is normal and familiar to the people . they want to be impressed and buy thing that are new and in facion , so a a designer you also have to be creative and try new thing . on the stock market you even have to take enormous risk if you want to make the highest income . here taking risk is fundamental . second , this is also true in the human partnership . here you have to take high risk to talk to the person you like and say this to him or her , but only then you can be successful by coming together and get friens or even partner . you have to take the risk and see if you fail or succeed . without revealing your feeling to the other person you never know , if you would have been successful if you did . success also mean improvement and this need change and development . but these can only take place if you take risk and try new thing . finally this statement is also true for me myself . i have chosen to take the risk and go in a foreign country to study and do my llm instead of staying at home and complete the normal education way that lawyer have in my home country . this includes being in a new surrounding and far away from home , but it is a challenge and it perhaps lead me to a more successful career than without taking this risk to study in a foreign country . in conclusion , all these point support the idea of the statement and therefore i agree with it .
