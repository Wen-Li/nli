i agree with the following statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' the aim of most advertisement is to make more money even if their product is not a good a they may advertise it . in order to sell thier product , most advertiser say good thing about their product in order to gain the marketting compare to other advertiser . they may tell you of the low price , the good teast , how it , s good for your health and all the possible good thing it can do . when you go to buy the advertised product , you may find that all they said about it is not true but you already bought it . what they are after is money . advertised product at time may have adverse effect on each and every individual . this may cause some allergy in some people and even death depending on the severity of the allergy . en general , most advertisments are not real , they are made to convince people to buy their product and not to satisfy the need of the population they serve even though some exeptions do exist .
