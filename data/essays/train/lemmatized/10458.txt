this is a controversial issue to define the important factor for sutudents . someone priotized knowledge of idea and concept that student gain is a most important factor of education , however others may say that experience from fact is an important factor for sutudents . these priority would depend on life everyone 's previous life experience . in my case , i wa grown up in a school that gave me mixed educational method , and that the method wa equally balanced . since i recognise mixed educational policy , both factor are key to obtain better concept , and at least i can say is both factor were needed and just one of those would not bring the significant result . when i wa elementary school student , i learned concept of insect . that wa a first time that someone told me concept . i engrossed in the idea and bought many book about insect . this easy introduction of concept brought me a significant knowledge even i spent my time and fund to have more knowledge of insect . this experience realised me the importance of understanding idea brings me more knowledge . in contrast with this experience , i learned concept from fact that i faced earthquake when i wa 10 year old . at that time , i did not know what earthquake is . first trembling wa come , and everybody went down stair or desk to protect one 's life . although i never knew such action had to did however learned imediately amd so did i . this action kept me from potential damage by earthquake . after the earthquake passed , my teacher gave u a concept . in this case , having to learn fact gave me a concrete concept and idea of what earthquake is . i say both factor are equally influenced and valued for better education and each is more or le ha value for better education . as i experienced both factor brought me a rational and educational value for my study even if each of those is different experience . since the purpose of student is to have best education , no matter what the method is , both method can bring value for student .
