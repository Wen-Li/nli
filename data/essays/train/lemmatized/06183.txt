age will give the man the experience and the wisdom but , unfortunately , take the sense of enjoyment . i , personally , believe that young people enjoy life more than older people life . some people believe that old people should have the tendency to enjoy and appreciate life more than young one . this is because old peolpe have wider experience and they saw in the life more interesting thing and harmless a well . i totally dispute this idea and i believe that the younger the man is that more enjoyable the life will be for him although i do not deny that elderly people can live enduring happiness and welfare . however , this happiness can not be compared to what teenager . there are several reason for my opinion and i would like to put them in the following way . first , young people tends to find virtually every thing new and exciting but old people do not feel that excitement . i remember in one product overview in my company , we were five : three can be considered young and the two others a old . the presenter showed a marvlas feature in the product that amazes u ( the three young participant ) . however , the presenter did not notice that excitement on the old employee and when asked they replied `` yeh , it is a good feature but we knew similar thing did not work on the company in the past '' . this previous example will also illustrate my second point that old people tend to think too much about consequence . they tend to do this systematically and programmatically . i saw many people who seems to lack the energy and motif . probably , advancement in age and health problem gave thim some of this discouragement . on the contrary , young people try to live on the principle `` do not cross the bridge till you come to it '' . i mean they do not think about the problem till these problem take place . there feeling are spontaneous and natural without the complexity of intensive thinking . this make the life always interesting for them . in conclusion , from the above point , young people enjoy life more than older people do .
