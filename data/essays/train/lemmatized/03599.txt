as far a iam concerned , i agree this statement . because understanding idea and concept are the basic step to know more about fact . however fact also having some importance for student . following are the reason to support my choice . firstly , understanding idea give a basic step to think about the object . if you understand clearly then it easy to estimate the quality and theory of that object . hence we need a extra concentration on understanding idea and concept . mostly every fact will have it own concept and idea . inaddition , if student concentrate well on understading idea and concept they can easily recognize the fact . some research study indicates that student who having more concept will show highly recognizing nature than others . for example will give mutch impotance to understanding idea and fact , i really got sound knowledge in subject . also i can easily estimate the fact in a subject . futhermore , lot of the student will give mutch importance to concept , because if you learn concept it will take long time to forget . by showing extra concentration on idea and fact lot of student were written well on exam . most of the lecture will also give importance to concept because once a student learned concept very well than it easy to teach them . however there is a need to understand fact , these are the conclusion to most idea and concept . several researcher saying that if a student having capability to recognize the fact than he is very sound in perticular subject . as far a iam concerned , idea and concept can play a major role in determinig fact . i can strongly support that idea and fact are more important to student than fact . lot of researcher are also saying tha same . by based on above reason and supporting point i can safely conclude that conceprt is more important than fact for student .
