some people think that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specializing in one specific subject . the rest of the people disagree with this idea . i belong to the second group of people . because specializing in one subject is more reasonable for me due to the reason of that one can not be considered a special if he or she know little from every subject and one can get confused by trying to deal with multitasks . firstly , knowing one topic with it every detail make a person special . for instance , two research assistans of chemical engineering study can be thought to clarify the point . one of them ha research in many area including , fluid dynamic , heat and mass transfer , thermodynamics and complicated process control system , while the other one search a special subject related to heat and mass transfer . he just want to know more about the design of plate heat exchanger . finally he will an extensive background , whereas the first guy loos himself in many area . so a special company interesting in heat exchanger can offer a job to the second guy . nevertheless first guy can not be thought an expert in any area to be hired by a special company . secondly , managing multitasks at the same time requires another knowledge and capability not to be lost in many area . first guy in the example before may get confused when he see that a perfect design of a heat exchanger is not a good a the inventor think . it may lack a control equipment from the process control point of view . however , he is not aware that it is unneccessary to have this property for a heat exchanger since he ha not enough information in both area . as a result , knowing one specific subject well gain a person speciality . with this special property , he or she can differ other people during his or her life , although this person ha not extensive information in other area .
