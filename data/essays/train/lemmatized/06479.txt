generally like to travel in a new place they had never been before in order to explore new area , new environmentfor example travel to vasit a new country or city . for those kind of travel , i stronghly believe that tavel in a group led by a tour guide is faraway the best . first because with a group led by a tour guide , to can discover and enjoy the most inportant place of the place visited . the historical thing s and place easily without so many effort to get to the place . because if you are visiting a new place by yourself , you might have to follow the map , sometime you can get lost , or spend more time and money than you should to get to the place that you where looking for . with a group led by a tour guide , you can go where ever you want with a group of people ; furthermore , some of them can become you fiend later on . travel in a group led by a tour guide give you a global and detail approach of the you travel , you usually get more fan with a group than travel by yourself . for example a couple of year ago , i went to marroco by myself to visit the country , if it wa not the tour guide that i did , i think that , i would spend the entiry amount of my money without visiting the main place of the country . the tour guide wa really helpful and unforgetable . the easiest way the go traveling in another place is to travel with a group led by a tour guide . it is more interesting and you can have more fan .
