i do agree that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . infact it is a art that ha developed with new era and new technology . it is a mean of atrracting their costumer to buy their product . advertising industry ha grown for decade and still growing today . with the invention of computer grafics any product in the market can be made very beautiful and irresistable . the advertisement is eye catching and it get registered into your mind . so when you go to the market , even if the product is not useful , you end up buying it only because the beautiful side of the product ha been inculcated into your mind . lets take an example of a perfume . in the advertise the perfume bottle wa in a shape of a lady and it wa being used by jenifer aniston . t hat had registerd into my mind and i wa wanting tho buy the perfume for a long time . one fine day i finall got a cance to go buy it . the price of the perfume wa unbelievable , it wa so expensive . but i wanted it at the image of jenifer holding the bottle just di n't go out of my mind , and guess what ? i finally ended up buying it . even today i regret to the purchase that i made that day a till today the perfume bottle is only half used a i no more like it smell . but that wa a lesson for me , and today i keep control on myself and donat get waved away by such fantasy created by the advertisement . i realize that i am not the only one , there are million of people who ha had this kind of experience . but the key thing to ask is , do these people realise how they are trapped by the advertisement industry . i guess there would n't even be 1 % of the entire crowd who understands this strategy used by the advertisement agency . this is one of the major reason for the fast growth of the advertising company . but ` yes ' i do agree to the fact that the advertising agency are doing a very good job and ha a great effect on people 's mind .
