nowadays , there are many kind of transportation for mankind . trains , bicycle , motocycles , airplane . .. etc. and most common method of transportation above all is car . nowadays , almost each one of u ha at least one car which he or she posse . and a the population increase on and on , the number of car in use would increase on and on . but due to the development of technology in our world , and growing awareness of people towards the environment they live in , i believe that in twenty year of time , there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstly , car have contributed to lot of pollution going on around our world . people are agressive being . they will try to eliminate all the factor that can pose threat to their life . so , if car give off too much pollutant to the environment people are living in , people will try to find a substitute for car in future . secondly , people are becoming more concerned about their health and the environment around them than they used to be in the past . now , after having put lot of damage to the environment , people are trying to conserve the environment again and trying to find a way to get rid of the pollution they have created . that 's why people are trying to use more environmental friendly method of transportation and use public transportation to reduce the pollution going on . if this trend continues on , in twenty year time , le people will use car a their main source of transportation and try to find another solution and use le car in the future . thirdly , the reason why people use car is to be more convenient when they are moving . driving car is more convenient than walking , running , or driving a horse . people have developed many way to make these improvement during the past . mankind have made an enormous development in the past history . as the time go on and on , people will try to invent a new way of transportation which will make them more convenient and le time taking than now . even now , airplane ha been invented and is becoming more popular than it used to be in the past becuase it is le time consuming and more comfortable than a car . so , with regard to this characteristic of mankind , there is no reason why people will not invent a new method of transportation and abandon using car a their main method of transportation . the aggressive nature of human being , growing awareness of importance of natural environment , and development of technology to meet people 's desire to live a more convenient and le time consuming life will probably reduce the numer of car used in twenty year from now . people are always trying to make improvement in their life . so , if they are more concerned with having a better life than they have now , they will try to find a way to do so under any circumstance .
