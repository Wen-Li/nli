since different people have different life activity and style , it is really difficult to generalize if youg people enjoy life more that older people do . however , from my experience , i think that older people enjoy life more than ypung poeple do . first of all , many young people do n't have freedom while the olders do . for instance , they have to belong to school to ged education , and they have to study seriously every day a long a they want to get a blight future which is essentially to get a good salary job and family . to study is one of the most stressful activity they experience . on the other hand , it is more likely for the olders to forcus their life on what they really want to do such a hiking and traveling . for instance , i am a college student so that i do not have time to spend for my hobby such a rockclimbing and swiming in the semester . and i envy older people who enjoy riding a bike . secondly , teenager tend to have difficulty to establish a good relationship with others and have other serious distress such a family probrems . this actually make many of them commit suiside . young people tend to depend on their parent so that they do n't have any abillity to change their life . a a consequence , it is more difficult for younger people to have time to enjoy their life . finally , young people do n't have good economical or finacial establsiment so that they tend to have money problem while older people do . to have joyful time , money is essence . if you do n't have enough money , i connot enjoy you life . therefore , older people have more time to enjoy life . each peason ha different life in different age so that it is not possilble to detrermine whether young people enjoy life more that older people do . however , again , older people have more opportunity to have time to enjoy their life , according to my experience .
