no matter where you go , what you do or what your educational background might be , you will be confronted with advertisement every single day . you see them in newspaper , magazine on television , even at bus station . thats why it is no wonder that company spend thousand of dollar for the marketing of their product . in my opinion it is true that that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because most company spend a significant amount of money to advertise their product , they obviously want a many peolpe a possible to buy their product . in order to do that , they must make their product sound a good a possible , probably even better than the product of their competitor . to be able to do that company need to make sure that all the emphasis is on the positive feature their product obtains . and therefore also try to hide all the imperfection a product might have . if you take a look at just the advertisement in a magazine , you can already tell if it is a magazine that is suppose to be read by female or male . if you think about a very well known magazine for woman like instyle , you find one ad for lipstick after the next . every single one of them tell you how uniqe the lipstick is and what great feature it ha , but none of them point out any negative thing like if they are produced in a 3rd world country or if any animal were used for the testing of it . companies need to make sure that their product stand out and that people feel they desperately need it in order to get people to buy their product in particular and not a similar one of another brand . companies try to give the reader of a magazine the feeling that they are only young and hip and fit in with everyone else if they own their product . that is why in my opinion product often seem so much better when they are advertised than they really are . not only because company put the emphasis on the positive thing but because they try to hide the thing that would make their product much more difficult to sell .
