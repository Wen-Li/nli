the young and the old each live their life under a different perspective . as a result , it wo n't be right to say that one enjoys their life more than the other doe . however , if i were to dare express my opinion on who were the happier , i would , without a doubt , choose the young a being happier . firstly , the young are yet free from the world 's grasp . unlike their parent and their relative , who have already gone through or are still going through the hardship and the harshness of the world , they are like sheet of blank paper waiting to be used . of course , being a pure a snow also mean that they are at a vulnerable stage where they may get corrupted with a single wrong decision , but most of the time , only the minority suffers this misfortune . secondly , the young have time that the old once used to have but now lack of . in fact , the young have plenty of time to be used ; depending on how it is used , their future would change . however , they should n't be just concerned about their future , especially when the current world have so much to offer for them . for example , they can enjoy listening to mp3s and download music from the internet . moreover , they have shopping mall to socialize with their peer . such innovation used to be unimaginable and ludicrous to some of the old , back when they were young , but now these brilliant invention have been created , it is up to the young to enjoy what they have . in conclusion , the young enjoy their life more than the old do theirs . being young mean that they have a lot of lesson that they have to learn and a lot of obstacle to go through , but then they show the great potential to blossom into full flower . having time to learn all they need and to enjoy their life , the young rarely have much to watch out for . they also benefit from the innovation of the current world and they are not hesitant to experience them and familiarize themselves with new experience . truly , all it would take for the young to grow into the old who can enjoy their life would be the right mind to make right decision so that they are successful in every endeavor that they go through .
