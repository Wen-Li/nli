if you open a textbook , for example a math one used in the past at school , it 's quite easy to notice that each theory and concept is followed by a practical example that explains and allows the student to get a better understanding of the cited rule . in fact i personally think that this is the way student learn better and easier . a concept on itself without an example sometimes doe n't have much sense and it can be difficult to memorize it . for istance , there are some subject that have no meaning without fact and i believe history is one of these one . a student ca n't just have the idea of what is `` the second world war '' without knowing the real historical event concerned to it . it would be an empty information . in my opinion history can be defined a a fact based subject where the idea or concept are almost irrelevant . although what i 've just said it depends much on the kind of subject you are going to study . some of them strictly require something more than the idea , meanwhile for others can be useless because it 's already clear by itself . facts such a date , example , reference give probably a hand to the student at first when he approach to study something new , once the student ha understood well i agree with the general opinion which is that fact are secondary to the idea and they may lose their importance and can be forgotten . as a result learning fact is helpful but it 's not all . even a single fact doe n't have sense if we do n't understand the reason we are studying it . in summary it 's important to have a balance between these two kind of learning because only doing this a student can really reach a high level of knowledge .
