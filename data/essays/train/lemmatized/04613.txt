i think the best way to travel is go the place without a tour guid . traveling with tour guid is look good , but i can not think so . there are three reason why i think so . the first reason is about the traveling time . if i travel with a group with a tour guid , i can not go anywhere i want to go . because the travel course is decided by the guid . it is not fun . the second reason is about a time . in a travel with a group with tour guid is needed to go somewhere on the time . if i get a free time at the tour , i had a lot of plan where i go but the time is limited , so i can not go to all place where i wanted . and if i go to myself , i do not have to think about the time because there is no person who ha to wait for me . so i think i can enjoy my traveling . the final reason is about money . i am a university student , so i do not have a lot of money . if i travel with a group led by a tour guid , i have to pay the money for the guid . it need more money than i travel by myself . and the guid exists to inform about the place or some good point of the place , so if i learned about them before i travel , i do not need the guid . these three reason are very important for me . and these avoid me to do something what i want to do . so , i do not think that to travel with a group led by the tour guid is the best way to travel .
