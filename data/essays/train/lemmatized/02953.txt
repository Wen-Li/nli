i totally agree with this statement , i think it is much more important to understand an idea than to learn fact . when a student understands a concept , it mean that is very clear in his mind and that he could explain it in a different way or relate it with another subject . moreover , when someone understands an idea , he learns the fact much easier because they are logically related to this idea . for example , in a history class , if i try to learn some inportant date without understanding the course , i will have difficulty and i will forget them a couple of day later . if i understand the course , i will learn those same fact easier because they are all logically connected so i will be able to remember those date a long time after . it is more important for student to understand the idea of a particular topic than to learn specific date because once you understand a course , you do not forget it easily . that is why student should try to understand what the course is about before learning fact . there is no use to learn fact without being able to explain it . when i wa in highschool , i used to hate mathematics because it wa for me just learning formula and writting them downon the exam day . so when i had a test , i could give the formula but i did not know when , where and how to use it . my teacher noticed that i wa learning my formula in a `` silly '' way , like a machine a he said , and he told me to spend much more time at home trying to find out how doe that work . that is what i did and from that day , i stopped to learn fact that i could n't understand in all the other course . now i always try to understand first which is much more exciting and it take le time and le pain .
