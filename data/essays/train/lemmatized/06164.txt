its true that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . it is the marketing skill of the company in making profit . most of the advertisement are so well designed and presented that they attract large part of audience . people tend to buy those product . when it come to reality the product does'nt seem better . for example , woman tend to buy various kind of cosmetic with out actually knowing how well they suit them . so customer should be very discerning in purchasing product . its better not to be simply carried away by advertisement rather check the statistic of the product before purchasing . consulting and taking others ' ( who might have already used the product ) opinion would help to purchase better product .
