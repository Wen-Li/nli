cars are the most convinient way to travel . unlike public transport , you can go exectly where you want - without waiting , without detour . if zou have a lot to transport , like a peace of furnature you can just put it in the trunk - given that zour car is big enough . riding by bus would be very impractical , getting through the door , finding enough space . you might thing that the bus is ceaper , and maybe sometimes it is , but a soon a you are n't traveling alone the expensives for the fuel can be shared . time is also of importance , even train beeing very fast traveling from one citz to another , you normaly need a lot of time until you reach your final destination . you will have to get a bus or subway , which may be late , and in the end you would have been quicker using a car . besides of being more practical , there is also a psychological aspect to it . your car is something you have earned , somthing you can be proud of . and most important , it belongs to you . so you are not quit in public when you drive your car . it 's like you are still on your own teritorry . and it is also a common symbol of status , and who want to give that up ? i shure do not . of cause there are problemes , like rising fuel price . but i think that way will be found to solve them . even today there are car which dont need fuel based on oil . so when the last oilwells dry out , the car wo n't lack of fuel - because when it happens car wo n't need fuel anymore . i think the car is so convinient , and liked by so many of u , that we will find a solution to any problem that might endanger our beloved automobil .
