yes , i do agree with the statement stated below . having a broad knowledge of many subject is more good than having knowledge ioin one subject . because , every subject in the acadmic year are related with the other subject . as we know that mathematics is father of all subject . it ha the major influence on all other subject . ther is no such subject which do not have an influence on it . having a kowledge on it only one can have the kowledge on the other subject completely . for example , in our bachelor degree , we have the subject mobile communications and wireless communications . each have the influence on the other . the mobile communication is the study of the science on the wireless transmission where a the wireless transmission is the path for the mobile transmission . both have the influence on eachother . mobiles includes the telephone or the data transmission device such a bluetooth , infrared device which are used in the data transmission . and the wireless transmission is the study or the process involved in the data transmission . not only these both subject , ther are many other subject which are very closely related to each other . that is why i strongly agree with the statement that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialised in other subject . as we know the proveb that `` knowledge is devine '' . no matter what the subject is , having a knowledge on it will surely help in kowing the other subject .
