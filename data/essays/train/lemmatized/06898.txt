i agree with the statement `` most advertisement make product seem mush better than they really are . '' the first reason is that they are useing the light and many staff to make the product more colorful , freash , and tasty and show to costmors the photo . i had many expriencese about food . when i wa living in the domn , i wa hungry and lazy to cook by myself then i went market and bought some instant food . on the box , the picture wa look like so nice , but after i went back home and ate . it wa so nasty . i just throw it in to trushcan . the second reason is that nowdays every company want to sell their product to costmors to get more money , so no one want to say our product are n't very good . it is meaning they can be honest to costmos . they only think about how to sell even they will cheat on costmors . overall , that is why i belive most advertisement make product seem much better
