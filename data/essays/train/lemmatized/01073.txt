i agree with the statement . i ofen thought that why most advertisement take a lie in my childhood . i have two reason about it . first , i have the experience which i wa baught the kind of hobby by soch most advertisement . i get the game machine . when i often watched on tv , i watched many advertisements together . it make me buy many thing . so , when i discover the game machine , i thought it had good perfermances . i ask my mother to buy it to me . my mother said it is too expensive to buy now , and she buy it for 1 year . after then , i could get it ten month later . i am very happy , but this machine is bad , so i wa angry . then my mother angry me too because it is hard to her to get this machine , and she think i am happy to get it . secend , it make bad relationship for many people with such first reason . many people expect good good which is watched on tv . when it is not good or bad good , most people feel stress . it reflect to other person , and many people feel bad . in conclusion , it is sometimes needed because of incresing product , but inalmost stuations , it is not needed .
