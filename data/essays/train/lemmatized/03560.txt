every person is given a meaning to his existence because of the community he life in and henice it his moral responsibility to show gratitude towards the comunity he is a part of . he need to help his fellow community member in whatever the extent he can . young people nowadays may not be a responsible a the youth of the previous generation in certain factor . but this can not be attributed to their work towards community . youth are a dedicated towards the development of community a the youth once were . i would strongly disprove the statement that young people are not giving enough time towards helping their community . we can find lot of young girl and boy volunteering during weekend at various temple , church and mosque . during festivals/celebrations , we find lot of community event organised . the interesting factor in these is , young people are the organiser of these event . they involve in the pooling of the fund , gathering the necessary equipment and hold on till the smooth transition of event is complete . they are present everywhere . they are not doing these for some petty monetary allowance . its being done a a token of respect for the community they live in and the people part of it . when all these are happening right in front of our eye , how can we state that they are showing a deaf ear to their community . these are few example of the service exhibited by the young people towards the upliftment of their community . though not in a direct form , we can find young people working in various company and college doing social service on few particular day commemorating some important occasion . also , most of the young people after passing out from their college and joining some industry/company , do come back to college occassionally . they help their junior student by taking some guidance class , clear their doubt about the job culture and industrial environment . they even help their alma mater by donating fund a a responsible alumnus and are supporting the community they are part of . we also find many young people participating in the preservation of environment campaign . they are raising their voice with the help of association like `` save earth '' , `` green peace foundation '' etc . most of the member in these organisation are people aged under 30 . they are preaching for a better earth and thus are striving to help the community they live in . in short , i would strongly disagree with the given statement and reinforce that youth 's commitment towards the community ha not changed over generation .
