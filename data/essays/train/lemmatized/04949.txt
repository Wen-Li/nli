ok , in this essay i would like to express what i think about the importance of idea and concept in contrast with learn fact . first , i will explain what do i understand for knowledge giving and example of one of the theory of plato , then i will use this definition to point out the main diferences between idea and concept , and learn fact . finally , i will write about what i think is more important . what doe knowledge mean ? this is a question that ha arised from the begining of the era . many philosopher had though about it . plato said that knowledge is organized in the next hierarchy way ( from most to le important ) : - procedural knowledge : knowledge about a method or a consecutive and ordered step to obtain something . for example , the scientific method , an algorithm to sort any number of element of the same kind , etc . - concepts and idea : knowledge about `` concept '' . for example , the mathematical concept of a limit of a function , the physical concept of the atom , the diferent state of water , between others . - facts : some sort of fact that we know that are true in this world or in some realm . for example , we know that people die , and that the capital of the state of tamaulipas is victoria city . i think that all different type of knowledge described by plato are important but if i have to choose between concept and fact i choose concept . but by ? i think that concept are a complex form of fact . some kind of relation between fact . for example if we know two fact : that all human are mortal and that aristotle is a human , then we can use the concept of `` human inference '' to say that aristotle is mortal . other example might have beed described on different area of science like mathematics , physic , logic and natural science .
