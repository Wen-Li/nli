cars have been the mean of transportation around the world for century . it is no doubt that the car is a major part of many people life . so will there be fewer car in use twenty year from now ? well , i think that the car will very much be present twenty year from now and probably with more user then ever , with a few change to the car 's function and design of course . i think that the car will change greatly over a twenty year period . resulting in a burst of popularlity with many individual around the world . i think that many of the function of the car will be changed a well . i think that the car , twenty year from now will use electric fuel not gasoline . i think this because there are many problem arising around the world regarding the price of gasoline . not only is the price of gasoline expensive but it is also destroying the atmosphere , resulting in global warming . i feel that the car industry will thus , shift it vision on car from gasoline to highly productive , well-made electric car . these electric car will not only run on small amount of electricity , but it will also have no exhaust pollution , creating a better and cleaner environment . it is because that i think these change will occur that i say that the number of car will not diminish in the future . i feel that with the environmentally friendly benefit and with the attachment that society already ha on car will make people keep riding car . i also think that there will not be fewer car in twenty year because i think that many people in many socities are very attached to the car . it is not a mere transportation vehicle , but it is a part of tradition to drive a car in many country . for example , it is a tradition to get your driver license when you turn the age of 16 in america . also it is a sign of wealth in many country to own a car in many country , such a china . therefore , i feel that there will not be a decline in the use of car because ; by losing the car you will lose many tradition , and tradition are a part of culture . so it is hard for me to think that the human race would diminish an entire part of culture from there life within a short period of twenty year . the attachment to car by the human society and the possiblity to alter car to better suit the need of the environment and the people , make me conclude that the usage of car will not decline in twenty year .
