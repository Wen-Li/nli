i would not personally agree with the statement . life to me is a flowing river that is beautiful at every stage . what ultimately matter is our perspective towards life , our priority and value we hold most close to ourselves . ultimately i guess it all boil down to what we concieve or understand of the notion of ` enjoyment ' . for a child playing could be enjoyment . something a small a building sand castle could ! as the child grows his demand and need evolve with him and ultimately what he asks from life would determine his level of happiness or enjoyment . at adolesence the spark of chemistry between the oppsite sex could be exciting . later on , finding someone you love or someone who love you maybe of most importance at a given phase of live . at a latter stage one might want to marry and settle down or may choose not to do so a per one our personal choice and whatever give them satisfaction . even the birth of a child and every moment of bringing up that child could be a great deal of enjoyment !! as you age your grandchild could be the greatest source of enjoyment . my belief in this theory ha only been augmented from empirical evidence i bring right from home . my parent are old yet happy and content . they enjoy every moment and live every second of it to the fullest . in brief i could summarise this theory in term of a utilitarian . life is extremely short so make use of it to the fullest - use it up to the optimum for a long a you live , your living your life no matter how old or how young you are . therefore enjoyment to me is a subjective term the interpretation of which shall differ from person to person and is not determined by the age .
