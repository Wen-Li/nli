the advantage and disadvantage of group travelling led by a guide are many . travel in a group is organized visa vi of time to spend on each site and the number of site to see . the travel in group is more secure , people travelling together may assist each other when needed . however , an other positive factor when travelling in group , is that all the arrangement are made in advance and each individual member of the group ha not to worry about hotel booking , food and other arrangement necessary for the trip . the disadvantage of travelling in a group is the limited freedom each member of the group ha . means that anyone ha to stick to the etablished schedule and nobody can make change to it . nobody can make a decision on behalf of the group . however , travelling in a group may deprive you of seeing site you want to go to , visit friend or spent more time in one of your preferred site . in the other hand , the group travel is financially worth , because sometimes paying for a group of people is entittled to a discount . i do also agree that the best travel is in a group , when it concern time spent to search for touristics site , the tour guide is easy and will economize you a lot of time to find these site . certainly , a mentioned above , a guide may economize your time and also provide you with information that sometimes are difficult to get for an individual traveller . in conclusion , people are free to choose between travelling alone and travelling in a group led by a tour guide . the human being 's nature dictate over any personel decision . therefore , my agreement with the statement about travel in a group is the best , should not influence the opinion of people who want to join me in the trip .
