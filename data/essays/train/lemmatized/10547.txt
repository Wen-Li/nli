i do agree with the statement . but i have to moderate my claim . coming out of the university , i can see i have learn a lot of thing , and i have forgotten an equal number of it . what will stay after passed year ? the idea , and the concept . in course , it , s really important to learn a way to think . not the same a the professor 's one , but it own one guided by teacher experience . so , is the knowledge unusefull ? certainly not . in order to develop his own way to learn , the student need strong basis . if he doe n't have good instalements , his science building is going to fail . in the elementary school , we already have to set up those strong basis . otherwise , the only way to build up a good mental structure is to receive example to learn . how to understand a car is riding without knowing how work an engine . the knowledge is also important to be able to make connection between different area , to compare some stuff . as an archeologist discovering some news object . he need to know how wa the environment , the atmosphere to figure out how those object could be usefull for people who lived there . in belgium , we have this big issue in the high school level . actually , we try to reduce the knowledge of student and to give u more skill an ability . but the college professor start to mean their student come into their course with too big lake . so , there is an emergency in finding the best middle way between pure knowledge and skill . i think that the more we grow up , the more we have to leave knowledge to get a lot of ability and concept . at the and of college , student get very various job and have to learn again what is typically needed for their domain . so we never stopped to learn , and college is there to give u concpets .
