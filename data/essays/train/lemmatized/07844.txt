advertisement is the channel by which a product is displayed in the eye of the mass for increasing it sellling power to the market a well a the people . i personally feel that most advertisement are designed to effect people more than it actual worth . advertisements nowadays are based on marketing stratagies more than the quality of product itself . i have had some personal experience where i fell for the beatifully displayed advertisement and purchased product , only to regret later . the color , background , personal emotion and photography are enhanced to impress the people about the product . one of the experience that made me realize that a product is much more than what it is advertized a , is when i bought diet pill by watching a television commercial . it wa a 15 minute commercial where people talked about how the pill worked effectively on them and showed drastic result . it definitely worked on me emotionally and i ordered the product . it wa an expensive purchase , hence expectation for the result were high . i folowed the direction and time of usage only to realize that it didnt work without diet and exercise . there wa no difference in how i looked and i wa extremely dissapointed . the commercial on television , radio and newspaper are made more to attract buyer , than to actually display the truth about the quality and the genuineness of the product . advanced technology and photography make product look very attractive , even to a point where advertisement are targeted to effect that part of the human brain which would get effected by the way the advertisement ha been displayed . all in all , i believe advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there is always more information about the product that one need to know besides the advertisement . the advertisements is the mean to increasing the selling power of the particular product , hence only the positive will be shown . i believe that law should be made so that the company are complied to give the true picture about the product , the good and the bad .
