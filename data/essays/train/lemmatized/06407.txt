i agree with the opinion that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better that just having studied one specialized subject . i believe that knowing many academic subject widely would help people understand more about what you really want to learn . people can get many point of view from that . for instence , when you are studying economics you can not forget about international relationship which can change economy of the world . also you have to think about how thinking only about good economy system may cause bad effect on the natural environment . people can learn more about what they are majoring by knowing other academic subject . there are also other reason . not studying other subject , which you thought not interesting may took your possibility . i had a friend who thought she doe not good at mathmatics , but she gave herself one last chance to study mathmatics in the last year of high school . she ended up with finding that she actually like to study mathmatics . she have found her new possibility . to decide not to study a sbject with first impression of yours can be dangerous sometimes . you may miss your favorite subject . futhermore , studying many subject widens your future . if a person only knew one specific subject , you may have a few choice of job . if a person studied many different subject , then those subject can give him a lot of opportunity to think what he really want to do in the future . when i wa younger i had a totally different job in my mind for the future , but studying many subject in high school and university ha changed my opinion many time . it is because i have found other possibility for the future by studying many different thing . to study many subject will take time and a lot of effort . however without studying them you will never know your possibility in the future . it is not too late to study specific subject after you have studied different thing .
