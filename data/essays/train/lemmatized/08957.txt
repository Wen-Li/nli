i strongly agree with the statement that great people take risk and accept new challenge in order to achieve great thing . since great achievement mostly do not come by in accident or at no cost , in order to make achievments , people need to assume the necessary risk and challenge involved . many supporting example can be found in successful business men and scientist . the most widely known and cited example of a successful business man is probably bill gates . he is the father of the most widely utilized softward affecting million of population around the globe . however , many doubt whether this could have been possible had bill gates decided to continue his study . rather , many ascribe his success to his daring initiative to drop out of college and start his own career a a programmer in the early stage of his life . by trying new thing and assuming risk , bill gates did to achieve great thing that many people aspire . the most genious and creative inventor the world ha ever observed so far , leonardo davinci , ha also assumed certain risk and challenge that were necessary to his great achievments . according to historian , davinci wa widely criticized and mocked by people when he first attempted to fly the air . being a completely new idea back then , most people considered this ingenious invention unrealistic . despite the circumstance , davinci continued on with his project and is nowadays regarded a the greatest inventor of all time . in summary , history and current event attest to the claim that successful people try new thing and take risk in order to make great achievement . bill gates had to assume considerable amount of risk when he decided to quit college and start his own career early . leonardo davinci had also confronted new challenge when he decided to attempt at flying .
