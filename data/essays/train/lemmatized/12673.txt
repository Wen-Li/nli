i do not agree with the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstly , techonology will not advance that faster that the role of car will be replaced by the more advanced technology such a plane or ultra fast train . secondly , developing world will someday will reach to the point that their major transportation becomes car . to begin with , it seems impossible that the more advanced trasportation technology such a plane or ultra fast train replace the role that current car ha . it is true that in twenty year time , the techonology will be much more develpoed . however , it draw some skepticism that twenty year later , everyone ha access of plane at their home like almost everyone ha a car in their house today . for example , south korea , in 1986 , already considerable number of people owned car . in 2006 , there are still numerous number of people who are not able to get a car because they are too expensive to afford . it wa impossible to even manage car for everyone in twenty year time for the country , then how would it be possible to people to manage some other advanced technology in twenty year time ? it is just too hard to imagine . antoher significan point is that there are more develpoing country than developed country in the world . it will be a bit easier for the people who live in developed countires to imagine the world in twenty year with fewer car , whether it is for the environmental reason or they dream about the better techonology , nonetheless , developed coutnries such a many african country , eash-asia countrie still need to take a step to the sociey that every people in their nation owns a car . that basic stage even ha not come to them yet . even though people in developed country use fewer car in twenty year time , there will be more number of car overall in the world because the people from the developing country would be able to manage car by then . for example , if china , india or russia grow the pace the they are growing at the moment , in twenty year of time , people from the nation will use more than million car . it might be possible that fewer car will be used in twenty year time , however , i think there are far too many problem that unables this statement firstly a the technology will not develop that fast and there are too many develping countire which need to catch up the current technology . therefore , it would be impossible to manage le car in twenty year time .
