i believe that young people have the possibility to enjoy life much more than older one . youngs usually have few phisycal constraint and see death and disease much further than they actually are . old people additionally have the disadvantage of living in a world that ha changed much since their time . one reason i think that people have higher opportunity of enjoying their life when they are younger is that they are healthy and strong . they can live freely without worry for the future : they can try exciting sport like bunjee jumping or rock climbing . instead old men and woman have to spend much of their time ( and money ) in visit at the doctor 's . many disease related to elderly requires the use of drug and medicine they would not be able to live without . while young have no time to spend thinking about risk , the old men and woman are often not even independent : they need somebody 's assistance . secondly the old people are living in an environment they are not even able to recognize ! the world change so fast that grandfather and grandmother are unable to understand the social behaviour of their grandchild . i 've often tried to explain my grandmother the reason i do n't want to get married , but she just ca n't understand it ! another aspect of this can be observed when comparing the number of old people who are able to use a computer with the number of electronic game sold to even some very young child . morever i truly believe that the most stimulating part of one 's life is the university time . it is the period of my lifetime where i 'm increasing mostly the size of my knowledge and experience . everyday i meet new person and i have the possibility to find many very interesting . for example some professor are so wise that just the possibility to talk with them five minute is a great chance . not many place are a precious a university . thus i am sure that people can enjoy life more and better when they are young than when they are old . i do n't think having a longer life is a good bargain : there is no point in leaving 100 year if the second half of it ha to be passed on a bed or a chair dreaming about the past time or asking somebody to turn on the television .
