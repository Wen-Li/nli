i agree , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if a student understand idea and concept , he will be able to do the work . he will learn while doing a job . for example , if a computer enginer learn how to write a program or how to make a website on the net , he will do the best thing . moreover , he will add his creativity and do something which is not made by anybody . and he improve himself when working and creating . if a student learn fact only , he will do work like robot . he do what he learn in class . he doe not do anything else . this make decrase in his creativity and some time will come he never do creative work after all . famous university teach only idea and concept . they not teach fact . student which are graduated in these popular university will become good place in their work life . in addition they earn a lot of money . if they learned only fact in university , they would be a unfamous , ordinary people . country are require people who learn idea and concept of work . they give a good job for these people , give good wage and everybody know that people 's name in the country . i will learn and understand idea and concept . i will concentre only thats while i will be studying in the univesity .
