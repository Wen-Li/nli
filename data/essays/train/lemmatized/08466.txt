i disagree with this statment because each company , organisation , factory , which made advertisement in newspaper have many parposes , the most important one is to collect a large number of money from coustomers in order to achive that the people work on that place should be true in what they said or if they are not many people will buy their product for once a time because they will find it different from the one they read about in the newspaper so a finnancial problem will be occured . but i thought that there is a few organization make advertisement do not tell the real thing about thier product and sucsseded , if we want to search for the reasult that they sucssed for you will find that it is not because the advertisment itself but from where the advertisment is published , because you know the advertismant which appeared in many place many and many people will see it and they will be surprised for that prefect adjective in that product then they will buy it and in the end theywill find the differances !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my last obinian came from an experiment , one day i watched in the tv an advertismant about shampoo which called `` head and shoulder '' which said the this sort of shampoo will make your hair shining , comfort , growing well , very beautiful smell , clean , keeping the the colour of your hair when you die it and with very littel price , after that i went to bye it and when i made a shwar evry thing wa correct excpet that it keep your hair colour when you use it a after i used it for one month all my hair colour changed . but in arabic country that could happen becau
