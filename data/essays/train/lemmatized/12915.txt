i personally disagree with the provided statement because i think that the number of car in use will remain basically constant through the year . first of all , i believe that twenty year will not carry enough change to produce a variation of our habit and way of living . even if the public transport will be presumably enhanced , most of the people will still need a car because the main commercial area such a shopping center , cinema and other facility will be located far away off the city and they will still require a car in order to be reached . moreover , according to the statistic , people who live in town will move to the adjacent countryside , owing to the high cost of living they are facing now . secondarily , the car industry will probably give it best in order to keep constant the annual income . solutions will be provided in order to let people replace their old vehicle , whithout just dismissing it . as an example , even now new method of payment are being introduced to allow driver to change their car regularly during the year . i suppose that even the western government will help the vehicle sector in order to inhibit the unemployment consequent to a possible crisis of the industry . in addition , in twenty year time , the pollution will probably cease to represent a problem . new hydrogen engine will be produced with the aim of contrasting the raise of the pollution rate in the air . people will be more confident in buying new car with a new environment-friendly technology . owning a car will therefore remain a status of economic wealth that no-one would refuse . these reason are in my opinion enough to justify why the number of car will not change in twenty year .
