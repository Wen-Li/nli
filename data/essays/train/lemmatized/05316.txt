while some of people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , others aim at specializing in one specific subject . what i address here is both of them are equally important to one person . not only broad knowledge we need , but aslo specifical knowledge in one specific field we must own . by broad knowledge of many academic subject , we can view the world in a total whole one . without broad knowledge of different subject , we can not comprehense the world correctly even . there is a story available to sustain my assertment : long long ago , some blind men were talking about the real feature of a elephant . some of them had touched the leg of the elephant , so they said elephant wa just like a great wall ; some of them had touched the ear of the elephant , so they asserted that the elephant wa just like a big plate ; others of them had touched the tail of the elephant , so they conjured that the elephant wa just like swing . we may laugh at the conclusion made by the blind men , but we must admit that it is lacking of global view of the elephant that make them so ridiculous . so in my opinion , the most meaningful th of owning broad knowledge of many academic is to offer u a global view of the world , so we can march into the uncharted world without low propability to make such mistake just like one blind men made . by specialized in one specific subject , we can explore the world deeper . without this insight , we can get nothing about the essense of the natural ! this is more important in recent year . with the development of computer and internet , the quantity of knowledge ha explored in an incredible speed . it is impossible for anyone to master all the knowledge of many academic subject . the society ha shaped into a world of cooperation , for example , a car manufactory may design their engine in the us , make the tire in indonesia , produce variety of material in china , and make all the matrials together into a complete car in taiwan . this trend ha force people to be an expert in a specific field . from this point of view , it is very important for the contemporary to specialize in one specific subject . in conclusion , we must own a broad knowledge of many academic subject to avoid some obvious stupid mistake which are not consistent with the basic principle of many academic subject . at the same time , we also pursue to be a expert in one specific subject to cooperate with others and contribute to the development of society .
