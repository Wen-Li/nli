the statement given here is a little tricky . it is difficult to state agreement or disgreement becose it varies from person to person . let u take an example for this one of my friend did his bachelor in mathematics which ha no relation with architecture , or a such like interior design , than he took addmission in to electronics where he speciallised in light product . now after doing this two totally different course today he is the leading personality and expert in lighting . he ha great knowledge of arranging liting in a perticular space wether it is a garden or planetorium or may be an art gallery . one day he opened up the reason behiend his success he told that mathamatic helped him in the electronics to making and understanding the perticular lighting product for implication at perticular space . and that is the way how multiple academic subject helped him to achieve in his life . where in the another case the other friend since he wa 10 he wa preety intrested in temple architecture - influnced by his father who is an architect - he kept working on the same topic and he took specialization in temple archtiecture , later on he join a research programe in the university , and he togetherly found a new kind of construction method to construct the temple . after having a kind of two different example in my life i personally feel that if a person is keen intrested in a perticular direction or topic they definately achieve in it ; and give something very special to the society . where a if a person is not decided or confirmed about his intrest of field but he is genuine in what he/she study , thay may also generate something very special after having multideciplinary acadamic subject . both the way the important thing is what we , must do the best . but i personally more favouring of many academic subject , becose that knowledge may affect a lot in taking decission at later time of carrier selection .
