you are active enough when you are young and this enables young one to go for making enjoyment . the word ` enjoy ' can be defined a the way by which people feel themselve happy and which give a feeling of satisfaction . in my opinion there isnt any distinction for enjoyment because everybody is unique in there enjoyment . i am giving following reason for holding this opinion . some young one take enjoyment in doing crazy thing . they feel that doing something crazy will give them enjoyment while other may look it a risky thing which will not give any kind of enjoyment . there is feeling of adrenaline rush which is enforced within the crazy performer , when they do some crazy thing like making a jump from high altitude place , or making something different from the world . in case of elderly person , their way of enjoyment are diffrent they like to read novel , magzines or some religious literature . they will not perform any other physical activity . this doe n't mean that they are enjoying le . their way and view towards this phenomenon is different that the young one . some may like to talk they may feel enjoyment in talking about memory of there time or talking about one of the friend of them . there are many number of way to feell enjoyment and to make enjoyment . moreover today the most prominent problem of world is depression which people get from their job work or any other stressfull comdition . so everybody try to get relaxed from that and want to get some kind of feeling of rest . so they try to grab every opportunity which they get for making an enjoyment . therefore you can observe many people doing some crazy thing while othere simply watching them and stilla making enjoyment in their life . to conclude , there should not be any distinction between young and olderone about who enjoys more and who dont . everybody is having their way of enjoyment for them .
