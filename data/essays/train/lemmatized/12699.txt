there ha been an argument regarding the issue that the best way to travel is a tour in a group generated by using tour agency . some people maintain that it is very beneficial to travel because it is cheaper and safer than traveling alone . however , i believe that traveling in a group is not effective way to appreciate foreign culture . in this essay , i will present two reason for my idea . first of all , traveling with group member impose restrict regulation to tourist . in general , each person ha their own personal preference . people usually set priority on different issue . to contend these various demand , schedule should be set by their own . however , tour guide can not provide flexible regulation to people . this is because all of the schedule and regulation set by tour guide are focused to group people . for example , when i traveled in paris by using a group tour , i had really wanted to go to montrematre , famous street in paris . however , tour agency stronly opposed to my idea because there is dangerous place to foriegn tourist . in addition , no other person did not join to my plan , so i finally gave up to visit there . seconly , touring in group can not provide wonderful memory to people . generally speaking , one of the most important reason that spring to people 's mind in relation to travel is enjoyable memory . if the person go to seesighting alone , it is common knowledge that visiting strange place ha high possibility to face accident . however , people are dare to want to face that sudden accident , and a result these happening will be enjoyable memory . however , if people travel in a group , they will lose a lot of chance to their own memory . this is due to the fact that almost every tour conducted by tour guide offer limited and regulated schedule . a study conducted by the department of korean tour associations show that seventy percent of korean young people who once traveled in a group by travel agency answered that they did not satisfied with group travel . taking all i mentioned into consideration , i believe that touring in a group by a tour guide is a not best option . this is because it offer restrict shedule and , can not meet people 's diverse taste .
