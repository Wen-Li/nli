do you think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? people hold different view on this issue . actually , this topic is so complex and controvesial that it deserves careful consideration . in my opinion , i think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . to begin with , the first reson to illustrate my point is that people will take public transportation system more often than today . rather than driving car by themselves , people would take bus or mass rapid transit system to their destination for it is more convenient . take my home city taipei for example . instead of being caught in the traffic jam during rush hour , people in taipei prefer taking mass rapid transit system to commute . i think this will be a trend in the future . in addition , the further aregument to strenghten my position is that not using car is an effective and efficient way to save energy and reducing pollution . for fear of depleting the prcious energy in the globe , it is wiser to do our best to save energy . moreover , to maintain a good and suitable environment , reducing both air and noise pollution by not using car is a good method . since environment conservation is an important issue nowadays , i think not using car is quite important . finally , another reason to reinforce my view is that taking public transportation system is much more economical than driving car , actually , maintaining a car is quite expensive . besides the expense of purchasing a car , it cost a lot to maintain and repair it . moreover , you have to spend a lot of time a well a money for parking your car . on the countrary , taking public transportation system is quite smart . therefore , i believe more and more people will choose taking public transportation system in the future . in conclusion , for the reason mentioned above , i firmly believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
