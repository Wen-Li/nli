the mindful body : a peculiar paradigm i think that specialize in one specific subjcet is better . specialising you can give to your reserch a peculiar prospective and than increase your field of study . let give u some example based on my experience a anthropologist . i think they could clearly illusterate what i mean . during my anthropological field work in cameoon , west africa , i argued that there were lot of intresting aspect of this african society ( for example kinship , economical or religious sistems etc . ) . however i decided to foucus my reserch on witchcraft and sorcery . observing life in a small village i saw that i colud note phenomenon of witchcraf in all social fabric . the occult power wa used a socilal and economical levellhood . moreover when i wrote my ba 's thesis i used a specifical prospective and a peculiar method of analysis . i used the post-modern prospective on hidden cult of japanese chirstians and i demostrated how these hidden cult influenced the modern japanese chistians and others religious movement . i tried to anlize just one aspect of the african or japanese society and i tried to explain how these particular aspect reflected on whole society in different level . i think that have a broad knowledge of may academic subject is not good or usefull . a man could not be omniscent - a god - so is uneuseful try to accumulate many many notion about different argument and topic . thus men , student , professor and so on need to recognize their limit and to work - a better a possible - on within their field of study . this are the reason why i think that specialize in one specific subject is the only way that men could adopt to costruct a brand new paradigm about knowledge .
