as a student , we learn a lot of different type of knowledge from teacher , classmate and textbook , including idea and fact . the essence of fact and idea are different , and the skill to learn fact and idea are also different . some think that learning fact is the most essential thing ; others argue that understanding idea is more important in learning . there have been an agruement for a long time . in my opinion , i agree that to understand idea and concept is more important . my first reason is that understanding concept is the basis when we study , but memorizing fact will limit student ' thinking . once we understand the concept of the question , it will be mush easier to solve the problem by using the concept and idea . on the other hand , if student only focus on the text and memorize the fact which is found by others , they lose the chance to think about the question on their own . another reason is that understanding concept and idea will help student to extend their own idea . knowing the concept is the basis for innovation . for example , although many inventor do not accept regular education , they practise and extend their own idea and imagination just based on the concept . most of the invention are from the concept of material and the inventor 's creativity . in other word , without just learning the fact from book , understanding concept give student more space to imaginate and try . tos ummarize , i think understanding the idea an concept is more important than learning fact . to learn fact is to learn something dead , however , concept and idea are alive . knowing concept ecourages student to think deeply and creatively .
