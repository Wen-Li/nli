there are many aspect that are done on the the student to make them learn and tow essential way that student follow and do while they are learning . one way is understanding concept while the other is learning fact . i agree that it is more important for student to got idea and concept than learning only the fact without understanding for many reason like the believe of the subject and aquiring the ability to apply the concept with the understanding . if student learn information without understand how it come , there would be apossibilty one day the information would be changed according to the weak understanding of it concept . for example , i know an old man who think that the earth is a sphere and he kept this information for many year . after decade the man change his mind since he saw proof that the earth is a sphere even he believed in the past that it is not a sphere ! . so the understanding of the concept would make stronger believed than if the information wa just learned to the student . the ability of applying any thing that is in our mind will vary depending on the way that we got the information in it . it woud not be easy for the student who just learn fact to apply them and imagin how the fact would work on the reality while it would be so easy for the student who know the concept to deal with any topic regarding it and it would be enthosiastic for them to dael with it and apply it since they already konw where and why it came from . for instance , there is tow student who want to do research on particular topic . the one who know the reason of the topic deal with the research perfectly with the other student doe not . in conclosion , understanding concept is much more better than learning fact since the believe will be higher and the applying would be more when the student understand idea and concept . i advise all the educational companied to show the fact to the student rather than only learning fact .
