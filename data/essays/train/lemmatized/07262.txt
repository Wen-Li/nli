the issue at hand is whether student should concentrate on understanding or to `` cram '' fact . this issue is difficult because it depends on the subject . in some subject like physics it is more important to practice understanding and approaching theory rather than learning fact by heart . in other subject , like medicine , both fact and understanding are essential . but to know about fact dominates . i believe that to focus on studiying fact is the better option , because if appropriate learned they will last forever . to study fact intensivley and frequently is preferable because it 's the fundament of your knowledge and therefore the basis of your proficiency . facts you once gained will be availible at any time when required . for example a doctor always ha to rely on his | her basic knowledge about physiology . if he | she would have to look up a process before curing , treatment would take too long . in addition , would such a behaviour be reliable ? because fact are the basis of our job i think most study should focus on building reliable knowlegde . additionally , to stay with the example , a doctor continously ha to learn and to advance his knowlegde . without appropriate knowlegde he wo n't be able to understand new research . and therefore wo n't be able to cure his | her patient in a actual manner . to learn how to approach new finding wo n't help . ultimately , i feel to focus on studying fact is the right choice . i believe this , because
