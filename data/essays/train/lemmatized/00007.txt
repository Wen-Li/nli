i strongly agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing only what they already know how to do well . because without taking the risk and trying new thing one can never be successful in his life . his success is very limited by the adopted procedure . if we ca n't take risk and try another thing how can we develop new thing , make new discovery . it is only because einstein conducted 1000 experiment we get bulb . it is by taking chance and risk one can do creative work . every new technology is created by taking risk and trying new thing . take the example of television in 1980 there are black and white ctvs and by trying new thing technology is upgraded day by day . relate the television of now with that of 1980 now we have screen up to the size of 100 inch and we have lcd tv and plasma tv which is 100 time better than the past tv in term of technology , size and graphic . it is only because of trying new thing . definition of business is to try new thing and take risk . if you stick to the adopted method you will only go to a certain limit . if you want to touch the sky then you must try new thing . take the example odf wipro chairman mr. azim premji he ha a vegatable oil bussiness but he try new thing and had taken risk and now wipro is billion dollar software company . take another example of infosys mentor mr. narayan murthy a middleclass man in 1980 try a idea of opening a software compony with ten people by contributing rs . 10,000 only by every member and now infosys is a global softwre company . it is because he take risk and moreover try something unique and now he is a successful man . therefore i strongly agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i support this by giving specific reason to support this .
