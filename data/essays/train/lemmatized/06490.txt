people may try new thing for which risk ha to be taken , and if the risk pay of they become successful . i strongly belive that when there is a risk involved the chance of being successful are equal to chance of failing . definetly only new thing give greater magnitude of success , since people are more inclined to newer and innovative thing rather than the thing which are already existing , there would certainly go for something new in the market . i know of a person who became very sucessful after introducing polyster into the national market where all the major buissness sold only cotton a their main product , the person tried something new though he knew that risk wa involved and became a great success story . on similar ground one of my friend wanted to try out something new and he opened a chain of clothes store on a newbrand name , though everyone adviced him to take up a franchise with an already established brand a their wa reduced risk of failing and reduced cost in new idea and advertizement , he did not listen to their advice and setup his own thing , but unfortunately for him the store did not do good business and he could not get to taste success . i also know of a person who opened a franchise of a popular company and doing great bussiness , here he did not try anything new went with doing what people already new about , that way it wa a sure thing for him and he did not have to invest a much a he would have if he started something new and he is enjoying success , although his success might not be of an equal magnitude compared to the one who have tried new thing and became successful . i conclude that a there are two side to a coin there are both advantage and disadvantage in trying out new thing or doing something which is already well established .
