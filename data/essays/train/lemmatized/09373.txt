knowledge is wide spread and never ending if seen in a different point of view a new information keep coming up everyday . it varies according to the topic and information that is discovered from different place in the world . you may never know when a major discovery might happen and to know what ha caused this major discovery you need to obtain knowledge about that specific genre of study . i agree with both the type . i think learning a variety of subject take you a step above others and on the other hand concentrating on one subject also share it part of success . a person may go into a very deep analysis of the subject , learning everything that is related to it . but i give a upper hand to learning more subject , a it is more beneficial . learning more subject tell you a lot than learning one subject , for example you can learn a different language which can come a great use when travelling . learning a widespread of subject doesnt only limit upto language but also a variety of subject and the person who learns about various thing ha more information than the person who is just speacializing on one subject . when learning many subject one can not really specialize in all . if he want to he can specialize in one of the subject that he like the most . learning one subject and specializing in it take a lot of time and then when you want to specialize in a subject you also need to know other subject that relate to it and also should have a appropriate ammount of information about them . for instance if a person want to speacialize in physic , he ha to know a lot about math that is because math play a crucial role in physic . this doe not apply to all the subject but many of the subject need relevant ammount of knowledge from other subject in order to specialize in them . when one learns more than one subject , he ha a better shot at the open world than the person who is stuck onto only one subject a his chance are very limited when compared to the people who have taken up various subject for study . having a broad knowledge make you open to a lot of information and can help you in various way for example in a debate or a quiz , since you know many subject and thing that relate to them it will not be a problem to answer but for people who specialize in one subject , they can not battle the question cause their knowledge is very limted and can answer question which are related to their topic properly . knowledge is wide spread and everyone ha the chance to aquire it and learning different subject ha it down to a specializing in a subject ha it own benefit . but i still support the point that having a better grasp at differnet subject at is better until i find convincing statement that prove specializing in one subject is better .
