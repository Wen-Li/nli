many people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specializw in one specific subject while other people do n't . i 'm one of the people who prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i have two reason for that . first , studying many academic subject is better , because learning more subject make your knowledge biger . for example if you were talking with your friend you can understan what they are talking about . also , studying many academic subject it take all your time . if you are studying many subject then you will not get bored . for example , one day i took an english lesson for five hour , so i got bored . studying many academic subject will give u more knowledge and it is going to west your time in an important thing .
