if one would not jump in to the water one could not learn how to swim . yes i agree with the statement that to be a successful person ane should be willing to take risk in life and try new thing rather than just do what he ha been doing . many of our ancient ha gone unorthodox way and had been maverick . this is the reason we hav seen the new age arising with better life . ability of human to think and do new thing make him different from animal and there make him to achieve new milestone in life . if a person would just follow a same routine or the same fashion what his ancestor ha been doing there would be no progress . people would not be able to find solution to the problem they are facing and therefore could not be able to make there life more comfortable . scientist , architecture , doctor , engineer are few of those people who contribute a lot to the development of the society and if these people just keep doing waht they know and been taught , i fear we could not see any further advancement in our present age and the progress could only happen if the worldmakers try new thing in life and take risk . taking risk in life and therefore try new thing probably help human to learn and gain experience . might be that he may hav to face the faliures and dissapointment in initial stage but sooner the success will kiss the foot . no one is born perfect it is the practise and the determination to try new thing make the person a better one . if manny of the great freedom fighter had not taken the risk and had faught for the freedom of there country we would not hav seen manny of the great nation . also if the faomous astrologer ha not stood against the religious belief and hav said that it the sun which is in center and not earth we would hav been unknown about the mystries of universal . if man had not taken the risk to step on the moon there would hav been no neil armstrong .
