education ha always been concerned with the question whether it is more important to learn fact or to acquire way of understanding the thing that happen around u . is it of more relevance to know when exactly a certain war broke out , or to understand how a conflict finally resulted in that specific war ? in the course of this work , it will be shown that fact should not be the first and paramount source and end of learning . first of all , fact are something that we memorize . the human brain , however , doe not have the capacity to remember every single fact for an unlimited amount of time . things that we learn by heart can just a easily be forgotten when we do not need the information anymore . a student can revise certain date in history or certain physic formula , but when the exam or the school year is over , his brain might erase them in order to make space for new information . moreover , student can adapt certain idea that they have understood to other topic area . this kind of potential for transferral of knowledge or way of thinking is in my opinion highly important . facts are only valid for one specific issue at one specific time whereas idea posse a more universal quality . understanding how a politician 's mind in conducting policy work - what factor they have to take into consideration - , for example , is more important than knowing about all the policy they introduced . in addition , the learning of idea rather than fact help you to draw comparison between certain issue , to ass quality and shortcoming and to look at the world from a more general point of view . a student who know a lot about the main tenet of liberalism will very likely be better able to compare it signifigance in different culture and at different time in world history than someone who ha studied the biography of philosopher of the past . to conclude , one can say that the learning of fact is a mere formality , an unreflected acquiring of name , number and event , whereas the understanding of concept and idea is a process by which student learn to look for and grasp the root of issue . ideas can be applied to various field and can stay in our mind , shape the conception of how we see the world . facts that are hammered into our brain , on the other hand , are likely to disappear over time .
