i agree with the following statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . successful people always try for new thing because for successful people sucecess is not small thing they feel success like `` thirst '' , so they go on searching for new thing and they very eager to take risk and succedd in that what they do . the people with success donot do what they already know because what is the use in doing the known thing always and keep on doing that is a waste of time the successful people donot waste time a time is precious for them . take example of our scientist who are successful in one topic also successful in another topic also , becuse they donot want to stop there research and they are not doing their reseach for name and fame , so they will go on doing their work until their death . risk taking is another good task of the successful people because successful people always take risk and the way they handle the risk differs from the normal people and thats why they are successful . trying new thing and risk handling are the task of successful people , because a normal man thing the same way he think every time because he donot want to take risk he comprimises with what he had , the successful person is the one who think in the different way and take risk and he owns the credit of it . and with out trying how can we say that they are successful people by trying and greater innovation only lead a person to success . with the above point i agree with successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
