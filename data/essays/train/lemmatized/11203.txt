first i would like to say that life doe not stop at acertian age , so i have to disagree with this statment . but also i must say that there are somethings that old people cant do anymore , never the le there are even more thing they still can do , a long a the person is surounded by his loved one , have a good hobby or still know how to life in the eye of his child he 'll always enjoy life . a young person could enjoy the thing that the old person had already enjoyed . for young people a need for exploring , for going to place , for speeding from time to time , for there heart beatting faster and faster a they start to feel love in thier soul is a must . for old people they 've seen it all - or at least thats whats they 're saying - they want the quit night , the early sleep , the healthy food , and a vacation to an island that he always dreamed of . for example a night of playing pingo with your friend and wife , going fishing with the child of your sun or going from time to time to your old work , all these thing would mean the joy for an old person . where a young man or girl would feel bored if he / she had to do any of these thing everyweek , he would rather be in a party or with his girl , or playing a hard game like football or basketball , she would rather be in the mall getting ready for the pram . and in the other hand the life of young people is not suitable for old people , to party every time you could , to play and move all the time . so every age ha it own style , it own magic , it own enjoy .
