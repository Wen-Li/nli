do you think that the best thing is to travel with a tour guide ? thats agood question . i one of the larg forest there wa agrop of people with out a guide and they have been loste in the forest so all of theme dead when they lost . for that agree with that thing because several reason . the first reason , that he now the plase and the good plases . the guide will let you se the best plases there . for exsampl , in the city he will let you ee the famouse plases like musiums . thats what will let heme very intreting . another reasone , that he will let you never be lost . you will have fun without afraide of geting lost at all in the country . if you be alon you must ask the poeple about the diriction , or the plases to have fun in it . he will be help ful with that thing . he will speek ith them and you can learn from him . last reason , that you will be without responseblity . when you want to do any thing he know every thing and he will do it and you will not hink how to do it , or where to do this thing . however , some poeple will say that if you travel alone you will have alot of fun . they also say that you will know the way , and you will learn alot of thing . for example , you will learn the cultur of othere country , and you will learn who to speek . not only that you will find it exsited . in conclusion , you can say that traveling with a guide is more better than traviling alone . in my opinion the guide is the best thing in the travel to be spicifice . these are some of the reason that you can have when you travel with a guide .
