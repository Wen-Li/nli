there is no doubt that advetisements specially today look much more attractive than the quality of the product itself . in my opinion this statement is correct . while many other people may have different opinion . from these people point of view , making good advetisement can encourage people to at least try this product . so this product may be good and they buy it afterthat . but if the method of advertisement is not good and not interesting to people , this will lead to failure of the advertised product . so they see that the advertisement must be better than the product at least till people try it a it 's the first step for the product to succeed . in my opinion this is not correct advertisement for a definite thing , but it 's called cheating . the sincerety in advertisement must be considered for the general benefit . if the advertisement did n't reflect the actual property of the product , this would lead to a bad reputation and so death of the product by time . in my life i have an example that make me aggressive about these type of advertisement . for instance , one day there is an advertisement about new meter for measuring blood glucos level . they said that it 's the most accurate one and it needle cause no pain at all , etc . .. then we bought it for my father who is diabetic . we started to use it and every time it give good and exellent reading about sugar level . suddenly , one day my father dropped on the floor . when we picked him to the hospital we surprised about his sugar level which is very high . as a result it causd serious complication to him specially on heart . in a nut of shell , it 's right when you say that the product are not really good a their advertisement introduce them . so , my advice is never to buy any new product except after it 's thrown in the market for a longtime and wa tried by many people .
