nowadas , advertisemnts become a very hot topic that everyone want to discus it . some people think that advertisement are quite good ; however , others think that most advertisement make product seem much beetter than they really are . from my point of view , i agree with the second opinion . first of all , the purpose of the advertisement lead the businessman to lie to audience . there are a lot of same product in the maket . every businessman want to sale their own product and make money . why people buy their product ? they can persude consumer to buy their product by making the advertisement . however , if they do not describe the product much better than they really are , consumer will not buy this product , so thay the businessman will not sale the product and make the money . secondly , the famous people like to make money by telling the lie to audience . people are always very curiostiy . they want to know more about the live of sport star , singing star , moive star . one way to know the famous people better is to buy the product which they introduce by the advertisement . the producer know that people always believe what the famous people say . for example , a famous movie star in hong kong tell the audience that use this mask wil let you look like 10 year younger in a mask advertisement . after watching this advertisement in the tv , a lot of woman go to the shop to buy this mask . alll wise audience notice what the movie star say will not come true . there are still many people believe this advertisement . three month latere , a news report that this mask is very harmful to woman and it will be banned to sale . in conclusion , it is true that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . in order to be a wise consumer , you need to know what is real and you can not believe everything the famous people say .
