i think that young people enjoy life more than old people . there is lot of reason for this which are genrally based on advantage of being young . let me explain these reason one by one . first of all young people not a experienced a old one . because they are lack of experience , everything appears something new to them and they enjoy dicovering these new thing . for example for a young people to go to a new country can be so much enjoyable because he is doing something new . a new experience which may create unfamilliar feeling . but on the other hand it is not that much attractive for an old man who had this kind of experience several time . secondly young people have le responsibility which give them more fredom . a young people generally only have his or her responsibility . so he can make his program without depending to others . he do n't need to take care of a baby or shedule his holiday acording to child 's school like old people . fredom is also one of the key word that make life more enjoyable . an other reason is energy of young people . the energy of young people also an advantage which make them enjoy life more than olders . when people are young they have energy to do everything . at it is not only an individual advantage . as all young pepole have this energy they can create more positive atmosphere than older people can . so they can also benefit from this advantage by using synergy of group . they can make party till late hour , dance and laugh all together . they are capable of this activity with their long lasting energy . as a conclusion it is obvious that young people have so much advantage to enjoy the life more than old people but there is no need to feel jelious about it . in fact sooner or later young peop will get older . a once older people were young .
