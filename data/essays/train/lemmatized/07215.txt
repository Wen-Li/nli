i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . many company will do any possible thing for their advertisement to make their product much more popular in the society , but do not care about the real value of the produsts . there are million of kind of advetisements on tv , radio , newspaper , magzines , or even mail . these various picture and commits of the product are seemed much better than they really are . it is because that the company want to make their product more popular in the society . for instance , burgerking will make advertisement to show how healthy their burger or frech fry are ; however , the fact is that any junk food is no good for health . the advertisement about toy are the most popular one on the tv , since kid can not read yet and the careness parent always make their kid ' requirement come ture ; the company of toy are make million of cartoon character or game which based on the cartoon every year . but sometimes the real produsts are not a valuable a the commercial show on the tv . it mean that the company do not respect the consumer ' right to purchase right and great product . on the other hand , advertisement of mechane of shape wonderful body are always fake , that nobody could just use the mechanes for several month to recreate their bodise which heritate from their parent . according to the health knowledge , a person 's body shape determened by the heritation from his/her own parent ; the excercise can only help the person to make his/her body much more healthier and stronger . thus , most of the advertisement contain many fakeness , people should be aware about the negetive effect of the advertisement . meanwhile the company should carefully think about the real purpose of making advertisement .
