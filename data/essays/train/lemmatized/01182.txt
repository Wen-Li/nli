indeed , advertissement is one of the best way to reach people . but some advertissements seem the most time much better than they are really are . in my opinoin , i agree with this statement for thesis two reason : the use of very good commercial and also the use of the celebrity person in the commercial . first of all , many advertisement have a really good commercial which can convince the people. , like one of the biggest problem in the usa is obesity , many of tho commercial which want a sell a product can use a naturally skinny person to make people believe that a soon a htey will get this product they might looklike this person . for example the increase of the production of numerous medicine to loose weight in this contry is a proof that is work but at the same time the usa still one of most important contry which ha problem with weight . second of all , ther is a huge use of celebrity in the advertissements that give a false image of what a product is really is . for instance , the last campaing of proactiv solution which is suppose to help to relieve acne . personnaly , i love jessica simpson who is a singer and actress . so when i saw in the commercial , i thought why not use this is my idol us this ' it might work for me too . so ' i use the product and im still using it but there is not such a big change like i tought . thus , i think that a good commercial and a use of a known person make more product look better than they are really are . people should start to stop believe in those advertissements at hundred percent because sometimes it can work and sometimes it might not .
