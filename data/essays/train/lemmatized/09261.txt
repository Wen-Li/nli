for a long time the education wa and continue to be very complex . how is the best way to learn , how is the best way to understand ? there ha only one way or various way to learn ? perahps the best people who can answer at this differents question are the student . an important question it is to know how make young people be interested in the thing , to be interested in learning ? for me , the best way is to understand idea and concept . indeed , learns fact are very boring and a lot of time , you forget quickly what you learn . young people need to think by themself , we need to use our bread , to analyse and ask ourself a lot of question to understand the why of the how . when you learn fact in a book , everything it explains , you have a lot of time the personal opinion of the author . this opinion will influence your thinking and make you being a lazy person , you will not have the will to find some others explanation or others way to understand behind the line in your book ! to ask you question about an idea or a concept will increase your curiosity and your real satisfaction to understand an idea . when you just learn about an author , you can have a good memory and explain his opinion but when you understand a conception you will use your personal word to explain something that you understand and it will increase your curiosity to know and know . in conclusion , i thing that young people need that we encourage their intelligence to appear , their curiosity to increase in trying to explain them the big concept and the main idea and let they looking for explainations and solution . learn fact at nowadays showed that it do not help u to learn about our fault but perhaps thinking and analzsing by ourself will help u to understand better every past fact .
