i agree that most advertisement make product seems to be much more better than they really are concerning the material used and satisfaction to consumer . useing a below average material in some product and advertise it the best . for example , a hire dryer that will be bought and in the next day it is burned . the seacond reason is consumer satisfaction . seeing an advertisment about a very comfortable and wonderfull car for example and when rideing it it 's completlly the opposite . in conclusion , not all advertisement are true . it 's all about selling there product in other word it 's about mony . consumers are the last in there task .
