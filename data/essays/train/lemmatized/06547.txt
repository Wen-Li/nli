i believe and i have observed that successful people always try new thing and more importantly do not hesitate to take risk . this is the way how people see and meet new opputunities waiting somewhere to pick it up . eventhough trying new thing and being open to change are fearfull to most people , i think this is the one seperating those who govern and others who are governed . i also strongly believe that taking risk is the key to success espicially in busuness . for example , my big brother resigned from his job in turkey and went to united states for his graduate study . some people who never want to try new thing and always doing the same stuff forever blame dmy brother a foolish because he wa trying something new and taking risk . however , in the long term , my brother completed his study in the us and now ha become a director in an oil company currently running in russia and making a lot of money . those who blamed my brother still do the same job with fixed salary and closed vision . now the world in which we are living ha become a small village and is changing in every hour in term of rule and way which we live \ which we do business , and so on . even if we do not want to try new thing , i believe , the current condition are forcing u to change , try new thing and taking risk . i have several friend doing business in different part of the country . i clearly certain that those who did new thing addressing taste and preference of custoners , for instance , have been winner at the end of the day . nevertheless , some of my friend who do not like taking risk lost their business . i have an specific but trategic example with one of my friend doing s'lver business in ankara . i strongly urged him that he had to try new market especially foreign market for his product he wa producing . in addition , he gad to take some risk for losing money . he chose his old way and avodid new thing . unfortunuately . his business is noe dead . in summury , i am in favor of trying new thing and taking risk . so that we will be able to improve our personel attidutes and busnisses . this is the way how we can prepare ourselves for future .
