i agree with this statement . young people can do what ever they want . the old peole cant judje them becuse they are young . they can go to club , date weman , dancie with everyone , and the youn people cant finguer the life in this age . i think when they coumplete 25 year old mybe he can finguer how it the life hard and how can handdle with it . the old people take every thing responsblity and they cannt joke in every thing a young people . the old people love quite place and stay alone sometimes . they just talking about the past and what did they do in them life . but the young people can joke in every thing and they can talke with you about what ever you want . but if the young people dont know what you aere talking about they will not join in the counverstation . the old people they talking about every thing and they think they knew every thing in the life . the young people travel to enjoy in their life and they want to know about the others counteres . the old people feel lazy and hate travel or go any where . if you ask any old person about what wa the best age you enjoy your time ? . i think almost of them will answer when they were young and when they did every thing in their life . the young people know that when they come old they cant do what they are doing in them age now .
