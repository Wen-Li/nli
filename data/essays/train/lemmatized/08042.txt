i agree with the statement , that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than memorizing fact . in the following paragraph i will give you reason and an example why i am convinced of the correctness of the statement . first of all , it 's true , that in any field of study there is always some kind of `` must know '' fact , that a student ha to know . apart form this one can always look up detailed information in a book , on the internet or any other reliable source of information . thus , learning fact is a practice to train your memory but it wo n't allow you to solve complex problem where you need a structure and a concept to follow . thats why learning or even memorizing fact doe n't make sense from an economical point of view : you waste your energy , time and `` storage '' with learning thing that you can look up anytime you need them . as an example you could take historic date : what if a student could tell you every date of battle on european territory between the 15th and the 19th century but ca n't conclude any connection with international relation in that time from these fact . it would certainly help him win an award in memorizing , but he would never be able to understand or tell others why european territory wa subject to so many change in the last century . instead , a student should take care to capture all the general idea , concept and method taught in class . concepts and idea are easier to reuse if you understand them correctly . as a student of business administration i can tell that fact can be very important , and if this is the case you should be very accurate . but in general i would agree , that it is more important to understand the idea and concept behind the fact , than mere fact that you will forget the second you learned them .
