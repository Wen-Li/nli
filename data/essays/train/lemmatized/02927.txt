money human being live on the world for thousand year , but they all live for the same thing , to earn money . every morning people go their job to earn money . everyone ha a different job suach a ; cooker , teacher , driver , ... etc . also there are people who owns a industry . they produce different product on their industry but they all try to produce the best of it . there are also people who cheat while they are working . for example they show their product much better than they really are like some newspaper publisher . some publisher say that our newspaper have different subject or different aspect or topic for news , but when you buy that newspaper you see it that they are the same with other newspaper . to sell their product they lie to people to show their product much better than they really are . i disagree to this following statement because those people who are trying to earn money by showing their product seem much better than they really are cheater , and those people are not working on equal way . i mean everyone is equal on the world and no one ha a right to lie to sell more prodcuts of they produced . this is not fair . this is the reason that i disagree to the statement . maybe the reason is those people make product seem much better than they really are to earn more money by making people buy their product but this can not be an excuse . i belive that people must not cheat or lie to earn more money , because these thing can cause big problem to those people . for example if people learns that industry owner are lie to sell more prdocuts those people stop buying those product so those industry owner stop earning money .
