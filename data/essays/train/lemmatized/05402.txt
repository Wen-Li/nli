i agree to the statement that young people do not have enough time to help out their community . there are many reason attached to this statement . the modern world ha become very busy and commercial . people work for time , the more time they work the more they are paid , this is directly proportional . let u start the discussion from root level . at a very tender age child are sent to the school , where they go in the morning and come back in the evening . slowly the student get habituated to living that his / her parent show . when they finish their metriculation they are joined in higher study and this go on for five to six year . after his completion of the graduation he is placed in any big company or in any field that he is interested in . from the above metioned data it clear that the people do not get enough time to their personal time for the community . most of the young people work for the multi national company which do not provide you the time to spare for extra curricular activity . the people of this generation have become workaholic . no body care for the society . they do their thing money oriented which for them is the primary thing . people of this generation think that there is governmant to look after the thing about the community . but they do not understand the simple fact that `` team work means more we and less me '' . there are very few people who you can count on your finger who care for the society and their community . it is because of these people that the world is still alive . the young generation ha become more family oriented and care least for their community . i here by conclude my discussion that the corporate culture ha slowly but surely imbibed into every one of u which ha given le chance to serve their community . i sincerely hope that people would realise the fact that every body should live happily . this only happens when you serve your community atleast inch to it success .
