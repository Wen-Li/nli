while we start learning something , we have to understand the idea and concept first . it seems to be critical for u to learn those thing first so that we can build the foundation of what we are going to learn . actually , if we just understand the concept or idea and we do n't understand the fact . eventually , we are not really learning something . from my point of view , to understand idea and fact are both important . there are wide variety of example in our daily life can prove my view point . i am taking psychology class right now . last week , my teacher talked about how to analyze dream . i got to learn the basic concept of analyzing dream . when i understood the concept , i wrote down one of my dream to my teacher . then , she analyzed it for me . as a result , it wa not really accurate about what i thought and what i wa going to do . then , she told me that fact and concept might not be the same ; therefore , we had to learn both . on the othe hand , if we are going to learn sport . first of all , we will learn concept and how to play . then , we will get to learn skill . can we just learn the concept and we will be good at it ? we must practice and play game so that we can learn the fact that what will it really happen while a game . we may not be able to use all the idea while we play the game . to conclude , student must understand both idea and fact . those are crutial for out learning . we ca n't lack either one during our learning process .
