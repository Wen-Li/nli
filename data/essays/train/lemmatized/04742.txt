on the one hand , i think that learning fact can be an advantage for student since they can have a sort of role model to help them understand the fact . they can easily learn how to do thing by learning what someone before them did . they can easily make out the person 's mistake and see what went wrong and what not to do if they want to succed . but on the other hand , i believe that understanding idea and concept is way better for student because if one want to repeat something , it would be easier for him if he ha understood what he want to do instead of juste copying something he ha learned . in that way , he can avoid making the same mistake . furthermore , he will be able to shape his own personality and we know that it is generally upheld that someone with a lot of personality is better treated than someone plain who just follows the flock . here in france , the way philosophy is taught to student is very peculiar . indeed , in france , student are n't only taught the doctrine of the author but they are also taught to become philosopher . i know that can sound ambitious and risky but i think that it 's an exellent way to shape the student ' spirit . instead of just teaching them doctrine that they do n't reaaly care about , they are told what the philosopher said but also what they think about that . they do n't have to simply learn by heart some doctrine that they do n't really understand , they are also askek to react to that doctrine and to say wether they agree or not . i think that 's great because no matter how intelligent and brilliant these philosopher were , we ca n't reaaly take all they said for garnted . as student and even a human being we have to react towards some doctrine sucha a nietzch 's . we can really learn what he said and believe that he is right just because he wa a smart man . indeed , let 's not forget that hitler wa inspired by him and used his work in order to justify nazism . furthermore , the great philosopher , aristotle , thought that slavery wa natural . all in all , what we can say is that a student , we can take all that our teacher tell u for granted . we absolutely have to think by ourselves and must not simply lear fact . thinking by ourselves will help u in the future for example when we will have to vote .
