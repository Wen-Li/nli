i agree with this topic . there are so many people and community in this world . community is the one of the most important thing in our life . however , it ha been changing thesedays . there are some of my opinion . first , i heard that the people whose age is over than middle age have helped their community , since they were teenager . it is good for human being because community also helped them . what i would like to explain is that childlen were not raised by only their family , but also thier community . young people nowadays want to be with friend rather their community even their family . it sound fun but they ca n't learn anyting from older people . they have been losing some oppotunity to be mature . unfortunatly , i have seen a lot of bad news done by teenager on tv nowadays . it mean , the young people have been getting rude and impolite . it is not good when they have to be independent . as a conclusion , young people should have time to help thier community , and learn a lot of thing from older people . it will be good in this world .
