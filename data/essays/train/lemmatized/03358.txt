when i wa a student , i met with different kind of student . some of them like to give some of their time in order to help their community , and some student do not . however , i agree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community and this is because of many reason . first of all , they depend mostly on the their superior to accomplish their own work . for example , in nursing profession , you will notice that joniors depend on senior to acheive their own work . another point , the developement of highly advanced technique and machine , such a internet , computer and so on , make these young people to depend on these equipment and to decrease focusing to help their community . moreover , they do n't take any responsibilies for any work they are doing and this is because of fully depending on the others so if they are not taking responsibility for their work , how they will help their community . another one is that le guidance that should be given by the other expert people . for example , some senior nurse tend to see mistake while the jonior nurse give health education but they will keep quite without correcting her mistake . in addition , le expert teacher are available nowadays to direct these student to the proper direction and to encourage them to give some of their time to help their community . finally , the family play a major role in keeping this feature in their child . at the end , taking all of these reason in consideration will help to have people who care about giving part of their own time to help their community and to build stronge community that can face any problem .
