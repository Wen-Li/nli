in my opinion it better for me to specialize in one specific subject , because if i specialized in many academic subject i 'll get distracted and i would'nt manage to pas in all of the subject for example i wanted to study general mass communication but when i thought about it i figured that i ca n't manage to to study four subject , so i pictured my self for future and i thought that advertsing would be very good for me if i passed my toel hopefully , and some of the people have job i mean part time job so their job make studying harder for them , and am not saying that if people want to have broad knowlege of many academic subject is wrong , half of the people can manage and the other half ca n't , thats why people should know thier ability of understandig and wroking hard unless they should specialize in one subject , but i dont mind trying to study more than one subject and if i do handle it i will continue it very good to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , it is very usefull for future and for your future job and you will have the apportunity to work in so many field if you did n't like a job you can move from it and go work in other job but a i said people should know thies ability if they can or if they ca n't so they could manage themselves .
