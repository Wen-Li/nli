i agree with the successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i know and heard many example about this kind of thing . i think a really successful person must be smart and honest . they can be successed in this area , because they know how to be successd in this area , but a man can not always stay and do now go forward . successful people always want to be success in diffrent area , so they can prove themselves that they are really should be successed . first , i think many peple heard that some popular movie star or singer also doing their own business , such a have a resteruant , clothes store , hotel and so on . movie star and singer they earnd too much money than others , why they should do these thing , they need more money ? or they have too much money so they just do it for fun ? i think they just want to show people that they can do everything like a regular person , they are not only have good looking or beautiful voice , they can also be succesed in other area . actually , many of them also did very good business . so i think successful people try new thing and take risk can prove themselves that they are not just lucky , or maybe they need more money . secondly , i readed in the newspaper , a man he is really a successful business man , he is so rich , but he always try the new thing . the man had many hotel , these hotel are all five star hotel , and they are so famous all over the world . but the man open a travelling company , this is a really good idea , because first of all he can let the traveler live in his hotel , and the secondly he can earnd more money from the travelling . now he did very good job in travelling company . after i readed this new , i really think the man is so smart , there are many travelling company and many hotel , why they can not be success but the man did both . last but not least , people can be successed not because they are just lucky , because they work more harder than others . a successful person can always be successful if he can catch the good chance , and use this chance to be successul .
