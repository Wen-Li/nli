in my opinion in twenty year we will see more and more car than we can see today . today we have big pollution and enviromental problem and we experience every year dramatical disaster but actually i think that this would n't stop the trend to have even more car circulating around the world . i am not happy about this , i am only realistic . emerging country like china and india , that were really poor any year ago , are now growhing incredibly fast and they need a lot of resourses and transport . they do n't care ( for the moment ) about pollution problem , they want car . for the moment i do n't see a valid alternative to car . it could be that in future we will assist at a change in the material that give the power to our car . the oil resource is another important problem thesedays but the technology progress is running fast and maybe in twenty year we will put water in the fuel tank . someone could think that with the spread use of computer an the presence everywhere of the internet we dont'need anymore to go away
