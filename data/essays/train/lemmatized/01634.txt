i agree with the statement '' the best way to travel is in group led by a tour guide . before someone travel to a place about which he doe n't know anything , he ha to have an organized plan for his trip . if he did n't have a plan , he would miss a lot of thing . the best way to have a guranteed and accomodative plan is to let the tour guide do it for many reason . first of all , the tour guide is a specialist and and know about the place more than the ordinary person . the tour guide wo n't miss any place that is worth of visiting . the ordinary person might not have the ability to know all the nice place that have to be visited . the second reason is that the tour guide save the time and the effort that the person would spend looking for the tourism place . this will make him use every hour and day of his travel without missing any in thinking where to go and in sitting plan . moreover , travelling in group is a llot of fun . it is better than travelling a lone . the travel time becomes shorter by making friendship with the other people at the trip . when people travel in group , they have nice memory with each other more than if they travel a lone . group travel with a tour guide leader also reduces the possibility of getting lost , robbed or involved in a danger . the tour guide would be trained to solve such matter while the individual might get in trouble and doe n't know how to deal with the people in that country . the language also an important issue . if the person did n't know to speak the language of the country to where he is travelling , he would have many trouble and difficulty communicating with the people there , but if he travelled with a group and with a tour guide , they would help him to communicate and also learn from them .
