now i know that i 'm young and i think this life stage is the most joyful , interesting , and exciting than others . such a stage , twenty-year-old piriod , i think there is a lot of stimulating thing . also young people have much more energitic than older people . do older people go clubing ? i do n't think so . but in each life stage , there is a lot of suitable thing to peple . in this time , my opiniom is young people enjoy life than older people do . i think most of peple think older people have already done any enjouyable thing but my opinion is not like that . of course , some older peple are enjoying their life with much more energitic power than young people . but what i want to say is the amount of time that young people spending more than older people do . now we have really a lot of time . and also older people sometimes say do whatever you want a earlyer a you can do . that is , i think , one of answer in this discussion . i think in each stage there is also desire , but they ca n't afford to do what they actually want because of no time . i think if older people who are marrige , it is more difficult than they are not . on the other hand , in my country , japan , the population of older people is increasing . it is kind of serious problem in the society . but real older people , eighty-year-old , have their free time and reluxing place in the public . we have to care about middle of older people . they are living just working . it is the biggest proglam .
