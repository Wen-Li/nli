having a chance to travel is most definitely one of the thing people prefer to do a a way to relax , rest and enjoy intercultural experience . of course this all depends on the nature of the trip , so this essay will restrict itself to `` pleasure traveling '' exclusively . in my opinion traveling in a group led by a tour guide is a good or bad option depending on the real purpose of the trip a well a on the traveler 's preference and personality . if the traveler or traveler are seeking an intercultural experience and do not resent being told were and when to go , then a group led by a tour guide is most definetely a good option . a guide will show them to all the right place and not only that , but he or she will provide pertinent information regarding the historical , cultural and/or artistical background of such place . this may enhance their entire traveling experience . another good reason why people may prefer traveling in group is safety . visiting an entirely different country where they might not be able to communicate may scare some people . having a guide a an interpreter and mediator might encourage taking the trip . the cultural shock is therefore decreased . some people might also enjoy traveling in group since they might get a chance to interact with different people and make friend during the trip . finally , having a tour guide can help reduce cost ( assuming transportation is provided ) and may also help reduce lost time ( time spent in getting to know the place and moving around ) . on the other hand , if the place targeted to visit lack all the cultural background that a tour guide might provide ( for example a beach ) , then maybe a guided trip may not be necessary . the decision also depends on the person 's personality . some people dislike traveling in group , having to follow strict time schedule , and following rule . if their trip is planned specifically for leisure and rest , then maybe a hectic touring shedule might not be a good idea . some people resent not being able to have their privacy or having to spend money on a guide when the `` can get around place by themselves '' . in conclusion , i believe that `` the best way to travel '' , having or not having a tour guide , depends entirely on the traveler and purpose of the trip . people wishing to travel should evaluate these thing carefully before engaging in a trip that may or may not be led by a tour guide .
