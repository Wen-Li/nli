i agree that in twenty year , there will be fewer car than there are today . owing to the over-crowding of road and highway and lack of enough parking space in large-cities and the global warming effect due to the fuel-missions , authority concerned in advanced country around the world would plan on taking of a lot of car off the road or atleast reduce their number a such . cars consume too much fuel , fuel in the form of kerosense , petrol , diesel . and their natural resouces like the crude-oil reserve are fast depleting . so , the number of car are more likely to be decreased in a few year down the lane in order to cut down the fuel consumption . countries/nations would invest in building rail road infrastructure and build a wider and larger sophisticated network of railroad for inter-city and intra-city connection . this will happen in 20 year from now . rail road provide very efficient public transportation and this option naturally replaces car . public transportation like fuel efficient bus , tram will increase so a to serve the society 's transportation need and hence people are le likely to be inclined to fancy themselves with a new car . bicycles , tri-cycles offer a very eco-friendly alternative a a personal mode of transportation for travelling lesser distance . traffic problem due to too many car on the highway is viewed very cautiously by the dept of transportation in many city . so , the only solution to cut down the traffic during peak time is to discourage people to buy card and encourage public transportation like bus , tram , commuter-trains . air-travel will increase and there will be airport at most smaller town and city and this enable people to reach their destination faster . airline network will be increased with better connection and better flight to serve the passenger need in twenty year from now . scientists have already spoken a lot about the deleterious effect of global warming which is caused due to the dangerous fuel emission from the car . so , to check this , governments will plan , strategise and draft a plan to find global solution to this problem . this will result in fewer car in 20 year from now . cars may however remain a main mode of personal/family transportation now , but in twenty year , there will be fewer car in use which would result in a better enviroment across the globe and the world will be a lot cleaner and healthier .
