young people enjoy life more than older people do ? yes , i agree with this opinion . obviously , today we enjoy our live more than older generation , because we face a differnet time . first , with the development of our society , the young people have more chance to learn about different life in this planet by tv program , internet or another medium . young man always ha a great interested in the new thing . they like to enjoy different life and eager to get more amazing experience . for example , in china so many older people cost so many time to care for their grandchild , or stay at home to watch tv . they always enjoy this kind of life and do not want to change again . but for young people , they can invite some friend to climb mountain or drive car to someplace , even though they have no much money . they don not want to waste their time when they are young . second , a we all konw , in china the older generation must work harder and harder , because our parent were not rich and they must earn more money to support their family . they spent their time in working . when they want to enjoy the rest of life , they have already had no time or no interest about something . but now so many young people were born in good family , they can enjoy their life a they want , because their family can afford their consum . in recent year , so many young boy were sent to aborad to study by their parent . under the help of their parent , they can enjoy a new life in forigen country , they can do anything if they want to do . that is a big differnece between young generation and older generation in china . according to these example , we found that the young people live in more good condition and good famlies . they can choose their life and enjoy more than their parent .
