i will agree the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' the people who try new thing will get more chance to be successful in these new thing . they also can build a good interest in their life . finally , they can lead our society to a higher level . people try new thing and take risk will have a higher chance to achieve their goal . they are the first people who take the opportunties to try and research these thing . for sure they are so brave and never give , so , they will keep trying and trying until they finally work out they won goal . when these people finish they new thing and risk , and success at them , they will enjoy the taste of them . this taste is what they are looking for while they are taking the risk , at last , they ca n't get out of this taste and keep trying other new thing . for example , edison and newton never stop after he ha invented light-ball . those people much be high educated , knowledgable and skillful . they need to use their skill and knowledgabel to solve the problem that exit during the research . on one hand , other people can use the new knowledge that they have found , and use this thing to up-date theirselves . on the other hand , those people have already high educated . they can open a course or a programe to our sociey and pas the knowlege to younger generation . basicly , that will blance the society and bright our society to a hight level . people try new thing and take risk have more advantage than the people who only doing what they already know how to do well . for these people who keep doing the old thing , out knowledge and society wo n't be improved . so i agree the statement .
