i strongly believe that that the student must understand idea and concept about a partricular topic and subject rather than just learn fact without understanding anything . it is most important for the student to first understand the content of the subject because one can not know about the topic of the subject without understanding anything about the idea and concept of the subject . just craming about anything is a wishful thing without understanding the subject . for example i a student of chemistry , in chemistry there are various type of complicated and difficult theory , law and reaction . if i can not understand the basic concept of the reaction how can i learn it and though chemical reaction are so much tough , and complicated no one can learn it and write in the examination without understanding the basic concept about the chemical reaction that is how it happens ? , how the reaction proceeds ? and what are the product formed after the completion of chemical reaction . for example take the process of formation of rust in iron , no student can learn it fact without understanding the basic concent of rusting of iron and i am sure that no student can learn it chemical reaction without understanding what are the compound involved in the rusting of iron and what is the formula of the reactant and product formed in the process of rusting of iron if the student doe n't know name of the reactant and product in the rusting of iron then how can he or she knoes the formula and the most important thing in knowing the formula is to first know the symbol of the element involved in the compound of rectants and product . the reactant involved in the rusting of iron are ferric oxide , oxygen , water in the form of moisture and they all combine to form ferrisoferric oxide known a rust . so for this to learn and write in the examination the student first ha to understand the proceess and condition involved in the rusting of iron and the student must know the symbol of the element involved and then only the student can write the formulea of all the reactant and product involved in the rusting of iron . in this way the student can explain the process of rusting of iron and write it properly in the exam by understanding the basic idea and concept involved in this particular process of risting of iron . in the same way the student can write the chemical reaction of the process of photosynthesis by understanding that it invoves oxygen and carbondioxide to form carbohydrate thus all branch of science can only be studied by understanding ideasn and concept
