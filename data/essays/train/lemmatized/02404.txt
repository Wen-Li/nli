it is commonly stated the the only part of the human life when you can enjoy yourself is when you are young , and several writer and philosopher wrote about that topic : actually i do n't agree with this statement for two main reason . in the first place , asd they feel to have plenty of time , young people usually can waste their time in something that later can reveal a something trivialor not worth doing . i remember having spent entire day watching tv , alone in my room , rather than going out with my friend for a walk , or to have refused to practicee a sport just because i wa too lazy . now that i 'm busy and i do n't have spare time , i really feel a i had waste my time . on the other side , young people have to think seriously about their future , and in many case , in order to accomplish their objective , they can not waste time or money to enjoy life . for example , if you are studying at university and want to have good result , you have to sacrifice your time to study , or , even if you have plenty of time , you do n't have the money to enjoy yourself . if you want to marry , you have to save money and this mean that you have to sacrifice many pleasure of life . on the contrary , older people can frrely enjoy their life : at the present time , while i 'm busy studying in order to enter in my phd program , my parent are travelling around the world with their friend and enjoying their hobby . i think they are really enjoying their life , not only beacuse they have gained , after year of sacrifice , the time and money to do it , but also because they have the capacity to recognize the thing that the really can make their life pleasant and worth being lived . consequently , they are able to place everything the right dimension . i think it is possible to gain this capacity only with experienceand in some way , both young people wasting time and young peolple sacrifying themselves for the future can later become able to fully enjoy the life .
