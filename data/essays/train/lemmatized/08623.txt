the issue at hand is wheter young people work enough for their community . this issue is important because working for the community help to develop social skill . i believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . first , young people nowadays are more interested in having fun than in helping their community . for example , young people like doing a lot of sport or going out with friend . beside these activity , there is no more time for community work . second , young people have to work hard in their job . the competition ha become harder and harder . to keep your job , you have to be focused on it completely . community work would keep you away from your work . many of the young people avoid this kind of activity for this reason . thrid , many of the young people are a little bit selfish nowadays . john f. kennedy said once : `` you do n't have to ask what your nation can do for you , you have to ask what you can do for your nation ! '' unfortunately , a lot of young people are more interested what they can get from the society rather than contribute themselves to the positive development of their community . a good example for the changing attidtude towards community work is the swiss army : by law , every swiss man ha to join the army . but , in fact , more than 40 % of the young men are released from military service . many of them just do not want do military service because it is inconvenient . finally , the image of the community work ha changed in the last few year . whereas in earlier time people working for the community were regarded a very respectful member of the society , a lot of people are laughing at them nowadays . today it is much more important to have a lot of money and to be very succesful in the job . to sum up , i believe that the young people nowadays do not help enough their community . there are different reason for that , a i mentioned , but i do not think this development
