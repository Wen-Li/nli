in general i agree with this statement . when are too frighted to beginn new project , activity or somethink else , you do n't give yourself the chance to develop . in my opinion especially in a business environment you could have no success without new idea and inovations every day . you must face challanges every day . if you just relaxe and do only the think you already know , your competitor wo n't give you a chance . in the modern society you always have to be the best . you must be the owner of many ability . if your mind is not open you ca n't have any success . when you regarde famous successful people , like ... for example , they all had idea and no fear to fight for them . but on the other hand , if you do the thing you know well you are getting better and better . at least , i would say , you have to be open for new thing but you also should improve the ability in the think you already know .
