i do not agree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and cocepts than it is for them to learn facts. '' , because this statement generalizes that idea and concept are always more important than fact . as a student there are always class that contain for huge part of fact , for example history . other subject , for example psychologie , concentrate on idea that have to be prooven later on . in deed it is important to always have a general idea what somebody is explaining and to understand how a concept work , but using a concept practically without having the knowledge of the important fact around and behind the idea is mostly not possible . for example : it is good to understand the concept of a war , but that includes not from when till when it actually happend , what the factic conseqences were . a concept is always just fifty percent of reality , the other fifty percent are the fact that set it into context . on the otherhand would it be almost useless to collect all the fact about for example the second world war , if you have no idea about the cause ; the idea and concept each party of this war had . with only one , fact or concept it is neither possible to completly understand something nor to make the step from the idea to reality . therefore my opinion is , that understanding a concept is for student a important a the fact surrounding the concept . both must be understood to realize a topic .
