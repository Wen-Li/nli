according to my opinion , school should be the place where student are thought and made understood the idea and concept . the idea and concept should be explained to them clearly and then the student should be made to think on them . when they think . they are going to internalise the idea and concept and they are going to see their reflection in their daily life . i think that , only teaching fact to the student , make them lose the main point of the subject . in other word , teaching fact about a subject in a class , not making student understand the vital part of the concept or idea first , is just like saying the first word that must be kept until the end . i think that this make the whole illusion and the interest to the subject disappear . of course fact must be thought to the student later , after explaining the idea and concept clearly in detail . in addition , i think that understanding the concept and idea , affect the ceativity of student in a positive way . this allows student to think on the subject and generate their own idea about the concept . teaching fact and demanding these from student a a feedback in the examinatins or what else , make student memorize the material and show them without any comment . in conclusion , i agree that it more is more important for student to understand idea and concept . i do not ignore the importance of teaching fact , but i believe that in an education system , it should come after understanding the concept .
