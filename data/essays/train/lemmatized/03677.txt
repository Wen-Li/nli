what would you think of an old man who play video game ? one of the most popular way of having fun in these day is playing video game , but seeing an old man playing a video game would be totally wierd and rare , the other hand people between the age of 11-22 usually spend their time playing video game . in my opinion , young people enjoy leife more than older people do for the two following reasions : old people have experansed a lot of thing and they got used to their own stayle in life and the . first of all , all the oldmans were once young , and young people passed through a lot of new thing until he become an old , and at some point , people start to got sick of lerning new thing , and therefor they start to stop doing most of the funny thing that they used to do when they were young and this what make an oldman 's life boring and young people life more enjoyable . second of all , a people grew they usually start some hapets at the age of 18 , and they start doing that hapet everyday a they grow , until the point that this hapet become a rotten in their life that later on they refuse to change it into any thing new even if the new thing wa better and more benfical then their hapet in conclusion , in my opinion young people enjoy their life more then old people because they usually try new thing , but because the older people have experansed a lot of thing and they get uesed to their life stayle dont usually try new thing even though the new thing maight be more interasting then theire old hapet .
