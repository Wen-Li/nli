i definately agree with the point , that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already knw how to do well . successful people are not afraid to try new thing , a because they are not afraid of faliure , because faliure is the key to one 's success . for this i support a pre-proposed theory by darwin stated a the `` survival of the fittest '' , according to this theory , only the one how can compete and are the fittest are able to survive in an environment . .. the best habit of successful people is to compete , they compete with other people , not to prove they are smarrter or the other is duller , but they compete to enhance thier skill , take challenge , learn new thing and live life to the fullest . .. successful people are called successful for taking risk and trying new thing . .. a person isint called successful until he ha stood up on his on foot and achieved through his hardowrk/pain . a person who gain his success by cheating/copying/taking help from others , isint really successful . there is only 1 way to sucess , which is hardwork , there is no easy formula , one ha to work towards it , and if u do not expect thing to quickly , you will finally find success . successful men also do not fear of the impossible , for them the word itself doesnt exist , because impossible itself say i 'm possible !! ... a person who back off easily after seeing hurdle , difficulty in his path is a coward and sure not to succed in life success is someting one can not buy/trade . it ha to be attained by one 's self . .. hardwork is the only . a succeded man never fear of the wrong , because one can not be successful until he fails ,,, the other important quality of successful men is the quality to continue ahead . .. successful people do not take faliure a a road bloack in thier life and stop there for-ever . . instead they find way to over come it , and to proceed in thier live 's . . faliure is the begining of success . .. one can never be successful untill he/her hasent failed i life . .. it is from failure what people learn and becomse successful hence i comclude this by saying that , success o written in every one life . . it only depends on u to find the mean to it . .. and the only mean it hardwork . . no matter what you do , shorcuts always lead to downfall of a person . . < < < < < < < < < __ -- ~ ~ -- __the end __ -- ~ ~ -- __ > > > > > > > > >
