i most certainly agree with this statement . as a music teacher myself , of course i want my student to learn their fact , but it is more important for them to understand it . i believe that a student should be able to understand what they just learned because that is why we learn in school . we go to school to learn and understand the material to apply it to our life . if a student did not understand something , then they are not going to be able to use it in life . the best way of knowing what they have been taught is asking them to use it . if they can not use what they had learned , then that mean they do not understand that certain topic . it is absolutely pointless for a student to go to class and just memorize fact . to understand something mean you can use it , teach it to someone , and be able to go further than just '' memorizing '' the fact . to me , in order for any student to excell is for them to be able to use what they know . i am not saying that learning fact are not important for a student , but sometimes there is no point in teaching that topic to the student if it mean they do n't know what just happened . a student can walk in a class and ` learn the fact ' , but that student will come back out with only fact . for example , there is a math student who just learned all the number of a problem . sure , he know all the number , but how in the world the number got to where they are is a completely different matter for the student . that is why teacher today take time to pull thing apart and explain them in detail . this situation can happen in any class . poetry can be read and the student can read it and learn the vocabulary to only read a poem . although to go through the detail of the poem would be much more effective in a student 's literature skill . i do not agree that fact is all we should learn about in life . there is much more to learning than just fact and statistic . being able to truly understand what wa taught is the same a saying , `` okay , i know how to use it now and it definitely make more sense than just memorizing note .
