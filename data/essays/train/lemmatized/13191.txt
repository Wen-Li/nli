i totally agree with the satement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . it is somehow true that successfull people always try to do new thing involving high risk to see their capibility to fight with the world . some people only try new thing because of their high interest innvolved in that particular field . when a new born baby come to this world , he doe not know anything about reading , eating , and other activity of our daily life . as our life move on , the child come to know new thing like how to eat poperly , how to play , how to write , and so on , which help child understand life better . it also help understand people with different belief and opnions . doing what a person already know will not help anyone in any way . for example , if a person ha finished his school and want to become a scientist , he will not be successful and will not reach his goal until he study futher doing some experiment and research . one should always try hard to understand new thing and apply them to their daily life . if a person is unsuccessful in his first attempt , he should not stop practicing thinking that he in uncapable of doing it , however , he should bring some fantasy in himself and should redirect his negative feeling into positive activity . one should always remember the most couraging line that `` practice make a man perfect '' . there is a story of a spider who try to climb a high wall to reach his web . he fall again and again even before he completes half of it way to his web . but he never stop trying having faith that , one day he will reach to the top . his positive attitude towards life and his practice make him successful leading him to to his web one day . this story is a good example
