in my opinion , i think that for student it is more important to understand idea and concept , because the student do n't forget them . for example , i study civil engineer and for preparation my examination , i understand more concept , scientific teory have many concept that elaborated many idea , instead if i learn fact , i must hope that i do n't forget them . when i have starting the university i have find a very good professor that i teach my like understand fully idea and concept , a to do summarize fact in few idea and concept , for have complessive panoramics of the problem . on first time , i worked hard to improve this method , but i have satisfaction while i wa studing and during examination . my memory is not very hard to memorize each idea and cocept so i write each thing . writing help me to recognize and understand idea and concept , another way of understand idea and concept is that recording lesson , conversation and other that is important for my everydays 's life . however is more important understand what there is beyond thing , therefore idea and concept . for example when somebody projectd an object , he us idea and cocepts of theory that him understand . for other student that study in umanistic university , i think that it is more important for them learn fact . infact when they go to examination , they must talk about specific fact , like for example story a civil war , and so they studied specific fact and not only understand idea and concept .
