i do n't agree with this statement . of course you need a little of broad knowledge , especially to be able to talk and understand when you speak with people that are specialized on other field , but you need to be specialized in one specific subject to do well your work , because you need to know that really well , and it 's impossible to be specialized about everythings . also if you know just a specific subject there is really a lot to know . for example , i am a psychologist and there are a lot of field i could work , like developmental , clinical , health , evaluation and others . but everyone of this need a lot of theory and model to know and a lot of experience to do , that take year to be really prepared in just one of these subject . but after all the training if someone ha a problem about what you have specialized you can be sure that you can give him the best support , that you can help him in the best way because you know what you are talking about . instead if you just know a little about everything you ca n't be really helpful but you can just tell to the people where going , usually a specialized centre , to have all the information they need [ that is doing counseling ] . after my degree i worked three year in a department of neuropsychology and until now i ca n't say that i know that subject because it 's really wide , so when someone ha a neuropsychological problem need to talk with another one that did a lot of year studing and working in that field , that know all the acquired brain pathology and all the test to do the right diagnosis and that know also about the rehabilitation , and that is able to explain to the relative what is going on . of course i do n't want to say that you have to know just about one subject , but that you have to be specialized about one subject and know , i.e. in a le specific way , about many .
