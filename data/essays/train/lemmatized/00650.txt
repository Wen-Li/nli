i partially agree with this statement ; according to my opinion people should try new thing a much a possible in order to enlarge their horyzons . that provides more experience which is a very important thing that is useful in facing new or unexpected situation . on the other hand , taking risk could lead to the loss of success that one person ha achieved before . so i think that a reliable way to value a risk is that to think about it consequence . for exaple we can look at economy market . economy market is a well known enviroment where someone can achieve success and easily lose it . in this field you may become richer by following new way of money investment , but if they fail , you would experience what really the word `` risk '' mean . although continue in doing what you know to do well , would take you away from loss of success , the only way to have more is to do more . let 's see another example , which might sound more familiar and could explain why i do n't fully agree with the statement . we can easily aplly the statement to the world of working people . in your working carreer you can follow this two main way : aplly for different work in your life in order to get more experience or aplly for a work that you surely can do well and focusing on it . the second way is better if you would like to achieve success because if you are sure you can do one thing very well , it might be recognized by other people and thenyour carreer may proceed on higher level . on the other hand if you are forced or choose to change work frequently , you wo n't get any valuable success . starting a new experience , in which also we 're not sure to do well , could bring a sense of frustration because the continous shifting among work lead you everytime to the starting point . now it might be clear what i mean when i affirm that i do not fully disagree with the statement : it 's a matter of point of view , some life experience can provide success by risk , other can not .
