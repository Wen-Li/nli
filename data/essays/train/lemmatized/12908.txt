i agree with the following statement . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . in addition , in my opinion , it is hard to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . to learn fact , the student do not need to have their own idea , they just remember these fact and it is really hard because the fact do not have any background , concept , and idea . for example , in the history class , i often just remember the fact , like what happened in 1945 , i just remembered a lot of event in the text book without thinking . as i thought , i got a great score on the test but a few day later , i forgot these event that i remembered . i did not understand about the event at all , just remembered them for the test . i think this is not leanig or studying . i think every thing have reason and result . when i am interested in something that i have not known i always think of the reason and result , not the fact . for instance , in history class , the theacher taught me many thing which have been happened and many people who affected to many thing . i preffer to think about why they did so than what is happened because there is many reason and jenerally it is so complex . it is really interesting to me and i noticed that if i could understand their idea , concept or detail , i never forget these memory . i wa really interested in japanese history and especially , ryouma sakamoto . he is really famous person in japan and he ha many strategy for life . i researched about him and his effect , and i think i could understand his idea and comsepts . now , i never forget about him because i could understand his idea and concept , not only thing that he did . if people want to understand something correctly and deeply , i think people should to understand the idea and concept , not only fact .
