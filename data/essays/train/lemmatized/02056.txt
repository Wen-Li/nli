being of part of the world which show an incrediable growth in every passing second , i find myself a thinking of why turkey is not like in an situation like america in world arena and i truely constracted my idea and thougts on specialization in one specific subjets . i definitly agree the idea of being specialization . i am going to proof it truely . america 's and turkey 's position in global range is simple . turkey is lower at education , health , human right than america . let 's look at education . i am mechanical engineer and when i had find to have chance to look at lecure 's or class note of the equivalent university in america , i wa suprised . the topic and content wa simple that u . the same situation with gmat test which ha to be take for the mba graduate . questions are so simple to qualify to accept the person to graduate . then why they qualify u with simple high-school mathematic question for their graduate study but america is in front of the too many counrtys with it education . i believe the answer is specialization . i learnt too many math , history , science but no one ask me that if i prefer playing chello rather than these too much confusing school subject . of course if am so intersted in playing chello , i could be the person who play chello with knowledge of science . but why not i prefer spending of my time with a education of chello , why not i learn chello of history . the sitation show breaking up the education , study or work in to peace will decrease the efficiency with the ratio on spending time with . america achieve this with brialliant ratio . they also chance the idea of future plan which ha to be specialized . you can easly be get the education of jazz history while you are at junior at engineerin department . this brings score at end the specilazed situaati \ .
