in this period , it 's very important to try to do new thing or new job because with the development of innovation there are le opportunity to become a successful person , and a a result only if you take some risk you will obtain some good result . a good example of this theory is bill gates , that ha used the innovation to become the most important person in all the world and now he can do everything he want . as far a i 'm concerned , i 'd like to have an idea like bill gates , because i 'm sure that this idea could be a solution to all my economic problem !! but i also believe that if you do what you know how to do well , you can have a normal and nice life , with some good aspect but also with some problem , instead if you want to become a successful man , the only thing that you can do is to try an original job or a new trend , because in this era only if you are a creative person you can found success and easy money . for instance , my father ha done the same job for thirty year , and he ha a very normal life , he help me with the university 's tax and he ha lot of friend , but he 's too far to be a successful man . in spite of it 's very difficult to be considered a successful person , there are lot of successful man in all the world , so i think that it 's not impossibe to become an important man , but it 's sure that if you do n't look for a new idea , you ca n't be considered like this one , so in conclusion i 'm agree with the statement .
