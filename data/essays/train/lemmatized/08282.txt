i disagree with the idea that young generation do n't have enough time to helping their community for the following reason . first reason is that almost all school have a class which give student to do some volunteer activity these day in japan . when i wa in the senior high school , i took the class of volunteer work once a week . in this class , student picked up garvages on the road , playing with child who ha mental illnes , and joined to social event , for example , festival of our town . through my high school day , i could learn spirit of welfare , and it made me to help my community more easily . second reason is that young people have many opportunity to help old people nowadays . because of tendency to becoming aging-society , there are a lot of people who are aged in japan . if we go out , we may face the situation that we must help old people at least once in a day . for example , i help to carring a lagguage of old lady at stair of station every morning , and give them a seat on the train . moreover , sometimes i go to neighbor 's house to talk with old lady who live alone in order to erace her loneliness . thus , there are many opportunity for young people to contribute their society in many way , and this opportunity are going to increase a aging-society will be advance .
