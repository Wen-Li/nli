cars are an effective and convinient mean of transport that can be owned by the individual person . in future , although the car may become totally different from what they are right now but in no way there number is going to decrease surely not in the time frame of the coming twenty year . cars are not only the mean of transport they are passion of an individual . they also give a sense of independence and a feeling of increased social status to the people . also no one want to depend on the public transport system beacuse it is not so reliable , it may improve over the time period of 20 year to a great extent but still the problem of waiting for the bus or train and going to the station to catch them will still remain . having an own car give the person the freedom to go anywhere at anytime , while such a facility is unlikely to be introduced in the public transportation system even after twenty year . another reason a to why the number would n't decrease is because the price of the car are reducing rapidly and such a decrease in price may open the new customer base the so called ` middle class ' who are not able to buy it earlier and thus the number of car may actually increase to a large extent . the increase in standard of living of the people will also contribute to this effect . the main reason that people predict the downfall of car is because they use petrol and since petrol is limited and it 's price are soaring a new high all the time , people predict that the running cost will eventually be so high that they will prohibit the buying of the car . but the new technological advance in the field of car designing negates all such view . the car maker are rapidly progressing in designing new car that burn le fuel per litre . also car that can run on alternate energy source like electricity , hydrogen and solar power are being developed . the amount of effort that are put in this research make u to believe that we will definitely overcome these problem in the coming year . in sum , the number of car in the coming year may actually witness a large increase because of the new technological advance . the current form of the car may change , there might be more hybrid car , car runnig on elctricity and solar energy , but the passion of car and the sense of freedom it provides will continue to encourage more and more people to buy car .
