it is often said that eoungh time to helping their society wa not given to young poeple in modern society . some poeple might think young poeple did not spend their time to do something for their community , in term of their lot of work to do . however , i disagree with the idea that young poeple do not spent their time helping their society because of the importance of volenteering activity , and the importance of guarding society . to begin with , the significant of volenteer work are oncreasing these day . it is obvious that volenteer activity are a mendatory for university student to get a job . for example , the ministry of labor in korea resarch the importance factor that company select the person . accordong to their resarch , activeties for their community are almost doubled than their score in university . from this atmosphere of the sociey encourages young poeple spend their tome for their community . in addition , young poeple realize that we can not maintain our life without helping each other . it is commonly observed that the crime rate are incresing in modern society . this risk give rise to the change that young poeple think they are the poeple who gurad their community by themselves . for instance , my village can prevent the crime thanks to the young poeple security club 's activeties . they , include i , guard my village in turn respectively every once a month . in conclusion i firmly believe that young make an effort to thier society in term of the atmosphere of modern society , and their won idea for guarding their community .
