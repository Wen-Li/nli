young people nowadays are diverse in their opinion and one will find a number of people that have completely opposite opinion depending upon their background or belief . most of the young people today , i feel , do not give enough time to helping their community prosper . to begin with , a reason for young people , today , not to help their community is basically due to the increase in population that ha led to the increase in competition . for example let take a person who ha spent his childhood in poverty . such a person would hardly think about helping his community because the only thing on his mind would be uplifting himself and his family to a higher status . due to the amount of competition that exist today one ha to be really unique or good in order to be at the top . thus , since young people today are more interested in seeing themselves at a higher position they do not think about helping their community . also , young people today have become too narrow minded in their approach to life and do not want to think beyond the future . for example a person who at the moment is wealthy but doesnt know what is in store for him in the future . people like these eventhough have the money and resource to help their community do not do so because they do not believe in it and feel that why should he help others when nobody ha helped him . the fact that he is neglecting here is that in case he doe manage to loose his wealth due to some unfortunate circumstance and if he ha helped people from his community in the past , it would be those people that would come to his rescue and support him in any way . however , there still do exist people who do give a lot of time to helping their community because they have been taught to help others from childhood or have it in them to help others . examples can be taken from the young social worker that one find today . these worker are dedicating most of their time to helping others and giving them all the support , financially or morally , to come out of a precarious situation . thus , one still find young people that are willing and happy to help others in many aspect of their life . nevertheless , in the present scenario young people are more concerned with their family and are only looking towards their betterment . they are least bothered about what others do and what they need . also , a we look to the future the situation is going to get worse and there will be a time when no one will be prepared to stand for others .
