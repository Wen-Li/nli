to awser you will describe what are the different way of learn at school ( specific subjet or not ) afterward you will try to compare the two ` system ' and at last conclude . a way to be clear is to take opposed two system . on the one hand the american system and in the other hand the french system . there are son different . in france during seven or more you have to study at le 6 subject with two bigger than the other mathematic and french . student in france are get under stress with a lot of work because of the abondance of the subject . there are under stress too because they kwon that this ' generalist ' way of studing will certainly not give them at the beginning of threre life a job . the american system is much more pragmatic . you choose during the start of your study one subject and try to becom the best in it . you will become and expert and sell your ability to do your special subject to a compagny . if your are goog you will find easily a job . but the differencies could be explain ; in fact the two system have not the same idea of the education ( you want avoid to give my point of you it is a objective a possible ) the first , in france , have keed the idea of the xviii centuary with the famous project of diderot and all of the higher autors of thye period . there dream were that education sould be the way for a citizen to get his freedom . he know so he is free . so french university is a big part of there dream . contrary to frenchm usa want good worker for a good economie . defenitevement i prefer franche system and the french way of life .
