the product of coars need to be advetise . the genuinety of the product is one of the nost important thing that a prudoct may have . the pubblicity is a soul of tradind and obviously made a product better that in realy is . if we take for example about a shoe , in nike spot we can easy see the people that run faster than thi wind , or jump higher than the sky , but in really this concept are unbeliveble . all of u kwon that nike shoe is like an other common shoe , but the advertisement make product much better yhan they really are . an other example are sky , the satellite tv company , that in the advertise show that yuo can take home the famous movie , in really sky offer the same thing that an other tv company offer . pubblicity aim is only to encurage the people to buy this product instead the other one . an other example will be the advertisement of a car , the pubblicity tell that one car is `` like no one '' , but it is icredible , all of the car hav e got 4 wheel , an engine . .. it 's incredible that car are so differet to justify `` one like no one '' !!! in my opinion advertisement make product much better than they really are ; so i like this advetisements but i kown that the truth is not what i see , i think that other people on the earth are enjoy with me , but i also know that the largest population of the world may not enjoy with me , is for they that the advertisement is referd to .
