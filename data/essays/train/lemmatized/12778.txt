it is pointed out that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community especially in the big city like tokyo where i live , for following two reason . firstly , it is true that for young people there are more and more thing to do than the people who lived 50 year , for example , watching tv , talking on the phone with their friend , useing computer , doing homework and so on , and that young people do not have time to helping their community . nowadays , young people have to get a great many of imformation to communicate with other people . for example , in the school they can not talk each other without same imformation like popular tv program and popular magazine . so they do not have enough time to give time to helping their community . secondly , there is little chance to have experience of feeling about commutities especially in the big city . in the big city , people are tend to live in big building rather than their own house . several year ago , there were little big building and people lived in their own house . so young people had chance to play in their community . however , nowadays young people do not have chance to have experience of feeling . so , i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community especially in the big city like tokyo where i live . they do not have enough time to give time to helping their community .
