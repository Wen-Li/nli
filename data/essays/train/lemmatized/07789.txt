`` each finger is diffrent from the other '' , a say by a well known peot . i would n't disagree and give u a fact that i 'm sure is not right , and defending people from my own age by saying that they do help their community . but though , they 're alot of childeren that are participating and helping communties , eventhough lot are not but those kid that are should be hounred because what they 're doing is not a small thin g at all . helping others in their age , with lot of pressure is not an easy thing that they can handle , thats why lot of parent do not allow their child in applying for activties or community . parents are consiered about the level of they 're child in study , and thats one of the main reason , why kid do not cosider people problem and try to help , it because they are not thought to love each other at home , they are not tought to love doing nice thins for others and help the needy although most od the religons around ofthe world consists on helping the person that doe not have enough to care of him self , whether it wa something in the person or it is a need of money , . helping community start with small thing around u , and i'mn that they are alot of kid that are helping by small thing that they dont even bother to count vecause they might think it silly . in conclusion i don n't fully agree with the statment but wish from parent and people whom call their self adult to make our younger child and next generation of kid to be cosidered and loving to others and to know thats there no diiference between a wealthy and a poor or a white or black except by heart because a we grow our heart split aound our beauty in our face and move .
