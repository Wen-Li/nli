it is widely considered a a fact that the number of car in use will decline during the next twenty year . but this theory is only true for the developed world and not for the world a a whole . it will be pointed out in the course of this essay why this is true for the developed world and - more important - why the total number of car in use on this planet will continue to rise . at first , the question arises why people tend to think that the number of car in use will decline during the next twenty year . as the people and especially the politician in the developed world tend to give more importance to environmental issue , it becomes obvious that car account for heavy air pollution . therefore , mass transportation system a train or bus are likely to be able to attract more customer than they are now . additionally , it is likely that those mass transportation system will receive more financial aid from the government making them more attractive for the customer . as a result of that development , people living in those developed country will need le car . but nevertheless , the amount of car in use in the world a a whole will continue to rise . new concept and development in the field of energy are currently developed by car manufacturer all over the world and they will make petroleum-based fuel obsolete . some new car a the toyota prius already use some of the new concept . the last and maybe most significant argument for the theory of an increasing number of car is the on-going process of globalisation which result in a higher level of development in country a china , india , brasil or indonesia . today , most inhabitant of those country can not afford buying a car . as those people get more money out of their job a a result of globalisation , they will develop the same need which people of developed country have today - driving into the countryside , visit friend in other city , making holiday , etc . and due to their increasing income , they will soon be able to buy car . as the number of inhabitant in those developing country is enormous ( more than 2bn people in china and india combined ) , the number of car in use is likely to rise . to conclude this argumentation , it is highly unlikely for the number of car in use to decline . especially the growing demand for car in the developing country a china and india will bring the number of car in use to a new record level .
