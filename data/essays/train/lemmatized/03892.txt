there are certain reason that contradict with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today a well there are argument which support this thesis . to my mind this statement is not well reasoned and will certainly not become true in near future . first of all , car provide an effective and cheap way of transportation that public transport for example is not able to give to it customer . driving a car , is more than a simple action , a strong emotion is involved of feeling free and flexible whereever you are in the world . people are dependent on this way of life , for instance getting to work with public transport in some area is not satisfying . one could argue that crude oil and gas will not deliver the proportion which is required to enable car use in future . although this could be right , the car industry is already making effort to develop new enginens based on solar and wind energy . furthermore , it is attempted to make the use of hydrocarbonite more economical and effective . all these development will have an positive effect on environment because they contribute le to pollution . on the other hand , people can say that we should reduce car traffic by improving our national transportation system for instance to make it cheaper and more comfortable in order to attract more customer . another option would be to stress the importance of using plaines for small distance between town instead of using the car . this obviously could all contribute to use the car not that often than nowadays . to sum it up , i strongly believe that the car is an integral part of life and it use will not decrease but increase in near future . there is no suitable option found yet which could replace the car and it great advantage . thus , let u do not abandon this extraordinary part of life but instead keep it and of course improve it .
