i do n't think that yong people do not take care of their community . there are three reason to support my oppinon . when i wa 16 year old i wa in the school valunteer 's club in an year . at that time , i could realize that there are a lot of people who help me without thinking of money . also i could understand why there are community in the world . i think there are so much chancese to take that kind of experience for young student in korea . listening radio is one of my hobby and my favorit program is ' chin han chin gu ' that mean my best friend in english and most of listener are middle or highschool student . whenever i listened that radio program , i could heard about a moved story about our life . the mc of that program always tel the meaning of peace through the radio and that really help me to do good thing . an year ago ' www.thehungersite.com ' is produced through that program and i 'm not sure but over hundred thousand student can heard about that same a me . in that site , you can do a nice thing to hungerd child without money problem . even young peaple do n't help their society , that 's not only young people i think . we live in a big city and there are not enough communication between our neigberhoods . i think that 's the point why the people think they live in a cold-society . in that reason , i do n't agree with that young people do n't help their community .
