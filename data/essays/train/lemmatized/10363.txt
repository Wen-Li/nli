i agree with the statemaent that young people enjoy life more than old people do . the reason is that young people have fresh mind . fresh mind mean that mind have a capacity for feel somthing new and it is important for people because it is good for human to feel something new and without it , people feel boring in his life . for example when i wa a child , zoo wa a very exciting place . there are lot of animal which i have not seen before . i wa very suprized by elephant 's big nose , lion 's tooth , small baby bear 's lovely face . i really enjoyed these experience at zoo . however , i am twenty now , and if i go to the zoo again , i will not feel exciting like my child food . furthermore , when i will be fifty , i will not even think about zoo . it is natural for people to lost fresh mind with their age , because we have gotten a lot of knowledge about this world . knowledge is not bad thing but , it is actually stole people 's fresh mind from many adult people . and we have some responsibility with our age . study , work , family , thinking about personal future , these thing are imprtant so they have to do it . and then we lost our fresh mind bacause we lost capacity for mind which feel somthing new . therefore , i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than plder people do . young mind make people 's life more happy .
