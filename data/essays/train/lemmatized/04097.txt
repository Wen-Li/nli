every person came on this world by thinking that he or she will enjoy entire life more than any person in this world world had enjoyed . it is well said that `` change is law of nature '' . every person change when he get older . in my view younger people enjoy their life more than older people do . it is a natural process that when a person get older his everything become older like his way of thinking , how he mange his further life and many more thing . older people ca n't do everything what the youth can do . to hold my opinion i would conclude some point . first , old person had enjoyed their entire life but after many year of his life he had not left any power in his bone or in vein to do any physically enjoyment while a young person have his bone like iron and vein like steel so he can do any physical enjoyment like going to party having dance etc. secondly , old person had already done all the work which the youth is doing and so their all feeling of enjoyement had lost from whole of their heart . while youth have fresh and warm blood so they have each and every emotion in their mind . thirdly , old perstons get more religious when they reach sixty or more so they have no more plan in their mind to enjoy . however , some people have beleif that older person can enjoy the life more than the younger people but they should take in mind thaht there are many challanging situation in front of enjoyment of of older people like physical and mental condition . we know that we cant acheive more than what is written in our luck we cant also obtain le than what we have to acheive . finally , i conclude that it travel generation to generation and it the time for youth to enjopy their life .
