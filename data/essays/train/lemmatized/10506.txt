i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . one reason is that it motivate other poeples creating new product . for example , if sucessful invent new product and it earn much money , it would be motivated other people to invent more useful thing than fomer thing which made by successful people made . so it make consumer use more useful thing . second reason is that it is very holic in my case when i took a math problem or other problem but i solved myself it 's so exciting that i want to feel it again . i think it is same about try new thing and take risk . i know how excited it is about inventing or producing new thing which noone invent or produce it . also it bring not only much money but also respect other people . finally , if they no more try new thing it make me lazy . i saw many time that if someone who invent new thing but no more try , finally he disrupted and divorced .
