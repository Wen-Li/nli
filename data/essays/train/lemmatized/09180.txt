recently , people tend to specialize in one specific subject . however i think that broadening knowledge of many academic subject is helpful . in this essay , i will present some reason to support my idea . first of all , i think that recent goal of our study doe not want specialized knowledge . although specialzed knowledge is also needed , broadened one are really required to u . for example , in the applied mechanic , statistic and management are also needed . if we do not know about them , we can only produce a safe something . however if we know about them , we also make thing cost-efficient . by doing so , we can reduce wasted money and provide thing on lower price . in addition , boadening knowledge of many academic subject make u diverse . if we are specialized on particular one , we would have narrow thought about what make u puzzeld . as we have a variety of knowledge , that give u diversed view . thus , various knowledge may result in synergy effect . for instance , since i wa studying various subject like statistic and mechanic , it encourage me to study hard . because i wa boring at studying only mechanic , by doing so , i wa excited to study mechanis . as a result , i got the good grade on both of them . taking all those into consideration , broadening knowledge of various field make u more efficent , having widened visioin , and having active motivation . we are living in a world that demand a multi-player .
