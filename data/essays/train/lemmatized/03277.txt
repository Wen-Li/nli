first , i think that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subject , because you tend to improve your critical mind more than when your are specialized , but in an other hand i think that a specialization may be benefic in some case too . in one hand , i think that a general knowledge of many subject increase the ability of a person to understand the society and the world in it many form . indeed , when you know the origin of a phenomenon that medias are talking about , you understand it better : in it construction , and in it effect . because most of the time , a phenomenon or crisis , is based on and ha developed from a cause that is important to know to really understand the problem . for instance , when you have both studied geography and history at school , you are more able to understand the origin of political problem such a mass immigration than when you only have studied geography or history . indeed , a problem is the result of cause that are often more various than we think . so when you have a wild culture , ( that mean when you have studied many subject at school , such a biology , physic , or geography ) , you tend to have a more critical mind , and a better approach of the situation . but in the other hand , a specialization on a specific subject is a good thing , because you are studing all the detail of a specific phenomenon , and you are able to explain to people the accurate reality of a process . you are also able to make the science go forward if you work on scientifical subject for many year , such a medical research . indeed , because time and specialization allow people to make big discovery . in conclusion , i really think that a wild knowledge may increased people critical mind , but there are also advantage to be specialized .
