i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better tahn they really are . in the recent year people 's life have been greately improved , and pepole began to demend more thing to their life . becasues there are more demends , or consumer , the market started to expend , and it caused more supplier joined into the market . suppliers must compete with each other inorder to let consumer to buy their product , and one effcient way to compete with others is advertising . before buying anything from the supplier , consumer would try to know more about the product through advertisement made by the supplier , and this give the supplier a chance to show their product . bearly no one would buy a thing just by one look , so the advertisement need to be more detailed and more attractive . consumers would compare about the advertisement between different supplier rather than the product themselves . suppliers clearly understand what consumer 's thought are , and they would try to add more thing to the advertisement , what may make them more superior than the others . the superior one are always more attractive to the consumer , at least more people would pay more attention to them . although the `` addtional '' thing or function added to the advertisement are usually not exist or in the real product or the real one will not work a efficient a the one the in advertisement , but it would never be a problem for the supplier , because what they cared most is the amount of product been sold . consumers may not recoganize what is true about the product until they bought them , and somehow they have to accpt the truth although they expected a much better result . in the recent year advertisement are no longer a way for consumer to get knowing about the production from the supplier , but more likely they became a way to just increase the selling amount by the seller . things described better than the real one in the advertisement are very common now , it is a misfortune for most of the consumer .
