although it look that young people tend to enjoy more than older people a the are young , full of energy and free from any kind of ailment . but on the basis of my personal experience i think if a person plan his life properly his going to enjooy more his oldage than his youth . he according to me his ` own ' life only when he reach the fag end of his life and enjoy thye life in it real term . let u take an example of a person who ha recently retired from his job and a person who ha recently joined his job . as i have said earlier if he is financially strong than he ha virtually no worry at all . since he ha no tension of going to office , catching bus etc he can start his day a per his wish . while the young fellow can not allow his such wish a he ha to attend the office . by the time a person reach that age his a suuficed his thurst for achiving new position , and hence is completly free of mind having no tension of acheving new target or proposing new project . on the other hand the young fellow will struggle a lot to make his reputation in the company and also to make his future secure in the company . mostly old age people by this time are free from their family liability , there child are well settled and they have not worry about them , they can spend there money completely accoring to there wish and do every thing that they once wanted to do in their l on the other hand the of so called energetic young person is loses a lot of his energy fighting and keeping himself up in the cutting age competition . more over many thing he can not do for himself because he ha a family dependent on him , he can not buy his dream car because he ha to educate his kid and for that he need money . as far health is concern physcially he ( the young man ) may look fit but mentallly his more troubled .
