the primary role of advertisement is to increase a firm 's profit by boosting the sale of a product . to achieve that goal , the firm ha to show the most attractive part of the thing they want to sale . to make something really attractive , advertiser have to prove the potential customer , that their product is better than each other . that 's why a lot of them have the desire to embellish their product . for example , in each car advertisement , we hear that this specific car is the best one , and that girl will love you because you own it . so we could consider that such a tv spot try to make the car much better than it really is . nonetheless , i 'm convinced that men who watch or read such an advertisement know that girl wo n't love them more just because they own that car . but they keep the spot in mind and the more they see the car , the more they could desire to own it . so in that case , advertiser have accomplished their mission , because they have succeded in increasing the car sale . moreover there are a lot of precise rule which make that an advertiser must not lie on the skill of a product . if we go back to the example of the car , a spot must not claim that the car ha an airbag if he ha n't . even if they can find a way to make their product seem very beautiful or very good , the law set some limit , and the firm must n't do what they want with the advertisement . finally , in a certain extent , the law provides a security for the customer , because they can be sure that the description of an object will be the same than in an advertisement . but i know that firm often find guile to make thing seem more beautiful to be more competitive .
