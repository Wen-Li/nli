i agree with that the most adevertisements make procucts seem better than they really are . i have two reason . first , the information on the product are different from the real content . for exeample , i often use cataloge shopping to buy my clothes . at that time , the clothes sended from company are totally deffrent the picture . the size , color seconds , the advertisement do not send real message . for instance , the rabel of food say only main materals . the advertisement need our life so , it have to send real information or massage .
