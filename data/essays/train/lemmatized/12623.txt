it is often accepted that young people enjoy life more than older people but i quite disagree with this view a it is merely associated with the concept of having no responsibility . indeed , the way young and older people enjoy life can be very different and it ha nothing to do with having responsibility or not . as a matter of fact , young and older people have n't got access to the same activity a they often depend on your physical ability . the fact that younger people are , most of the time , healthier than older people mean that , for example , young people could enjoy playing a soccer match whereas old people could not . moreover , it would be harder for a senior to spend every night in club without sleeping . fortunately , enjoying life is not restricted to sport activity and older people could enjoy other aspect of life like building a family , creating business relationship , take part to the city or the country social or political life . these kind of activity can definitely bring a lot of happiness and maybe more fulfilling than simply play tennis or spending night in bar . another important aspect is that older people may value life more a they might have been in contact with death of relative . therefore , they might even enjoy life more than younger people a they know their time is limited . on the contrary , young people are not in direct contact with death and just do not realize what is at stake . they might then just live life a it come and not get the most of it . as a conclusion , young people and older people can both enjoy life in different manner . happiness is not a question of age but of perspective and i am sure that anyone , young or old can enjoy life if they are ready for it .
