undoubtedly , this is one of the most trite debate that have taken part in the last decade . after dedicating a big part of my energy to dealing with this so intricate topic , i reached the conclusion that the election between specializing or multiplying knowledge depends on a more deep debate , which is choosing between good education ( and here i refer to good with capital letter ) and economic success . postmodern era ha brought with it the problem of defying traditional view not only about the organization of the world but mainly about the virtue of certain kind of knowledge . while in the ancient era it wa easy to grasp different discipline , the huge increase in the mass of science production that took place during the xix and xx th. century really difficulted the possibility of dealing with different type of knowledge . today , it seems to be that certain discipline are clearly priviledged in the market . specialization is not only very valued in company ( that may need engineer or marketing professional ) , but in the academic world . although it seems to be reasonable in term of efficiency ( the more you mechanically know anything about something , the faster you find a solution or give a response to a certain problem ) , it doe not appear to be the same when facing unconventional or even life challenge . in this last sense , i think that multidisciplinary knowledge can add value to one 's education . holistic vision of situation may help to deal with more complex problem and may provide people with mental framework for acting in different scenario and in front of different kind of people . my experience ha shown me that the more specialized you are , the more difficulty you find to understand problem that may go a bit beyond your perspective . moreover , you tend to see life through the lens provided by the discipline you are expert in . this wa very frequent for me at university , where i used to talk to professor that tended to refuse or discard theory that took idea from other area of knowledge . typically , for political scientists all problem arise from politics , and from economists everything ha to do with economics . it appears to be very simplistic my statement , but i really had to pas over those situation when pursuing a multidisciplionary degree ( international affairs ) and dealing with phd professor from very different area . unfortunately , this surplus i perceive in broad knowledge is not valued by market and , a i said before , it may be almost legitime in term of rapid efectiveness . however , i do not think the debate is over . on the contrary , i think it will evolve in tandem with the evolution or cycle of human advance . in the while , my curiosity and eagerness for really understanding all this lead me to buy book on astronomy , zapping between national geographic and history channel , or listening to religion lecture . so far , it ha been very fruitful for my life .
