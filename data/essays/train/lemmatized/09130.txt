from my point of view , i do not think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . some people believe this becasue they think that in twenty year , perhaps , the world will have changed so much that we will use flying object to go from one place to another and that , moreover , we will transport thing by putting them into a machine , pressing a button , and , suddenly , they will appear thousand of kilometre away from where they were . when i wa young everybody said that in the year two thousand everything wa going to be different and that what i 've said above would have already happened , but these did n't become true . nowadays thing are quite similar to what they were twenty year ago . cars are so important in our life that we can not live without them . nowadays we need our car to transport thing , to go to many place where public transport do n't go and to feel a bit more free . on the other hand , it 's true that if public transport became cheaper and quicker , many people would n't need their car , and they would take public transport , but , what about feeling free ? our society need to feel really free , and to feel that they can go wherever they want , whenever they want . we are absolutely under control in our city and in our country and , a i think , car give u this bit of freedom that we do not have in many other part of our life . for all this reason i think that in twenty year , there wo n't be fewer car in use than there are today , although i do think that the number of car wo n't be growing so quickly a it is growing today .
