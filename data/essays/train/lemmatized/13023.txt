in my opinion most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , but i think it 's the marketing way . it 's absolutely comprensible that a company want seem an his product better than it really is ; a company , in fact , have to see multiple factor , like for example the actractivity of the market , the other concorrent company and in this situation the impact with the customer is fundamental . we can think , to understand the concept , how much advertisement is watched on tv ; if a message is reiceved from a lot of people , a certain product can be buyed from a large part of the population . probably this way is not ethically correct ; a person can be fascinated from a particular type of product , after the wiew of the advertisement , and then he can discover that this product is not what he expected . but i repeat that this is the market law , so the company ca n't make in other term . i think the positive way of this process is that a good product can have a lot of visibility wih the advirtisement . my mind go , for example , to linux , an alternative software ; most of it 's expert say it 's better then windows , but it doe n't have the necessary visibility ( and many other factor : for example linux is not organized a a company like his concorrent ) to fight it . in many case i have choosen a product for the fantastic advertisement of that product ; i like very much coca - cola , i ever buyed it , probably i 'd prefer pepsi , but i have never buyed it , because i 'm a fanatic customer of coke , in part for his beautiful advertisement , that remind me when wa a chld . in other word , a lot of advertisemnets can decide the consumation of a produc
