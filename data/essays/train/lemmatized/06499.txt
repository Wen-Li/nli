i strongly disagree with the statement given . it is not good to have a broad knowledge about many academic subject . a broad knowledge will not get you good grade in the examination at school . everyone ha heard the famous saying `` jack of all trades but master of none '' . also little knowledge is a dangerous thing . it can infact endanger a person 's life . for example while doing the cpr technique to resuscitate a dying person you need to have the complete knowledge about the procedure , otherwise you can put his or her life in danger . another place where the specialized knowledge is useful is the `` school of life '' . having a specialized knowledge can create a great career oppurtunity . this can translate into a prosperous and comfortable life . another point to be considered is that people who have a broad knowledge about many subject are generally restless people who can not concentrate long enough on any subject to master it . this loss at concentrating will result in failure at every stage in their life . this will make them a complete loser . also people who have specialized knowledge will make a positive impression on their kid . this will result in highly inspired kid who will then become able and successful adult . these kid will in turn produce another great generation . in fact specialized knowledge can transform a dismal or moderate nation into a truly great one . this is the stuff winner are made of . a broad knowledge will only take you so much far , but to go that extra mile you need to have a something `` extra '' . this extra is specialized knowledge . in the end i would like to say that it is really much better to have specialized knowledge about a subject than to have little knowledge about everything under the sun . go for specialized knowledge guy , it is certainly worth it .
