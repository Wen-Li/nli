in physic , teacher nowadays try to teach their student the so called physical sense . it mean to understand , to predict a phenomenon without filling blackboard of equation . if we zoom out of the scientific field , we can compare , on one hand , the understanding of idea and concept to the physical sense , and on the other hand , the fact to the equation which describe the phenomenon . both are intrisiquently linked . a good scientific can explain the most difficult phenomenon to anybody , a well a he can demonstrate a theory . in history , fact have their own importance and significance . they keep idea and concept in the real world , avoiding people to get far from reality . facts are pillar , whereas idea can change . what make nazis different from any racist and populist group ? the extermination camp . on one edge , we have ideal that have to be condamned , on the other side , we have piece of evidence , that once , democratic country let nazi germany killing million of people just because they were jew . if a history teacher want to present the horror of the extermination of jewish people , he can not talk only about nazi ideal . he must mentionning auschwitz . and auschwitz is a fact . ideas and concept can be defined a frame , whereas fact are detail . details make the difference . on a teaching point of view , is it easier to learn fact or to learn concept ? facts give the concept a practical substance , making it easier to reach . i think it is a important to learn concept a to learnf fact
