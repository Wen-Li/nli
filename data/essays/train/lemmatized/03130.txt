i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . if this statement wa false then there would be no new fast car . people would have not reached the moon . some people like scientist do not keep on doing the same thing , they try new thing which are dangerous . if the scientist would not have researched on different disease then we would have not got the cure of different disease which are present now . the death rate would have increased . even in sport people donot use the same tactic in all the game . they use different tactic in different game which help them to win their game . if they use the same tactic then the opponent would take advantage & they will win . suppose pistons us the same tactic against all the team they might win for some game but after some game all the team will come to know that they are using the same tactic and take benefit of that and win from pistons . for this reason they use different strategy in different game . they might loose sometime but a it is said people must learn from their mistake . try new thing . in the beginning of the race of satellite if u.s would have stoped trying after they lost of many space ship then they would had not reached the moon . u.s is the first country to send their peope on moon . in the beginning many space ship got blast before going in space . many people died to help their country in achieving great height but they later on used new technology new idea & they did it . after working hard using different method in making car , today we have various type of fast car . if people would have stop trying or would had keep on making same car there would have been no new fast car , like there would have been no cadillac , no ferrari fast car . if after building railroad people would have never tried making plane then today people would not have reached one place to another in le time . it wa hard but after the invention of plane today we can go where ever we want on the earth in le time . what if people would have kept on making telephone and would had not tried to making wireless phone which we call cell phone , then today we could not have called any emergency number like ambulance if we werer outside our home . if there were no cell phone at that time then we would have waisted our time to search a phone booth & then call ambulance but till that time there would have been more loss , many people would have died . for the above reason i think people must not stop trying new thing , they must not get scared from the consequence but they must try . there are many other thing which would have not been invented if people would have not tried new thing . try & try until u suceed . ..
