in our life we always see that some people keep success and others not . i think that it doe n't depends only on the fact that a person take risk or not . so i can say that sometimes a person keep success because of their risk and sometimes becauses of his good luck . in the first case , the person is a very known and eximated person . for instance , a person that ha people that work for him can be a man that taked risk , that believed in his ability and in his potentiality , that have a great sense of responsability because perhaps the future of many family depends on his decision . in the second case i can think to some people that now appear on television , or in the cinema . they are successful people but their success is not keep from hard work . they had simply a good luck in order to be known and to receive a lot of money and often the success is no so long . for instance the famous people 's son are successful people but they have n't take any risk : they are only famous people son . to conclude , successful people can take risk or can have a good luck rathen the others .
