i agree with this statement . some time company do marketing of their product to get more profit . i think not only some but most of thems do same . there are lot of reason and example available to support my claim . lots of people are there who complains about product . they start using that product after viewing advertisement . i have a serious problem due to this . when i used to stay in india at that time , on many tv channel they saw really very popular and attractive advertisment for shampoo . it is like if you use this shampoo your hair will look like this man . you can feel change in your hair with in few week . so i attracted due to that and star using that product . and it true that i start feeling change in my hair . but instead of shining my hair , my hair start disapparing . yes thats true that i have hair lose problem . before i use that product i do n't have that problem . so i quit using that product any more , and start using what i used to use early . but thats not end of my problem . even today aslo i am suffering with that problem . i had spent lot of money for maditation but i did not find any improvement in my hair . but due to that madicines i have another side effect . ohh god ! i am really feel so bad . not only that but now in the usa also i am affaried of trying new stuff . i think there must be some rule to make advertisement . like in advertisement company must show what could be the side effect and how to take precations to use that product . in my case it okay , but i had seen lot of people who are suffering from serious problem just due to much more good advertisement then actually they are . according to my view point government must pas a law that company must have to show truth in advertisement insted of imagnary thing . let people live in real world and not in just imagnary world .
