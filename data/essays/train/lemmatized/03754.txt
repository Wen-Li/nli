successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . this statement is very true successful people are always taking risk trying new thing but this is what make those person successful . if someone is successful in something and keep on doing only what they already know how to do , well he will never learn more and will stay in the same place he is . the person who will be trying new thing will stard to be more successful because he will be good in new thing he tried so he will know how to do more thing well . this is the way this person will be more successful than the other one that just kept on doing what he use to know and did not try to learn more thing . if you look at the people who are around you , you will see that the person who are always doing new thing will have a lot more problem to resolve than person who stay doing what he know . this is for sure but resolving those problem the person learn more and more , this is the way he will stard to do the new thing and to know how to do it . well if you can tell this person who is always taking those risk are successful . the reason is that not all the new thing he tried worked but a lot of them did work . it is a very good sentence that i like a lot that say : `` how do you want to get fish if you do not get your foot wet '' . the successful person is who get her foot wait to get some fish . this is a very true sentence you have to get wet to get what you want and most of the person want success in life . i agree that if you want to be successful you have to take risk trying new thing this is why person who take risk tring are successful .
