i really agree with this topic . when i see the advertisement , i become to want it or eat it or drink it . i have a experience about it . when i wa watching tv , i saw the commercial about `` taco-bell '' . i had never eatten it . it seemed really good . then after school , i asked my host mother to take me there because i seriously wanted to eat it . then we went there . and i ordered it . i wa very surprised when it came . it wa just like my finger sized . when i watched the commercial it wa much bigger than real . and it wa warm , not hot . i always become to want it when i see the advertisement . so i wa glad it wa not like machine . because it wa not so much expensive . sometimes i really want to get something expensive when i see the advertisement . but i can stop feeling that i want it . i think because i missed the `` taco-bell '' 's meal . as we can see there are many advertisement in the world . i do n't think it is good to make priducts seem much better than they really are . it is kind of trickster . it is kind of illegal thing !! however if i became someone who wa selling something , i would have the advertisement . and i would say something which make product seem much better than they really are . so everyone dose it . i think it is like lace , and someone who male gppd advertisement would win that lace . we have to search what it really is form hidding in advertisement . it is hard because every advertisement hide the truth . we have to think about it deeply before we get it . but i always become to want it . i would like to change it .
