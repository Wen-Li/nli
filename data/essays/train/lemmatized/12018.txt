everyone in this life want to live more so i think that we should enjoy our time in living our life . so i agree that young people enjoy their life than older people . we know that when we are young we enjoy our time in playing , studing and doing alot of thinges we can not doing now . there are several reason of that , one reason that , when we were child we had the freedom in doing any thing we need , also we had the power to live happy and interesting lifestyle , we could be lated for along hour . moreover , we had the health and the willing to reach to what we need , we could go for playing , singing with our friend , but when we come older we connot do this thing because we have the new responsibility in our life such a , our child and the care which they need to become like thier parent . also , our power in enjoying our time became weak and we connot have the ability in working and enjoying , so we should let our child to have this intertainment and let them live their life , because when we are in their age we did alot of thinges which reminds me now . so you should live your life by having some of exicting and enjoyment . all in all , we can not stop the time , and we should convince in our distiny and fait , we must imagine our self a we can try to give our age his right in having the rest in the end of our life , and this will not prevent u to try to complete our life in thinking about the history which we had lived from the young .
