i agree with the statement : `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' because young people have a good health . they also live their life without difficult responsabilities . on the other side , older people feel tired to enjoy their life . i believe that young people live their life happily . young people have the opportunity to do whatever they want because they have excellent health . for example , they can run outside when it is cold . they will not get fiver because they are strong . furthermore , they can eat anything what they want . consequently , they enjoy their life because they can visit any country and eat different kind of food . young people live without difficult responsabilities . they do not need to be worried about to work hard in order to earn a great amount of money to pay their billes . they are happy to earn enough money to buy simple thing . furthermore , they only think about their personal goal . for example , to study in good university with fun people . on the other side , old people are tired to enjoy their life because they have huge problem that they need to resolve every day . they have problem with their heart and stomach . consequently , they are not able to receive bad news or eat in any place . they also have financial problem because they do not earn enough money to enjoy their life . in conclusion , i think that young people enjoy their life than older people because they have good health . they have good opportunity to do many activity . however , old people suffer because they have many problem which they need to resolve .
