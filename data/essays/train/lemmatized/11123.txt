i think in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today , because we may create new thing to transport . or , we may try to reduce the number of car for the environment . first , i think we may create new other thing to transport . more faster , efficient and economical tool . in the fact , we are already creating some new thing for transporting u . high speed train is good example . it is quite expensive to use , but it would be lower because other more high-speeded thing to transport will possibly appear . moreover , i think we may try to reduce the number of car so will be fewer car , because car produce many impact for the environment . they produce carbon dioxide that can break the ozone layer of the earth . the ozone layer is protecting u from strong uv that can heat up the air of the earth . now a day , many people being aware about this . so , in the future , we will be more sensitive for the einvironment . in conclusion , i agree with the statement , because we may create new other method to transport instead of car and we may try to reduce the number of car for our environment in the future .
