i think that enjoying life is not a matter of age . when we talk about young people we usually think of fun , happines and party . on the other hand , when we talk about old people we think of , streess , work , family and bore . first of all , i think that to enjoy life mean to do all the thing that can make you happy everyday of your life , accepting thing a they come , and if we can , making thing better . what i 'm saying is that not only young people can enjoy life , not only they have dream , not only they can accomplish their goal . in fact some young people do n't enjoy their life at all , maybe because they have n't found yet their goal in life or maybe because they do n't have any motivation to do so . second , i do n't think that someone is able to enjoy life more than others . you can enjoy life or you do n't enjoy it at all . in fact enjoying life is a question of attitude , how you face the reality , how you decide to carry your life , with all the problem and all the happiness it could bring . young or old , i think that we all pursuit the same goal ^ to be happy ^ , and i am sure that if you want to be happy you will enjoy every moment of your life , doing the thing that you like and dislike , making your world a better place for yourself and the people you love , taking care of the thing and the people you appreciate . all those thing are a sing that you are enjoying your life . whatever you do , if you do it with pleasure , you are enjoying your life . in conclusion , i think that everybody , young , old , black or white , can choose how to enjoy life .
