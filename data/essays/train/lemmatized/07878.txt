i disagree with the statement that `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' . there are so many reason and example to support my opinion . it is each and every one 's responsibilily to help their community . young people have to spend some time to help their community . in so many community there are so many poeople do not have minimum requirement like food , cloth and shelter . youth people should take forestalls to prevent the spread of this to future generation . my personal experience is that i saw so many people who are young in participating the social development activity . even though youth is busy with their work they know that the nation 's development depoends on the individual development of all community . generally young people inspire by their patriot and the social worker . for example in our city i observed so many poeopole who are trying improve the literacy and ameliorate the life of fetid slum area . really i impressed by them alot . so it is necessary to young people to help their community . . then only natiion 's development will occure . nowadays life became very busy . but it should not affect our participation in helping our community . we have to share our time for all the thing . young people are spending their time improve the way of life of poor and they also increase their time to involve in social developoment . finally i conclude that it is necessary to give enough time to helping their community .
