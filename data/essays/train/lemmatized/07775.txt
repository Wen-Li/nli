a famous man once said , `` from experience , come skill . .. yet experience come from risk . '' this mean that to obtain skill one need experience , and to obtain experience one need to take a risk . therefore to be successful one need to learn how to take risk . when a child go to school , they are taught the essential that they are going to need in their life ; reading , writing , listening and leadership . when this child move on to high school they are taught specifically what they need to learn to fullfill their ambition . when a child graduate from school they use their previous knowledge to get a work place and a consistant job . .. then what ? the person ha got this far , yet are they truly successful ? are they truly at their full potential ? the answer is no ! one will never get raised or moved up in the corporate ladder if they are only doing what they are told . this is because everyone else is doing exactly what they are told too . to make one self stand out they must be able to take risk and put yourself on the line . show the employer that you are willing to do anything for the cause and you will get moved . however if you stay put and dont take risk then you will not move anywhere and stay at the same level a everyone else that doe n't take a risk . a prime example in history is that of galileo . he took a risk by defying the whole scientific system of his time and saying that the world wa round and that the universe wa heliocentric ( sun in the middle ) . of course he wa laughed at and not taken seriously , yet now student write about him in formal essay such a this one . this man proved the whole world wrong simply by taking a risk . there is no man or woman in a history book that is there because they did the ordinary , they are all there because they took some sort of risk . to get far you will have to do thing you already know , yet to be truly successful you will have to take risk .
