i dont agree with the statement that `` there will be fewer number of car in use than there are today '' . the above may not be completely ture because of the point that are given below . to stop the usage of car either the petroleum should get scarce and the price should go so high that only very rich can efford to buy to use car . and coming to technology point of view a the technology is developing the part of car are becomming cheaper a a result many people can afford to buy a car for their own use . so , this indicate fairly increase of the number of car than the number that persent now . also a the newer model are getting in to the market to attract people . the people who ha car already send their car for lower price a a second hand car and go for the new one . there might be a possibility that if government want to control the pollution producd by the car . it can increase the tax so a to decrease the number of car . but still the people may use the car because the government cant lay too much of tax . so , a far a we can see that number decreasing not likely to occur . but the growth can be predicted because of the above point . the number of car reduction cant be possible because a the population grows many people are settling well would like to have a car . also now a day many colleage student are using car a lot so decreasing number is not really possible a the statement state . also now a day many people who use two wheeler want to buy a car next . so we can see that the population are orienting towards buying car to have luxury life .
