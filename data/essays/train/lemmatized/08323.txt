i disagree with the previous example because i do not consider one is option is better from the other . i believe that concept or idea are a much important a it is to learn fact . of course there exists a different weight of this concept depending on the field the person is studying , working on or leaving in . but in general i consider concept give the knowledge about a certain topic and give the opportunity to the individual to form a personal point of view of something , then after the individual create his or her own perspective he or she could learn fact and later on review them and analized wich fact are in favor or against it individual perpective , and generate a conclusion on what posture should take ; change the personal perspective about something or keep it . also it doe not exist a theory that stablish what to learn first concept or fact , it could be better for a person to fisrt have knowledge about some fact and then revise the concept of the same topic . but for other people shoul be better to participate in the learning process in the opppossite way . as an example we can see people that did not have the opportunity to study but they can have a good performance on different kind of job , just by knowing first the fact and then review the theory to solve the problem . for examble a lot of mechanincs , specially in mexico , doe not ha a formal study formation but they know where can be the solution to a certain problem and then get interested in knowing the concept . in recent year the combination of both statement is becoming the best way to succeed in live . ust ask how many university include in their program a 50 % practical course and 50 % theoretical course . and look for job that ask for expirience and ahigh university degree .
