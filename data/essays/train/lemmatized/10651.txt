i do not agree with the statement that young people are not giving enough time to helping their community . in today fast going society , where time is money and every one is over acheiving , there is little time which a young person can devote to the commnunity . but with in this small amount of time which is available , today youth is contributing much in term of quality of help a well a quantity there are numerous way in which this can be shown . 90 percent of the young men and woman whom you meet today are having hearty ambition and very defined carrer goal . most young woman today aspire to be dynamic executive rather than being just a home maker mom . these healthy ambition in them self are a great contribution to human society , making the society progressive and dynamic . the vitality of society brings about the much nourishment which is required for the charity organization . a goal driven youth is much more likely to be a benefactor to a poor child or a good social worker , a part of service which is required for obtaining a place in prestigious educational institute . today 's aspring youth are tomorrow 's benefactor of society for a given certainity , a they drive the economy in full speed another example of youth contribution to society is evident in increased entreprenuership , in sector of environment protection , waste recycling and alternative energy production , by young entreprenuers through out the world a teenager who earns pocket money or money for tution fee through baby sitting or service in a old age home is an excellent example of a young person who is serving the society a well a his or her own need . a student who organizes a student body or writes a web log to help other student from his nation to study internationally and earn prestigious honor is an excellent example of a young person , trying to develop his fellow student . in a place like india , where government can not provide adequate social security , recently i read of 2 young sister , who have organized a rehabilitation center for mentally retarded or dsiturbed woman who roam in street , with out nobody to take care of them . i personally know some of my young friend who sponsor poor child annually , almost anonymously i would like to conclude that today youth is responsible , goal driven and service oriented . they are giving back to their community and are role model for coming generation
