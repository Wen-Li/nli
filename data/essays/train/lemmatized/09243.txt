cars are very important for our society . it ensures our mobility which becomes more and more important in these day . so car became an important part of our world . but how will the situation be in twenty year ? in many country in africa or south america , often called the third world , car are not a important a in europe or a in the united states . but in the last year more and more people get car becuase they become more important . the number of car increase every year and even the increasing rate becomes higher . so there is no end in sight . it is certain that in the third world will be much more car than today . but what is the situation in the so called `` western world '' ? fifty year ago car were luxus . but today a car bellongs to life standard . only few family have no car and the production of cheap small car like the smart enforce the development to have more than one car . so also in the western world the number of car increase . but it is on a high level , so perhaps the growth will stop in a few year . but there are no sign that the situation will turn to fewer car . less visible , but nonetheless important is the situation of the street . all over the world street become better and better . this lead to a more comfortable feeling in your car what finally lead to more car . but i think the crucial question is not how many car we can count per person . the question is how many people will live on the world in twenty year . at the moment the population grows very fast . during the last twenty year the population increased of about 70 % . it is not certain if the growth remain a high but sure is : population will grow ! and more people buy more car . as a result i ca n't agree with the statement . i think there are no doubt that the number of car will become much higher .
