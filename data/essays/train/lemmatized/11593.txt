i belive that all the people want to enjoy their life . not only old people but also young people , too . i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are more energetic . young people can make more time than old people to enjoy . young people do n't have to think about the other people in the family like old people . first , young people are more energetic than old people . they work hard and the next day they can enjoy snowboarding whole day . then they have no problem to go to work the next day . the do n't get tired easily , because they put priority to enjoyment of their life . however , old people do n't want to get too tired since they care about their hearlth more than young people and their body do n't follow their mind . second , young people are more flexible at their time . old people have to think about thier job and consider the other people 's schedule , too . on the other hand , young people can make time whenever they want to . they can come home late to go to the movie and go to the library until late at night not considering the time . finally , there are more possiblities that young people are single . when they are single or do n't have the baby . they do n't have to think about what other family member ' opinion about their enjoyment of their life . they can go to the night club . they can go to trip whenever they want to . but when they are not single , or have child they should consider many situation , and ca n't be selfish . from above the reason , i think young people enjoy life more than old people . they do n't have to think about many situation which old people have to do . health , flexible time and what other family member .
