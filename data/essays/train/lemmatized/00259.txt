today man 's dependence on automobile is very much and will increase in the future . i disagree with the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' man is very much dependent on car which form his basic mean of locomotion without which he can not dream of going out . he us his car for many resons such a to go for work , to go out etc . futhermore the public transport is limited on which he ca n't rely upon for evereything . in order to access public transport he should go to bus station or to railway station for which he should have some sort of transport to take him from home to those place . the main thing which cause u to believe that car will become lesser in twenty year is the pollution . automobiles cause a lot of pollution but recent adavancements in technology have provided new technology that decrease pollution to a large extent . new technology have come which help to reduce the pollution created by the automobile and to make them more fuel efficient which is also a mojor concern for the car user . new technology such a use of natural gas instead of petrol and diesel have come which decrease the pollution by a large extent . this is also cost effective and ha become popular in the developing country like india . another technology which is more reliable is the use of battery power to run the car and this cause zero pollution . technologies like use of hydrogen gas a a fuel is also on consideration and research is still going on in this field . new technology in the field of manufacturing are also coming which increase the durability of automobile to a great extent i.e , they last longer . upon considering the following factor and reason i dont think that there will be a decrease in the number of car in the next twenty year .
