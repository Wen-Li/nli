nowadays , many people can see lot of advertisement . that is very effected to people . so , making an advertisement is very important for the company . i think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , a purpose of advertising a product is to sell more . so , they can add some lie in order to sell more . for example , i remembered that one company make an advertisement for a hair shampoo . in the tv , the advertisement introdce that when i use the shampoo , my hair change to silk . that 's lie and exaxerate . but the company sold lot of them . second , if they tell only fact about a product on advertisement , no one will buy the product . if i were the advertisement maker , i will not tell only fact . in fact , many company try to show more better than to show more factly . it 's of couse . third , no one intervene hardly on their advertisement idea . many advertisement make product much better . but if one company only express their product they really are , the company will do n't succeed . they have to sell their product . therefore , a purpose of advertising a product is to sell more . and many company try to show more better than to show more factly . and no one intervene hardly on their advertisement . it 's free . so most advertisement make product look better and want to show better than they really are .
