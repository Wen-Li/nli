i agree this statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is because the young have much physical energy , they can try what they want , and they can make use of that experience for the future life . first , the young are endowed with powerful energy more than the old . because they are on growing in case of child and keep going to live , they have physical energy . because they have much energy , they can do many activity in a day . for example , they go to school , participate in club activity , and have other extra possibility such a to talk with friend , to study , and so on . in contrast , the old can not all of those staff in a day because of their lack of energy , compared to the young . because they have enough energy , the young can work a lot and get knowledge and experience from there . second , the young can try whatever they want . for example , the young who have dream can try to make that come true . they can use time , devote themselves , and try to expand their ability . in such case , the life becomes really efficient and briliant . they have what they want and actually there is possibility , and they can try . the possibility are unlimited and the young can try those over and over again . however , the old can not do that because their remained life time is possibly limited . last , the young can use the experience to benefit their future life . after trial , even if they are not succesful for that dream , they learn from the attempt and get life experience . in addition to that , because they have enough time after that , they can make use of that fruitful experience and can make their life much better . the old , however , have limited time for their life and can not do that . the old have abundant exprience and mayhe have child and grand child to teach that experience . nevertheless , they no not have time to expand that experience by themselves . above all , i believe that the young enjoy life more than the older people . because their potential and energy are limittess , they can do many work and thing much more than older people .
