the quality of a people 's education and principle therein is measured in different way . germany for example is still a country very much influenced by the ideal of humanistic teaching principle conveighed by and kept alive almost since ancient time , when scholarly education wa a matter of academy and reknown school of thought . it seems that german non-universitarian education for high school student is still strictly modelled after this old idea . therefore high school schedule in germany include - or rather cram in ? - many subject . as soon a a student reach university or college level he find himself quickly forced into making his first own educational choice for which - due to the lack of previous experience - he might not be ready . there seems to be a great disproportion in what is considered important knowledge , everyone should have access to and in the understanding of what a true academic really is . when it come to university academic are people highly specialized in their subject . german university praise their specialist . of course , the people displaying knowledge or even expertise in several subject are often highly praized but they are rare and getting rarer by the generation of student . so much focus is put on the early specialization of the mind that the broad and not necessarily deep level of knowlegde is completely underestimated , whereas exactly this level actually make people accessible and grant them lightness and fluency of conversation with many different people of - again - many different - social , intellectual etc. - level . unfortunately , education ha become strongly influenced by trend of all kind . i am especially referring to the growing interest in economic study rather than the humanity , including philosophy . myself having enjoyed substantial training in the classic - latin , greek and hebrew - i only want to speak for the advancement of the broadly educated individual . the earlier a specialization take place the earlier a mind is locked-down and fixed . in order to determine the best use and combination of one 's interest a well a capability one ha to be a free a possible for a long a possible . i fear that specialization drain the individual early of it creative energy and serf a a uniformer to knowledge in general .
