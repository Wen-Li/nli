in general it is very hard to compare the level of enjoying life between younger and older people . they live in different situation with different problem and challenge . firstly one ha to consider the situation in which the different group are . both have an unique profile . the big part of the young people ha only few money , because they are going to school or studying at a university , so the possibility and the offer are different from those who are older and have relatively more money . young people often enjoy their life by hanging around with friend , doing sport , in short activity that cost only few money , on the other side older people go to work and so they have relatively more money which they can spend by eating in good restaurant , visiting the opera or travelling . by consideration these fact my opinion is that in general no one enjoy their live more . because the different ressources which are necessary to enjoy your life are balanced . to underline this , one can compare a student with a retired person , the retired person ha a lot of time , he can decide what he doe everytime , in spite of this he is n't in an better situation than a student that ha n't a lot of time for enjoying , the student have to prepare himself for his exam , but this time that he use for studying is no waste of time , probably the student is enjoying his matter , else he should n't have choosen it . on the other side the retired person ca n't fill allwazs all it freetime in conlusion i disagree with the statement , obviously it is balanced , nevertheless everyone should enjoy every second in his life .
