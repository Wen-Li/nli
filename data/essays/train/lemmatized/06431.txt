i think it is a commom phenomenon that older people tend to critizice the younger generation for just taking care of themselves and not thinking about the future . for example in austria this problem existed already many year and the 68-generation which ha been blamed for putting too much attention on the fun part of life already started to state their opinion about how bad the current generation is . i do n't think it is because the focus shifted to have fun . the reason for the missunderstanding ha something to do with development . because of economic development in many western country every generation started at a much better position than the last one . many improvement establishment during the industrial revolution created free time that needed to be filled by something we like to do . when most people were farmer they had not enough time for fun activity like going running or playing soccer because they were too tired after working on the field the whole day . many developed country have low weekly working hour and therefore provide space for people to enjoy their time . but of course also the free time culture did n't stop but continued to improve . the new hobby greated during the time seem like more fun for the older generation who is not able to do this kind of activity anymore . they are jealous about this new sport ( like skateboarding or snow boarding ) but forget that their generation also developed new thing that seemed strange for their parent . i do n't think that modern generation have more fun than older one but instead suggest to look at the cultural , economical and political context in order to judge this question . only because our grandparent enjoyed different thing than we do it doe n't mean that we enjoy life more than them . now i am young but when i become old i might change my opinion , like they did .
