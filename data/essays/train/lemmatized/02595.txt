since ever there are dicussions if young people enjoy life more than older people do . i would say that this is not true . if i look at my parent or even at my grandparent i can recognize that they still enjoy their life . fist of all , it is clear that older people enjoy their life in a more different way than younger people do . they do not want to go out every night or weekend . but for them this is not so important . they had the possiblities when they were young . for them it is more important to spent a much time with their family a possible . this is enjoying life for them . moreover older peolpe have much more thing to do every day . they have the responsibility for a house , they have a job to do , and many other thing . when you are young you do not have all these problem or jobes to handle with . so from the eye of young people our parent life might be seen a not too excited . but i would say that is is not true , too . for older people the thing mentioned above are very important . they are pround of all these thing and reaching is a way enjoying their life . another point i want to mention is that older people have made much more experiance in their life . most of the think me and my friend are doing now my parent have already done . so they enjoyed their life a they were young nearly in the same way a my generation doe it now . so you never can not say that they do not enjoy their life . they enjoyed their life a well a we do it now . but unfortunatelly this most of the younger people will understand when they get older . to come to a conclusion , i would never say that younger peolpe enjoy their life more than older peolpe do . as you can read above i completly disagree with this statement .
