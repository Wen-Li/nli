in nowadays , the rate of increasing car is faster than ever before . it is true that car ha many benefit for moving from place to another place . however , i strongly agree that there will be le car than now in twenty year because of following reason . first of all , a car is a main cause of many pollution problem . by using of gasoline to drive a car , car make much co or other kind of harmful gas which provokes air pollution . these pollution have been accumulated for many year so that nature disastors which we can not explain scientifically occurs recently . according to a survey which is investigated all over the world by green peace , which is one of the famous environmental organization , over 80 % people of who suffered from the nature disaster believe that substance which are made by car ha been made disaster . moreover , the goverment is making law about the limiting of using a car because of the pollution . another significant reason is that the amount of oil which is a very popular resource to drive a car is decreasing . as everybody know , the amount of oil which is saved under the ground is limited and it price is increasing fastly . according to a geological professor in the united states , the rest of oil will finish only for 12 year if we use oil in the same rate a now . as more expensive the price of oil is , le people drive a car . for example in my country , when the oil price wa going up 10 % of the price , 20 % of the driver gave up to drive a car . although there are other source such a electricity or hybrid , howere , it need time more than 20 year to be common . to make a long story short , the population of driving a car will be decresing in a few year because of pollution and expensive oil . therefore , there will be fewer car in use than today .
