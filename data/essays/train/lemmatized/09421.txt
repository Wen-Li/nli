the youth of a coummuniy it is said is it very pulse . how true this belief is in the modern day context is what remains to be examined . with every passing century in the history of the human race it youth ha become increasingly empowered , alert and certainly more aggressive in numerous way . as part of this section of the communiy i can safely afford to voice some of it concern and predicament . while it is true that the young people of today have different priority and expectation from themselves which often lead to a self absorbed style of living , it would be unfair to say that they are any le sensitive to the need of their community than they were in the last few generation . nor can it be said that they are unaware of their responsibility that they owe to fellow human being . in fact the young people of our time are more inclined towards community service and other volunteer work than people belonging to older generation were . a classic example is that of bombay city , the financial capital of india whose youth came forward to help the administration in the post 7/11 blast period and on another occasion when it wa severely hit by relentless flooding . students , professional and every kind could be seen not just helping clear the debris but also in managing the insanely difficult traffic in the thick of flood and disease that had devoured the city 's prosperity in a matter of day . the entire nation watched on their television screen the moral strength and commitment that the youth of this organic city so selflessly displayed in time of a national crisis . this however is not where it end . contrary to popular and convenient belief the youth of today , across the world is better prepared and more committed to tackle to problem of the human community than they ever have been .
