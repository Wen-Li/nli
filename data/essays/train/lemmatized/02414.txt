young people enjoy life more than old people do . i agree twith the statement because they are more energetic and have a great physical and mental ability to work , to earn , to play and what not . '' a fit body ha better brain '' and this make young generation to enjoy the life more . older people are capable of giving the idea based on their experience but could not implement them a they lag the physical fitness required for heavy work and also being slower in doing a work . children at school have great fun in learning , playing , doing innovative project , being with parent , expressing their view in various way such a drawing , moulding of clay , building some metal structure using small piece of metal . at the age of 16 they learn to apply the idea which help in inventing new device or theory that were unsolved or were remained a a mystery so long . also the future of the nation depends undoubtedly in the hand of the younger generation . when you take a look at the past twenty year the role of younger generation in every field ha increased gradually . if a work is alloted to a group of young individual they take that work a a challenge , strive to complete that a quickly a possible and they even enjoy working for something they want to . younger people look for enjoyment in every work they do . for an example i enjoy working for my study , for my career and earning for my family and in helping others to develop . there are many thing which the older people can not do a the young do . bill gate wa young when he started research , srinivasa ramanujan wa a young mathematician , shakuntala devi wa young for her intelligence in answering mathematical question and puzzle a fast a super computer , adolf hitler wa young when he wanted to rule the world . in the near future we will be able to see the young and dynamic youth ruling . education and research , politics , science , business and in all the field . the energy , the entusiasm , the innovative idea , the spirit and many other factor make the younger generation enjoy life more than the older people do .
