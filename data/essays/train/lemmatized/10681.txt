i gisagree with this statement . it is true that some young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , but there are also some young people who do it . for example , my friend went to elderly people dorm to do volunteer work . she talked a lot with the eldery people . she said to me '' elderly people looked happy when i talked with them . oher student just went there a intership , but i think we did volunteer work . we could make them happy . '' when i heard that , i felt that young people nowadays not all bad person . the are many young people who are kind and do volunteer work . another example , i had cleaned my city to do volunteer work to take up raddishes on the road when i wa a elememtaly school student and a junior high school student . other student in our city also did such a volunteer work . moreover , it doe n't mean '' give enough time to helping their community '' but i want to say this . nowadays , i often see that young people give thier seat to the elderly people . i also often give my seat to elderly people . does n't it mean we help our community ? i also think that working very hard , taking great degree at school , keeping the best score by school activity sport and writing great art also mean that we help our community . for instance , great school which made grate student will be known other city and thev city will be famous . there are many student who study hard or plactice sport to win the play . above all , i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time helping their community .
