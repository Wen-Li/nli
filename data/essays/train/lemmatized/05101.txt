i agree with that statement because learning fact are based on understanding idea . students can not learn new fact without knowing where they came from or what corroberates them . for some people , memorizing a new fact is enough . it might not be that important to them to understand it or study it . but i disagree with that . there ha to be a base for everything someone learns or it wont be concidered learning . my favourite subject ha always been math because , unlike subject like history and literature , it all based on logic . everything ha an explanation and acknowledging that explanation lead to acknowledging a new fact . when student understand idea , they become more productive , and more accomplished , because grasping and analizing idea lead to creativety which lead to creation . students have differents learning skill , some learn by memorizing conlusions , and some cant memorize without an knowing how they reached to the those conclusion . understanding idea is more difficult that learning facts. a fact can be learned by reading a book or a biography , an idea ha to be studied to be learned , which oblidges more thinking . as a result , one who study new concept provide more in the community in the future , because what is his or her mind are not just fixed fact , they are way of thinking . if someone think about the technology that is enhancing everyday and the growth of our economy , it will be clear that it is the cause of knowledge , knowledge that is not only obtained by memorizing fact but by creative mind . there is more to improvement than learning fact . and when i say improvement i mean in yourself . when you want to imoprove youself you need to understand what you learn to implicate it . thats how the process of teaching work a well . teachers could have just given out book and told student to read them at home and get tested on them the next day . wouldnt that have been easier if the point wa n't to make student understand what they 're taking in school ?
