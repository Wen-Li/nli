while some people who like traveling alone disagree with that opinion , but i totally agree with that opinion that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have two reason for this . they are reliability and gurantee . first , travel with tour guide ha reliability for time and schedule . when i go to travel alone , i sometimes miss a transportation what we need to get on or a park i want to visit is closed . but if we go to travel with tour guide , we can not miss it and we can visit there . i hate to worry about anything except from enjoying . when i go to travel to see something i want , we do not know about when it is open or close even though i study before , it might be suddenly close . we can not reach the purpose of that tour . second , i have certainly gurantee which is kind of insurance in travel with tour guide . though sometimes we have a sick such a headache and cold even though heart disease , if we are with the tour guide , he take u to the proper hospital or the place to rest . that is a big useful in travel . when also we have a possiblity to meet accident such a car accident and something mine stolen , he will contact with local police and might get back . in terrible situation such a a sick or accident , we can rely on the tour guide . on the other hand , if we go to travel alone , we can not rely on anyone , so we should communicate with your stranger and negotiate . that need vast work and getting exhauseted . in conclusion , when i go to travel , i am always together with my tour guide . it is the most useful way for u to enjoy our travel . thus i would go to travel ina group led by a tour guide . and i recommend you to go to travel with a tour guide for your most happiness .
