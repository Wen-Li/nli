iam in complete agreement with this statement . nowadays , young people are not devoting sufficient time to helping their community . there are several reason why i believe so and i shall put forth some of them . i shall also try to cite some reason why i believe such a behavior is prevalent today . there are several example that illustrate the declining devotion to the community . earlier in india , there used to be a lot of institution that used to help out the poor people . a primary example is the service institute run by mother teresa . but such instance are on a rapid decline these day . in our school , we were required to complete 20 compulsory hour of community service , where we had to teach illiterate people , young or old . to me , this presented u with an excellent opportunity of putting our knowledge to good use , doing something that would benefit our community and our country . but a lot of student used to bunk these class and used some unfair mean to put in the attendance . as a result , this requirement of community service wa removed after we passed out , which clearly illustrates the feeling the young people have towards their community . it is true that a number of institution are coming up in india that aim to help out the elder member of the society . this might be considered to be a positive development . but when we look closely , we notice an alarming fact . why are these institute needed . the reason is that young people do not stay around to help and support their parent . the parent , when they get old , need some help , and since their own sons/daughters are not around to help , they seek refuge in such institution . this demonstrates the level of selfishness that prevails amongst the youth of our country . to me , my community also comprises of my family member , relative and neighbor . people have even stopped caring for their parent these day . lot of student graduate and go abroad and then forget their parent . they do n't come back , do n't enquire about their health and do n't send money that their parent may require . selfish attitude ha become prevalent in the indian society these day , where you do n't care for anyone else but for yourself . the parent , who have sacrificed so much in bringing you up , are not given the respect and attention they deserve in old age . little can one expect the youth to go around helping the community they belong to . if we look closely , we might be able to find the reason why young people are neglecting their community these day . the world ha become extremely competetive and a a result , people need to work a lot harder than those of say 50 year back . the competetion ha become very stiff and a a result , a lot of time ha to be devoted for personal thing like studying for various exam , working overtime at work place , etc . so , the increasing competetion might be one of the major factor why young people do n't devote enough time for their community these day . increasing job opportunity abroad might also be a reason for this kind of behavior . the kind of money that is offered in some job abroad is extremely tempting . young people flee from their country , never to return . they become intoxicated wth the new way of life and forget all their obligation towards their parent , friend , relative and their other communitites . thus , in my opinion it is true that the young people of today are not devoting enough time , if any , in helping out their community .
