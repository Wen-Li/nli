i love my car and ca n't give up using it and i do n't agree with the statement that say there will be fewer car in twenty year than today . i have three major reason to say that . one of them is newer type of car are being produced and the second is the transportation with car is ok for many people and the third one is the expense of the change that to be done for people to transport the first reason for not agreeing the statement is that i think rather than extinction , newer type of car are being produced . these type include car which work with electrical power , hydropower and in the next future i 'm sure there will be car which will work with many other thing . there are also plan to create car which is flying near to surface and this will provide place for some more car . the second reason is that i think there is no other way of transportation rather than car which are so effective and so cheap . now the usage of car are very huge . there are other way of transportation for example plane . they ca n't belong to anyone in the world but car can be used by most of the people . nowadays many people have car and in my country this number will increase a the development of the country . cars are effective for transportation for many people the third reason for not agreeing this statement is that to give up using car there should be radical change . they should be very expensive change , that is needed to compansate for the need of transportation of the increasing population of the world . installing a new system is required and for this system many new research should be conducted which will be expensive and constructing will require money very much again . to conclude , a i stated the reason above there will be more car than now in twenty year . one of them is newer car type and the second one is the efficiency of car and the expense of the change . there is an air pollution problem because of the usage of the car unfortunately but i believe if this problem is solved car would be more critical and would a better place in the people 's eye .
