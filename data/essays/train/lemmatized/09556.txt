i agree with the statement most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because the principal task of a marketing and branding executive is to improve new market and to sell his product to them . one way of selling product is showing the benefit it provides ; like texture , taste , color , us , etc . all of this benefit go directly to the costumer 's mind by the advestisement , which let the customer enjoy the product for a few second or minute throught the television , the radio , internet , etc . as an example , when any fast food bussines advertises it 's product ( in this case a hamburger with fry and dessert ) , they show a really big hamburger with large fry with lot of spicy sauce and a a dessert , a huge ice cream with two different topping on it . but when one , a a customer go to that fast food restaurant , instead of one big meal , one found a medium not tasty hamburger with medium fry without spicy sauce ( because it is a side , it is not included in the meal ) and with a one - scoop ice cream . this is not fair for the costumer , but a i said in the introduction , that 's the way marketing executive create their advertisement , showing the customer how good their product are . finally , a it occurs in food company , it happens the same in most of the company around the world ; in the advertisement one will always see a perfect product with extraordinary characteristic , but when one buy the product is when one know if the product is a good a it wa supposed to be or all of the advertisement wa a fake .
