i actually think that it is true : a product look usually better in the advertisement than in real . but i also think that it is normal and i 'm going to explain why . first , advertising exists for two reason : it informs you of every new product that come out on the market and it encourages people to buy it . when you look at an advertisement in the street or on tv , the advertiser want you to need this object and to think about buying it , to desire it . obviously , you will see the product ( materiel or not ) in it best aspect , sometimes presented with others product that improve the image of the product . that is the case for all the food product : for example , meat will often be presented with some beautifull vegetable or a charming sauce . and you will never see a parfume presented by a normal man or woman but by one or several top model . in this situation , it is not the product itself that is more beautifull but the context and you have the impression that the product is better than in your hand . besides , advertising is a kind of art , and sometimes help research for the cinema . you can test new technique , try to film some place ( the film `` the lord of the rings '' wa filmed in new zealand after the landscape wa tested or remarked in an advertisement ) . that explains also why such money is put in advertisment and why they are often so developped and beautifull . but the product seems better to a certain extent and they can not be physical difference between the product on tv and in the supermarket : the consumer is protected by a law that forbids to make false advertisement . so i will conclude saying that advertising enhance the image of the product and it is better like that . it only concern u to be aware of that and not to be foul .
