most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . the idea of the advertisement is that the people really want to obtain a specific product even if they have not taken , so in my opinion the creation of an advertisement is a business work , is a marketing job and what the factory want to do is to offer a product that seems great because if the people see something that it look good and special is possible that they are going to get it and try it . in my opinion there are some advantage and some disadvantage of this advertisement . first of all some of the advantage are that the advertisement reflect what is the product look like , it a good clue to find people to buy the product , it a good comunication between the saler and the client , is a way to promote a new product , and actually a new way to buy thing because people are very busy and do not have enough time to go shopping is buying thing that they look in newspaper , magazine publicity , and tv marketing this one becomes very famous during the last year because most of the people watch tv so is a medium to have an idea about the product and it ha an advantage you just make a phone call and you can receive your product back in your home inmediately . but some disadvantage are that may be the product seem much better than they really are , they seem biger than they really are , they taste better than they really are . so it up to everyone if we get or not a specific product . in my case i think i am agree with the position that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are because today the marketing is the publicity of a product
