learning is a very important part of student life . i think learning in any form add to one information and knowledge area . therefore in my opinion when a student is at undergraduate level he should take variety of course both in the area of learning fact and understanding idea and concept . on the otherhand when a student is taking up a graduate program he or she should take up a course which involves understanding the concept and idea . for example taking a professional course in the understaning of computers is better than studying history or geography . i beleive that task becomes easier and more enjoyable if one try to understand instead of memorizing it . thus a practical approach is better than rote learning . i feel learning fact is not a much interesting a understanding concept . thus i agree with the statement .
