no one can cast a shadow of doubt on the fact that there is innumorous number of advertisement in the world . there is a discussion among different people about whether advertisement make item seem much better than they really are , or not . as regard the aformentioned idea , i reckon advertisement do not show what they really are because they forcus only their merit , and use attractive picture in them . besides medicen and cigarret commarcials , company emphasize only advantage of their product . for example wash soap , in the tvs or magazine , they show only very clean white plate and clear glass . audiences understand how it is effective , we can clean up everything so easily . however , of course we have to spend some time to do dish , or maybe we need soak them for little while . they do not show the various type of food stain . therefore we do not understand actuall effect of the product . furthermore , advertisement maker use very attractive picture in them . beautiful landscape , pretty acctress , among others make it nicer . for instence , in a cosmetic product advertisment , there are always a beautiful young actress . even if the product forcus for antiaging , they pic up young model . of course her skin integlity is not because of the product . however , people do not know her actuall age , thus easily people believe the result . in a nutshell , advertisments are created for incresing their salls , therefore , company want to show only good point of it
