every people want to get a much enjoyment a he can get from his life . one of the main factor that affect the level of this enjoyment is the age of the person . i think young people enjoy life more than older one since there are more facility for them and they are le directly concerned with many problem that come with age level . to begin with , there are many entertainment facility in today 's world for young people such a night club , sport club , dance club and so on . the primary reason behind this fact is the marketer ' concern about the young people that they are more energetic and more attracted for entertainment product and service . secondly , young people tend to be more individualistic . they have a tendency to think of themselves rather than their family . they go to party , enjoy their college education etc . they have little concern for money , since their parent pay for their expense or they are granted scholarship . on the other hand when people becomes older , several different concern arise . older people should think of the financial situation of the family member , education of their sibling , housing expense and surviving after retirement . some people may argue that age doe not matter in term of enjoying life by claiming there are many opportunity suitable for every age group . although i agree to this claim to a certain extent , i think there are some physiological and psychological constraint that prevent them from doing what they want to do . illnesses and being tired of life can be given a an example . to sum up , i can easily say that young people 's having much more facility for entertainment and being confronted with le problem make them enjoy their life more .
