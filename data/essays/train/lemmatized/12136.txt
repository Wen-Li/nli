i must say taht i am totally disagree with the statement given . ideas and concept are fictional , created thought on specific question . these are developed by someone and might be accepted a a fact in the society even not at the beginning . for example `` democracy '' . in modern society concept of democracy ha created it own myht . we see democracy a an ideal which all people should respect it institution and live according to it rule . in our eye democracy is universal . however , only 64 year ago , in the heart of europe a man raised his voice against the democracy and million followed him despite his brutulness paved the way for a war massacered million who followed him and other million from different nation . the reasonne behind this is the ignorance of the fact of german people devoting themselves to the idea and concept of race superiority , dictatorship and fuhrer . under the brutal regime of hitler junta , they not only ignored what happened to their neighbour but told their child to do so also . hitler wa successful because he could play with the idea and concept a he liked . what i mean is a the idea concept are the product of whether an individual or a society they may not reflect the right or the fact everytime . they show most of the time what the bulk of people think , but these thought might have nothing to do with the fact . a solid education system must be based on the fact a well a idea and concept . if we do not give the chance student to learn fact and the concept and idea built on them one part of the education will always be missed . i remember when i wa at school of law . roman law wa one of the toughest of the lesson , especially the relation in the family . as a concept roman law , in my opinion , alone can not explain the fictitious relation between for example bride and her father in-law . in ancient rome when bride come to his husband family , she is accepted not a a bride , but however a the daughter of the patria familias . to understand the reason we must look at the fact provided u by history and sociology . to sum up , my own experience ha shown me that learning of the idea and concept must walk in hand with the fact in education system . otherwise easily misguided by wrong idea , student might not find what the real world is .
