i agree with the statement which say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . typically , young people are healthier and thus they have more opportunity to pursue different activity like bungee jumping , parasailing , gliding and others which provide a stimulation and a difference to the usual routine of the life of people . young people are also not usually weighed down with the responsibilites of family life . thus they are able to go on adventure and undertake risky project with complete enthusiasm and lack of fear . climbing mount everest , going on a jungle safari ride , going racing with friend on car are some of the activity that older people are scared to undertake a they get on in life . when people are young , say in college , they usually have a gang of friend with whom pursuing different activity becomes a lot of fun . but a time go on , they get married and have child . slowly they start losing contact with their college friend and it no longer becomes possible to go on trip a happy-go-lucky bachelor . now if they go on trip , they do so with their family and this give a totally different and more serious outlook compared to going with friend . when young , people are not concerned a lot about saving money . so they do n't mind spending money and going on trip frequently . but older people realize that trip are not essential , but providing for the future of the family is . so they decide to restrict their activity and spend only on what is essential and save the rest for the future . finally one can say that a person is only a old a he think he is . so if a person think he is young in mind , he can have fun no matter what the age . it 's the attitude of the person that count when you want to have fun , not the actual number of year you 've lived on earth !! all these reason thus support the view that the younger you are , the more fun you can have !
