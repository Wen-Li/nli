i completely agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are two main reason for that : they give a perfect appearance of an object that is not always that beautiful , and they represent some product a being able to do thing that are quite improbable . first of all , most advertisement work on the physical aspect of the product in the picture or commercial . this is intented to show a perfect physical aspect of the product , but this doe n't always reflect the reality . for example , when you watch a mcdonald 's commercial , they give the burger a much prettier image than the one you will actually hold in your hand when you order it yourself . another example would be makeup commercial , in which all product seem to have a magical effect , when in fact , the lighting and beautiful model boost their apparent efficiency . these representation are intended to make the consumer buy the product , but he or she will most probably be disappointed when trying it . second of all , most advertisement display their product a being able to do thing that are quite improbable , or at least very difficult . one major example for this is car advertising on television , which may show the vehicle climbing cliff , engaging on racing track , or going into wild nature without any problem . in each case , and for any vehicle advertised , the product is not only shown a being adapted for these action , it is also presented a the better one . this is surely not possible for all of those car , at least not with an everyday-life driver . although some of the advertisement may represent product accurately , the marketing rule lead advertiser to make strong endeavor to represent the product a well a they can to attract the consumer , even if it is not the exact reality .
