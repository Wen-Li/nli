advertisments is what make the product to be saled . when offering a product the best quality of it is shown . this marketing technique ha boost up a lot of product for not saying most of them . we have some case like shampoo , clothes , and medicine . first , most of the adverstisments company only want to sell , no matter how , no matter when , but the faster the better , sometimes they exagerate the function of a product or it quality , to convince and presuade people to buy it . second , the product will eventually work but most of the time not in the way shown in the adverstisment , let take the case of a no-hair lost shampoo , the advertisment will show a bald man who want his hair back , so he will use the shampoo for a few day and after minute in the advertisment you will see a guy with long hair talking about his experience , i really do not beleive that , thats my personal opinion because they say you will se result in a short period , and yes , you will see them but not a much a they say it will . third , advertisments create sometimes a non-real idea of the product , or if they do they will show you real shallow . in conclusion , advertisments only work for boosting up a product and convince a costumer . it is not a main purpose show what the product really is or how is it going to work or how long doe it will take . they just want to convince you and persuade you to buy it . thats why i strongly dislike to see advertisments , everything is a big lie , my quote is `` advertisment product do half of what they say and half of what they pomise '' .
