in our modern time of new way of communication via television or internet it is not difficult to make a product seem much better through advertisement than it really is . lets take for example a pencil which is praised to be of very high qualitiy at tele-shopping , of course for a low price . the costumer will pick up the telephone and order this lovely pencil . two week later he got the small packet with the little pencil in it and he ca n't wate to open it . still he think he made a good deal with what he bought on tv , very practical and easy buying . but what happens in the end ? the colour of the pencil is blue instead of black a it wa shown on tv . the writing is not that lovely a it wa described in the advertisment . what now ? big disappointment . as we see in this little example the new medias have the power to manipulate the costumer in a way he doe not even take note of it . the composion of the light in which the product is recorded , or the frame in which it is showed can make it seem bigger , smaller , nicer etc . for the costumer it is hard to imagine how the product look like in reality . this kind of manipulation bz making thing appear better than thez really are is a profession for itself , in that way one can imagine how effective these tool must be . conclusona ; in may opinion in many case the original product is very different in aspect and quality so that one ha to be carefull with too fast decision about buying a product . it is always better to put down the glass of advertisments and look with zour own eye
