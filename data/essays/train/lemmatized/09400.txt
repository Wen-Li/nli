young people are the future . they do n't realize this anymore . they are becoming not effective in there community . young people spend time on usless stuff , they are relayable , and have studying a an excuse everytime they are asked to do something . young people tend to spend so much time on fun stuff rather than helping their community . most young people surf the net for approximately four hour a day . this make them forget about what sorrounds them . they also spend their time chatting on mobile . they hang out with each other and talk about what happend in their day . they do n't spend time thinking about their future in this communty and how they must be an effective part in it . young people relay on adult in doing many thing . relaying on adult would close their eye from what sorrounds them . for example , if a young son relay on his father in paying all his fee , he would not have the chance to try having a job . having a job would show him what his community need . most young people have studying a an excuse for not helping in the community . this is not a proper excuse for not helping their community because each one of u can manage time if they want to do so . for example , student can help their community by doing community work in their school . such a selling craft for charity work . they may toture other student to help them with what is hard on them . all of these characteristic would help their community improve . young people must change . their community need them . they the leader of the future . they must care about their community . this community wa improved by people that were young one day . what do those old young people have that nowadays young people do n't ?
