without question , i agree witn this idea that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . i have two reason for this opinion : energy and freedom . first of all , i think that young people are able to exercise more harder then older people because they are young , so they have a lot of energy in general . in my grandfather 's case , he said that he could run very fast and carry everything even the huge thing when he wa 21 year old . moreover , he played baseball everyday after school with his friend and never injured when he wa junior high-school . i guess he wa a tough boy , but he never play sport now . furthermore , he say that you should play sport when you are young because you will not be able to run faster end play some sport when you are 70 year old . secondly , i asserts that young people can fall in love with their classmate , school friend and so on easily . in my case , i loved some girlfriend when i wa a high-school student . it wa very enjoyable and very sweet memory for me . however , the older people can not propose the people they love or like , i think . it is because that older people have their husband or wife in many case . of course , if you are young and not married , you can make boyfriend or girlfriend freely . while it may be true that not every young people can fall in love with someone , and older people tend to have much money than young people . however , young people are given the freedom . that 's why they may be find their love affair and are given money by thier parent . to be young mean that to be free , i think . in conclusion , i support the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people do . his/her energy and freedom enables him/her to enjoy life , i think .
