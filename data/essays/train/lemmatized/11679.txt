as far a i am concerned , i take side for the idea that it is more essential and useful to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . first and foremost , it is worth mentionning that a strong aquaintance is based on the ability to classify fact and event . indeed , for instance , in order to understand historical event , it is unefficient to accumulate fact in a chronological order . what is really thought-provoking is to be able to identify why it ha occured . to identify that , you must be aware of philosophical theory or political movement . thus , i personnaly believe you have to learn concept and idea to have a clear idea of history and to understand better fact . furthermore , knowing an accumulation of fact is useless . as a matter of fact , it doe not allow student to face all situation . there is a striking issue ; students who study economy need to know what is liberalism or keynesianism but not the little event that arose in an unknown company . eventually , student have to prepare them to be efficient and dynamic on the labor market . broadly speaking , i think that learning idea and concept build your ability to face predicament or dilemnas . in a company , when you take a decision , it is not only important but also , to me , mandatory to refer yourself to a concept in order to defend your viewpoint and your action . a wellknown idea or concept may lead your bos to trust you about the efficiency of your action . to conclude , i personnaly believe that idea and concept are crucial for a strong and logical knowledge in university . moreover , i think that it is essential to adapt to the labor market .
