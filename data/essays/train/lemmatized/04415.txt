the statement is certainly true . products ' quality are exaggerated by advertisement . as there is no empirical support available , i will support this position twofold . first , i will give two short example of such advertisement . second , i will discus possible explanation of the phenomenon . if there are both fitting case and a compelling theory , we have the best evidence availiable without further study . finally , i will briefly discus possible action . the first example relates to a typical car spot . the car are almost always polished to brilliance , the only exception being spot on jeeps , hummers and the like . but these type of car are designed for use in wilderness . suv ( meaning sports utility vehicle ) is ironically referred to a a ` suburban utility vehicle ' . the spot pretend a reality that doe not exist . also , often the window of the car are made of black glass . i suppose this stress the geometric feature of the car and let it appear a bit mystique . summed up , the car are always in perfect shape and not in the state of your average car . using small and smart trick , the spot manipulate the expectation and the image you might have of the car . another example is a recent advertisement for milk that i saw . in the morning , the whole family sat together around a nice table in a beautiful kitchen . the sun wa shining , and everybody wa havong fun and drinking milk . this scenario probably is a bit overstretched and not corresponding to the average breakfast . it wa suggested that milk and the enjoyable situation are linked together . after these two short example , we proceed to possible explanation . a set of them is located in the dynamic of the competition on the market . firms , if they are to survive , are forced to sell their good . to this end , they try to compel the comsumer to buy the company 's product , and not the competitor 's . therefore , firm make their good appear a good a possible . advertisements not only serve to immediately selling product - they also increase the prestige of the company 's brand . a well-known name allows a company to take higher price for it product , for consumer base their decision upon incomplete information about the product . they assume that a well-known brand also mean well-established quality , which would justify higher price . also , game theory help a bit in explaining the phenomenon . a company can not be sure that the competitor 's advertisement are true . so the company may be tempted to cheat a little to boost it sale in a presumably unfair competition . in political science , this constellation is known a prisoner 's dilemma . regarding possible solution , the eu ha some regulation on advertisement that do not exist in the united states . in the eu , company are not allowed to include information about the product they know to be wrong . also , the eu ha stricter guideline on ingredient in food and their publication . apparently , there might be some room to manouevre in the legislative area to tackle the problem . on the other hand , an informed consumer judging on the basis of the best knowledge will be the best weapon against these kind of misleading advertisement .
