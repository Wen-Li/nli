regarding the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' i think it depends on the situation and the country or place where you are going . traveling deal with a lot of thing like : language , culture , nature , weather , kind of inhabitant , available time , etc. and for every case it coulbe a different oppinion about the statement . for instance if i 'm in china probably i will prefer to be guided by a skilled tour guide , otherwise anybody can get lost , but if i 'm going to an european country in that case i will prefer to go on my own . time is also important if you have little time for traveling then an experienced guide will be very heplfull to know a much a possible in short time . regarding group , if you are with a group where you do n't know anybody it will be very different experience if you know all of the people in the group very well , like in a football team or schoolmate . on the other hand , if your intention is to know new people in the place you are visiting , then traveling alone it could be an advantage . other important factor to consider is the reason or the final intention of the travel . for instance , if you are traveling to rest and be away of noise , to have a time for yourself or , on the contrary , you are willing to know new place , people and city . in both case , the group or the guide is a big difference . as explained , it is necessary to take a lot of thing into account before to agree or disagree with such general statement , but if i have the oppotunity to travel , i will prefer to go to europe in a group and without tour guide , in this case i do n't agree with the statement .
