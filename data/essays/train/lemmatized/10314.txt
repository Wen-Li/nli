do you think people who always think and act same a other person do will succeeed in the future ? i think people should try new thing and take risk for their success . i have some reason to support my opinion . first , i think many thing are changing rapidly everyday ; for example , people 's demand and preference are different from yesterday . thus we have to think about new thing and product . if we do n't care about this point , no one will be interested our business , and we will not succeed . second , risk produce big success for u . most people do n't want to take risk because they are afraid of the result . then , these people the safety way and get le success . they ca n't get much money or be supecial people . they are just general . however people who take risk will succeed because they chose very difficult way for them , and they will make an effort for success . motivation is tottally different among the two people . finally , people who do n't take risk do n't believe their ability . they ca n't trust themselves for success . we have to believe ourselver for success . in conclusion , for those reason i agree with the statement . i think if we want to success , we should try risk and believe our possibility and future .
