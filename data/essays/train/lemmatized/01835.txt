nowadays , there are ten of thousand of advertisement everywhere , these advertisement exists on tv program , internet website and even on wall paper . accoring to the resent scientific research done by toronto sun newspaper , more than 83 % of the people think that the product are usually worse than what they have been advertised . even though most of the manufacture will argue that their advertisement truely reflect their product ; but majority of the society , including me , stronly believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , with the purpose to sale a much product a possible , the advertisement will always enlarge the actual ability of their product . for example , if one person what to sell a car , most likely , the ability to save gas will be one of the most important feature that others look into . even though , the car may not save gas at all , but for the sake of selling the car quickly and with a higher price . the seller would possibly indicate that this car can save gas . this can be applied to the process of selling all product . in addition , the fact that the actual product ca n't not be see in person increase the possibility of the saling company to hide the weakness of their good . a good example would be the on line seeling process . the product are sold with only a few line of instruction and a tiny picture that may not even be true on the website . just because the people ca n't test or touch the actual product itself , they are depressed with the difference in quality of the actual product and what is been told on the internet . all in all , taking into consideration of what i have discussed above , it is self-evident that most advertisement do not tell the truth . this situation occurs not only because of the desire to earn more profit of the producer but also result of the lack of the oppertunities for the customer to test the product in person .
