i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . when i watching the tv commercial or magerzine , i wa suprised because the comercials and real material are too different . and sometimes , i see the wrong information that say they have more effect like bubble , i think that adverisements make product seem much better than they really are because when they did that they can get more economic profit and they think that they make good product so they have a good image . first , when they make produscts seem much better than they really are , most people believe that and they buy and use the product so they can get more money and more economic profit . for example , yesterday i bought some chip . i do not konw exaxtly kind of chip and favior of chip . i choose one that i saw the advertise on the tv because when i wa watching tv , it look delicious . but it is not a delicious . i think that customer buy product that wa watched or heared . second , they think they make good product and good image . but it is not true . they make usual product . the comercial is just showed that look much better , and some advertise are appear famouse star or people so people buy the product . but it is just comercial . so do not allow the tric . in conclusion , when the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , owner can get more money and economic profit , and they think that they have a good emage and they make a good product . but i think that it is tric . it is just bubble so if i am a advertiser , i want to do that do not seem much better and i show the real product ' tempt .
