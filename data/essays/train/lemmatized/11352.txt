i would definitely agree that the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are some reason why i believe so , and the example i can give for this topic . one of the example is that the every product at the supermarket , especially the food look very good which make the customer want to buy them . some product are a good a how the advertisement look when you open the product at home , but some are completely different than how the advertisement look . i am one of the customer that buy food . i look at the advertisement first and then if i think the product seems good , i pay for them . i have been very disappointed many time by being treated by the advertisement . i 've had many food that taste completely different than how the advertisement look like . it happens alot in frozen food . even though you look in the box what the inside product look like , you ca n't tell how it taste like until you heat it . people always look at the advertisement first and then decide weather they want to buy it or not . it may look very different when the frozen product is heated than how it is suppose to look like which show on the advertisement . even though the company that make those product make the advertisement look much better than they really are which doe not really make people happy , it is not their fault . i believe that the company work hard on the advertisement than they do on making product . the company just want to sell product a more a possible . they know that it is the most important thing to make the advertisement neat which make the people want to buy them . i believe that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are in order to sell more and more because selling product and making money from it is their job .
