there are many successful people around the world now and if we want to be a successful person , we can learn some thing from them . i agree with this statement which is `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i think my father is a successful person because he is a good sample for me all the time . he is a doctor in taiwan and when he wa still a kid , he like to try new thing and always interested in the thing that he doe not know . my grandmother told me a lot of his story when he is young . and when he studied in high school , he already knew that he want to be a doctor in the future . he always got good mark on the test or homework so he did not worried about these thing . he started to go to some hostipal and see what 's going on in a real place not just in school . he think this would be useful when he actually work in a hospital . after he graduated , he started to learn how to be a doctor and it wa much more difficult than study in school . he try many nre thing such a helping the patiens . they only did some practice in the school but not for real patiens so it is very hard for him at the first time . but after many year , he can control everything in his hospital now . my father is a good example because he keep continue to learn new thing after he graduated and also take risk . if he only did what he already know in the school , he can not be a successful doctor in the hospital now . therefore i agree with this statement .
