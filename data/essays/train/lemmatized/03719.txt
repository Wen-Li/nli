i am writing this compositon to argue about the statment that say `` is it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . in the next paragraph i am going to state the advantage of having broad knowledge in many acedemic subject and the disadvantage of it . every single person all around the world want to be a person with knowledge a person who ha a good average and all the family is proud to have a person like that . studying many subject in school and in university and getting low mark is useless there would be only one advantage and that is that this person will show that he is able to study so many subject at once . on the other hand side . there are many disadvantage of having broad knowledge in so many subject . first of all studying physic chemistry along with business and economics need both learning and thinking , i do not think that there is a person who is able to study these subject together . studying all these subject will not make a person work in a company which ha engineering combined with journalism . a person can only work in one of these company . almost all the people who work in company now graduated from university and all of these people studied a specific subject . studying a subject you are an expert in is much better than studying many subject that you are not good in . many people who study many subject are doing that just to get more money , these people should know that money is not more important than having a job which you are expert in , and at the same time you are enjoying yourself in this company . another reason a person would want to have this knowledge in many subject would be that this person just want to show off infront of friend and family that he is working in two company at once . my cousin wa one of those people that wanted to have broad knowledge in so many subject and he suffered a lot studying in university . on the other hand his brother studied finance only and now his brother is happier than him in his work and he is also getting a higher salary . i disagree about this statement `` having broad knowledge in many subject is better than specializing in one subject '' . i think specializing in one subject is much better and i advise every single person who is planning to study many subject to think before making this desicion because nothing is more important than your future .
