nowdays , book contain a lot of information which we know or we might not know and it is a very good tool for u to improve our knowledge by understanding the idea or concept from book , so most people think that understanding idear or concept are more important than learning fact ; however , i totally disagree with that due to the source of book and knowledge which is outside of the book . obviously , the reason for understanding idea from book is important is that book contains a lot of information which are believable and reliable , but have you think about how doe those book come from ? . usually the all the knowledge is from the outside of the book and book is just a collection for those idea or concept which were found by practice . take the example of the shape of earth , long time ago , people learn that the shape of earth is square from the book and they understood this information without doubt . however , the true is not the same a the concept that earth is square but round . thus , could you say that understanding the concept is more significant than learning fact ? of course not , people usually take many practice in order to indicate the concept and learning from the fact is more memeroable and more trustable . moreover , there are abundant of knowledge which are outside of the concept . to be more precise , our knowledge is changing every miumit every secand , so if you just understand the concept , that is not enough . in addition , if you learning fact , you will not only know the concept which is from the real life but also it will be unforgetable for you . in particular , when i learn table tennis by myself , i always take many practice in order to reach the correct positure or action . after my practice , i realize how can i do it right and how can i change some movement in order to confuse my partner and win the game . briefly , the idea are from the real life and if you just understanding the concept without experience , you will be useless . in conclusion , understanding the idea or concept is very important and very useful for our future , yet if you ignore the value of learning from the fact , you can not be successfull in the future . after all , all the concept are from the real life and they are changing by the experience of fact a time pass .
