i do think that successful people try new thing instead of doing only what they already know , and i agree that learning something new and taking risk is key for beeing a steap ahead the others . new experience allow you to try out yourself , to understand your ability and your lack , and give you the an opportunity of prove how worth a person is . the first person that come in my mind when i think to a successful man is cristoforo colombo , the seaman that ha discovered america . during a historical period when nobody wa believing in this project , reaching india with an other route , he decided to try . facing the common opinion he went to the king for clering his doubt about the project . after a long time during which he had to face the strong reaction to his idea and the opinion of the people , he eventually got the ship and the money for his journey . he ha demontrated how important beeing confident is and how taking risk can actually pay off . the fact that in the end he did not reached india doe no reduce his success , because the main point is that he ha demonstrated to europe how good his idea wa . his courage ha allowed him to become one of the most important man of is century and even more . on 5the other side , people who do not try new thing , are not able to find out who they are . i personally consider what they do like hiding beside what they have already obtained . it is a good way for surviving but it no brings that mach on the long-term .
