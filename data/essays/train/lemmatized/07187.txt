first of all i 'm not totaly disagree with this statement . i think that the number of car in use in the next twenty year will be the same that there are today . i hope that the number of car decrease , but i 'm not sure that it happen . in italy , the country where i live , the situation is very difficult . everyday in the street there are a lot of car , so there are also a lot of pollution and also a lot of incident . today the cost of life is very high , so for many people is difficult to buy a car and they use the public transport like bus , taxi , train or underground ( metro ) . in italy , in my opinion , the public transport is not very development and i think that instead is important to increase this type of service . for example there are a lot of people , that live far away the place where they work , that everyday go to work by car , in spite of there are orher possibility to go like train a i have just said before . but in italy i know because the people prefer to use car instead of train or other public transport , because they are always in late and they are not efficent . i hope that in the next year the thing could be better than now .
