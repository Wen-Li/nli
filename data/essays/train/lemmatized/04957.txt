today , there are many advertisement all around in our life , and the purpose of them are attracting customer to buy product which advertisement are about . but it also cause many problem in this society , such a some customer do not believe that advertisement are telling them truth of product . i personally disagree with the statement , `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . '' the reason i doubt it are listing below . first , a the tochnology get better nowadays , advertisement can be made with many technique , such a made by computer with many fantasy stuff . while customer think that this advertisement is fantasy , it really doesn not mean that it doesn not tell them the truth of the product that the advertisement is about . and the most important thing is that advertisement is just a advertisement , it doe not force customer to buy product . second , the people who think that most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are probably just make misunderstanding before they buy product . and it really should not be company ' fault because they do this is just for selling their product . customers have right not to believe what advertisement say , buy they should not say every advertisement is not real . it would be really unfair to the people who have spent a lot of time working on how to make good advertisement . whether advertisement make product seem much better than they really are or not , it depends on different people and everyone ha different thinking about it .
