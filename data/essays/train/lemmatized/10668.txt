i do agree on this following statement . we all know it can be very hard to succeed in our work , in our plan of life , in our career . it demand a lot of work and an entire contribution . this is the price to pay to become successful . the sensation of having succeeded something is really unique and it make u feel we have accomplished something we have always wanted to happen . life is too short and all of u should have many goal in life . once an goal is reached , we can profite from it a much a we want but why not continue ??? take the example of a baker . he manages to open his first bakery in town after many month or year of working on this very difficult project . finally the bakery is a real success , but he think one is enough work to do . i think he should continue and expand his business by opening one in another town nearby . of course he ha the risk of failing but imagine the fantastic sensation of victory if his second bakery is a much a successful a the first one . wanting to be successful doe n't concern only our work and career plan , it can also be in our family life . successful people are right to try new thing so they wo n't have any regret on what they did . life is too short to live without any risk . but concerning the fact of taking risk to be successful , we have to be very careful on what it implies . some people are too ambitious and it can have very negative effect . there is no need to put our family or ourselves in danger only because we want to achieve something new . we have to think in a very realistic way before doing anything , but what a feeling if we succeed in all our accomplishment !
