when it asked which is better , exclusive reading or inclusive reading , however , people rarely come to absolutely consensus at such a controversial issue . some people attach more improtance on the broad knowledge , but a to me , i can not accept the statement state above . because the argument is too extreme . as far a some subject concerned we need to focus more attention on the specific subject and think it deeper . those more concrete one like , biotechnology , agriculture , medecne and so on . these subject require more related information about it . subject like medicine need not only aboudant knowledge but also adequate experience . the following example that is a persuasive one . imagine that , what will happen if a doctor focus more attention on economy instead of patient and medical book . the concequence is definitely undesirable . not doubt broad knowledge is very significant to some scholar in specific realm . for instance , some subject , such a those abstract one , like history , philosophy , politics , administration , archeology need a wide range of knowledge . these sort of scholar expecially in the field of administration , should have more common sense than the other subject , because when face with difficult situation they can make a fast decision base , all these need more comprehensive learning of some knowledge such a history , economy , politics so on and so forth . according to what have been discussed about , i believe this question is depend on personal inclination .
