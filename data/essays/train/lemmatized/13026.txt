we all know the common advertisement in the medium . no matter if they appear in television , in magazine or in the radio . do hamburger really look so much bigger and so much more delicious in the tv ? in my opinion , they definately do . in the different marketing lesson i took part in , i 've learned that this effect is a widespread marketing tool to sell more product and according to this a bigger profit . the marketing bureau of big company are working hand in hand with designer to make their product looking the best it is able to . let u have a little review about the example with the burger . in the advertisement the burger and french fry look so incredibly delicious that you might have a bite directly from your tv . furthermore they even seem to be very huge . but when you step in an fast food restaurant you will face the truth . the burger taste awful and in addition to that you will , still hungry , leave the restaurant unsatisfied . there are plenty more example than only the look of a product . for instance , most people think that the car of daimler chrysler settle the leadership in safety . by using the only good result out of some safety test , daimlers marketing bureau implement the reliability of their car . but the real leader , when it come to safety , is toyota . so , when the first problem with your air-bags occure , you might recognize the truth . the quality of some clothes give u another example . regarding the very popular clothes company h & m , you know what their type of advertising is ! in their ad they tell you that you get their clothes which so trendy and fashionable for an extremely low price . but you might get to know why this piece of fashion is so cheap when you put it the first time out of your washing machine . the colour have been bleached and they wo n't fit anymore . to sum up , i really have the opinion that the most advertisement make the product seem much better than they really are .
