i agree with the statement that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first of all student give importance to get high grade from the exam . on the exam student are generally questioned from the idea and concept which are thought at the classroom . in order to get high grade they are forced to understand idea and concept very well . the fact of the life are different than the classroom . in the classroom student do n't have the chance of practice . in other word they are faced with only theory . also they have an expectation that they will see the fact after graduating from the school . according to them there are two time period : at the school and after the school . i think we must not escape from the fact during school period .
