in my opinion , being an specialist in specific subject is much more important than having a broad knowledge . that 's because modern society want specialist . at the previous time , such a 19 century , slight and broad information about all range of academic subject would make out efficient solution and perspective view of the problem . but the world ha changed . we can get that kind of knowledge in internet , very easily . it 's not wealth anymore . so , having a normal knowledge about all over the academic subject can not make you a needed person . when you were teenager , school ( or teacher ) teach you all kind of subject such a english , mathmatics , biology , art , etc . but when you get in to university , you have to choose your major and study deeply in that part . why the education programme is changed general thing to specific thing ? university make a leader not a just normal citizen . when you roll a a leader , you need a specialized knowledge about your major . the society go to diversity , they need an specialist on several part to solve complexe probleme . so the importance of specialist is emphrased . if you want to be a needed person , you have to study your own subject , and be specialist . that way will make you wealth people .
