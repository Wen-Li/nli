the happiest period in one 's life is young age . it is a period of learning , enjoyment , base for future life , healthier life . so i feel that young people enjoy more than older people . firstly young age is the period where people learn a lot . they learn about interaction with others . they learn about various subject , & of nature . they even do specialisation in various field which become profession to earn money . this form the base for the future life . because it is the period to earn money for future and for eenjoyment . this is also period to learn other skill for relaxation a well a for entertainment . it is a period of learning skill because they have good memory and intelligence . secondly , it is a period of enjoyment . because people can spend much time with friend , relative , family member . at this age people can also move freely to different placesin search of work , see different place , enjoy holiday . they can even enjoy by reading book , playing with child where a older people can not spend time with family member mostly because of their stay away from them due to study or work . older people loss interest in thing a they grow older so they do not enjoy every thing surrounding them . thirdly , young age is the healthy period in health point of view . as older people face many problem of old age such a dementia - loss of memory , general weakness , and various other problem relating to old age . finally , i conclude that young people enjoy more than older people because of their intelligence , memory , interest , and lastly support of the health .
