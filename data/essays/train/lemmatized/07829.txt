i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take new risk . . '' . i firmly believe that ` success is a journey , not a destination ' . if one spends his entire life doing what he already know show to do well , he is not exploring new avenue and hence , will never know what life ha to offer . a few example to support my view are a follows . the first one is a story of a little boy who , out of curiosity and vision turned around his life . once , dejected and depressed about thing not working with his computer , he put thought into why that might be and tried out a ` new way ' to make thing work . today , the world know the man by bill gates , one of the richest people and creator of microsoft . a lot of great invention come by accident and one need to open one 's mind to trying new thing in order to run into accident . another example is the popular 3m company which manufacture post-it . while trying a `` new way '' to make a glue that stick so well that it never come off , a failure to do so , led to the invention of post it note which are popularly used world-wide today . taking risk expose a person to failure and make him a stronger individual , a trait that ironically is the essence of success . i conclude with a few line from the famous poem if written by rudyard kipling - `` if you can make a heap of all your winning , and risk it on one turn of pitch and toss , and lose , and start at the beginning , and never breathe a word about your loss '' ... then `` yours is the world and everything that 's in it , and which is more , you will be a man , my son '' .
