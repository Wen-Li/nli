that young people enjoy life more than older people is relative of each person . for me a 25 student trying to achieve many thing a a good job or high steem reputation the life some time could be stressfull , but it is important to keep a balance between what i want and what i need . some time the older people have enough benefit to enjoy the rest of their life . of course they worked for all their life , and right now have the money to spend travelling or living in quiet place where they can rest in peace , but what about those with out the benefit ; in contrast there are old people around the word without money or benefit of any kind . they sometimes have to go to the street asking for cent so they can live . in this case it would be impossible to get a good quality of life . on the other hand , the young people have all the chance in front of them . they can live their life a they want , sometime rushing in new thing without thinking the consecuences . others young people are more concern about build a reputation and have good job and that kind of life make them happy . i think that all depends of what the people want for themself . to conlcude , for me is easier to enjoy the life and get the thing that i want working a a young person , thus i can start to work in how i want to spend my life a and eldery person , so i could enjoy it when that time come to .
