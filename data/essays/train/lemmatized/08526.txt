advertisements are everywhere . you can see in the street , watch it on television , heard it on the radio . it is almost impossible to live without it . the purpose of advertisement is to make the future customer buy the company 's product . in order to make the product look good , advertisement can be very tricky . there are some reason what make me think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , the man or the woman who work in an advertisement company ha to have a very well developped imagination . for example , if you have to make an advertisement for water , it is very difficult to figure out what to put on it . moreover , you have to explain why your water is better than the other water on the ` water market ' . so you say that your water is healthier or ha a better taste . people who make this type of commercial lie on the specificity of the water , they make product seem much better than they really are . moreover , they want to make benefit , so they have to make you buy the product . sometimes a comgany creates a product that you do n't even need . they make a new product , it look useless but the commercial is so nice and well done that people want to buy absolutly the product . advertisements lie and the efficient part of the product , they make it usefull but it is not . in conclusion , the world of advertisement is very tricky . it is very easy to fall into the trap of the ` new product ' . advertisers are very good to make you want the product even if you do n't need it . i think that most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are because advertisement company wo n't show up the bad side of their product . so they make their product look perfect and they fool the customer .
