i would strongly agree that successful people do try new thing and also take risk rather than sticking to what they already know and continuing work on it . a good example to support my opinion is nasa . the scientist and engineers over there dare to take risk and they also know how to achieve their goal . insipte of the columbia space shuttle crash they were not dissappointed and did not stop their work . they are well aware that they are risking their life but still continuing their work and are succeeding in their work that they were involved in . i think their motto would be dare to dream and make it happen . i think life is about trying and experiencing new thing and taking risk , otherwise we would not be in so advanced state . as an another example i would like to describe the effect of nuclear science . i would like to appreciate the work done by technologist and other gy for handling the nuclear reactor and station a they are not only used for making nuclear bomb but are also used for power generation and india is perfect example . as an another example i would like to appreciate the work done by our defense force such a army , navy , airforce and also police force . they are adopting to new technology and trying out so many new thing making diffrent strategy in order to help the nation from terrorist and other extremist . we should not forget that they are risking their life in order to do all such thing . in conclusion i would like to say that try and try until you succeed . in order for the nation and the whole world to develop people should try out new thing . and if there is no risk there is no gain .
