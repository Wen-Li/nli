i agree with this statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . of course there are many reasont to agree with this statement , for example , studying many subject will help u in our future life that we got alot of knowledge and experience of studying these subject , also it will help u to study any major u want in university because u had already studied most of the subject , and for the far future for getting a job it will help alot that u study these all subject . i think also it help in ur family life that you can help your kid in studying at school by teaching them and explaining many thing that you had already know about it . in conclousin , studying many subject help alot in yuor future life , so i advice any person to go thru many subject and read alot it help in many way .
