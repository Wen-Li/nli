some people say being a specialist in a specific field is most important thing in the ever-changing society . however , i strongly believe that having broad academic knowlege is much important than being a specialist . first of all , learning wide knowledge of various subject is helpful to be well-rounded people and have a good relationship with others . when people learn the only one subject , they are well fitted in the field , but might not be a general people who mingle with any others . for example , tae-hun kim , who is my university friend , is on psychology major . he did not know about any other subject . some day when i ask other friend to join a party in kim 's house , they answered reluctantly . i knew why they did . that wa because kim always talk only about psychologic issue . on top of that , it is beneficial not only to social relationship , but also to get good job in these day . many company want to recruit versatil people who can be adjusted any department . some department need speicialists , but most of department teach new people to work together . when people even want to make their own company , it will be more a helpful to be a this kind of versatil man . for instance , despite my brother 's major is computer science , he tried to learn management and economics when he want to build his own computer software company . he already had good computer skill but he also needed management skill to manage his company , and economics ' insight to read the current market flow . now he is a one of the most famous ceo of a young venture company . in brief , learning diverse knowledge have a positive effect on people 's relationship and getting a good job . people should learn diverse kind of academic subject to be more well rounded people and have various knowledge to jet
