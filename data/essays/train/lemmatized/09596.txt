how do you like to travel by yourself with a tour book or with a tour guide 's leading ? many variable can exist that which way to travel is the most influential . regardless of the possibility , i strongly support that traveling in a group leading by a tour guide is the best way to travel because of the substantial amount of information one would get . being in a group positively make a person to know more people . from my experience , a group tour opened my eye more toward the world . i had two trip to new york city : the first one by myself with a tour book and the second within a group led by a tour guide . going to the new york city by myself with my own knowledge put me in such a hardtime . i guessed that with a tour guide hand book , i would be able to handle the situation well . however , the prediction wa completely wrong . i wa lost and for finished the tour in a week instead of the original plan , three day , because of my lack of ability . however , the second trip to n.y.c with a tour guide in a group wa only two day and the trip wa very enjoyable . i learned a lot of new fact about the city from the peer . traveling in a group led by a tour guide would certainly cost more . in this case , one ha to weigh the price that he would get from a tour guide more . by traveling with a group he can meet new people and interpret the place in more different way . i went to italy last year with in a group with a tour guide . the trip wa more expensive than i would just go with my friend . my friend and i were in the same group and within the group we met a lot of people . by meeting these new people , we could apply different knowledge and understand the rome with diversity of information . although traveling by oneself might be a good experience , traveling in a group is better because of the amount of the information one would get is umlimited .
