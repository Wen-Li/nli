i agree with this statement without any doubt . it is sure that without any advertisement a product would not probably be known , considered and , a a result , sold . but it is always necessary to consider the limit between use and abuse and to be really careful with the public you are talking to . or better , i think that people working to make a product wonderful , or simply desiderable , know very well how weak we can be , depending on our age and on our emotional state . and the problem is that they profite of this . here are some example . if you are a child why not to have the best video-game , may be the last one presented on tv by the world champion video-game player ? and if you are a teenager , a girl looking for his prince , why not to buy the body parfum showed by a beautiful heart breakear ? then , if you are fatty , why not to buy the lower calorie food of the most famous mark , even if it is twice more expensive than a normal one ? and when you are getting older . .. woul not you buy the long life skin lotion ? it is quite sad , on my opinion , that we could be so unconsciously controlled by our material need . now my question is : could my life be so different if , instead of buying those product , i will have some equal but le expensive one , which do n't include the high price of advertisement ? i can be sure of not . but the paradox is that me too i constantly fall down in these trap : someteimes , a pair of shoe for example , it is not so important , but i totally did wrong when i booked a holiday with a famous travel agency telling about the amazing life in tunisia , in fact i did n't enjoy at all that holiday , and it cost me more than the same travel with an other agency , probably more sincere and le promising . so to be careful of what is presented to u is a good start . then to look for essen
