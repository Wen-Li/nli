it is always up to the personality whether one like to keep the track of others or do something new , something which 's not tried before . so according to this idea of mine , i believe that success is a reflection of personality . in my opinion success come from production and innovation . if you do n't try something new and do the same thing those have been done for year , you dont produce much . we can clearly see that from the current situation of the economy of the country in the world . the biggest economy which produce the largest amount of national income are the one which always produce and sell new technologic innovation . they are the one who are successfull in the world economy . because , taking risk is the most valuable input of the economic activity . trying new thing always includes much more risk than the doing what they already know how to do well . as taking risk ha a price , risk averse people or society can not be successfull . if we go on from our example , far east country which only produce already-invented-goods , can only have a little profit since they dont take the risk of trying new thing . the same thing is valid in the extend of person . in my view , doing the thing what someone already know how to do well , is a thing which can be achieved by an ordinary man but not by a successfull man . because trying new thing need courage and effort to succeed . and this effort and courage must be at a level which can not be obtained by everyone since everyone can not be successfull . it is to be sucessfull to create this difference .
