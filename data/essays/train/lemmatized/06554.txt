`` technology ha always been a boon to the society '' , due to advancement in technology there are smaller and efficient way to finish a particular task . the population growth of the car ha also been a major part of concern . we are striving hard enough to meet the requiremnts of today world . so , i feel that twenty year down the line we may have very fewer car on the road . in twenty year from now technology will be so advanced that person can work efficiently sitting at home or being online , so there is not much to travel and work at the same time . nowadays people are looking for luxury and work together . they do not want themselves to stress a lot but , at the same time work harder and efficiently . think of people during ancient time , they were happy and contented with the work and effort they used to put in at that time , but now the scenario is different people are looking towards the world with a broder perspective , they want to gain more and put le . they do not want to sit ideal but also do not want to stress themselves . with the growth in population , competition is increasing rapidly and people are looking focused towards their work . they prefer to work more and gain more but , with ease . people will be getting stuff ready at their doorstep and thus there doe not arise a need to travel through car and waste time a time is precious . cars are polluting the city heavily nowadays and so i feel that the government will provide other mean of transport twenty year from now and ban car . may be this step will help u to get a healthy and pure environment . thus , one can mearly suggest that the rate of car twenty year from now will surely decrease . some other mean of transport may arise which will help to secure and improve the environment . there will also be a lot of advancement in technology which will help u to achieve this .
