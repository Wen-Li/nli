i think it to be true . however i think it to be not bad . prior to community , young people do not help even house work . i think they do a part time job than before . my mother always say to me `` modern young people do not help housework than in my childhood . you have to do help me . i take it for granted . ' i do part time job too . because i want to save money and go study abroad . in my opinion , young people can decide many thing by ourselves . because there are many thing that we can choose . if we regard heiping our community a a benefit to u , we would help . but we have much time to help pour community . i live in mantion . there live many people . they do not ask help . so what shall i do ? what i have to do occure to me
