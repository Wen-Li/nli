people could be successful without trying new thing but just by following custom only for a short term , but can not keep being successfull for a long term without trying new thing . that is because society and trend always change . i 'd like to bring an example of beeper and mobile phone in japanese market . the beeper ha recently vanished after 40 year of history from it japanese market . it used to be one of the most popular mobile good untill mobile phone wa commonly used . i remember when wa in school , all of my friend had one and it wa the main tool to communicate with each other . if you had a bisiness to deal with beeper - could be a manufacture , supplier of material to manufacture or agency to make deal with consumer - your business back then must have been successful and prosperous . however , mobile phone became more and more popular since over 10 year ago and it ha now overtaken the beeper . nowadays almost everyone ha one or even more than two , like one for private use and the other for business , and it 's hard for many people to imagine a life without them . as being involved in the beeper business if you decided not to go into mobile phone business but stick to the beeper because you did not feel comfortable with trying new thing and did not like to take risk , your business dealing with beeper must have gradually diminished and it wa no longer successful . in any category , a i meantioned above , trend constantly change and you ca n't stick to the same thing forever . to be successful , it is necessary to adopt new thing to go with the latest trend and it always require some risk but it 's , i think , unfortunately unavoidable in order to get success .
