personally i disagree that young people nowadays do not give enought time ti helping their community . i have mainly three reason . my reason are point of support , economics , and security . one mainly reason is support of community . in general , all people belong to their community . community support the people with tangible and intangible . for example , tangible support is fire resuque . if happened to fire , the people of neiborhood in community support you . second example is intangible support . if disappeared activity in the community , it is not vivid . communities support you with spirit . second mainly reason is economics . communities depend on the economics of their community . for example , if fully to take money with community out resouces , the economics of the comunities is not surplus . where is necesary of money ? it is taxation . the economics of the comunities without taxation is effectively and efficentally . the commitment of young people is good effect of the economics of their community . final my reason is security . the netwok in the community is good point of security . security is not free . in general , common service is free rider problem of macro economics . if young people commit their community , the cost is lower . therefore , i do not support that young people recently do not give enough time to helping their community . i think that young people have to help their community for own profit .
