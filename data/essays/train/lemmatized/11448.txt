i disagree to the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this statement contrast with the quote `` jack of all trade master of none '' . not only academic this state is false for every kind of work . i would tell my certian personal example . in my college i play football , cricket , weightlifting , powerlifting . despite of playing so many game i have not been selected till today in my any of the college team . when i am dropped out by the selection committee then i feel that it would have been better if i would have devoted my entire time on a single game and do mastery in that instead of playing many game . when we talk about the world famous author they mostly have specialisation in a single subject . for example william shakespeare wa famous for english literature , issac newton wa famous in science , etc . there are endless example about different personality who have achieved success by doing specialization in one specific subject . so i would conclude this paragraph by stating that for getting renowned in your school , state , country or world you should have specialization in a specific subject unless you put in your best effort in that . most of the people face unemployment because they try to put their hand and leg in many work which reduces their chance of success in that . it is just a a person standing on two boat and trying to navigate the river . so i would end with a famous quote that `` single bird in a hand is better than many bird in a bush ''
