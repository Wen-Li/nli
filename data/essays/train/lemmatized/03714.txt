some tipes of advertisement use to make different product , and a lot of them are , better it 's say that they seem , much better than they really are . is it true or wrong ? it is good or bad ? do i agree or disagree with the statement written at the top ? i really do n't know . i ca n't find a personal and not common opinion about this theme , for that reason i will say sorry before for the not really interesting text that i 'm going to write , or better that i 'm going to try write . first all the advertisement can be devide in two group . the first one comprend all the advertisement who use to give product a soon a possible , the second one , at the contrary , used to give product in a log way . in the same line i 'd like to devide all the product in two order , the really `` good '' and the `` appeared good '' . after this tipe of division is possible to combinate in different way all group . so we can find advertisemtent who give to you a product really soon and whit a lot of good thing correlated at it , or at really opposite concept , an advertisement who give in a really long period something not really good for your person . i 'm going to the conclusion of this issue , and i want to declarate that this is a really difficult topic where i have trought to give my opinion or something who try to be the same shape . if i have to take one decision about what tipe of advertisement i will choose , i hope to find a product whio can give to me a seem better than it look like . whit that i hope to be finisched all my argouments ad idea about this really diffucult and embarasing issue .
