i agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . companies want make money form those product so they try to show better than they really are . companies use techonology to create a good advertisement for their product . they use color , image , ext . which attract people to buy those product . advertisement is a important isue to sell product . good advertisement have advantage for product which is advertise . in the advertisement , they try to show product much better than they really are . they use visiual thing or they use sound to make the advertisement more colorful . most of the time , those thing attract people to buy those product which ha a increadible advertisement . for example , my father bought a sprey for his car . in this sprey 's advertisement , they show a red bmw car which ha some spot on it is cleaned with this sprey perfectly and also in the advertisement they show some reference for that sprey . my father 's car ha some same spot too and my father belive that advertisement and these reference and he decided to buy that product shown in that advertisement . this sprey did not work on my father 's car . it caused to change color where he used it on the car . when he searchen why it did not work he figured out that sprey not used for all spot occured on the car , but in the advertisement , they do not warn you that what kind of spot is ok for this sprey . advertisements use to introduce the product to the public . they try to show the product much better than they are . because of that kind of advertisement people get wrong idea about product most of the time . by advertisement , company want make more money so they can use all techonogical way to attract people to buy their product , but this kind of advertisement do not make their product better but they make money for sure .
