i completely agree with the statement . we are in the consumis time , that mean that people buy thing and industrial product not when they really need them , but only for the pleasure to buy something new and have the pleasant sensation to spend the money in those modern supermarket , which you can find everything new in . in this way a person always feel to be original and `` modern '' , not `` ancient '' like people that surroand him or her . with this new conception of the money and about the way to spend them , the productors of object that are every day used ( such the mobile phone , the tv , the shoe and so on ) invent always new way to make those product attractive . in this way people feel obliged to buy the last thecnological mobile phone for example , otherwise the seem to be out , but not for the really need to have it . and what is the best way to let their new product be known all over the world ? the answer for this question is simple and everyone know the answer . simply the answer is : advertisement . we can watch the tv or only look at every journal to verify this sad truth . if the advertisement is the quicker and most seen way to spread news about an industrial product , in order to let people know my last innovation , why do n't use this simple way of diffusion according to the imprenditor 's volonty ? and in order to sell more piece of a product , so that this imprenditor can get much more money , what about making an advertisement annunce putting lie in ? it 's not a true lie , but only a manner to pubbicize the product in a wrong way : not like an object that you can buy only if you really need it , but like an object that you ca n't live without it . for this reason advertisement make product better they really are .
