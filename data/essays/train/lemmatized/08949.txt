many different approach are used in the education system of an educational community . mainly ; two type of approach emerges in a school curriculum ; one is practical application of issue which profoundly depends on the understanding of the idea and concept ; the other one is undoubtedly the theoretical approach which focus on the merely comprehending of the fact and detail . as far a i am concerned and a being a student for a considerable amount of my life-time ; i am a proponent of the practical approach and think that school must pay attention to teach idea and concept and should provide each student a broad vision to comprehend them throughly . there are a number of important reason i can settle down about the beneficial point of the practical approach ; meaning ; procuring student with the idea and concept . the main advantage that may come along with such an attitude in an education system is the fact that student can learn how various people applied-otherwise saying practiced - the fact . they are not only feeded with raw material ; but ; also application of the fact ; their processed form is also given to them . during a school life ; a student may not value the importance of the fact learned . and ; this wa what exactly happenned to me and my classmate in the philosophy class in the lycee . i have always considered that class a a base one to understand the very basic of science a it teach to think in both quantitative manner and also abstract way . but ; i have graduated from lycee being devoid of having the ability in pholosophic thinking . because ; our teacher would talk about the fact all the time . for example ; when she talked about the evolution of the world and the fact related to it ; she never touched to the various idea proposed by celebrated philosopher such a sokrates and platon . as a virtue of our teacher `` s educational approach ; we learned to memorize the fact ; furthermore denied acceptance on thinking on further idea or concept . to sum up and to cut the story short ; it is much more important and further beneficial to make student learn the idea and concept which are the application of various fact solely or in combination with other fact . it is true that we can not deny the importance of fact a they highly depend on the fact . evaluation and validation of an idea related to a fact may further make it possible for a student to develop his or her own idea .
