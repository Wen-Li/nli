it is a well-known idea that young people should enjoy their life more than older people do because they still have ` energy ' and ` time ' to spend , but if we really think about that statement we can tell that it 's not that true . well first of all it depends on what we mean by ` young people ' . if young people mean child , the statement will be kind of true , what i 'd like to say is that when your a child you will defenitely enjoy the life more than older people do because you 're still sort of unconscious yet and without any kind of worry besides ' what am i getting for christmas ? ' and so on . .. but if young people mean teenager , student or young active it 'd be another problem . as for me , i think that being a teenager a student or a young active is one of the most stressful time of our life not that it 's not enjoyable at all but it 's a period where time fly and it 's a period that will define the rest of your life in other word everything and by everything i 'd like to emphasize the word ` future ' . what will i become in this world ? what will i do ? well i guess those question are getting unsignificant when your getting older . i think older people among all should know how to enjoy life the best they can and time . as we 're getting older , we 're getting wiser ( well i do hope so ) and we wo n't have to worry about meaningless thing such a what kind of clothes am i going to wear to school today . altought older people can not a much thing a they used to do when they were young but they would definetely take time to enjoy them .
