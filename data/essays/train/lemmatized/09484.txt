i agree with this statement because idea are the primary form of the fact . the fact were idea before they becaome fact . therefore , it is important to underdatnd the idea first then develope them and make them work a fact . in addition , idea are felixable and can be more useful than the fact bacause simply we can discus the idea and develope them but we can not discus all the fact especially those which became `` dogma '' . so understanding the idea is the door of the discussion skill that the student need . student can use the idea and get what is beyond it and get deeply into it to get other idea out from the orginal idea so they will be able to undersatnd it and use it effectly . this method also help the student to keep all what they need in mind and not forget it . focusing in idea are most important because every thing start with an idea . also we can be involve in the idea and we can add our own idea so we are sharing the thought . all in all , the idea is the passage for every thing . it lead u to the truth , the fact . idea are what we live for and at the end , life is an idea .
