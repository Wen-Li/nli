i agree with the statement : usually advestisements make product seem much better than they really are . i also think that in many case this beviour is an illegal way to send a product to normal people . in fact , many time advertisement involve situation that are bild to hit particular group of people , like child or old person . children are one of the favourite target for advertisement , because they want to be socially accepted by other child and usually this mean that they want clothes , game and other thing similar to those that the others have . parents know that many of those thing do n't correspond to real desire of their son , but they ca n't say ` no ' in front of many request , because it is very important to be accepted by the other child . for this reason , many advertisement are prepared for child and they usually show product that are n't good a it seems in television , or on a newspaper . an example are toy : in italy , many year ago , a very important company started selling electronic game , by mail . in television they showed a particular product , that wa nice and interesting , and many family bougth it . the problem started when family recived it by mail : the game wa n't the one they had seen on television , it wa shorter and very difficult to be played . also old peolple are good target for fake advertisement , because they are weak and unable to realize what they are going to buy . an example : my grandmother bougth a radio , that she had seen on a newspaper , and when she recived it , by mail , she realized that it did n't work .
