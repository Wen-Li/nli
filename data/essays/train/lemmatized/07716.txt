yes , i agree with the statement that only people who take risk will be successful . it is important to know what i can and can not do . the most important thing is to be good at what i do and to concentrate on one specivic opject or part . in the modern time there are so many people that for example work a designer that it is not possible to work just a such . everybody need no have a certain speciality like interior designer or a a designer for car . success only come with individuality . there are so many designer there is no way of beeing successful when you just do what everyone doe . like because everyone this season think red and length sripes are trendy that should not make you only design red and length sriped chair , skirt or what ever the provetion is . it should make the person make green skirt with pink point on it . that is shourly risky because maybe no one will buy them but maybe because of everybodys having red , some individual like having green . as soon a a person loos the thrill of beeing better he ha stopped to be good . success come and go and only thou how keep on working on their own knowlege can keep on beeing successful . bringing new idea and finding spot on the market that have not yet been discovered is the most surten way to make something big . therefor only beeing good at what you do , doe not make someone autmaticly successful . but taking the risk of going one step further then everyone else can will make the differnec .
