when you have a mastercard in the dessert will it be usefull for you while you want water to survive ? this is the way who idea and concept work . in real live you will act naturally a you are and a you know without refeering to the math or the physic . you will drink water without thinking that it is compind of hydrogen and oxygen . so , learnning the fact is more imprtant than understanding the concept because in real life you will use the fact easier , and you can do it naturally without wasting time in thinking while there is no time . first of all , in our life when we face something we cope with it easier with fact which includes an expieriance from father or brother or even from tv . however , when you want to do something you will not bring your calculator and your pincel and think about it . for example , when you sit with your grandmother you know it just want someone to sit with her and hear she talking about boring thing , but a you do n't show that you are not bored a your grandmother will love you more . second , we act a a human , and this doe n't mean that we don 'd use our hids . when you had a puncture you will rise your foot and try to control the car . you did n't know that from safety program , but you learn it by using human sense , and this is the most important thing that we have , so we should use it . finally , our background about something and our natural behaviore are very usefull thing . on the other hand , we should not think that the concept are n't important , but they are not important a the fact are , and a i have said you will not bring your notebook and your calculator to solve everything , and sometime you do n't have the time to think a while you have a puncture .
