the answer to this question must take into consideration different complex matter . first of all one need to clarify the concept of `` their community '' . i would suggest that nowadays young people rightly consider a group of peer to be `` their community '' . they consider themselves part of a group of people with similar aspiration , cultural interest , way of acting and manner of speech . the same sort of close community connection is of course part of the way of living in a modern society : people generally do not relate so much to the entire society or nation but have their preferred community chosen from a pluralisitic set of option . once they have joined their community of choice they tend to spend a lot of time advancing the interest of their community and fostering solidarity and friendship among the member of that particular community . from this point of view young people act in very similar way : they feel attached to a group of friend or to a speficic life style . once they are attached they equally spend a lot of time supporting and helping that particular community they are member of . in that sense i would be inclined to disagree with the statement . the problem is thus not so much that young people do not give enough time to helping their community but rather that one might disagree on what should count a their community in the first place . it is often the case that adult do not like to see young people relate to their peer and would like to be an active part of a larger community that includes the adult . while this desire might be understandable from the point of view of the adult - even if only for the simple fact that this would probably give adult more power to control young people - i do not believe it to be in the best interest of young people . the best way for them to learn the meaning of community solidarity is by experiencing solidarity in a group they truly and almost naturally feel attached to . helping the community is not something a young person should be forced to do but something he or she should come to see a providing mutual advantage . eventually most people will realiye that the solidarity the y enjoy in their specific community can only have true value and meaning if the community of peer is part of a larger cmmunity called society which eventually will need some support from the member a well .
