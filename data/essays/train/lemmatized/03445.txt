successful people try news thnhgs . it is not the bad idea . i think people should learn new thing every day . it is fun to learn new thnigs . and when you learning new thing you can know what is thing you good at and do better than another people . but if you already know how to well on one thing . another people are know well to do anothert thing . that you do n't need to woried about when you try to do another thing you will make mistake . because you can just toled the people is good at do for you and you can do the thing you good at for him . for example today there is a complian . there are three people are going to make chair . there is a who can cut the tree faster than everyone . b is who can use one tree two make two chair . and c is who sell cahirs faster than everyone . so if today you are a boo what are you going to do ? to make each one to leant how to cut the tres like a , make chair like b or sell chair like c. but that will be westing to much time and money . and it problem will not make the good chair . so i think if there is one person he is good at something already and you shoul keep him to do the same thing . and another peopl do what is they good at . if you do n't know waht is you good at you can try new thing untial you find out waht is you good at . so successful people try new thingd and rather than only doing waht they already know how to do well . this will be work . this waht happen in the world now and to becane more propucally .
