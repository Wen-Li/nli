i think what make a lot of people successful is thier tendcy to try new thing and way , and being ready to take the risk the come on thier way a a result of thier creativty . let take the history and developmet of science a an example , we can easily notice that great scientsts in the history of science share the quality of being skceptic about the domminat way of thinking in thier era . and a a result they interduced creative approach which radicly differ from the common and the established . and we can take einstine , s theory of relativity a a case study , einstien a phycists refused to confirm with the domminat newtenian mechanical physiscs that wa the main stream in physic , and instead he forced his way through a radical way of thinking that emphesized the idea of the relative in contrast with the idea of the constant . let u imagine the lost that humanity could have suffered if einstien did not choose to think differently , and let u imagine all the great door of knowledge that were opened a a result of this novelty of thinking . waht we learn from einstien is thinking differernt is the core of our essence a humman being a free creature that refuse to accept the norm that others are more cabaple than we are
