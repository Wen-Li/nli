most of the people love travelling in order to discover new place , to rivisit place that they already know and maybe experience them in a new , different way , or just in order to relax by the beach . some people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide , some other people prefer to just buy a book , read something about the place they 're headed to and go by themselves . personally , i prefer to travel by myself , or with a few friend but absolutly without a tour guide . sure an organized trip is really nice but personally i do n't like the idea of jumping on a bus with people i do n't know and with a tour guide telling me all the time what to do , where to go and why . i 'd rather drive with a few friend , a map and the idea to discover the true reality of the place we are going to visit . i like this way of travelling because i think i 'd feel more free to organize my trip a i really want to . the fact that i 'm not interested in being on a bus with people i do n't know might seem a little bit close minded and i would n't want it to be misleading . it 's not that i do n't like meeting new people but if i go to a new place i 'd like to get in touch with local people in order for me to understand their culture , tradition , habit . waht i 'm looking for while travelling is a full immersion in a new , different reality from which i want to learn . i do n't like much the idea of a tour guide because i think he or she will show me the most famous tourist destination without really entering the culture itself . all and all i can say that travelling is great either way . i like to travel the way i described because i believe it really help u open up our horizon to different realty . italian food is great - i 'm italian so . . ! - but if i went to marocco , i 'd rather try cous cous than go the italian restaurant and italian resort where there is nothing about the local culture .
