i completly disagree with this statment . i truly belive life can be enjoyed by a person of any age . first of all i belive that just like their are allways different view of life their are also different way of enjoying life . for example for a kid , a life full of joy may be deffined bye the abillity to run and play . for a teenager joy may be in the art of being in love or taking risk and learning . then again an elder may expirience the same ammount of joy than a young person just bye laying down on a hamac on a sunny afternoon to remember beutifull time , or to read his favorite novel . for example if i wa an elder i would love to recall my past expiriences whith woman and tell them to my grandson . and the story of grandma and i to my grandoughter . and then again a i am young their is the beuty of learning and expiriencing what i will later tell my grandchild . their is a time for everything and in these time you may enjoy life in manny different way .
