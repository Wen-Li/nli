recently , i recieved an anonymous , yet very impressive , e-mail power point presentation that made me reflect and musitate on various philosophy of life . on of these specifically captured my attention : `` to achieve something you have n't met with before , you must do something , well , that you have n't done before . '' certainly , successful people do capture fame because they have ventured out into a sea of opportunity rather than stay safely in a boat . literature ha supported the idea that success arrives after an original challenge ha been overcome . in the epic of gilgamesh , the hero directs himself to try to gain immortality by traveling to the end of the world . though he misplaces the final flower of youth , gilgamesh acknowledges a sudden sense of completion in his being and a spark of energy to change his kingdom . gilgamesh 's goal of gaining immortality doe complete itself , a is stated at the end of the epic poem , when his name is recorded in history and remembered throughout subsequent generation . however , the greatest example of succes involving risk come to u in history . several name pop into my head : ghandi , mother teresa , martin luther king , jr. , betty williams , nelson mandella . .. all of these people participated and led heroic act against the standard and convention of society , against the expectancy of the crowd , and gave u , the present day generation , life , liberty , and justice . if this fails to ring up the word `` success '' in my ear , i do not know what will . finally , personal experience have rendered this belief of the correlation between risk and succes true . two year ago , i decided to try out for my school 's soccer team . i played midfield , but i settled for goalie just because the team needed one . this position actually scared me , but , nevertheless , i kept practicing to develop my latent abilties . incredibly , i became an all-star goalie . even today , i have been invited to compete in the junior olympics a a keeper . all in all , success usually involves some type of risk . progress , innovation , and fame all resulted from wild attempt to change . in this case , `` change '' is the key word . a transformation from safe to highly challenging equal a tranformation from loser to victorious .
