yes i do agree with this statement . in my point of view when a person invents something new which is not available in the market . he try to include everything that he could do . this is a good thing . but when the time come for advertising this product . the person try to advertise it in such a way that he could get profit a fast a he can . lets talk about a shop who deal in mobile phone . when a person open a new mobile phone shop he try to give the customer promotion that the other shop do not give . like to give a mobile phone headset , a car charger , a mobile phone carry case , some application , game that he can be downloaded from the computer into the mobile phone . when a customer look at this kind of an advertisment he get really excited . he go to that shop and asks for that item that he saw it in the advertisment . then the shop keeper show him , he doe not like the item . why ? because most of the shop advertise the promotional item a original one . but they find them that they are not original . this make a lot of problem when a shop keeper is selling a product of someone else . i would like to share an example that i experienced before a year or two . there is a trademark who is really popular among the lady . it sell readymade clothes for woman . and his logo is also very popular . a shop owner copied this logo on a material that doe not cost the half price of the material the orignal shop is selling and he advertised it in variuos magizenes and newspaper . people started buying from him not also keeping in mind that it 's the same kind of material . so this kind of advertisment can loose alot of money on just silly thing . in my opinion people should not do these kind of thing at all .
