i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are three reason why i choose the idea . first of all , broad knowledge is useful when we have to decide something . it give u a object point of view , i think . for example , when i wa a high school student , i did n't have such broad knowledge that i could not choose to take the course of physic which i really wanted to study and i finally regret my choice before . in fact , i did n't know well what physic is . if i have knowledge about the physic , i difinitely choose the course of physic . threfore , broad knowledge is useful to have a objective point of view . second , broad knowledge help u to work more fluently . when we work for the company , we face various problem which are difficult to solve . in that case , most of people do n't solve the problem by himself or herself and have a meeting to find a clue to overcome it . it mean that various knowlede which belongs to a lot of people is effective to solve the problem . therefore people who have broad knowledge is competent to solve the problem . finally , broad knowlede make out life more fun . when we talk with the other person , a person with broad knowledge can give a lot of subject to talk and it give people enjoyable time to talk . for instance , i have a friend who have broad knowledge . when i go out for a drink with him in a group , he supply various topic and most of people concentrate on his talk . thus broad knowledge is efficient to spend enjoyable time with others . for these reason , i agree with the idea that people should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
