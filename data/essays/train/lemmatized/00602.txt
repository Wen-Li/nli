the question before hand is that whether young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communites . i am in complete disagreement with the aforementioned statement . i belive that young generation actively participate in the functioning of the community . the youth now are more interested in community work then ever before . the following reason will further buttressed my belief in the acitve involvement of the youth in community work . firstly , nowdays young people are involved in many community work by associating themselves with various political party which are dedecated towards community related work . these political parties/organisations require the youth to effectively raise there voice and the youth inturns get involved in it so a to make a mark for themselves . for example , there is a political party called shiv sena in india which is mostly comprises of young student . secondly , non-governmental organisation which are cheifly controlled by young student are established to allow the young people to raise there voice on community related issue . for example , an organisation called the youth parliament is controlled by some college going student who want to educate the school going childrens by discussing all community related issue . it open a discussion forum over all issue centering our community . thirdly , many student specifically take time out of there busy schedule to be a part of an old age home or any protective home for the special childrens . a survey conducted by a popular magzine , ` india today ' show a inclination of the student towards community work . the survey rated the community work conducted by the young people more effective then conducted by the people of more mature age . finally , young people are also associated in raising there voice on community related issue by filling public interest litigation in the court . recent study show that the slap suit filed in the court regarding community work are carried out by the youth . to conclude i would like to quote jacob arnold a renowned author who once stated that , `` the pillar stone of any community is not the work carried out in it , but it is the participation of the youth in carriying out the community work count '' .
