in following text i 'm going to express my thought about the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know . there is a distinction of successful people that i want to make before answering the question . there are two kind of them . first is the successful guy , who just happened to be in the right spot or have the right friend to come into a position where he is successfull . those people mostz do n't try new thing at all or use new knowledge . they 'll be interested in keeping the current status quo . the second kind are the self-made successful people . they do have to take risk and think new thought in order to be successful . for example if you open a shop , you 'll have to get a loan from a bank , which is risky because you might ca n't pay it back . if you are not able to pay your rate you risk not only the new shop you 've opened , but your whole existance . therefore you have to make sure that your bussines is going to work . the best way to be successful is to differ from others . you 'll have to think about new product to sell , new way to advertise them . maybe new location and way to build them . without innovation it wo n't take long until there is someone better coming into the field , to take your custumers away . that 's why , a a self-made man , you always have to be on top of new development . whether in technical or in marketing issue . that doe n't mean that in order to be successful you 'll have to start something totally new . it 's perfectly possible to start with something that you already know and are good at . but it 's a must to always develop new skill and knowledge . custumers always want the best service they can get so you have to improve your service . once you 're successfull , ther is no guaranty that it always stay like that . successful people will always make effort to improve further . it 's neccesary for them to take risk and think new thought .
