now a day the technology ha been improved to enjoy both yong and old equally . a the culture is getting changed , if the old people go with the change they mey also enjoy a youth . enjoyment come from take the growth a benefit then taking it a useless the young people are enjoying more , a all the helpful in present day busy life . for example eating at fastfood center then by cooking at home this make them to use the time . the advanced improvement in computer decreses the work stress on them , a the salary are more they are spending more money to get enjoy like buying sport car and leading a luxurious life . the people who are old now where young at sometime before they enjoyed at their time . the people who are old enough are not satisfied with the the change in culture , they give more importance to the moral value , health , andtheir own view . if they doe n't change their idea they may not enjoy . for example consider the new year itself , the young people enjoy themselves in the party and want to celebrate the whole day with many people in club , the old people may not go the club and get involved in the party . they sit idle at home . the movie now a day more concentrate on the youth and making them more enjoying , while the ca n't see those movie which involve romance , action e.t.c . i agree with the above statement that young are enjoying more than older . they are seeing for a temporary joy , a increasing lifestyle .
