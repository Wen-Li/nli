people can learn through different method . some have an easiness for remembering chart , picture or other graphic while others learn faster by literal mean . the quality of the retention of those fact varies according to the way they retain them . when a student understands the idea of what he is doing , he can implement observation of his own . when one understands something , it is much more probable to imply or discover the rest of the detail . he may even add new idea . once you get the big picture of one concept and understand it , your mind can analyze it , judge it and compare it to former experience . understanding a concept make it last much longer in the memory . we have a limited memorization time and space . for example , if you memorize your credit card number , you will remember it for a period of time . once you stop using that number , the most probable thing is that you will forget it in a few month . our memory work best when we put to practice concept and understand their function and structure . on the other hand , simply learning fact lead to being able to hold back more detail . you may know everything there is to know about a certain theme , but if you can not understand it , you can not change it or handle it . think of it this way . pretend you make a new friend . you may have read about this person before . you may know everything about him , from his blood type , to his hobby , to his taste , even his habit . if you do not understand the person , you can not deal with him , or even maintain a lasting friendship . to truly know that person you must not only know about him , but also know him . to conclude , my opinion is that it is more important if you can understand rather than just retain fact . when you understand , you have the ability to change it , experiment it and even handle it . if the knowledge of a student is going to last him for a lifetime , the best way of remembering fact is to understand them .
