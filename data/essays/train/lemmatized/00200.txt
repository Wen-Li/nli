firsteval , it is important to remind that , usualy , successfull people are people with habilities and knowledge in specific field . usualy , the success doe n't come alone . you succeeded because you have dared thing , which mean generally that you took risk . successful people usualy get money from their success , and we could think this is crazy to take other risk because you may loose the money you won . to my mind successful people are people who like risk , and who are better under pressure . as an example i will talk about my girlfriend 's granfather . he is a decorator and he lost all his money and everything he made up several year ago . but while some people would n't know what to do , he restarted everything from the beginning , to find success again and that 's what he did . i think most of successful people are very self confident people , and that 's why they 're stronger than the others , because if they fall , they can also rebuild what ha been destroyed . otherwise , trying new thing and taking risk while you succeeded may appear a really crazy . would n't it be better to take advantage of what you won , instead of risking to lose it ? i think the best to do , when you are a successful people , is to try new thing but taking the le risk a possible ; indeed , even if you are successful one time , may be next time you wo n't and you will loose everything . but in the opposite , if you do n't take risk in your life , you may never successful or at least , you may spend a very boring life . that 's why a certain dose of risk ha to be taken , even if you are successful . trying new thing open up your mind , whereas going on to do only what you know how to do well doe n't .
