i agree this opinion that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are three reason why i think so . first , young people spend much time studying and joining club . for example , they need to enter the good school and get a good job in their future . since i wa 10 year old , my parent had told me to study hard to get good grade and go to a good school . my friend parent told so to my friend . so young people always have a lot of thing to do , and they also do n't have enough time to talk with their family . in order to get a good life for the future , young people belive that they need to make grate effort , even though they do n't have enough time to enjoy their daily life . second , a number of young people is getting le interested their community . in these day , people tend to talk to their friend through phone , email , chat and so on , and they are getting le serious about the human relationship . some of them may have little idea how toit is one of the social problem . we need to talk to other people directly to solve this problem . third , young people do n't know how to help their community . they have no good idea what is the useful way to help their community . so young people need to try to join their community once . they will understand how to help their community when they join them . i explained three point why i agree this statement . in conclusion , young people need more time to join thier community , to be interested in them and know what they can do for them .
