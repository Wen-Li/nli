i agree with this statement because sometimes when we watch tv we see news which is about people helping their comunities such a cleaning road or advertising , but most of those people who help comunity we see is old people . why young people do not give enough time to helping their community are because young people think it the old people 's job or they do not care about their comunities . even though they do not help their comunities , some of them complain to their comunities . i think it just wrong because if they have something to complain to their comunities they should go and complain it and work the problem out with the other comunitiy worker . thats the best way to get worked out the problem . however there are heap of young people who do not care about their comunities . they do n't even know who is the leader of their comunitiy or what their comunity working for people , if they know that who clean road or park , they would not make a mess on the road . as we can see , usually the mess on the road were made by young people that mean they do n't clean their road and let the other people to clean them .
