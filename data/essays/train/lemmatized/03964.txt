i think that is most important for everyone to have a broad knowledge of many argument , at the sometime i think that is foundamental for everyone to have specific knowledge in one subject . for some aspect i prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because in this way i can to have many possibility of choise for my future . for other aspect i prefer to have a specialize knowledge in one specific area ; in this way i can do my work better and with most capacity . generally i am agree with this statement because today every studets want to go at the university and , in this way , they can choise better the course in wich they want to specialize . i think also that the primary and the high school must to give to the student the struments and the capacity to build theire future like they want .
