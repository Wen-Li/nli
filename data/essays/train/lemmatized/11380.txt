this is a very difficult question , which i ca n't answer by saying `` yes '' or `` no '' . there are argument for both opinion . on the one side , you have to think of the le devoloped country of today . they will clearly have economic progress and more wealth for the people within the next twenty year . for example , the quality of life in country like china or india ha been improved within the last decade . and qualitiy of life mean having your own car , a it is common in europe or northern america . so , in the year 2026 , the world could be faced with inhabitans of former `` third world '' country who drive their own car . one the other side , the problem of carbon dioxide , such a global warming or more tornado , will leed to a different way to consider the use of energy . the `` green house effect '' is more and more acknowleged among scientist , and maybe somedays also the government will consequentially deal with this problem . cars are one of the main producer of coarbon dioxide . so , if you want to try to stop global warming , one possibility could be to reduce the number of car . maybe the government - instead of making it possible for their citizen to have an own car - will improve the public traffic system like bus or train , or they will try to develope new technology which are n't dependent on fossile energy , like solar energy nowerdays . in germany , also the tax on fuel are very high . the government try this way to make the people become aware of their use of fuel and maybe to reduce it . finally , no one know what the technological or economical developement of the world will be like within the next twenty year . but these developements will extremely influence the number of car . i think , the second version is more probable and therefore i agree with the statement above . the idea of million of chineses and indians driving their own car and producing much more carbon dioxide than today is n't very convenient .
