i think that fewer car will be in use in twenty year because of several reason . first of all , there is a growing environmental awareness that is going to drive the decrease in car usage . people are increasingly aware that current pollution level and even oil resource are not sustainable in the long term . even nowadays there are example of city major banning the entrance of car to certain area in order to protect them , and this could well be a growing trend looking forward . an efficient technological alternative to oil ha to be found but until this outbreak occurs , government would have to find a solution to make the best possible use of the limited oil resource . therefore , a possible solution would be to encourage the use of public transportation while disencouraging the use of car ( tax , fee to enter certain city area , increasing parking fee , etc . ) in addition to environmental awareness , i think that people would actually end up finding public transportation a better way to move around than car . this would obviously need a general improvement of public transportation , but it seems quite reasonable that this improvement will occur with the government aligned in a drive to restrict car usage . once public transportation is improved , people will without any doubt choose it because of two resons . firstly , people like to travel in the fastest and safest way . public transportation will be a safer way of moving around than car , and it woul even be faster , a it could avoid traffic jam . in the second place , public transportatio will prove to be more cost and time effective . people will be able to save a significant amount of money while travelling in a more time-effective way , a not only will they get to their destination in le time but they will also be able to read or even work while they are travelling .
