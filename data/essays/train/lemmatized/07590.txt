as a student myself , the question of whether it is necessary to acquire the knowledge or to merely learn the fact about it ha been pounding quite often through my experience of learning . obviously , it take far more time and effort to entirely understand the knowledge whereas sometimes it is mandatory for student to roughly learn the fact according to the requirement of their curriculum . in my opinion , i completely agree with the point of view in the statement that it is far more important for student to understand the idea and concept . first of all , to be able to understand the idea is to master the knowledge , which requires student to be quite familiar with the field of knowledge where a great deal of research have to be done before one could reach such level of understanding . through the way of reseaching , student can not only learn the history and origin of such concept but also gain a deep impression of the knowledge itself . the knowledge that is totally understood will last a long time and thus becomes the life-time fortune for student . secondly , a rough knowledge of fact would n't help student to learn further . some education system ask their student to remember a certain fact on the textbook a a way to learn knowledge . in this way , student might pas their exam with impressive mark by staying up late to cram through the textbook but there would n't be much knowledge left for them after the test , which to many of them is a massive loss a well a a waste of effort . if student have a better understanding of the knowledge , they are able to apply their knowledge to real life and solve problem easily . last but not the least , having a good understanding of idea and knowledge inspires student to go further beyond . it help the student to foster a great interest of the knowledge and drive them to `` dig a deeper hole '' . `` interests is the best teacher . '' the mission of learning is to carry on the experience and wisdom of the past and walk farther in civilization . the inspiration student gain from their understanding of idea and concept help to broaden their horizon , to see the world in a multi-dimension perspect , and eventually to foster noble value and belief . learning , a we all know , is a life-time experience . therefore , it is quite crusial to find the best way to learn . apparently , `` burning the mid-night oil '' is not the perfect method that many educator approve . teachers should encourage their student to understand thoroughly the idea and concept rather than to just learn the fact . be a smart learner , not a facts-collector !
