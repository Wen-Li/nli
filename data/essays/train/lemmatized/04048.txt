`` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . regarding the actual circumstance , such an assertion might appears surprising and even unrealistic . indeed , the selling rate of car keep increasing all over the word and especially in overcrowded country such a india or china . however , i agree and hope it will be true . reducing the number of car is in fact a fundamental element in order to protect the environment and to preserve futur generation from dramatic aftermath . i acknowledge it is going to be very hard to realise such an affirmation but it is not impossible . indeed , more and more people are aware of the importance of what is in stake when dealing with environment . they become more and more conscious of the necessity not to use the car too often . even politics realise it . in many europeans capital , decision have been taken in order to deter people from using their car and encourage them to use other type of transport such a metro or bus . in london , for instance , you must pay an important amount of money each time you want to go to the city with your car . in paris , reform have also been made in favour of bus . another important factor not environmental but economic will help the the reduction of the number of car to be achieved . statistics have shown that the price of the gasoil have increased so much during the last couple of year that people no longer can afford it a they used to be able . therefore , they do not used it a often a they used to do . if such a trend were to be confirmed in the next twenty year , people might think about no buying a car anymore . also , a '' natural element '' will probably plead in favour of the reduction of the number of car . gasoil is a limited natural ressource . unless a new resource were to discovered in the futur , car might simply not be able to be in use anymore because of the lack of petroleum .
