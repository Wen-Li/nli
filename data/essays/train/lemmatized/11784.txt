i completely agree with this statement . people become successful if they try different job and attain success in them . but trying different job involves risk . hence to become successful tring different risky job is essential to any person . anyone have to try differet job to know in which they are talented a well a interested . if we go on doing the same thing which we know , there is no further gain . we a well a lose the interest in what we are doing and finally get bored . then we cant move further . we just dont know the destination . if we go on trying new thing we will certainly reach our destination one day or the other . then we can develop ourselves in that task . few of the scientist have invented the best thing which we are using today by experimenting in different field or task . according to me without experimenting and taking risk one can not achieve the best of what he can . though not experimenting may not make the person a failure . enjoying life somewhat involves in attempting various task . actually , the law of life is to face new task day-by-day . this law is just implemented to attain success . we see in our day to day life , many people in different field are trying new task . few example are - actor trying in different concept and theme to show their versatality , bussiness-man introducing new product and new advertising technique , software engineer tring to work out and invent new soft ware etc . .. trying on different job may lead people to failure many-a time but this should not become a break to their experimental nature . they should recover from the failure and rise to success a said in the following proverb - `` failures are stepping stone for success '' .this mean that a person can learn a lot from failure about what to do and not to do . this experience make the person more and more perfect a the time progress . so according to me everyone should try new task and accept challenge in life not only to attain success but also to enjoy the life in various aspect .
