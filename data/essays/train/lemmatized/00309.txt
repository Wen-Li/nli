nowadays , most people generally spend a lot of time in their company for their work in daytime . although they are busy all day long , they have their spare time . i disagree with the position that the young do not have time to helping their communites . for this statement , i have two specific reason . helping another people do not need a lot of time and the young should reduce their waste time . first of all , helping people , there are not needed many time . and the important thing is the mind for helping people . for example , in recently , public advertisement express the only 3 minute needed for helping people , for instance , helping the old with the heavey broden when people walk on the street to go to the work in the morning or to go to home at night . next , if young people reduce their waste time , they can do more meaningful work like helping another poor people . after working , most people tend to spend their time watching television and take a nap . for example , whenever they have a spare time , if they help poor people and older people , they soon feel they are not alone anymore . in finally , the young should have spare time to help their community . they can make time for helping another people .
