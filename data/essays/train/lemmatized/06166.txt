young people stand for the future of one society . it is worthy of discussing what they do when they are free . recently there are many report of younth consumption of luxury purse and cosmetic in taiwan . young people are depicted a egocentric and indifferent to social condition in such report . is it true that the youth nowadays are no longer embodiment of passion to change the world ? examining carefully , there are many example of enthusiastic young men to help their community . for instance , a group of sophomore and junior student in yang ming medical college annually visit yu li asylum to support therapist there . the prepartion begun at least one year earlier . these future doctor learn not only from textbook but also from interacting with patient . they are not satistfied with a knowleage of disease and therapy ; human being are their ultimate concern . since some young people contribute their leisure to those who are in need , then where doe the myth of aloof youth come from in taiwan ? i think there might be some reason behind the prejudice to young people . nowadays young people are more daring to express their discontent to social reality than their parent did . but our society regard these opinion a pure complaint , a symbol of arrogance . this is the first mistake , although some young people are busy indulging in various kind of luxures , others are dedicated to improvement of where they live . it is not fair to deny the effort made by young people tip a tag of laziness . so i ca n't agree that young people nowadays do n't give enough time for their community .
