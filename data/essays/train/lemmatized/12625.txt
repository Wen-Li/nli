the problem of helping his community is very difficult to deal with due to his complexity . many people belive that teenager do not give enough time to help their community because they do not care about it . on the contrary , the statement that people give time to charity can also be partly justified because nowadays people try to be closer with the poor people . however , all aspect into account , i stronghly feel that young people do not give enough time to their community . first , i agree with the statement that explain that young people are more interessted in video game or getting out than in helping people . for instance , when we need to go the see my grandparent , my little sister always try to find a solution to do something else this day ( chatting on internet , meeting some friend , ... ) . another exemple to illustrate that young people do not care about elder is the bus . i can barely understand what cost to young people to ask a old man or woman if he or she want the sit . besides it better to stay on your foot after a whole day of lesson where you have been sitting for hour . but it is true that is difficult to really help his community , it take a lot of time and nowadays it is hard to find some free time . however their is some people who like to help people of their community , they do a very nice job like . to illustrate my point , i would like to talk about people who give some warn food for people who do not have enough money to eat something hot during the winter time . therefore not everybody do not care about his community , but a lot of people think that other people do that for them . i am not particularly active to help my community , but for me it is a lack of time . but this year i have decided to help some young people to their homework in order to give them the pleasure of working . to sum up we could say that not everybody do something for his community but i am not sure that 50 year ago it would have been better . i have the feeling that people help more and more their community with money for association . their is an age for everything and , perhaps , the youth who do not care about community will change their mind and become an activ helper . the community need help whenever and whoever give this help .
