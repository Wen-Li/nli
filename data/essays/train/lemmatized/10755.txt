to me both aspect are important because a student should have the knowlege and the understanding of the idea and the concept of an specific topic before they learn a fact on it . that is because i actually think that , when you have a fact on any matter , that fact happens a a response to several or various event that happend before therefore an student should know all the concept and idea , or all the information he can have on a certain matter to become aware or to have a logical explanation of why that fact or event turned that way . in my specific field of medicine , that is obstetrics and ginecology , an student need to know all the information about labor and delivery , for example , refering to all the change the uterus , the delivery channel and the vagina go thru , and all of the bio-mechanical aspect of the uterus contraction , the biochemicals aspect of the contraction , all the active and passive change that the mother an the fetus have in the labor and delivery event , a well a all the change that occur in the pregnancy , before getting to learn how to take care or handle a delivery event . that way if something go wrong he will have all the information on wath is going wrong an if there is a way to make it go the way it is supposed to go , and have the knowledge to handle any undesired event . tha same reason apllies to a student that can learn how to do a c-section , or learn the tehcnics aspect of how to perfomr it , but if he doe not have all the anatomical information about the human body , anything can go wrong in that procedure and it will turn to the death of the mother and the baby . so i think that every fact ha an explanation and the more you learn about the conceps or idea leading to a certain fact the more you will know about the fact itself .
