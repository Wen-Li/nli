have you ever try new thing even though you knew risk is going to be extreme ? there are a few successful people who take chance and try new thing , bill gates and steve jobs . two most reknown rival in the world . therefore i agree with the topic . first example is bill gates . in 2000 , sony 's playstation 2 wa the best game instrument in the world . any other company did not even try to beat the power of ps2 . however , there were one man who chellenge sony 's ps2 . bill gates demanded his worker to work on a game instrument . and eventually , he created x-box . he knew that risk would be gigantic enough to shut down his company for a while . despite of risk , his microsoft jumped into a game industry . in 2003 , microsoft made halo2 , which is considered a the greatest game of all time . second example is steve jobs , the ceo of apple inc . in san fransico , california , the mp3 company were amazed by sudden appearance of ipod , which can hold up to 1,000 song . because apple wa a computer-making company , the other company were surely surprized . according to steve job 's biography , icon , he knew the risk wa literally going to tear his company apart because of it financial problem . hw also knew that if he success , it is going to resurrect apple . as you all know , ipod is success . there are a lot of successful people in the world , but a few try new thing and willing to take chance rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . bill gates succees gaming industry while steve jobs dominated a fielid of mp3 . there is no doubt in my mind that successful people try new thing .
