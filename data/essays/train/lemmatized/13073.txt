i am agree with this statement because the successful people try new thing and take risk than only doing what they already know how to do well . to support this idea i will use some simple example and other simple reason . for example i think that every professor of the most important university in europe and united states are good ( it is a reasonable assumption for me !!! ) , clever and are able to do well their job , but only few of these can become famous in the world winning the nobel ! who win this , win because his study or his research is revolutionary and very important . to be revolutionary you have to study something new and you have to take risk . another example is that many person can play a musical instrument , but only very few people become famous and remembered in the history of music , thanks to their innovative style of their music . from this two simple example it is easy to see that a lot of person are able to do well something , but the successful person study or create something innovative and just for this they take risk . many time the research of succes doe not go well and you can lose time and other thing , but for me , taking the risk , it is the price that you have to pay if you want to try to have succes .
