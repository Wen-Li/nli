i consider that a a human being , we are constantly making change in our life , but generally we look for the thing we know , because we like to be sure and confortable . i agree with the statement , because if you find out the story of the people who ha suceed in their life , they have done something different , and they took the risk of do it . usually the path they have walked is really hard , they do not give up , they learned how to deal with the difficulty . i consider that their best caracteristic is that they are selfconfidents , but after all that at the end they saw the result . all the thing we do not know , allways give u scare , because the consequence are unkown , but in this world what we need is more enterpreuners , people who can start a business , who can improve the social responsability , who do not need others to make decision . on the other hand , people who ha only do what they know how to do well , do not let themselves try other opportunity and of course when you do thing that you have never done before you learn , you know more people and this people can teach you to be a better person . i think that it is important to take risk , because it improve your knowledge about differents area like the proffesional area , the sentimental area , the health area . and it also improve your relashionship with the enviroment . life is a group of different area , concentrated in one person , who ha the freedom to take risk or no .
