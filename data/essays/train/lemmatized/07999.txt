in the current society , the combined ability is always be required . especially the basic capacity of english and computer . in my opinion , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . as i mentioned above , more and more job need people to have more than one ability . such a my major is finance and banking , but if i just be familiar with how the bank operation , it is firely not enough . because with the developing of the banking system , a lot of new and comprehensive thing occered to bank and they have to accept them because of the harsh competition . for example , the bond relatived to the performance of many company . we have to have the good knowledge of accouting and mathmatics to do it . it showes that have broad knowledge could meet the requirement . have many skill also help u have a broader carrer range . if one only specialize in one specific subject , he or she could only doing one job for his/her whole life . if he/she find the job is boring or not the real thing they like to do , there is no chance to change for him/her , which is really regretful . we can easy to turn to other job with a broad knowledge and we can solve the problem we meet by more than one method . i can not imagine that doing one thing all my life . i love to change . i love the excitement that change give me . the change can make my life colourful and happy . so i choose to have a broad ability . the broad knowledge make u do our job better a well . such a with the wonderful logical thinking of math and good foundation of chinese , i can make the banking essay more perfect !
