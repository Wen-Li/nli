i agree to the statement `` young people enjoy more life than older people do '' . even many older people would like to say , i have done this when i wa of young age . this statement clearly state that even older people agree to this statement . the time when the young people leave their childhood , they got a lot of energy in them which they would definitely try to utilize , unlike in the older age where they cant even have enough energy to walk around . it is only in the young age , the people can do whatever they want , like for example go to gym , playing sport with much ease . if these are also the interest of older pleple then they could have done it in their young age only . since the young person ha something called the young blood flowing in his body he/she will be affected by le disease because in that age the immunity is at it greatest level , also any injury they suffer thay have the capability to recover quickly . some young people actually take disadvantage of their age and endure themselves in disorderly pleasure like boozing , combating with others if necessary or even enjoy having sex which the older one may not enjoy . in case they booze , they cant take in more drink . but apart from those unruly pleasure there also diferrent form of pleasure which can be enjoyed in the young age only . they include travelling long distance , playing sport , working in office which give them pleasure and also satisfaction . finally i can say that all sort of people enjoy theis life in some or other way but it is only at young age you wnjoy the most . this many of them realize in old age only afer having lost their valube time . .
