being young is the reason of being active for a long time and being active would naturally imply to be in a state to enjoy for a longer time . but there are some exception where even older people show their activeness for a long time which is in rare situation . young people can easily do the activity which the older people struggle for . but even there are some old people who do the thing easily . older people usually never dare for the adventure in their life for enjoyment where a most of the young people will not hesitate to go for adventure for enjoyment . the old people probabaly will lose the interest of enjoying the life a they would put their interest more on the family matter , career , future life etc , . the young people having the plan for their future will more concentrate on enjoying the part of their life . watching movie , going to beach , enjoying the beaties of the nature are mostly done by the young peolpe a it can be clearly seen in any tourist place that most of the visitor will be the younger people . old people lack the interest in doing so because most of them doesnot have the strength to travel for a long time . there are also some old people who never think of their pain for enjoyment . old people usually select the actvities for enjoyment only at the time of some ocassion whereas the young people will always try to find the reason for enjoyment . there are also old people who leave the responsibilites aside and spend more time in enjoyment of life . hence i strongly feel that , it not the matter of age which decides the enjoyment but it is the matter of the attitude of the people towards life .
