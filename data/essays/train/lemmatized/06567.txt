i live in istanbul . it is a city that there are lot of energy due to young population . there are lot of bar , diskos etc . i mean , istanbul 's social life athached with young population . this provides young person to an entertaning life . so , they love and enjoy the life more than older people . first of all , being young is a strange thing . you 're slowly get in life , seeing life ' good side and bad side . also you do n't have much experience about life . so , you are following life , but you do n't know where it is going . in addition to that , nice and enjoying thing are coming very nice to you . you are driving car for the first time , maybe you have your first sex experience etc . these are very beautiful experiment . you get exited when you do them all for the first time . these kind of example make person much life liker . at last but not least , older people also enjoying life . they are travelling world , trying to find new thing and trying to find more exitement thing . however , many of them can not finding what they are looking for because , whatever they are gonna find is familiar to them . this situation break their hope of course . in conclusion , young people love to live . they are addicted to live . like a man say `` the more you enjoy , then you die '' . i guess he is right , a man can not continue to get enjoy from everything in his life .
