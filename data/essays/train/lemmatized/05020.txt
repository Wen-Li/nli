i think to a large degree that the fact in the future there will be fewer car in use than today it depends strectly on technological progress . having a look in to the past and comparing that situation with the one we are living today we can say that there were a lot of discovering process that allowed the society to change it scenary . in fact 30 year ago , referring to the modern era , the scenary wa characterized by new hi/tech invention in the field of main of transport . in fact the airplane transportation existed since 1950 but increased immensely 30 year ago when people could travel around the world without problem . so , i think that if the technology continues to perform and to grows a it did in the past i can say that probably in the future we will have fewer car than today . so i completely agree with the statement because i think that in the future people will not use anymore car for any kind of transportation need , thanks especially to modern technology . nowadays if we have a look to modern city we can see that people move from a part of the city to another using underground . so i think that people will use fewer car for differents reason > first because they do not want to make the queue on the street second they replace car with others main of transport because they do not have to be concentrated in to driving . third because in the future we will have better main of transport , in fact we know that researcher are projecting a new type of train project . i am referring to the new train that will connect the europe with america . so this train will be positioned into a tunnel . the tunnel will be build under the sea that permit to the train to cross the ocean in only 9 hour . so the future human life will be very different from now .
