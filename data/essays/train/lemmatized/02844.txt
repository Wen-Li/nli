i actually think that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . let 's start with two simple example . setting up a new restorant for instance . the setter take a huge risk : he spend his money , asks for loan . all of this could lead him to sell his house , his car to give the money back to the bank . but if he do not , maybe will he stay waiter for the rest of his life . my second example is a person who want to marry his girlfriend . that could seems to him like a terrific change in his routine . but if he do not , he can never know what a father life look like . i personnaly think that trying new thing lead u to a better situation . by trying new thing you could invent or create something great . in a financial point of view , creating new thing is directly bound to the creation of new market , new customer and so on . furthermore , inventing give the inventor a better satisfaction than if he is always doing what he know . a other possible consequence is to find out a new way to do the thing what you need to do . in this case you could be more efficient , or making the others feel better . for example a manager who set up a new method for his worker to create shoe , could reduce the noise that they have to face , and improve the factory 's production . anyway , if the new method doe not show good result , he always can cancel it . on the other hand , i think that doing what you already know is fine if you agree with your situation ; e.g. you could refuse a promotion to manager if you prefer spending great time with your family rather than having more responsabilities in your workplace . i mainly agree with this statement , but i think there could be some exception , though .
