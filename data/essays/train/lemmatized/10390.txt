there are many example in history which prove that risktakers who tried out new thing often were exceptionally successful . on the other hand many story prove the opposite and too much risk caused great dispair . within the following text two men shall underline these example : henry ford and napoleon . with a short summary of what made out their live a conclusion with my own opinion finish the essay . henry ford had a vision and idea to let this vision come true . he wanted to achieve such a cheap car , that it becomes affordable to everyone . he knew how to minimize cost of production and calculated very well before starting the business . one can say that he had a dream but wa not a dreamer and estimated the amount of risk very well . also in the aftermath , the success did not ruin his sense of reality . ford continued being realistic and careful . an opposite example is napoleon . he especially loved to be rich and successful and therefore accepted almost each risk . he invaded country and wa the biggest warrier of his time . but a he became too mighty , he lost his natural given angst . he became unconcius of obvious danger . within his wish of never ending glory he lost everything and had to life in exile . consequently , i agree with part of the statement above . successfull people defenitely achieve innovation or do unknown thing . but to be successcful for a long time , it is neccessary to never lose control about a business and never forget about realistic risk . and condition . often , those who reach high aim become blind for their environment and are only driven by the willingness of achieving even more . i think it is absolutely important to carefully estimate the own talent and gift and to be true to oneself .
