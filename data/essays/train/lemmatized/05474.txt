almost everyone , from a seventeen year old teenager to an old man of 60 , ha the experience of trying new thing and take risk . it seems to me , after 18 year of experience , that people who are successful are tend to challenge the traditional idea and to take risk to obtain the success . and i 'm going to approach my idea in the following three way . first of all , new thing bring a entirely different area to the businessmen which nobody ever entered before and therefore draw a lot of attention attention from people . the founder of walmart , sam walton , is a good example of open a new business area and made millons of money from it . sam walton created a lot of new way to make his shop different . for example , he made the consumer be able to choose all the thing they need first and pay for them together at the end of shopping . it is so convenient for constomers that people like walton 's way of seeling thing and rush to his shop to shopping . consequently , new idea will give the businessman a new chance to exhibit it product in a different and attractive way . equally important , new thing can give people a drive . since the idea never appears before , the person will be excited about it . this kind of emotion would motivates the bos a well a the staff . compared to the old way of accomplish a goal , taking a risk is more funning and amusing . in consequence , people may get more profit from doing a different way because they energetic and interested . lastly , business people will be more and more difficult to get profit if they keep on doing it the same way . since the old way is proved to be effective , more and more people will try to use the same way and a a result , they are not going to get a good profit . in contrast , challenging the old way of dealing with business will provide the person more chance to be profitable . accordingly , people who want to get an success should try to operate the business in a new way . there are several other reason relevent to the problem under discussion while , unfortunately , i do n't have enough time to explore them in detail . neverthless , the above three point should in a large sense calrify my idea that successful people tend to try new idea and challenge the old way .
