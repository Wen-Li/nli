whether young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community or not is controversial . some point out that they are quite busy to give helpness to their society while others insist that they would be great hand to help the community . i strongy disagree with the opinion that youth doe not give enough time to helping their community . first , they would pay close attention to society where they belong to , even though there are a lot of burden they have to deal with by themselves . here is an example . in my case , a a university student , i have worked for youth organization which is for helping young generation . one of what i have done wa to participate in the summer camp for people who do not have parent or any relative . the action i have achieved wa to be a sister for them and take care of them . i insist that there might be plenty of volunteer who join the youth group a a one of the young people . second , young people are willing to get involved in their junior to give advice in school . i have been helped by my predecessor in regard to the homework which i could not solve by alone and the way to reach the dream i have held . they gave me various information making me intelligent and stimulated me to fulfill my goal . in addition , now i am giving helpness and many kind of advice to my junior a my predecessor did . it mean that young people are delighted to helping their school . to sum up , young people , especially getting involved in the school , organization in the current society give sufficient time to help their community . there is no doubt in my mind that young people play important role in their group .
