there are many difference in the world from the way it wa in the past , young people are one of those category which were effected by the change . i completly agree with the statement that young adult do not give enough time to help by giving a helping hand in their community . there are many reason for this thought , first , the young adult were not raised by their family to carry out the responsibility of a person other than themselves , food is provided to their table , plus a much money a they want without any kind of work no matter how old they are ! and a a result there are some who ca n't be responsible even for their ownselves let alone contributing to their community ! . also , we ca n't deny the many attraction around young adult , which make it impossible for them to be part of any positive community work many movie , gamesand other attraction which had made them forget any kind of resposibility . finally , some young people have a very negative idea about themselves , and they have no positive feedback from the elder of their family or community , they always procieved with coutions from people around them . all that and much more could be the factor behind the low number of young people participating in community service .
