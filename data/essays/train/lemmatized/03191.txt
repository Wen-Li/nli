i disagree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . i disagree mainly by three reason . first , even though the tour guide is an specialist in the zone or city that you are going to visit and you can get a more complete knowledge of that zone or city , i think that a good book of the city can supply in a correct way the knowledge of the tour guide . a good book have history of the city , route of interest , architectural and archeological point to visit and legend of the city among other thing . using a book of the city in your travel can help you both to acquire the knowledge that you would acquire with the tour guide and to plan the route to follow . second , when you travel with a tour guide , you have the schedule restriction . for example the plan say 8 am breakfast , 9 am visit to the museum , 1 pm eating ... and you have to respect the schedule . you do not have enough freedom . on the other hand , when you travel without a tour guide , you can assign the time that you want to the different activity . if you want , you can get up more late in the hotel , or if the visit to the museum is bored , you can end the visit and go to drink a coke or visit other thing . in other word , you can assign the time to every activity , and not be restricted by an schedule . you can enjoy the place by the time that you want , no by the time that a tour guide want . third , traveling with a tour guide , restrict you the route or itinerary . for example your travel can be limited to 7 or 8 place and you can not add or quit a place . traveling with a tour guide will allow you to decide wich place to visit . your travel will not be limited by a determined number of place . if you want you can add or quit place to visit , the route is not fix . you can visit the place that most attracts your attention . in conclusion , for me is more exciting to travel without a tour guide because i can get more freedom in my travel and i can decide which place to visit and for how many hour . i am not limited by the schedule or route of a tour guide .
