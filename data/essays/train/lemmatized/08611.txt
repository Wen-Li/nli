some people ca n't travel without a perfect organization , without to know where they will be on each day and everything . to my point of view this is not the best way to travel . i prefer traveling by myself without a group let by a tour guide . there is many reason who explain this idea : first of all , it is more conveniant and you feel free to do what you want , secondly because you can be integrated to the culture and not only visit touristic place . on the first hand , when you are with a group led by a tour guide you know the program before to leave your country . you have no surprise and can not decide to change your plan . you do not have the possibility to like a place and want to spend more time because most of the time , you must look at you clock and follow the group . for example , when i wa in florida , in miami , i decided to go with my friend to visit key west . on the way to go , we get lost and , by the way , we discover other beautiful place that we would not be able to see with a tour guide . then we spend one night in key west a we planed to do but we really enjoyed the city and wanted to stay more . so we just did it , without any problem : we were totaly free to enjoy in our way . on the other hand , when you are with a tour guide , you most of the time only visit the touristic place and where everybody go . you see and visit what all the others see and visit and you are not able to know place that nobody know or where only the citizen go . also , by traveling with a group , you only speak your own language and you not have any possibility to know and experiment about the other culture . as an example , when i wa in china , i met a girl who invite me for a dinner in her house . it would never happen with a tour guide because i should follow all the group . so because i wa free to do what i wanted to do , i had a dinner with a traditional chinese family and it wa such a great experience ! to conclude , when you have the possibility to travel by yourself , without any help , it is better to do it without a tour guide : you are free and even if you get loose , you will learn a lot about the culture . so let go and for your next holiday : be your own tour guide !
