i strongly agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . but this is my opinion , i think the common opinion of the customer ; in the other hand i have to say that the opinion of the people involved in the production of advertising is different . first i want to provide my personal experience . two week ago i bought a personal computer of the last generation of computer . the advertising wa amazing , the quality of the screen and the powerful of the cpu showed incredible . in reality it 's just the evolution of a normal computer , nothing of special . this is just an exemple of a personal experience but i think that there are million of customer in italy that every day are pussed by the advertisemets to buy something that is in reality differs from what presented . i have the chance to have a friend working in an agency that develops advertisemnts for both italian or foreign client . her opinion is not in costrast with mine but she thing that the problerms is not the advertisement in it self but how the people want to see the advertisement . her point is that the some customer need to believe that a product can improve his quality of life and then he buy it , but , once he ha bought the object , he realizes that his life ha no changed and so he is not satisfied by the object . at the end he belief that the responsible for his disatisafaction is the advertisement . as conclusion i want to say that most advertisement show product much better than they really are , even if part of the responsability for an error in buying an object can in part due to the customer .
