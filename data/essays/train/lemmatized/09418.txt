i agree with the opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today for the following reason . first , when people do not often use car , the air of the city will become clearer than now . when i wa keio junior high school student , a private school in tokyo , the capital city of japan , i lived near the supermarket which had a lot of parking for the car of the customer . the air near my house wa very dark , i wa always sick inmy throat . but when i wa tokyo university student , i moved to the small town where people did not use car at all . so i became nice of my condition of throat because of the cleanness of air . second , in twenty year more and more transportational sytem will become expanded all over the world . when i began to work in osaka , the second big city of japan , i went to the office by car , because there wa no transportational system , for example , subway , bus , train . but i wa worried about a heavy traffic jam every day , besides i wa often late for the starting time of the office . after two year , now , i can go to the office by subway happily because the transportational system became expanded to the station near my office . now unlike me what two year ago , i am never late for the starting time of the office . so , in twenty year , people will use more transportational system which have not any traffic jam . therefore i strongly agree the opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
