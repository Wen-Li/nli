i think each age ha it plasure time and memory . during the childhood , teen year , young people & old during childhood you have the chance to do anything and no one will say why ? they will say he is trying to learn , let him try it so he will know what is it like drink a hot cup of tea he will cray becouse he did not know it hot , what is hot ? so next time he will avoid it and when he cray his mom and dad will run to him and huge him . he will have all the interisting . he will buy toy , game and tudybears . he will sleep with his mother and father . teens and yong people usully have the most good time they enjoy the most becose they will start to under stand everything , try everything if they have the corige ( brave heart ) for the bunji jumping , scopa diving , have alots of frineds , join a collage , drive the car , lot and lot of enteristing thing which old people can do it but not like young people . old people spicelly when they retier they like to go in a croze or in a trip around the world , but the acttivities that they will had are not the same of the young . young people have cornucopia of fun , experiens , friend . the butiy being old is to see your son or dughetr having a buby , to see his smill , to see your old wife/husben beside you smileing to you graping your hand . i think young people have a wild life but when they become old they have lot of love . the most important is to know how to live each period correctly . enjoy each second becose ya each second you will lose are aint gonna come back . good bless every one
