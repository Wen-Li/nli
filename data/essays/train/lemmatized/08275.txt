in my openion successful people try new thing and take risk rather than going in the old fashion or method . there are a number of people who used new way and helped them to succeed in their life . if they go with the old fashion a they already familiar with in their life , they may go in same way in the career which may not help in the challenging environment . dheerubhai ambani , a great business person in india used to go in the new unconventional way in his life aswell a career . it worked alot so a a result of it he became a great person from school teacher son . let we take about google founder , they didnot gone in a old fashion . even though they are software professional , they didnot tried a normal employ . they wanted to go in a new way and wanted to take risk . they started with a new idea and now we can see the difference . if all the person going in the traditional way which already excisted no new invention will occur . so people are going in new way and succeeding in their life and in their career . hollywood director also come under this same group . most of the successful director used to present their movie in a different manner with new idea and some people try to present their movie in the old fashion which already working . `` jurasic park '' came with this policy only . the producer and direcor know that they are doing risk but they want prefer to go in the new way and they succeeded . eventhough some movie with sory is coming now , we remembered only sephen speilberg , who started the way . eventhough some people going in the same route and succeding , we can call them a follower not the initiaters . so i strongly agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
