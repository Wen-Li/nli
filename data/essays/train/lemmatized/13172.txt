i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i really think that travelling should be a personal experience . this way you can travel alone or with someone who share same interest . you can even travel with your loved one 's and spend more personal and quality time . travelling is not always fun if it 's layed out for you by the tour guide . travel should be adventerous and it can accomplished only if you travel with out a guide . you can have more adventure and story to tell when you travel with out a guide since you can find out new way of doing thing . it give a great boost on how you could achieve thing which you might have never imagined . travel should be an experience not a reservation . it also provides some time to think about yourself and how you have acieved it . you dont have to time your travel and can spend time based on your interest . you can always take a break at any place you want , if you are tired or just love spending more time at a specific location which is not possible travelling in group with guide . travelling in a group ha lot of disadvantage than advantage . first of all you are grouped with lot of people you are not even familiar with . even though it all layed out for you to make it easy , it really take away the personal beauty of travel . your interest might not really match up with every one in the group . so you end up spending time where you really do n't like to be . so personally i would like to travel by myself rather than in a group led by a tour guide . and make the travel more peronal .
