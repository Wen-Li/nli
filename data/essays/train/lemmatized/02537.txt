nowadays , knowledge ha changed , method of approach are different , concept ha become more difficut to master , student have different ability , there are student with limited abilites and stretched to student with overwhelming ability , this doe not put an end to learning experience , a there is a question that is floating in our mind and lead a person to a deeper thinking and make him put his knowlege behind him . is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact ? to begin with , i surley accomodate this , and it is more influencial for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , for example : what would it be better if a student know that the sea is deep , or learns why it deep , that will give student a deeper , wider , and a variety of way to think , student will be more efficient in their life , thus leading to better study and a safer vision to their future , and start thinking in a convergantly more significant way . in the past , people had limited recources , no computer , no television , and it would be good if they had book with a quite limited explanation , so our past ansistors depended on their logic , religon , and the scenario that they pas through everyday to learn fact , which lead them to a succesful life that we live nowadays , invention and innovation passed through , so what is left ? its more important to understand idea and concept , a i have mentioned that all fact have been produced , so what is left for a student nowadays is to dive deeper in idea and concept and try to get out with a sucessful summary at the end of the day , because one day he will be tested with the fact in front of him . example : in a math exam a student get all rule that he might need to solve the qustion , but what he need is the concept of how to solve the question . it is not a mirracle for a student to pas his study life with flying coulors , every person owns his own mind , but the secret of each is where when and how to use it . which will result him in his/her desired outcome .
