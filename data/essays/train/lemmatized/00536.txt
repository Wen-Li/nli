i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . although traveling in a group with a guide doe have advantage for people who are not used to traveling , i think traveling by individual is far more interesting and challenging . here below are the reason . first of all , if you travel with a group , it is likely that the travel agency offer you only several choice of hotel . whereas if you book on your own , you can chose from a vast list of hotel that most suit your taste . you would probably have to dine in large restaurant mosty for tourist because local food establishment where they have delicious food tend to lack space to host a group . another inconvenient factor of traveling with a guide is that you can not chose the site you would like to visit . usually , the guide would take you to the most popular tourist site , and not to the le famous but fascinating place . you would also have limited time to spend at each site . i believe the most wonderful thing about traveling is that you get to meet people from all over the world , but if you travel in a group , you are le likely to interact with other traveler . i visited spain this september on my own , and became acquainted with traveler from us , france , morocco , and china on the train and at football stadium , and we exchanged information on the best place to visit . i still correspond with one of them .
