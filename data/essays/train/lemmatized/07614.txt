yes i do agree that successful people always try out new thing and take risk rather than doing the same thing what they already know how to do well . because people will with his own experinces not from other experinces . if we try out the new thing then only we will come to know what we have to do and how to do . in starting we might may go wrong because that is the new thing for u . but we have one prolong `` always keep trying unless u get success '' and one day surely u will be success . there is one story of one king who fight for his kingdom . he lost and hide in one cave , there he saw one small spiderman trying to clim the wall . but he keep on falling donw , but he never loss his control and temper he keep trying it untill he get succes . from this king understand that there is nothing impossible in this world only6 the thing is we need to give our total dedication towards our work . he understand this thing and went back , gathered his army and faught again . he keep on trying it and in last he won and got back his kingdom back . so he learnt the lesson from a small spiderman that we should never give up . always keep on trying . so in the same way i feel that , if we have confidence upon ourself we can do anything on this earth and get success in that , though it might be from different field which we not deal with . but what we need t o have is confidence and strenght in ourself that we can do this thing . if we have this quality then no one can beat u . we will always be successful in our life and in our work . it might happen that being a experince person also he might fail . because anything is possible in this world . so i conclude that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . only we need to have confidence on our self then we can do anything on this world .
