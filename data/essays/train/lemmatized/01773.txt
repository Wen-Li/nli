some university teach the student with broad knowledge of many academic subject and others concentrate on specific subject . in my opinon , if i can choose , i would rather study one specific subject . fisrt , i can study deeper in same amont of time . if i have more knowlege in one subject i can use it more . also i think if i had the experience study deep enough in one subject , studying other sbuject is much easier than before . however , if i never had that experience i can only go a far a the first subject with the second subject or hard to study deeper because i do not have experience . second , these day , the company want the people who ha a great knowledge about one specific subject . in our socity we work togeather . most of the company ha part of the work and expected them to do their own job not the other person job . if each of the employee can finish their job perfectly there will be no problem of the soving the task . last , you can share the information about what you know well . if there is an issue that need to discus about your major , you can explain to other people because you know it well . however you know it vaguelly the information that you would explain would not helpfull , in worst situation that could give more confusion to the people who are listening to your explanation . as i talk about the advantage of leaning a specific subject , i support the idea . i want to have one specific knowledge and i think it help me and the socity at the same time .
