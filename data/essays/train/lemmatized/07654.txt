specialization in my opinion is a key word that ha to be taken into account . from experience that have occured to me in life i have forged a negative idea of the knowledge of many subject . i i think this is a valid explanatory element therefore i have decided to include this happening in order to give my thougts some back up . my english teacher in the 12th grade made a clear distinction between the italian teaching system and the american teaching system . the italian system had a vast program but it did not prepare student for `` that specific sector '' in university and then work . on the other hand he emphasized the fact that the american educational system had fewer amount of topic but the piece of information absobred by the student would have surly been stored in his long term memory becoming permanent knowledge . whilst depth knowledge can connect a student to `` work '' in general , the student with a vast but more superficial knowledge will probably have more difficulty in settling and finding an occupation suitable for him . for all these reason i think specialized knowledge ha a more utlistic aspect that the knowledge of seldom subject lack . it is true that knowledge of a variety of topic can be applied in other life situation but the need people have in our society are different . a person go to the university a he want to have knowlege on a certain topic , this knowledge will enable him to find a job . recalling on another life experience , my father that ownes a fabrique told me how he had some employee that lacked of the working skill . all turned out to be a waste of time since he had to teach and explain the information that ha not been taught previously . if a person specializes on a single subject he will easily work effectivly therefore the result for society will be postive . i think school and university should provide this system and then they should give the opportunity for student to reasearch singularly . if a person is attracted by the vast variety of knowledege he should research and study on his own , an unclear knowlege of many topic may undermine working system in society .
