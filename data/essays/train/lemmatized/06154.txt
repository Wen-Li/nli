with the advance of communication system such a television and internet , access to information is becoming easier and easier . therefore , it is not hard these day to find people with a little knowledge on a wide range of subject . access to information ha become easier not only for ten-year-old child but also for scientist a well . however , it is not the range of subject one ha knowledge on , but the depth of knowledge in a specific subject , when it come to academic . the reason is many fold . first of all , good academic work requires concentration , hard work , and above all , deep knowledge on the subject . it is of course true that having knowledge on many other subject would help the researcher look at the subject , or the problem at hand from other point of view , but when it come to actually producing good work , all that matter is expertize on the subject . simply , one can not produce original academic work without understanding the small detail of the subject ; be it the inner working of a physical principle , or the french cuisine in middle class of the seventeenth century . another crucial reason a to one should specialize on the subject she is working on , rather than spending her time learning about other subject is that in the end , one will have to convey his knowledge to the next generation . as this is the only way knowledge is accumulated , by passing from generation to generation , a researcher should always have a good understanding of the new discovery in his field , which will require specializing on the subject . only after having a deep knowledge on the subject can one let the next generation benefit from his background . having superficial knowledge about a broad range of subject is like reading the first page of thousand of book , hence doe not contribute to one 's wisdom or expertise . compare that to someone who ha only read hemingway 's ` for whom the bell tolls ' . it is not unreasonable at all to argue that the latter ha gained a better wisdom from her experience .
