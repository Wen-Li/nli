when success is involved i tend to find myself disagreeing with statments relating to the measurment of success . when defining success and how it is obtained one realises that different method and many underlying factor take a toll on the general outcome of any ordeal . to simply encase a method of success into a vague statement is a contadiction in itself . to find success is to define it according to each man want and need . for one person being successfull is to constantly change and to constantly adapt to the surroundings . this give him the offset of a `` jack of all trade '' . he chooses to experiance all but master nothing . and a such he also find adversity in the decision he chose to define himself a . one would benefit from the adaptivity of such a persona , but might suffer from the instability of such a lifestyle . accordingly so , others might find themselves proud and in tune with the aspect of their personality which they have deemed powerfull . it is another form of strength which benefit from gaining great wisdom and a more decisive approach to the lifestyle they would deem a successful . knowing one fault and unwillingess to adapt creates a form of security and purpose in life . but might also negatively affect a person weakness when a forcefull unpredicted change in enviroment is brought about . in conclusion , any strive to achieve success no matter the method should be considered a valiant one . it is those who invent themselves and push forward with their action who are successful no matter what the situation is . knowing that there is no guidline for success and there is only achieving content after effort will bring about instant glory to any man or woman . it is that strive to maintain your identity which determines if you obtain your goal . therefore it is goal which define success , and it is only obtaining those goal that should consequently matter .
