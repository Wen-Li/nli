to talk about successfull people make it neccessary to define success itself . per definition success is the ability to adapt to life circumstance that will grant to make them or life better than others or to open better opportunity for themself or their family . so success go definately along with new thing on a special field nobody ever did before . every day people take the risk of trying new thing . if in the past , there wa no one who attempted to try something else than the routine , there wo n't have been people , who developed the tire . a tire wa in the ancient time only for material transport , where tree could be transported form one place to another . nobody around that time thought of beeing successfull . it wa an idea that made routine and life more easy . after some thousand year karl benz developed the first automobile . the people were afraid , a they are ususally with upcoming new invention . he took the risk with investing money in an idea , that collected some allready existing good idea ( tire ) . he made something new that today people can not think to life without : the car . he wa successfull , he took the risk of failure for implementing something new in the society . another example is the carreer of the mobile phone , computer and many other electrical device that nobody believed in but that under construction of several year went out to be a great success . and that is the same for people . people doing the same thing the same way during all their life wo n't face any kind of development . some people change in small step others in big one , depending on their social experience and their family background . but of course not everybody can be the risky one . that is why nature made all variety of expression of such a behavior . if all people were doing the same , and for example that could be an error or disadvantage , the whole planet would be gone . so only some people try to be extraordinary or in some kind different that the rest . and the others can use their invention a well , when it is sold a a product , that system is called merchandising . and the others can pay with their abiltiy that brought them that amount of money so they can join the progress that the others went through without a risk . so i think successfull people trz new thing but thez do not have the full response of beeing successfull , it is , additional what nature and life gave u with them . it 's chance and luck .
