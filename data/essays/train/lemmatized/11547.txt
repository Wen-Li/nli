cars are very essential mode of transportation now a day . its a type of luxury thing in human life . i think every middle class person is thinking of having a car . i donot agree with the statement that in coming twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . firstly , i want to support my idea by decribing the following thing . as world go on developing in technology , science and many other form i think pollution also increase after twenty year . beacuse of this pollution a person may not able to travel on a moped or twwo wheeler . so many peoaple like even middle calss people try to have a car instead of having a two wheeler moped . secondly , i want to support my idea by focusing on living condition of a human being . day by day the standard of living of an individual is going on increasing . an individual think of having luxury good . which result to have a car . its a type of pretigious thing of having a car . thirdly , i think it a safest mode of trasportation like eventhough in the climatic variation like rainfall and snowfall . there is no need of worrying that there is a chance of getting wet . we can confidentally go anywhere at any time wth out considering the rainfall . finally i want to support my idea of having more car after twenty year with the above example . like considering pollution in coming twenty year the number of car will be increased , secondly it is type of satisfaction that an individual will get in pursuing a car . another reason is that at any time we can plan any trip . here the speed of the car also come into picture . we can reach the destination in right time at any climatic condition . last but not the least an individual wiil feel comfort while travelling in a car .
