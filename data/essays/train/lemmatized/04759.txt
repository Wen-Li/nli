i am not sure about this statement . i would say it depends on the focus you put on your life . i will start with the business part and illustrate that with a few example of my life . i am studying english and politics at the university of wuerzburg . in the english subject it is very important to know all the specific term for word of the subject . you have to be very into literature , culture and history of the country where english is spoken . mainly of course such country a the united states and great britain . in my other subject , politics , i have to read a daily newspaper and to know what is going on in the world . thus , you see i need a broad knowledge of daily life . but i also have to be specialized in my subject , i have to know various political system for example and i need to have information about political regime and history of country others surely do not know . . for my career i need to be specialized in mz subject , but also have to have some broad knowledge of other academic subject . for example if i talk in a presentation about the political situation in iraq i should also know at least where iraq is geographically . whereas in social life it is better to have a broad knowledge than to have the focus only on your specific subjetc . i give you an example : as a student you sometimes get an invitation to a party . it can easily happen that you get in contact with unknown person . in order to get a conversation started you should have a topic you can talk about . this topic should be something your partner can easily get into . if you want to avoid a boring converstaion about the weather it is better to have some knowledge about something else . nowadays manz people go to television game show , there it is also important to have a broad knowledge , if you want to win a lot of money . in the end i think i can say , that it is important to to have both if you want to be sucsessful in life , wether it in the private sector or in the business one .
