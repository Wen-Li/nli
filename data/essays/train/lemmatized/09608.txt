i think the issue posed here is actually a combination of two extreme . the very purpouse of all the human activity is the quest for knowledge . right from the ancient time , man 's quest for knowledge ha taken him to many ` until-then-undiscovered ' realm of priceless information or knowledge . so `` knowledge '' a the word indicates can be interpreted a knowing till the edge . but gathering information or collecting detail of every aspect and working of this world is no le than a ` herculean ' task . every person ha a particular field of interest or an area of interest where in , the more he study about it the more he enjoys . so one can explore joy in knowing more about what he like or what interest him . this is nothing but specialisation . it actually satisfies the inner desire of a person to know more about the thing or concept he like to it completeness . on the other hand , having a deep understanding of only one subject or one concept without knowing anything about the other area might cripple a person in this ` oh-so-tough ' competitive world . every person ha to have a basic knowledge about vast subject area and field . lets take a simple example of a modern day science professor . lets say that he teach physic to the fullest he know and surprisingly if he hate the subject mathematics he might be losing the race over the others . because . mathematics is the language in which physical principle are expressed and if he doe not keep his mind open to the new theory or principle being invented or discovered in the area of mathematics he will be missing a chance to express his physical principle in a more effective way to the student . so having a broad knowledge of many subject area than specialize in one subject will definitely give an edge to every person in today world . ` knowledge is wealth and it is good to have many varieties of wealth ''
