some people want to be a successful person . however , other people do not try to be a perfect person . just , they feel shy by themselves a seeing and respect . i think that some people who want to get goal can become a successful person . whereas , other people who do not practice to be a good person would live usual life . so , i agree with that '' successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . while i am living in present time , i have never seen people who do not want to be a wonderful person . as developing in socity , most people always pursue to get success from their degree . and konwledge continuously keep going on changing for fitting in new thing . also we have to chang mind from old thinking to new one . for example , we can see bill gate who is richman a employment of computer company . he constantly try to develope software or hardware until now . even thoug he ha big house and ha been became riceman , he never give up in his business and always concentrate on fousing how to make a special product . althogh he experienced failure , took risk in a whole part of his life or he already konw how to do well , he try to do rather than another employment of computer company . therefor , he can do anything and then he can keep his work in top of firm . i like him because
