although i understand the comfort of own car driving , i support the statement that there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are several reason why i feel this is right . first , we know how many people are getting the disease like cancer and so many respiratory disease from the pollution delivered from the vehicle , car especially . in addition to causing dangerous disease , the use of car also spoil the greenary of environment . furthermore this pollution from the car may lead to green house effect . by considering above reason the people may reduce the use of car in coming twenty year . second , the cost of fuel for the car is trying to kiss the sky . normal people are too eligible to use car . in addition , the natural resource like petrol and diesel are getting diminished in the earth . this may result in avoiding of usage of car like vehicle which consume petrol and diesel . to increase the alternate for petrol and diesel people may have to grow natural bio plant which will replace the normal petrol and diesel . by using natural resource we may improve the availability of source , in contrast it may decrese the efficiency of car . this may result in decresing the usage of car in the future . another reason i can give is that with the increasing technology scientist may invent new technique with which people can fly with their own hand . they may invent flying machine with which a group of people can travel at a time like a comfortable a in the car without any cost . morover this type of invention will reduce the pollution problem that we have now like sound pollution and air pollution . in addition to that it not only prevents accident but also the life style of future citizen . in my opinion , when technology is increasing it will definately replace a fault thing with a new thing which will be more effective than older one . in the same way the usage of number of car will decreas with the replacement of new technology .
