some people may think that younger people enjoy their life more than old people , whereas other people might find the elder part of life more joyful . mainly because youth in our hedonistic society on the eve of capitalism is often seen a the ultimate good , most people may tend to agree with the first opinion . on tv , in the newspaper the fun that young people have is shown . not just the so - called star of hollywood or elsewhere try to stay forever young , is it through fashion or the benefit of plastic surgery . so after all , there must be something about it . and , yes , it is definitely fun to be young . your body is healthy and maybe beatiful , you are free and everything is new and exiting , the book of life is not written yet , everything seems within your reach . so youth is , frankly said , a wonderful thing . but the problem is , that in a society where youth seems to be all , being old seems to be the odd counterpart . who want to think about being old , not able to move properly , maybe dependend on medicine and not able to think in new way ? but in my opinion , their can be certain benefit in the later age , too . you maybe have a lovely wife or husband and a familie that give you all the fulfilment you have dreamt of when you whre still young . whereas youth can be a big struggle in the dark , the age brings the advantage of experience with it . furthermore one can maybe afford nice thing like big sport car , house in the provence or younger woman young men just could dream of . so after all i think that both age could be great fun , it certainly depends on your personal situation and the personal idea about every age . according to this a pure culture of youth is doubtlessly a mislead in cultural development , especially regarding to the demographic change that will turn u soon into a society of elder people .
