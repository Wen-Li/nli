young people and older people do not have the same point of view of the life . they can not enjoy the life in the same way . i do think that it is not a question of the age . in this essay , i will try to explain why i believe that young people could enjoy life more than older people do and vice versa . first of all , i would like to say that you can not do a '' generalisation '' . there are , in this world , happiness and sadness . on the one hand , they are young people who live it up and young people who are very sad and do not enjoy their life . on the other hand , there are old people who enjoy their life and others who do not . for example , my grand father , he ha worked all his life . he ha found a company and he ha spent forty year to build this company . he never went on holyday with his son and his wife . he wa a kind of workalcoholic . he started to enjoy his life at sixty . now , he is very happy . in this rapidly changing world , money is related to happiness and unfortunately all people do not have enough money to live . i really do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do because it depends on much more thing . there are money but also the health , the environment where you grow up , where you spend your childhood , your condition of life , your family life , your job and social life and so on . personally , it is for me incredible to think that . even if you have 80 you can live it up and enjoy your life a young people do .
