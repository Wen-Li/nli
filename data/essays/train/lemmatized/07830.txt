younger and older people have differnt way to live their life but it seems to me that younger people can enjoy their way of living more than older people can . that is why i agree with the the statment . on reason is , that i think that young people are more unconscious than older peolpe and that is why they are more free in taking advantage of what is going on in front of them . for example if hey have the opportunity to go and visit a friend in another country they often do not thing how hard it is to go there . they just take a few thing and try to reach their friend place , maybe by hitch hiking . this mostly differes from the behaviour of older people , which often have to plan thing in a really organized way . and often have all this thouhgts like is this the right moment in my life , what about my job . .. this feel like , that young people have a big amount of freedom to act however they want a other reason why young people can enjoy their life more is , that they do not have the same amount of responsibillities like older people . they do not have child to look for . they can go to a party the whole night long without having lot of stress the next day . they only need to go to school . young people often are more healthy then older people , so they can do a lot of thing older people can not do , for example extrem - sport according to all the other reasonable thing about this topic i would think , that the main point why young people enjoy life betteris , that they still have freedom to choose what they want to do , without beeing trapped in an adult life .
