i agree with the statement , that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . industries only want to sell their product . especially in tv advertisments the marketing director of a company only want to show , how positive the product is and that everybody need it at home . first of all , company want to sell . they want to earn money . that is why they exist . what people really need is not nescessary for them . they only want custumers to buy their own product . the second point is , that tv ads only show how positive a product is . negative thing , like high rated prize are often not in the advertisments . companies onlzx show how positiv a product is . thez also sell dream . for example : ten naked girl running on a beach on a boy , who look ugly and ha the product in his hand . today that is a normal tv spot . with the product of this specific company the ugly guy will get one of the girl for a date . the advertisment will tell me that , but that is just not the truth . companies want to sell dream , which have nothing to do with the truth . marketing director of company also want the customer to tell , that there is a product what they really need at home and for themselves . everthing in advertisments is positive . faced by this fact , it show that the product in tv spots should be better than they are in reality . the reality do not exist in advertisments . that is a fact . all that reason are important for me , why i agree with the statement , that advertisments make prducts seem much better than they really are . somebody who disagree ha no idea about company and their trick to sell the highest number of product , which are possible .
