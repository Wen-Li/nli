i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . these day , many young people are just playing around and some of them are even being obstacle to others . in my country , japan , the unemployed young people is being a serious problem . they are the people who never go outside and work . they often get food supply and hobby good from their parent . these people are surely not helping their community , since they just spend most of the time playing computer game . i have a friend that used to play a lot in childhood , but now that friend is staying in his house for all the day and doing nothing . that friend 's mother wa saying that it would be great if he get out from his room and start searching for job , since the family 's income is not sufficient . there is other case too . some young people in japan spend their time just running around their neighbourhood with their motorcycle , usually with a very noisy sound of that motorcycle . they can be very hostile and cause a lot of fight . by those fight , public property could be destroyed , or other people might get injured too . i got injured by those people last week . i wa just standing in the park , waiting for my friend , and those people came saying that the park is their place , so never enter . they punced me in face , and i wa badly injured . young people should be the one who help and develop their community , but it is not yet achieved in my country . i think those people who are being obstacle to others should stop harming other people or destroying public property at first . then gradually , they can be helping their community and could make it better .
