some people say that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . certainly , many company spend much money for advertisement because it may have much effect on the sale increase . but , personally , i think many user are getting wiser to find out that many product are not necessarily a good a they are promoted in the advertisement . therefore , i do n't agree that most product seem much better than they really are . my primary reason is that we have become wise to find out whether the product are really good or not despite of the advertisement . recently , we often hear the news that people were deceived by the false advertisement and paid much money for the worthless product . for example , where i lived , japan , cosmetic surgery is very popular among young woman generation . however , i have read the article that many woman suffered damage by cosmetic surgery although they paid high price for it . many advertisement of cosmetic surgery describe only the good effect and doe n't mention the possibility of bad supplementle effect after surgery . as a result of these bad news , woman tend to cast a doubt on the advertisement and investigate the hospital enough before paying money . as a result , many private hospital which provided bad treatment is suffering from the loss of customer . the another reason is that some advertisement exaggerate the product too much and they do n't seem the product much better than they are . for example , in japan , we often see the advertisement of english school or material for studying english . some of them say that we could master english if we go to school for 10 day . who belief such an advertisement ? i think some advertisement using unrealistic word too much doe not look the product well . in conclusion , i do n't think most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . we have learned that we should not believe what advertisement say without having a doubt on it .
