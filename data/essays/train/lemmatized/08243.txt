the comparison between the life of two different generation is always difficult , but it is possible to find reason enough for living in both age . i think , that the youth ha more advantage . first there are physical parameter , such a the use of muscle , which allows young people to do much more than older people . furthermore older people have usually more deseases and are not strong enough to do what ever they want to do . another interesting point is the way of thinking . young people have not to think about money or insurance . they have their mother , who buy the food , clean their room and their clothes . the only problem for people at this age could be possibly the school , but it weight le if i think about older people , who have to get job . older people have to think about money every day because their responsability for their family is extraordinary . a third point is the possability for adult to make what they want . for example they can study what thezbuy what they want . simply they have much more choice than younger people . finally if i could choose , i would like to be young because i like it to do some activity , which i can not do when i become older .
