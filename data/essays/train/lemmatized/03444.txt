most people usually tend to tell the fact without having explained the idea and the concept . this would have a worst impact on student . i think it is wrongly done and it would be a lot more important for student to understand idea and concept than it would be for them to learn the fact . it is so for many reason : le genius in the world , a non evolution of the world and the promotion of a non democratic system . by learning fact , the student will never gain a lot . they do not really understand , they will certainly know what they are said , will memorize it , but will never understand why is that , making them foolishes or machine with no brain . it would even be harder for him to memorize the fact . but on the other hand , if he understands the idea and the concept , he would be able to get to the fact on his own , without having to memrize them , perfectly knowing what is going on . understanding these concept and idea , the student work his brain and can even think of something new and way better . this is how the world grows and expands and the evolution go . the student will also learn how to work on his own , express hiself , his opinion and contribute to the development of a stronger and powerful society . if they just learn the fact , it mean that only one or a few person will know the reason , giving him or them the entire power over the others , the ability to make decision a he want , even if they are wrong or should not be done . i strongly agree with those who think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . we will build a more effective world that way , and promote the world solidarity .
