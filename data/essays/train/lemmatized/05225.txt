hana tour , uri tour . .. they are the platcard that we can see easily around u . you will think go to to travel in goup led by a tour guide look great idea . but what i want to say here is that method is not a best way . best wayto travel is go to trip not with a tourguide . that cause more fun and give you unforgartable memory . do you actually think go trip with guide is fun ? the answer is no . if you travel with out tour guide , then you can go to anywhere you want . with tourguide , you have to follow the skedule , and be more careful to your behabiors not to behave badly to others . and the worst thing is that tour guide even instruct the time of resting . like `` 10 minute ! '' or `` 1hour ! '' . we ca n't rest enough or do what ever we want with a tourguide . maybe we will learn more and get some extra-knowledge but remember that we can know it easily from book or other source like computer or tv . it 's sure that you will get charming memory by traveling with out tourguide . with tour guide , you have to do what he or her instructed . it 's right that there are low percentage of accident like losting , when you go trip with tour guide , but think diffrently , it can be a one source of experience . an accident , meeting ... in my case , when i wa traveling with my family , not a tourguide , we made a friend in the who live in other country . i still communicate with them nowadays too . they helped me a lot in many thing . but when i travel with tourguide , i do n't enjoy trip much . lie down on the snow for long time is lomantic thing , but you ca n't even dream it with tourguide . you will also feel bad or tired , but long time later , that memory will be unforgatable in you mind , that can tell to the other people you know . having fun and precious memory is really need in traveling . with out tourguide , sometime even annoying , you can enjoy the real point of trip . peoples , let 's packed the bag and go to trip where we can refresh ourselves ! : d
