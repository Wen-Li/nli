personally i agree with the statement that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . there are three amin reason for saying so . first , becuase they are young , they are physicaly tough and healtheir than older people . they can enjoy physical sport such a soccer , futball , etc . on the other hand old people have le stamen and they will have to stop even if thy want to go on . their joint , bone and musles are weaker , causing injury . this will stop them from most of the sport that they like and enjoyed when they were young . so they wil think back to the day when they were young and feel that they would like to go back to that day . secondly , younger people have better looking than older people . as we get old , our skin will be not smooth , there will be le hair , etc . so they even enjoy thereselves , their own looking , but once they are old they will not be satified by their own look . their wife or husband will look hansome or beautiful when they are young . this might not be true for everyone , but partner will look at each other and think he/she are not good looking a he/she wa / this now-days lead to a devorse of couple . the number couple devorsing when they get to middle age is increasing . that question whether they married to each other becuase they loved the partner of loved the look of partner . finally , there will be more friend when people are young . i might sound too realistic , but a people get old they pas away and there will be le people that you know of . my grandparets are saying that in every class union , there will be le people . either they are physically unable to attend or they had passed away . this is similar to the fact that there will be le friend , but also there will be le family member or relative . so they will feel lonely and left out when all the family member and close relative are gone . i might be able to come up with more reason , but i will stop here . it sound just too sad to talk about it . i will be old some day and i am getting older every year , although i am still young . i heard from some people that they want to die before they get really old , becuase they can not `` live '' with the situation that they would be in when they are old . i hope that this is not teh way i should be . i hope i will be able to enjoy my life a much a i am enjoying now . as long a god keep me alive , i will thank him and live my life following his word . i think that not enjoying the life or even feel like want to die , is an act of cursing god . i am a christian , so i want to be able to thank god and enjoy anytime . but i have to admit that i would enjoy better if i am young . i really love sport , so i would really miss playing soccer , tennis , table tennis , badminton , etc . well i got a bit off the road but this is how i think about the topic . so from these reason , i agree that young people enjoy life more than older peopld do .
