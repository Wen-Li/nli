before starting this argument , i would like to define the term `` successful '' a a achievement of what he/she want to do . '' . based on the definition determined above , i would agree with the statement due to the two reason . first , people who try new thing basically know what he/she really want to do and have a strong will to achieve it . generally , for most people , finding what he/she want to do is very difficult and people who are doing what they already know how to do well tend to have a hard time with this process or stop thinking about it . for example , i have been working a an auditor for more than 5 year and i know what i am doing well . although , the salary increase and i work more easily because of the experience recently , i doubt if i am doing what i really want to do and to achieve . the people who are trying new thing have already gotton over this question to themselves and is in at next stage . second , people how are doing new thing are taking risk at the same time . for example , a i mentioned in prior paragraph , i have been an auditor for 5 year and am working a a manger now . if i decided to leave my firm and to start new career in different company , i might have to start my career a a staff again . taking this kind or riks is very difficult for most people . i respect their brave in conclusion , based on the reason mentioned above , i strongly agree with the statement .
