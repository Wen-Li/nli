the question whether young people enjoy life more than the older generation . it is an intriguing question . a one might feel that the energetic young people , are more likely to have enjoyable experience compared to the senile old people . however i completely disagree with the statement and feel that enjoyment in life is not constrained by age . for one reason i beleive that age ha no bearing on the good moment in life is when i see an old person jogging around merrily in the park compared to a young guy suffering from lung disorder , admitted in the hodpital , resulting from smoking . the younger generation could be sometimes be too careless and headlong in their approach towards life a compared to the old and mature folk . the young people believe that they should go for everything they feel will give them pleasure and live every moment to the fullest . in doing that they present an outer picture of joy happiness but it could not be so good afterall . ok let talk about sport , ever wondered about the young player on the field and the older retired player sitting in the commentary box describing every action of the game . does n't the game give the same amount of pleasure to both on field , young player and off field old guy who are thrilled and nostalgic of their time . can we qantify their enjoyment ? , we cant . each of u enjoy in a different way . the older people have much more experience and lesson from their life which they can share with their friend and childrens . i agree an old man cant race his motorbike or overspeed , the popular source of fun for the younger generation , but doesnt an old man enjoy playing with his grandson or teaching him a game of chess , or riding a bicycle . cant he reflect upon the achievement of his life and feel contented . its a matter of how we take life and cherish it moment . finally , its not about age , enjoyment in life is solely about our approach towards life , for some people life begin at forty . i have seen so many old aged convivial gourmet who still enjoy tasting the wine and educating the younger people about the various wine . its just one simple example which depicts that age doesnt restrict enjoyment . i ultimately beleive that enjoyment in life transcends the boundary set by factor like age or health . senility could be a period of tremendous fun and enjoyment . young or old joy , is knocking our door , we need to open the door .
