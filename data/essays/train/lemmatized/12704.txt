it is true that nowadays , school give out more work for student to do . and most of the student are packed with school work that they do not have spare time to do other thing . even though it is true , i still believe young people are putting enough time to help their community . as for my school , an average student spend about four to five hour on their homework , and it depends on the level of the difficulty of the course they took . but , even though our homework take up a great time , many student from my school still work for community service . my school end at 3 pm everyday , but we have activity that is offer after school , such a community service . and most of the student are `` forced '' to do community service . there 's no rule set on the minimum hour worked per year , but for those people who wish to get into good college , would do community service everyday . because we know , college care about community service . of course , there are people who help out in their community just because of their interest . you might ask , `` why would people enjoy doing community service when there are better alternative such a watching movie and chilling out with your friend ? '' the reason you would have asked the question is because you have not found a community service that you can enjoy doing . i have been persistantly going to leprosy home everyweek . i worked about seventy hour every year . college application might be one of the reason i visit there , but the main reason that keep me spending so much time there is because of the resident there . even though most of the resident had never gone to school before , there 're thing that i can learn from them , such a , the way to live and look at your life . they are disabled , and they have been through all sort of difficulty , and while chatting with them , they 'll share their story of how they 'd gone through all the difficulty . and that 's why there are people who enjoy helping out the community - they learn many thing that they do n't usually learn from school . may be , around the world , young people do not give enough time helping their community . but from the environment i live in , i see people doing community almost everyday . some of them might be forced by their parent or college application , but those people are still the same a those who do community with interest . either way , people are helping out the community . and i think putting an extra two hour everyday on top of the five hour homework is a decent amount of time to put into the community .
