i totally agree with this statement . i 'm really convinced that having a widespread knowledge of many different subject is better than specializing on just one of them because of several reason . first of all , since i 'm not sure of where i 'm going to be or what i 'm going to do in the near future i 'd rather prefer to have many choice in front of me , many path to run instead of focusing on just one way that maybe could even be the wrong one . acting like this i will get ready and prepared to take any valuable opportunity aroused along my personal scholastic journey . in addition to this , i think that specializing on only one topic would be more boring and annoying than approaching different type of subject . in spite of opening and studying every day the same book and the same lecture i believe that daily shift from one subject to another could make your life more appealing , still keeping the chance to drop the course which do n't match your initial expectation . finally the most important reason , my personal thirst of knowledge . since i wa a child i used to read any kind of book , to watch any type of program and to observe everything that could strike my attention so i would really love having at my disposal a broad experience and knowledge in order to say my opinion in each context . i want to be a person ready to explain my belief wherever i am , whatever i `` m talking about without feeling uncomfortable or inappropriate . hope to be like this . ..
