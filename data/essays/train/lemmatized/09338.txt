no , i wont agree with the statement , in my opinion just simply knowing and understanding idea and cocepts is not sufficient knowing the fact is very important , just simply knowing concept doesnot help in all case , knowing the fact about the thing is very important then only we can know wheather the thing which we understood are correct or not . in some case without know the fact we can not come to the conclusion . fact should be known . there is a chance of getting misleaded simply by understanding concept and agreeing the thing , in such case fact are very useful fact are real thing which we can see or taste . simply uderstanding the concept will help the student upto some extent only that mean upto exam only , but in case of kowing the fact it will be helpful in future when the same problem repeat in future . the concept are those that are simply printed in the book or said by the professor in the colleages but fact are those which we see directly in the lab or in daily life . for example if we take an experiment in a lab if we do it by ourself and the both if the expected and the result match then we can say that the experiment ha passed . other wise simply listening to the professor about the experiment may or may not give the expected result , there aries lot of doubt , therefore after once if we perform the experiment there is no chance of getting doubt in the whole life time about that experiment . at some extent understanding is enough but in all case it wont work . especially in work of get importance such a civil engineering work , mechanical work doing the test personally and knowing all the fact about all the product and material only the work can be completed successfully . understanding the concept are useful upto the exam point of view , after that we may forget them but about knowing fact they wont never be fogetted . this is how knowing fact is important when compared to understanding fact and performing them .
