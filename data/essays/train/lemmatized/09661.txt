i partially agree with the statement that either understanding the idea and concept is importent or to learn the fact . because every thing in our life cant be understand through the idea and concept that which it neede more creative mind . firstly when we talk about the idea and concept these some time easy to understan but some time very typical to understan . and this also depends on the type of the mind that the student ha . and understanding idea and concept also depends on the way how we have brought in our life . because if a student is restricted to certain thing in his childhood then he cant have a creative mind . and if there is every thing understood through the idea then there will be more number of scientist than the normal person on the earth . and the other thing we have to talk about is learn fact that is learning through the experience . and every thing cant be experienced because if we think wearing helmet can implemented after facing any problen then it just like taking chance in our life . and every thin cant be learned through the fact becayse every thing cant be a fact in our life . because it is difficult to get every thing a a fact . and if we wait for a fact to be happened in our life then our life will be completing just for learning and not for implementing those which we have learned . and the importent thing is understandind idea and concept give the sharpness to our mind a we go on understanding them but there are some concept which cant be understan through idea but we can undertand them through the fact , thus there is the need of fact . and learning thing through the fact is a good thing that which improves our practical knowledge . but every thing cant be a fact so it is good to learn them from the idea and concept . and the reproduction of the plantsa and animalas can be well understan through the fact .
