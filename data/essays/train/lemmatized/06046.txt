i agree with the statement that most advertisemens make poeple to think those product are much better than what they are . in these day , we can see the advertisement on the tv about the game . most of elementary , junior high school , and high school student have a game machine in their house . advertisement give an idea that those game really nice and fun , but in reality , they play with that game no longer than three month . moreover , people spend too much time on the game than school work , which cause the problem that student do not do their homework at home . furthermore , when we see the advertisement of drink and sweet , we go buy it , because they are advertising a it will take away our thirstyness and hungry . in reality , it is not healthy and it will cause more damage in our body . which can be very harsh for patient who stay in their home with out doctor and nurse . in my case , i saw a advertisement on the shopping mall about the jean that is really comfortable and cheap . i had no doubt about it because it wa very famous company , so i believed what they were saying . whein i bought and brought my house , it wa n't that pretty that i expected and it wa n't comfortable than what i thought . i thought that i just should keep for the future , but then i changed my mind to return it . when i brought that jean to the mall , they said , it not refundable . i told them that there is no sign about return policy , but it wa on the pomplet that i saw before i buy the jean . they put a statement that all sale product are not refundable with small font . i could n't believe that they did n't put that policy in the front of the pomplet with little bigger font . most advertisement ca n't be trusted because they are advertising their product to make more money and profit .
