the question ha been asked whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept or for them to learn fact . in my opinion , understanding is definatly more important because it give the student a progress of exploring , a chance to be creative and an unforgetable result . trying to understand idea and concept of a topic alows student to go through the investing process . for example , telling student that literacy device such a metaphor , similies and imagery make writing good is not really convincing . instead , it would be better to let the student explore through different type of literture and found out themselves that certain technique add to the porfessioness of writing . understand how they work would give student a better lesson . getting the concept and idea also provides student a chance to be creative , especially when dealing with are . what kind of art class whould it be without studio work ? students should be offered to get creative with colour , texture , mood and all sort of thing . who care if they fail once in a while ? new creation found in the process of real understanding . years after year , it is not the defination that student remember , but the unforgetable experience that they learned . giving out the fact doe not provide student a lot of thoughs of their own . by understanding the idea and concept , student gained the ability to conclude the fact themselves . even if they forget about the fact , they would be able to `` reproduce '' them . facts is the devil that limited imagination and understanding . thomas edison woulding be able to invest without knowing the idea and concept of science very well .
