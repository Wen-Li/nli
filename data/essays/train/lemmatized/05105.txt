is it more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact ? by learning fact it is possible for the student to get access to lot of information . huge topic and their content can be passed in a minimum of time . but certainly the student will forget a lot of information a fast a they have just learned them . if student have mainly to understand the idea and concept of a theme they need more time to pas the same quantity of information but they do realy know it and will not forget it a quickly a they do if they would just learn it without understanding . so both side ha their positive and negative argument . the quantity of information on the one hand , the long time argument on the other hand . is it better to have a lot of information in your brain you do not realy understand or would you be better of with some information you can handle and understand ? well , the best way is surely the intermediate way . every student ha to find his balance between learning fact and understanding idea . there are certain thing you do have to know but do not need to explain and the other way around . if you study science for example you have to learn a lot of fact and there is no chance you will ever understand all of them . the topic are just to huge and for instant every process you learn is so complex that it is just not possible to fully understand it . so one should not concentrating on just understanding idea ( this would take a lifetime ) neither one should just learn fact . you would not know what to do with them . it is just dangerous because if you do not know what you do and something occurs what you have not learned , you are helpless . referring for the question of the essay , there is no `` more important '' . it is a important to learn fact a to understand idea and concept . if student go to an extrem they will find out that this doe not work . today society is complex , the human nature and a lot of process are complex too . if you study you try get in to a certain topic , a topic which is also complex . just if learning and understanding are combined in balance a student can be long time successfull .
