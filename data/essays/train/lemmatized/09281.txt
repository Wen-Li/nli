i believe this statement is true , but i would rather blame the community or the society than the youth . our society have gone through lot of change in the last century . in the past , the society of the middle age wa built around the community and the village and further the basic family , which is the father , the mother and the child . there wa no need to leave the house , unless mariage , and the school wa mostly for the wealthy . this type of organisation made it easy , and essential , for the community and especially the youngest to work hand in hand for the community , for instance on the field , because the life of the all the community relied on the amount and the quality of crop . and also because the yougest had no choice than to work for the community in order to securize their own existence . the society of the 21st century is pretty much different from that picture . the young from the age of 3 or 4 to the age of 22 or 23 ha to go to school in order to learn a profession and find his place in the society . as soon a you got a job , the security you were obtaining through the middle age community in the past , is all gained through your salary . the today world ha become very oriented on the person itself , and not so much on the community . people raise their child alone , go to work and come back at evening and prepare for the same ritual the next day . commercials appearing all the time on television or radio send clear message `` goods for your personal need '' a a person . the sense of community ha almost disappeared from the screen . another factor to the discharge of the youth of today , is the lack of time . talking about school or workplace , thing have to be done more efficiently in a shorter period of time . so it become more difficult for people to concentrate on the problem of the others . that reaction is exactly the one of the youth of today , which should n't be blamed but the society we are living in .
