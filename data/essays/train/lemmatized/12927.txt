travel is an excellent opportunity to know different culture and also , is an opportunity to enjoy the life in different perspective that your habitual life . in addition , travelling allows u to know a different people , habit and then different point of view . although traveling with a group led by a tour guide could be an excellent option to enjoy and relax , i prefer travel by myself with my family or friend . this is for several reason . first , when you travel by yourself , you can decide the place that you want to visit , the time that you want to spend in each place , and the most important point you can save a lot of money . for example , the last year when i traveled to europe with my friend and my boyfriend , it wa really enjoyable because we decided everything about our trip . so , in only one month we visited eight different country and it wa unexpensive . second , travelling by yourself allows you to realize that you are able to do anything . when you are travelling without guide , you have to be carefully if you do not want to lose . in this case , this kind of trip help u to be self-confidence in yourself , and to be open to ask to any person and then to meet a people from different country . spending time with your friend or family , saving money and deciding all about place and time are my reason to think that the best way to travel is by yourself .
