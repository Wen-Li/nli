cars are indispensible for our life since they are used very commonly and since they facilitate our transportation to high extent . even though this statement is a fact , some people still think that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year time . what i think is just the opposite due to two reason . the first reason is that the technology in twentieth century is improving very fastly that might lead to a decrease in the price of car . as most people experince from computer world , when something new is introduced into the market , the older one get cheaper and more people can have the opportunity to buy the older one . i think same situation is also valid for car . since many company are working on providing car with superior quality , the price of some old car , still with really good property , will decline and therefore more people will be able to afford to buy a car . the second reason is that there are many research going on the development of alternative energy source for transport other than petrolium , which might provide cheaper fuel for car . as most of you know , nowadays many car are run on natural gas instead of petrolium making the travel expense much cheaper . this already lead to the increase in the use of car a i observed . since the fuel is becoming cheaper , people reluctant to buy car since they do not want to pay huge amount of money for driving will change their mind . furthermore , some hopeful research is also going on about the use of hydrogen in transportation vehicle which might even further decrease the price of the fuel since it is really an abundant element in the world . in conclusion , due to some technological advance in car production market and hopeful research about alternative energy source such a hydrogen for vehicle , which will lead a decline in the price of both the car and the fuel , people will tend to buy more car in near future .
