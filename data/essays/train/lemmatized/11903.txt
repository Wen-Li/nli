i think it 's better to specialize in one specific subject than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . today we find a job world that doe n't wait our study , our training . graduates are much more than in the ` 90 , and afterall they are more younger , the challenge in these term are very strong . the industry , the company , ... the job world mark point on these : your skill have to be more stronger than a while . we study to find a good job , remunerative and , anyway , that turn back award . because of this , if all of we have broad knowledge of many academic subject ( who better of others , that 's clarify ) , we certainly have more problem to find the dream ' job . in spite of this , if somebody ha a specialistic skill , maybe he 'll find le work announces that respond to his qualifing , but surely he wo n't challenge , such a others with a widespread standard knowledge , too hard to obtain that work . i 'm an `` almost engineer '' , i see every day on the newspaper , on tv , at my university how hard is today find worthy people : too many people have to broad knowledge of many academic subject , too many people have to challenge on the same job . this is my personal opinion on this stateme
