i do agree on the statement that young people nowadays do not give enought time to helping their community . i would saz the word nowadays could be taken out . i can tell you from my personal expierience that this is not a new story . i wa a well not a good kid in regard of helping our community . i always had the feeling that i do not have enough time to help . when i came home from school , i did my homework and than i went to my sport class . i just wa part of the group and went home again . i also wanted to spend time for doing nothing and just relax a little bit . there wa not enough time to do something else . now i know that this is not true , a a kid you have a lot of time to do something for your community . i did only realize this when i began to work and i saw that i will have not that much time in future . i think the young people have the same problem a i had . they would like to spend their time for something more important for themselves . they do not realize that helping others would bring any benefit for them . therefore it is not only the fault of the young people that they do not taking some time to spend with their community , it is a well a problem of communication due to the fact that only adult could communicate from their own experience , it is their responsibility to take action . parents and teacher should talk the ownership on this and get the young people up to speed . if the parent would explain how important the community will be for the future of their kid . there will be more interaction with the community alrady . teacher should raise this issue in their school and maybe implement some community activity in their schedule . so that all kid could learn more about their community and see by themselves that it is an important thing , so they will continue to participate in future activity . in conclusion , i would like to make the clear statement that everybody is responsible to help our community and we should not pointing with the finger to others .
