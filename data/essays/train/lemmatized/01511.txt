generally speaking , advertisement make product attractive and desirable . let me start from scratch , what is the point of an advertisement ? it is of course to make sell . and why would someone buy an object if it seems useless and uneffective ? as a result , advertisment naturally try to make a product look interesting . it is true that consequently , advertisement sometimes make a product seem much better than it really is . sometimes advertisement lie . yet it is not necessarily in it own interest to lie to consumer since they are not so stupid , and once a consumer find out that he had been betrayed , he will not buy the product of the advertisement anymore . it might get even worst : the betrayed consumer may not buy any other product of this company . that is why , advertisement must be careful about what they are claiming , and they ought to win the consumer 's trust by simply telling him what the true advantage of such or such product are . yet , it is also true that advertisement tends to emphasize the pro of an object and to hide it disadvantage . this is the implicit rule of business . unfortunatly , in occidental society this rule is a general principle . one can not avoid it . so one must not be gullible . for these reason , i am not shocked by advertisement even if they are false . one must simply be careful and read magazine about product that he want to acquire . besides , i believe that advertisement is a everyday enjoyment . it is part of our life , and i do think that they are some advertisement that are very well done and that are very enjoyable , even if they lie a little . i prefer an intersesting but lying commercial than a realistic boring one . anywaym the main goal of advertisement is to ; ake a product known right ? and what is ; ore striking that a beautiful advertisement ?
