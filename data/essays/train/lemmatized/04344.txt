there are two type of successful people i think : the first one is the person , who reached the success with the own force . this kind of successfully person is intelligent , quick , know the meaning of the word ` work '' , all that he/she ha it have been earned from him/her , so he/she know exactely how to do the job or how to behave in varies occasion . for this reason i do n't agree with the statement because i think this kind of person will surely try new thing or take some risk to reach what he/she want to or to improve in his/her job , because he/she is sure , competent and respectable . however in my mind ther 's another kind of succesful people , those who reached the success because this success ha been gifted to they . in this case the person ha not the quality to be a successful person because he/she did n't work hard to reach his/her life 's purpose , he/she doe n't konw how to work well or how to behave in some kind of circumstance and first of all ther 's the risk that the success can have a too big weight for he/she and this kind of people could crash down . i think they would never take into account to take a risk or triyng new thing , because they know that in case of a big problem they would n't know how to solve it . they would of course look for the help of other people . because of those reason i agree and disagree with the statement in the same time . all that concern the choice of a person depend on so many thing like character , ability , past and also a little bit of luck .
