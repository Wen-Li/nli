it is natural that a student studying harder can get higher grade than others . however , if he dose n't study efficiently , he will not get a result a he expects . i firmly believe that understanding idea and concept is more important than learning fact . this is not only because student need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible source on the internet reduced the necessity of learning fact themselves . to begin with , student need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful , for example , most subject in school require logical thinking rather than memorizing fact . when i wa in high school , i wa one of the book worm . however , my grade wa not improved a much a i studied . at the freshman year , i did n't know the reason but i became to know the reason after i met my freind , james , in the second year . he always tried to understand the idea and concept so that he studied very efficiently and got better grade than me . on top of that , i think people who can understand idea and concept are also love in society because they can solve problem quickly . to be sucessful student try to understand the idea and concept secondly , variouse accessible source on the internet reduced the neccesity of learning fact themselves . to be specific , in the time when people had difficulty finding information , people depended on their memory a lot . however , now people can access internet to gather general information a much a they want . this mean people do not need to memorize general thing . in conclusion , i believe that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . this is not only because student need to have logical thinking to get a good grade and to be successful but because various accessible source on the internet reduced the necessity of learning fact themselves .
