doubtless invention were and are still the motor of the developement of mankind . what would the world look like without fire , wheel or iron ? inventions are made by people who try new thing or improve thing . but despite all positive effecs also danger have to be considered . today the know how of many firm is their most valuable posession . if you invent something and get a patent for it you might become wealthy because everybody who want to use your idea ha to pay for that . moreover the history teach u , that knowledge can determine about winning or loosing war . just think of gun powder and fire arm which led to success in war at the end of the middle age or the famous enigma-machine in the second world war . but invention are not the only form of trying somthing new . a famous saying say : `` there is nothing that ca n't be improved ! '' for example if you have already working marketing strategy ; why not try something new ? perhaps new one might be more successfull and you will b able to sell more good . a friend of mine worked in china . he saw worker manufacturing something quite slowly because they combined it part in the wrong order . when he suggested to change the order they were afraid of trying something new and take the risk . so their output kept slow . in other word when you take the risk to try something new , you will be unique in a certain way , because nobody had done this before . this is a clear advantage in competition for instance between two company . but going along with that everybody shold be aware of the danger . for example when nuclear energy wa first used for building bomb . despite they were built to kill there wa another aspect some scientist were afraid of . they predicted that it might be possible that the heat of the detonation will initiate a chemical reaction which will completely burn the atmosphere . today we know better , but what would have happened if they were right ? better not to imagine ! in other word to discover new thing will nomally create advantage for people , firm and the whole mankind . but make shure that you know the danger and that you can handle them .
