the issue of wheather understand the idea and concept is more important than learn fact ha been a long time disputed . and people are entitled to opinion . from my point of view , i strongly side with the later group who belief learn fact are more inportant . there are number reason to support this , but in the following passage i will only present the major one . first of all , learnig the fact can let them to be a crativity learner . in this world , everything have two view side : right or wrong . tt is important for you to choose which way you will do . it is optional but sometims you have to follow the patten rule . along the time changing the patten is always changing . if student just understant the idea and concept escept the fact , they wil do not know change when they meet the new fact . so learn fact is more important . becuse it can let them thinking what it is , and what we will do . second of all , learning fact can gain more knowledge , when you know how to solve this problem you will also thinking whether this pattern can slove this kind of thing . if it can not so what we will do , we will ask ourselves or any other people . lao zi , a chinese psychologist , once said : there have a teacher in any three person . it mean that everbody have the thing that you need to learn , if we want to be a knowledge person we need to asks and get the help from other people . lastly , learning fact can you learn the communication ability , because when you learn the fact , you probably need to know more detail about the fact and you can disscuse and improve that you said it is correct , so you need to explain you idea to let other people know , it good for you to communicate and let you to be a welcome one to them . understant idea and concept can only let you be a receiver but learn the fact can help you be a scholar , you need to think to improve what you say and what you think , be a crative lea
