i do n't agree it is better to have board knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize one spesific subject because being specialize in many academic subject mean your attention divide to many academic subject . if everyone doe just his or her work well then every work would have a specialized person . being specialize in many subject mean your brain and your attention divide many adacemis subject . its harder to focus a lot of point than focus just one point . for example the student studying double major in universty and they have two exam for next day . they have to study both . then they can not study a much a their other friend . if they have enough potential to get good grade from both think about to they study just one exam . specializeing one spesific subject is mean you have enough time and enrgy to study about the think whick you are working on . but if you are triynig to study more than one spesific subject then you do n't have enough time to specialize a much a the one who specializes one spesific subject . i think if every one doe just their work well the world would be a better place to live . think about a person who is a engineer can he or she make a better construction than an architect . no . but also an architect can not do the think a good a the engineer doe . world ha a rule and everyone ha to do his or her own work and have to try to be specialize his or her own work . being specialized in a subject is allways better than being specialize in many subject because the one who specialized in many subject can not know a much a the think that the one who is specialized just one subject .
