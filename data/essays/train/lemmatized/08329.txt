of course yes , this is a really important part of graphic design , making the product look better than theyre really are , it almost the same with a model on the cover of a magazine , she doesnt look with something strange on his face , she will be always looking in a good shape , with a perfect teeth , perfect skin , perfect hair it all about fashion and image to make your product sell . the perfect example are the mcdonalds advertises , you always see a big burguer , looking so tasty and delicious , but theyre not , thats why all the people go to mcdonalds and get the bigmac that they saw on tv , expecting the biggest burguer ever and tehy just receive a small burguer like everyone else . i think that the cars are the only thing that look exactly like they look on tv , they cant show you something and offering another . at this moment , everything turn around graphic design , all those advertises on the street , on the tv , on the magazine , all to make the poeple buying your product because this is the goal that everybody who start a business want . another example could be the action figure that they look so great on tv with all those enemy all those weapon and all that battle field , and when you get your own you just get the character and you need to get the other item by separated . i bet those company sell a lot of toy every christmas , getting first a huge campaign for the tv and making the kid cry to they mom to make her buying toy every year . this is wha really happen with all of those product , everything it invloved , food , clothing , toy , care product , car , unfortunately we are going to still living in a world full of consumism .
