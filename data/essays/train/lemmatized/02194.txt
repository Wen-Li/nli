in my opinion i generally believe when people want to be successful in their life they have to try out new thing and take risk . i admit that some people can be also successful when their doing their thing in a way that they are familar with and going better in the future becaue of more routine and experience . however , in my view when you will be realy successful you must have the courage going risk and try something new for two reason changing the view how to do thing better and decreasing the procedure cost . first reason , doing thing in the same way can be very uneffective and it is better to change the procedure . in my job experience i have heard a lot the sentence : `` this have we always made in this particular way and it wa good so . '' however , sometimes a particuar work will stuck and nobody have the courage to change thing , because nobody will feel guilty for a failure of changing the workingsystem . second reason , changing the procedure of a particular job or decision can decline the cost in a company . for instance , to change the production department to an abroad country can be connected with some risk factor that could not predict but the company ha the change to decrease the production cost . the risk could be the emplyees in the foreign country since they work not so effective like the employee in the home country . all in all , when you be successful in your life and not want to stand still it is better to take the risk and take the change to thing in different way .
