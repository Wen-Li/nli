after industrial revolution , there wa a boost in the production of new staff all over the wold . the revolution not only increased the speed of the production but also it opened a way for the variation . however there should be another innoation to exhibit these new product . at this point the advertisement concept came onto the stage . the advertisement have been using for introducing new product to consumer starting from that time . they are doing a good job for introducing new product to u . however i agree that most of them intoduce product much better that they realy are . first reason why i agree with the statement is that these advertisement company should act in this way to be able to make profit which is the rule of capitalism world . the statemet is true in that these company should show the product desirable to get new job from the other company . however the introducton of new product in other way may result in disaster . for example , if one new food product is introduced a a healthy product , altough it is not a healthy product in real . this advertisement attempt would be resulted in death of a lot of people . the second reason is that the company may not have enough time and procedure to differentiate between the good one and bad one . as a result they try to show them in the best way . the technological innovation helped them a lot in this concept . however there should be division in these company to check the quality of productto be introduced . otherwise a i mentioned above the disaster for the human health would be unavoidable . in conlusion the advertisement usually show product better with the ignorance of human health .
