i completely agree with what the statement asserts . i believe that nowadays student are more and more concerned with their own interest and le preoccupied for their nearby people 's need . students only want to go out with their friend , amuse themselves and have a life without preoccupation and resposabilities . on my opinion this is caused by a society that is getting more and more selfish and because parent and goverments are permiting it . we live in world where people want to get their necessity fulfilled and these one are related more with personal and individual interest than with social interaction . personally , i think that people were more united before . they used to help when it wa necessary and they were taught to be attentive and co-operator with everybody . at the present time , student do n't have these moral or ideal and they do not feel that they must help their community necessity . that student nowadays do n't have enough time to carry out this kind of social labour it is not a reason , because student have never had so much time than ever . the problem is that tudents are getting more and more interested in playing videogames and other activity than helping their community . it also depends on the country you live . what i mean is that for instance , student do n't have the same responsabilities and duty in germany than in spain . spaniards do n't have to accomplish any social labour like helping handicap , invalid or aiding in government job like germans do . i think every government should entice his student to carry out miscellaneous labor by making up to them in any aspect . what i mean is that if student do n't feel the necessity or they just do n't feel attracted to helping their community the goverment should impose them a minimum social work requirement .
