young people can enjoy life more than older people do , i agree with this statement but it is not true in some case . the reason people who enjoy life in young age and old age . 1.they doesnt know the value of money . if they think how money come in life few support to enjoy and few them or not 2 . they feel that we cant enjoy if we become old but unfortunatly it is practically proved that it is true . for example im 24 year and my father is 45 year old he want to enjoy the life more than me and he have lot of money to enjoy the life more but he feel that he is not young . 3.it depends on the people mentality how they behave and how they want and how they like . but in my case i like to enjoy but i think about money . 4.some people have money and all but they are not intrested to spend time and money with friend and others . they think that there is no difference for enjoy ment in age . 5. few people those who follow with the latest tradition , culture they like to enjoy the life even though they are old . 6. in my personal opinion enyoing the life is depend on how we think about life enjoyment it is not related to age . 7. people who think life is very short they like to enjoy in young age . 8. people who are thinking about life experience they never like to enjoy life . 9. people enjoy in life in old age is my grand father he work and enjoys alot in young age and enjoy now in old age . 10. i feel my family is the best example for this . finally i concluded that eyoung people enjoy life more than older people do .
