yes , i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product much better than they really are . the nature of advertisement is to sell , be it a consumer product or a political message . in order to sell , advertisement often exhibit the following feature : first of all , advertisement often create an attractive image associated with the product to their consumer or their audience . advertisements , especially those tv ad with sound and picture , often present the product to consumer in a more appealing way . for example , an advertisement for nextle coffee in china . the tv ad ha several handsome young men and elegant young woman sipping coffee with a background soundover `` great flavor , great taste ! '' . people in china watched this ad unconsciously have the impression that cool , trendy , handsome people drink coffee . the sale of nextle coffee shot up after the ad . though tea is more popular in china , yet the attractive image presented in the ad lured many tea drinker to buy nextle coffee . they want to be associated with the trend . in this case , advertisement here add halo effect to the product . secondly , advertisement often use image leader to convey appealing message to their audience . for example , nike 's tv ad with michael jordon playing a basket ball accompanying the nike logo and `` just do it '' message is very tempting . people feel that wearing nike shoe , they can be more successful . it creats an illusion . because people admire jordon and they want to buy the shoe brand he is wearing . here , jordon is the image leader . people follow suit . people want to identify themselves with famous people . finally , advertisement often only mention the positive thing about the product and ignore or downplay the side effect or negative aspect of the produccts . for example , ad for drug . `` ask your doctor if this medicine is for you '' instead of mentioning the side effect . in sum , advertisement are marketing tool . they can not truly reflect what product they are . they often elevate the product .
