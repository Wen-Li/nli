the human kind always need enjoying to reach good life standarts therefore enjoying is one of the most important aspect of human life . everyone ha different point of view about the idea of enjoying . some belief that young people enjoy life more than older person do and i totally agree with the idea . these are my following idea . first of all , youngers have more oppurtunity to enjoy more than olders . a lot of sport and enjoying activity are generally made for young person because of the fact that they are motre healthier and powerful to enjoy the activity . for example , out door activity are very enjoable and realy provide youngers to have good time . however these need a strong body and heart to feel the enjoying point of adrenalin . in addition to this , youngers have le problem to enjoy more than olders . generally young person have le responsibility about life . moreover they have le health problem to survive . all of these enable them to enjoy more and have good time . for instance , my grandfather ha some money and health problem . hence all of these prevent him to enjoy more than an independent child . the last but not least , youngers have more time to meet the world and taste new thing of it . for example forty year ago there is not the sport of paragliding and the people of the past couldnot find time to taste the enjoyablity of the sport . however , paragliding is my favorite sport and i can realy enjoy and have good time with my friend in pragliding trip . all in all , a i said before young people enjoy life more than older person . enjoying is related with both more oppourtunity and le problem a well a more time to taste new thing . the long and the short of it is that , yong person should try to find the way of enjoying until they become older .
