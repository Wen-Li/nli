i agree with the statement ` young people do not give enough time to helping their community . ' also , young people do not have to give time to help their community . nowadays , people are busy to live . they have to work for their family and themselves . it is hard to earn a living . people do not have enough time for themselves . how can they help others ? if they have enough time and money for their community , it is okay to help others . however , if they do not have time and money for their community , there is no way to help others . human being are born selfish . they first think about themselves , their family and their friend , not the people who are not related to them . when there is enough time and money for them and for others , they may help others . but helping thier community is their choice . it is not people 's duty . however , some people think it is our duty to help others and help our community . it sound good , but it is hard to do . for example , a person who ha little income which barely afford his or her family take time to help the communitiy . it would be good for the community , but the person 's family will not eat their meal . helping their community can be possible by the people who can afford their family first . helping their community is not bad . it is good behavior , and also it is for all people , not only for one or two . but to help their community , the first thing to do is help themselves and their family . helping their community from the heart can be done just when thier family is happy . to help from the heart ,, people should take care of themselves and their family first .
