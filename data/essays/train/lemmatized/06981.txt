our world is changing fast and going well by one step to an other , because so many successful people are everywhere in the world . and people always have different opion about the successful people , and what is the idea bout successful people . some think they always trying new thing to improve themself , and some may think that they doing well because they just focus on the stuff that they already know . in my opion , i think successful people are always trying new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , trying new thing can improve our life . for example , from ancient time to now , we find a lot of new stuff to improve our live , like if people want to go somewhere quikly , only thing they can do is running , but after that , they find out that horse are fast than human , so they started to ride horse . but now , we have car , and it is much faster than horse , if we do n't trying to find the new thing to help , may be we still ride horse now or still running . same a everything we have in our life now , like redio , micorwave , they all the new thing at we find to improve our live . secondly , trying new thing can increse your confidense . for example , when you try to slove a math promblem , and it is very hard find the answer , but you find out there is an other way to slove the promblem and it is much easier than other people 's way to slove it . you will feel really happy and wnat to try if there are more new way to slove it
