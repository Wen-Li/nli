i do agree with the following statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in our society , the use of advertisement is completely insane . the company try to sell anything to the people and even if it not good for our health . the big company us differents way to make the people buy their product and sometimes there are not very proper way . the goal of the company it is to have a important benefit and they try to sell some product which can bring them a lot of money . an advertisement on tv is a fabulous possibilty to influence people to buy the product . a lot of color , a famous music , a famous people like kate moss can make the people change their mind about a product and make them buy it once they are in the supermaket . for example , a shampoo with the brand l'oreal have a better chance to be buy than another shampoo which is not on tv . we are indue the influence of marketing and it is very hard to resist too such nice and new product because our favorite football player or actress wear or eats the product . in our mind , we think '' if she or he have it '' it is certain that is a good product and that 's why i should buy it '' . however according to many study and statistic , the product on the advertisement are not so good than they try to say . a lot of chemical ingredient can be hide inside a product . for instance , a sample chocolate bar like '' lion '' bar contains a lot of bad thing which can really affect our body in the futur . for the moment , we can not realize how bad it can be but one day it will occurs . moreover , it is a fact that most of these product contains a lot of fat and are terrible for our health . as a result of the product , older people have heart attack , diabete , problem of obesity . .. to conclude , i reallu believe that the people have to be aware of the impact of the ad
