i agree that it is more important for student to ndertand idea and concept than it is for the to learn fact . to tie yourself up to fact , produce fact that alredy existd , therefore it cause nothing else . however , understanding idea and concept , you may obtain various way of opinion from each person . when you analyse cohensive fact from them , you will see several fact . for example , if you think about excution , and you conclude it is unnecessarry from one article , there ought to be existed those who disaree with it reason that they killed humakind and it 's obviously outlaw . he should get punishment . eve if both idea are acceptable , they 're lead through by simple agement . people need to collect those information by not standing by both side , and find solution how object ha to be concluded .
