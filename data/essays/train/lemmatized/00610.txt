the issue at hand is '' do advertisement make product seem much better than what they really are ? `` . yes , i strongly agree with the above point . in today 's developing world medium and advertisement do play in major role in enhancing the product . firstly the general public or the customer who are buying or going to buy a particular product are attracted by the advertisement of that product rather than the quality and the performance . advertisements are done with famous people which attracts many of their fan 's and they start using that particular product . for example if a actor is using a particular brand of perfume then his/her fan do follow him without actually considering the quality . in this way i feel most advertisement make product seem much better than what they really are . secondly most of the advertisement contains graphic and high resolution video and image . they are visually more appealing and attractive to look at . due to the use of multimedia technology more and more client get attracted and buy the product instead going for their property and long lasting nature . for example in an advertisement it shown that a bicyle ( product ) collides with a bus and nothing happens to the bicycle which is not at all possible . so again advertisement seemed to make product much better than what they really are in real life . thirdly advertisement lead to the increase in the sale of a particular product whether it is really good or not . many company use advertisement to increase their sale of product . their main aim behind is to earn maximum profit . furthermore many of the firm use advertisement a an intelligent weapon to show superior feature in their product when compared to the product of different firm , so that the customer is tempted to buy their product . so i strongly feel that advertisement enhances the product than what really it is .
