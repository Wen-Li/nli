worlds resource are ending fast today . resources like oil , natural gas which are major fuel to the modern car are limeted source of energy . therefore i agree that in couple of decade , there will be fewer car in use than they are today . with the effect of industrialisation in past two century the culture have markedly changed , more ease in life , more amenity easy communication and travelling . but all of these on the cost of fuel , which are rapidly eaten up a time progressed . main fuel that are used in car are gasoline , deisel , natural gas etc . these fuel scarcity ha been now realized . they are hinted by the recent hike in oil price all over the world . major gulf country , which are abundant in oil field are now increasing price because of it growing demand considering it availability . solar car are the good option to secure our future . but these source of energy is very inefficient and le productive than existing oil and natural gas fuel . electric car may sound good which us battery to run the car and is supposed to replace future car . but these battery are to recharged again and again by electricity . now , from where the electricity come . it is made by utilizing coal in thermal powerplants , from hydal powerplant and nuclear power plant . but since most of the powerplant in the world are thermal powerplants , which depands on coal and also a limited resource . it will probably be over in future . these fact also aggrevates the fact of availability of fewer car in future . hence it is the hightime that scientist today should find out the alternative way to replace the existing fuel which are limited or face the bitter consequence of future . where the car on road wil become history .
