people percieve enjoyment in different way . enjoyment for me may mean playing soccer but at the same time enjoyment for my grandpa may mean meditating or reading . i may endorse enjoyment in a different sense . enjoyment is a personal view and not a general one . i would refute the statement that young people enjoy life more than the older people do . enjoyment is associated with very phase of life in it own way , carrying a special meaning . before the teenage , playing with friend for long hour may be the ulimate source of enjoyment for kid . during the teenage however , chatting with friend on the phone , talking to the opposite sex may be thrillling & enjoying . typical pang of adolosence a we call it . post teenage , i.e college life , we may like to hang out with our friend for party , movie , festival etcetra . it would certainly mean enjoyment . pre-marriage job life would add some other kind of dimension to the definition of enjoyment of life like going out for shopping . post-marriage enjoyment may mean bringing up kid , playing with them , making them study . my parent say that my birth wa the best moment of their life . old age may seek enjoyment in morning walk , playing with grandchild , meditation . it could be the time when one introspect and see how well have they lead their life and how can they make it even better . that would certainly make life more enjoyable . we may enjoy life doing thing alone or we enjoy life in comany of friend . its basically the way we see enjoyment . enjoyment ha different face to it which show up at the right time or the right phase of life . branding enjoyment of life to only a particular segment of age may not justify the essence of enjoyment . living every moment to the fullest and the best one can is the is thrust of enjoyment .
