many consider traveling to be one of the fundemantel value to develop your point of view in to the world . traviling alone sometimes can be hard for people . on my part , i agree that travelling with a tour guide ha more benefit than travelling individually . with a tour guide , youn can safe time and recieve more information . on the other hand , traveling without a tour guide give you freedom . first , safing time is really important when you are on the trip . by a tour giude , you can schedule your time . for example , in trip , there are some schedule which offer a lot of place to visit for visitor . in this schedule with a tour guide visitor can see many place in one day . they have a chance to visit many place and see on in addition , when people travel to somewhere , they would like to learn some information about the place . with a tour guide , receiving information is easy for visitor . for example , in foreign country visitor have to translate some information which is about the place . people do not have a chance to translate all foreign language . a tour guide can translate the information for visitor . hovewer , depending on someone sometimes feel visitor boring . when people travel to some place , they sometimes want to feel free . without a tour guide , they can do whatever they want . for example , they can go shoping , visiting some place , eating their launch or dinner whenever they want . to sum up , travelling with a tour guide offer many advantage for visitor . saving time and getting information are really significant thing to travel .
