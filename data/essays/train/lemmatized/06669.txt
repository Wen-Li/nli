i believe that young people enjoy life far more than old people do . this is due to three main reason . in this essay , i will explain why i have come to this conclition . firstly , most young people have good health . as a eighteen-yearold my self , i rarely get sick or get injured compared with my neighbor lady who is seventy-five . she always tell me that health is the most important aspect , and to take care of my health since it is so important . many people in japanese society believe this idea . also , there is a word in japanese that saids : the inner health come from the outer health . this mean that if an individual is physicaly healthy , he/she will be mentaly health , refering to having positive emotion . which indicates that people can enjoy their life when they are healthy . secondly , having both old and new way of thinking is easy for young people . young people can learn new idea or analise new technique . they are able to use technology , and conseme new idea . in addition , young people can learn history at school , or listen to story from older people , such a parent , grand-parents , and neighbor . having a diverse thinking will allow a prosperous life , which can mean a enjoyable life . on the other hand , older people are not advanced in handleing new idea , on new technique . forexample , my mother who is fifty-years-old , can not handle advanced technology such a her mobile-phone . thirdly , young people are usualy ambisious then older people . this is because young have not seen the big world yet , which allows them tohave diverse goal . also , young people can study hard to get in a good university , to enjoy life . however , most older people have brain which can not consume many material physicaly . also , older peoplr know the limit of goal and dream . i believe that having a goal or a dream increase the standard of living . which lead to an enjoyable life .
