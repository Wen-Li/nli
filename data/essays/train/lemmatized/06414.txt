at the beginning of the 21st century , the increasing number of car in use worldwide is a key environmental issue . it doe not only affect the level of pollution in the air but it also amplifies the green house effect and it seriously endangers the sustainability of the earth 's energy ressources . although some important sign show a general willigness to reduce the number of car in use , i believe the current trend is very difficult to change . on the one hand , it is visible that there are clear force trying to influence the increase in the number of car . the environmental consciousness of the public is more important than ever and could be a good driver for the reduction of the number of car a citizen themselves decide to not use or use le frequently their car to protect the environment . there are also several policy put in place by givernments , mostly in western country , to try to reduce the usage of car . these policy include for instance , the development of public transport , the closure of some road or city center to car or incentive given to driver to share btheir car to go to work . however , i belive other factor will hamper the reduction of the number of car in use . in fact , one important reality once ha to face is that the environment concern is more widespread in western country , which do not represent the majority of the earth populiation . in parallel to the environmental movement that are growing in developped country , there are many developping country that are growing very fast . and people in those country seems to be very eager to achieve the same standard of living a we have in western country , and this includes access to car . for all those resons , i do n't belive the number of car in use will decrease in the next twenty year although it is necessary to achieve a sustainable development of the planet .
