i do not agree with this statement ha provided . young people could enjoy life in many different way in present than past day however i do think the word , `` enjoy '' mean solely living without any worry . first , old people experienced many way in life and these experience bring to enjoy life . when i first saw this statement , i came up with many different experience that i heard from my grandmother and mother . simply , old people lived more than young people did and this show how old people experienced many different situation before the young people . they already experienced and survived many different situation , so they deserve to enjoy life . second , old people would have their child and grand child and to see how their own child growing and giving new birth , are the real meaning of enjoy life . i came up with this topin sentence to thinking about my grandmother in south korea . even though i have n't seen her in past five year , i will never forget all the word that my grandmother told me . in my experience , since i wa young , my grandmother told me to respect parent and having family is the most happy thing in life . as well a she told me that young people could enjoy life in their way however , they have more responsibility about schoosl , futurse , job , and many more thing until they think finished everything . my grandmother told me that she ha child and grand child and they all grown up to work everything by themselves so she doe n't have to worry about future . when she first thought about what is the real meaning of enjoy life , she said that even though she 's getting older and everything wa n't like when she wa young but only her mind wa more peaceful and comfortable than when she wa young . as i heard that , i did think that i want to live like my grandmother . in conclusion , young people enjoy life a what they feel about to enjoy however , i do think old people do enjoy life more freely and happily than young people do and they should have to because they deserved to enjoy life .
