i think success is a thing which can be obtained from hard work and ofcourse in some cases it may comethrough luck also , but it will not remain for a long time . according to me `` hardwork is the main concept for success '' and coming to successful people , i think they succeded because of hardwork . by implementing the new ideas in the field of business they have developed their businesses . these new ideas may be some times risky and may lead to the loss in the business . but every successful person thinks that `` failures are the steping stones to success '' . a successful person never and should not be discouraged . there is nothing new in doing the same thing they know and making to run the business asusually with normalprofits . and that 's also not that much interesting in life . according to me every business person in the field of business thinks of growing more na more and to reach a higher position in life . every person in the field of business should have zeal to grow up . for example take some of the indians who r in one of the top positions in the world and in the country , those are mr.lakshmi mittal , anil ambani , mukesh ambani , ratan tata , ajim premji . .. etc. , and many mor . all these persons are not born with silver spoon while birth . they have reached their positions by carefully implementing the required rules and regulations for the new ideas or things which are risky . they did not stop their achievement by just doing the same business what they have started first and becoming calm . every person should have a specific scope in order to reach something new . no person should stop at the level they have aquired and should try for higher position . therefore i conclude by agreement that successful person try new thinggs and take riska rather than only doing what they know how to do well .
