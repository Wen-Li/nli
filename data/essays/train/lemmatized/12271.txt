fist , i do n't agree with this statement , because if you would like to go a place where you are in a vacation in there , you may want to be a free person . on the other hand , you ca n't do everything what you would like to do in that time and in that place . but , sometimes we need a tour guide who introduce u the place or city where we are in vacation there , because some place where we do n't know howmany historical place it ha . besides this , if you go to travel with your tour guide you may have some problem . for instance , when you would like to visit some historical place you ca n't choose where you want to go . so , your travel guide may affect to you . your travel guide everytime stay with you . you could n't have a rest with your family . the best one is , travel only with your family . next , there wiil be many people in your vacation . and most of them who you do n't see in your life or you do n't know how charecteristic person do they have ? this point is very important because , if you do n't know a person or people , you should n't go to vacation with them . maybe some of them are guilty , we do n't know eachother . and there will be a lot of problem with your group , if they are n't nice people . then , you could n't have a chance to choose them . i think if we could choose which person can go to vacation with u , it maybe possible to think go to vacation with a grup and a tour guide . but i never heard that you could choose your person of group . after that , maybe in your vacation , some of your group 's member would like to go to other place or would like to do different thing , but you do n't . finally , the best one is everytime you should go to your vacation only with your family .
