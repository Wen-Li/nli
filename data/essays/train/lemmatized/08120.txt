it is evident from history and successful people life that doing something new and taking risk ha always resulted in sucess . one should believe that doing an ordinary thing is not appreciated . every one considers it a a job or part of a job . only extraordinary thing which raise others eyebrow are appreciated and rewarded . this happens only if someone try to do something new or something different . this definately is achieved by taking a risk . inventions like television , communication system like telephone are the result of sucessful people . if they have done their normal routine job they might not have invented all these . they have taken risk and tried to do something new . thats the reason they are suceessful . we can quote research scholar and people working on new topic a an example . they are doing something new by taking risk . due to their effort we are seeing many advanced and surprising product , invention , drug etc . if we compare u with our granfathers lot ha changed . they used to move from place to place by mean of animal whereas we are travelling in air , by road , train and on water . our grandfather havent dreamt of all these . all these are the invention of successful people . they acheved by trying something new and taking risk . people do their routine job . they may succeed by doing the job with perfection which is considered a a job or a part of the job . what are they succeeding ? . if someone doe the same job or same step in le time or with increased productivity than there is success in it . the success can be achieved only if he try to do in a different way . doing a routine job in a different way alwasys involves risk . hence i strongly agree with the opinion that successful peple try new thing involving risk rather than only doing what they know how to do with perfection .
