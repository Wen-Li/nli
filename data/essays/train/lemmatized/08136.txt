i definitely disagree with the idea that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because i know that a lot of young people work for their community a volunterre . i would like to offer some example to support my opinion . first , there are a large number of student at my university who are interested in helping their community . for exmple , when i went to the volunterre meeting at the university a few day ago , although it wa still on summer vacation , the meeting room wa packed with student who wanted to volunterre . i wa so exited to see and know that the number of student made time for the meeting . it show the fact that there are a lot of young studets who are interested in helping their community and make time for it . second , i know that a lot of my freinds are working for volunterre already . moreover , at the meeting of this kind , i have seen a lot of young people who join for volunterre including from different university , location and background . if young people have not given enought time to supporting their community acitively these day how come i have seen these people ? also i know that they are not only suppoting their community but also they are willing to do it . they feel more reponsible to the community through the acitivity . doing these activity give them a lot of satisfation a a member of community and society . for these reason , i disagree the idea strongly that young people today do not make enought time to helping their community . furthermore , a long a i know , they participate more to help their community .
