nowadays group traveling is more popular . everbody try to travel somewhere by a group such a somewhat europe tour or africa trip . although some people think that the best way to trip is an alone without tour guide , i do strongly support the idea of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because of two reason , first one is tour guide are know where we have to go and secondly if you have never been to there you need a leader who help to you how to visit and how to spend their time enjoyable there . first of all , if somebody want to travel somewhere certainly she/he must get tour or tour guide because if you have no idea where are you and you need some help from someone this person shoul be your tour guide moreover if you spend a lot money for this travel it is so normal to want to see important place . nowadays tour guide have well educated person about how to assist the other person in addition to that they have an idea and knowledge about that area , for that reason if somebody want to travel somewhere such a france or spain and also if you have no idea about that countires you have to travel is in a group led by a tour guide in addition to that , if you want to travel in spain firts of all you must get a lot of information about spain if you could get when you go to there you need a leader who help to you to go somewhere or important place and also how to spend your time enjoyable because you dont know how to go there and you have knoe idea such a weher is the most popular disco 's there , if you are not use a tour guide maybe you can waste your time in one place if you pay a lot of money for this trip you want to see a lot of place . to illustrate nowadays most of businessmen are using this way so they are using tour guide while your are going to abroad when they are finish their meeting going somewhere to see important place by the way , because thet havent got any time to visit somewhere for that reason busunessmen are travelling by tour guide in conclusion , everybody travelling somewhere i suggest that if you want to travel somewhere that is the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , i strongly support the this idea rather than the travelling alone without a tour guide .
