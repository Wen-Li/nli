to answer if i agree or disagree with this statement , i have to make some distinction . there are some profession that need a broad knowledge of many academic subject and some that do not . professions like scientist in specific region , let say microbiologist , need a specialization . that mean that they will start to study general biology and later specialize for microbiology . they might need general knowledge about statictis , mathematics and maybe some term in the latin lannguage , but they do not need to study economy or philosophy . on the other hand there are some profession where a broad knowledge is needed . a director of a movie will need complex understanding of many different subject . he will have to deal with actor , so he will need probably some knowledge about psychology . he will need to understand the finance of this project , have knowleadge about technical issue to communicate with the camera , light and editing team . further he will need to outweight the importance of every upcoming problem , where he will need managing skill like timemanagement . on the other hand , if you have enough time to study what you like and what you are passionate for , it will always be of help . nowadays we live in a fast changing world with upcoming challenge . no job will replace ohters and to have diffrent knowledge and skill will always help to increase the amount of possibilites where to work . i think that one ha to see the opportunity cost and listen to one 's heart what is really important for
