`` young people enjoy life more than older people . '' yes , i agree with the given statement perfectly . because of several reason a follows , * at the young age people are not yet matured a the people of older age , so that they can enjoy the life with out any limit . * similarly there is a lot of difference in their daily life span of living such that , the young people does'nt have that much responsibility when compared to the older people . * if we consider an example , the young man that he is not got married . he enjoys his life with his freinds and parent in many way , such a in party in function etc. , because he doe not need to go to home earlier that he did not got married . * but where a the old man who got married have to go home early because he ha lot of responsibility of his family . * because the old man life with his wife and the childrens that there are so much work to do with . * but where a the young man will enjoy till the midnight of the party where ever he like . * if we note the point that this old man also enjoyed in his young periond so that he now got some responsibility . * the young people also ha some responsibility internally , about the future and the study . but these are not the major problem when we compare to the problem of the olde man ha in his life . * and another thing if we note that some older man also enjoy a lot than the young in some situation , such that these older man are already settled their life and also the life 's of their childrens also with lot of money in their pocket . * but these situation are much rare one because some old people get settled and some will not suceeds in thier life . similarly some old people get soon settled and some will be late . so by these variation there will get some difference between them . * where a this is not the case in young people , because upto a particular age they will depend upon their parent untill they can get a job . from there onwards also they will enjoy a lot with their own money and exenses . * finally the conclusion is that the `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' .
