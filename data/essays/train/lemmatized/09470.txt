the answer is this question depends on ur own like , hobby and life experience . in my point of view ; i dont agree with this statement beacuse i like the motor sport and enginees . im a mechanical engineer . even if the most people dont use car in the future ; im sure that i wont leave this habit , im going to use car in the future . i know my answer is emotional . the techonologhy is getting more modern everyday . and the word pollulation is growing up too . because of the traffic problem we need to use puplic transporting vechiles like metro or bus . there are a lot car on the street and it really hard to travel by car . for example travelling by metro is really easer than the indivual one . and in twenty year the train will be faster than now . acutally im not sure about we are going to use car in twenty year . maybe we will use different type of car in the future which have the ability of flying . its really early to say thats kind of firm idea like that . now we use cruise control in our car and there are a lot of system that can help to driver . who know whats gonna happen next ? the most important important reason that i need to suppose this statment is technologhy . the scientist are working for transporting object with the speed of light and they succeed about transpoting light . now the turn is for physical object . im sure that they are going to solve this problem and then we will able to travel faster , needless to say , there will be fewer car than there are today . and this the right thing about our future . because the world temprature is rising up by car or which are using oil . if we want to stop this we need to find different invention better than car
