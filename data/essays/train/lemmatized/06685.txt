comparing young people to older one , people tend to think that the youth enjoys life more than it elder counterpart . indeed , it is easy to realize that in most of the case , old people are le able-bodied than the young one . this physical aspect may interfere with one 's ability to enjoy life because it prevents people from doing a certain number of activity such a sport or even the basic everyday act of going outside to do shopping for example . moreover , most of the activity in city are created for the young people , to avoid them getting bored and staying in the street . these activity can be a well night club than sport center . .. nevertheless it would not be fair to attribute an enjoyable life to the young people only . indeed , i really think that enjoying life simply depends on one 's state of mind . for instance , if we are used to get bored of everything and to criticize more than to admire then we will scarcely enjoy life . on the other hand if we are used to be positive on the event happening then we have le reason to dislike life and not to enjoy it . thus in my opinion enjoying life is more related to a psychological aspect than a physical one and in that way it is possible for the old people to enjoy life a much , indeed more , than the youth . the fact of enjoying life can also be influenced by the event happening or that already happened in one 's life . in that way , a i said before , the eldest person may enjoy life more than the youngest one because if for instance a young ha health problem or family one while the old no , then the latter will be more likely to enjoy life than the former one . as a conclusion i would say that enjoying life is not a matter of age but a matter of state of mind and way of thinking .
