the way that the young and the old living their life are totally different nowadays in china . and what i agree is young people do enjoy life mor than older people do . maybe the most important reason is that young people spend more money . almost every young student have some technological instrument , such a cd player , digital camera , mobile phone , mp3 player , or even mp4 player . but that 's not so popular in adult . they may only have a very old type mobile phone . the computer in everyhome have almost become toy for the child , the only function is to play game . compared to my classmate , i 'm a saving boy , but compared to my parent , i 'm wasting . once , when i wa having lunch at a out-door restraunt near my schol , many adult passed me by . what they do is just leave , because they think it wa too expensive . another unforgettable reason may be the different style of education we get . our parent were told to save when they were at school . save , save , save . all they knew wa to save , and they really met some problem , which `` save '' really helped them . but what i learn is `` enjoy your life ! '' , so i do . i enjoy my life so much that what i have enjoyed maybe more than my parent . also , love is a factor , maybe someone will ignore . adults have many people for them to love . their husband or wife , child , parent . but for we , we only love ourselves . we have n't got so many people to love , and we are still do n't know how to love , and who to love . so the olders want the people they love to enjoy their life , not themselves , which is completely different from u . last , there are some kind of joy that the elder ca n't enjoy , such a some physical sport , such a football , basketball and some dangerous stuff . so , in my point of view , the youth enjoy life more than their elder do .
