i do not agree with the question . the major reason that brought me to this conclusion is , that only specialisation make perfect . that mean if you want to work in a certain field , you have to specialize . because you have to know a much a possible about this certain field , in order to work on a highly professional level . for example , if you are a doctor , you should learn everything about medicine , the human body and how to treat sicknisses . if you only know how to treat a cold and how to measure the blood pressure , you can not work on a high level . to give another example ; if a programmer would not specialize , he or she will never find a job . because there is such a great variety of programming language , that only specialisation will make it possible to work in a certain field . there is no general programming ! a programmer ha to choose one field to work in , maybe web-designe , than he or she ha to studie a lot in order to get a good overview about this particular working field . i think you can transfer this to every kind of academic subject . only specialisation make perfect . but it is also my opinion , that people should have a broad knowledge of many different subject . not especially on academic level , but a good general knowledge is important a well .
