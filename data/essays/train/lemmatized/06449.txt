eessential way to succeed is trying new thing with le risk . therefore , i disagree that successful people try new thing and take risk . succcessful people to eager to get knowledge a much a possible and pay effort all the time . that 's why they look like that they try thing what they already know how to do well . moreover , they tend to be careful to challenge new thing such a business and sport . before they start dsomething , they imagine and exmaine . them , when they have confidence , they callenge it . for example , successful first food chain company exmins how many and what kind of people walk arround the area where they want to open the new store . people who try new thins takng lot of lisks are sometimes fascinating people . in addition , they rarely success . nevertheless they succeed in the past , they tend to be fail someday . for exmample , some succeeded internet business owner lost their all money suddenly . their cuccess wa based on the fassion of society and business tendency . unfortunatelly , they misunderstood the way to scucceed . therefore , they used ton of mney they got before to something new business . i believe taht success always bring the people basen on their effort . pople who did theiyr best are always le risk . therefore trying new thing s witought risk are tip to be success .
