some people think that yonug people can act more than older people , and yong people can spent more enjoyable time than older people . for the following reason , however , i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first , older people have more free time . for example , older people can retire his job when the people got enough money to spent their least life . many older people can spent both money and time for what they want to do . some older people can travel all over the world . some people can gather antique jewelies all over the world . some people spend his life treating their gearden . by contrast , young people have to go school . yong people do not have enough time and money to do all what they want . second , older people have a great deal of knowledge and experience to spent time . for example , older people can enjoy even in five minute , if they know writting poem . when the older people doe not know about writing poem , they would hit on other idea , ssuch a reading book , talking with others , and thinking about their offspring ' future . they know various choice , because they have experienced various past time in their own past . but , young people doe n't . this is adventage for older people . so , i strongly disagree that older people enjoy their life le than young people .
