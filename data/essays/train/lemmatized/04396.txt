i agree with the statement that , it is better to travel in a group and with a tour guide rather than being on our own . it is always fun to go in group , so that we can enjoy more and get to know new people , their habit , hobby and we might find some thing very intresting to learn from others , for example drwing , painting or anything which is intresting to u . when it come to traveling , most of the time we try to see new place and will be curious to know each and everything about that new place , but we know that we can only hope when we are on our own but for sure we can do that when a guide is with u . first of all , a guide is the expert who will be knowing most of the thing and he would have certain planning for travelling a well a sight seeing . so our time would be sufficient to travel to the place where we want and see what we are looking for . another important thing is , financial aspect . when we are on our own , we might spend on unnecessary thing and land up in ` empty hand ' . so , it is wise to have a deal with the tour guide and relax without bothering about the financial aspect . the last and the most important aspect is'safety ' . when we travel on our own , we may not be aware of how secure our visiting place would be and also how safe the people are in that place ? . so a tour guide would be a best person to travel with , so that he know the best safety procedure related to place to be visited and we can relax that we will be safe . concidering all these thing , i personally prefer going in a group led by a tour guide which will save my time , money and i will be fulfilling the purpose of my journey .
