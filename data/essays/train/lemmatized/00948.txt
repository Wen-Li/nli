in my opinion , success is mainly the result of realized chance and opportunity . as a consequence , i agree with the issued statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i do acknowledge that there may be situation in which it may prove better to stick to what you are used to do . in the course of a sport examination , for example , it may not be too wise to try an entirely new way of jumping across a hurdle . however , even in a situation like this the basic fact remains valid that without taking some risk you may miss your chance . in my example this mean that this one different jump might just have been the one your teacher wanted to see . apart from that , i believe that you ca n't make any progress if you stay persistently at the same level . and always doing what you know how to well already doe n't mean anything else but precisely this remaining static and without progress . in order to be successful , it is , in my opinion , essential that you make some progress . for usually success is connected with some achievement . this is just another reason why i agree with the issued statement . however , the most important reason , why i affirm this statement , is that chance may appear suddenly . and a i have explained prior to this , i consider taking and realizing your chance to be of fundamental importance for success . if you always pondered about whether to seize an opprtunity or not , it would probably be gone before you came to a decision . it is often impossible to realize your chance with an absolute certainty that everything will turn out all right . consequently , there always is a risk in realizing them . and if you are not willing to take this risk and instead stick to what you know to do well already , you may very likely miss a chance to be successful .
