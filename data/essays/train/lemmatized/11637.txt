although there are several debate about how people bacome successful , i am really supporting that successful people always prefer trying new idea to doing what they know exactly . there is nothing to do with someone who insists on being what he or she is and do n't taking risk in order to improve herself or himself . first of all , although people do a job very well , thay can not be successful because of their lack of imagination . they usually make same thing in same way every day . on the other hand , people using their imagination and inventing different method for doing a job are usually the best position in the company . for example , there are several people working in a company but there is only one major and this major ha already make a difference with other employee . in addition , people continued doing something in the same way ' they can not recagnise other facility . for instance , if sakip sabanci who wa the most sucessfull businesman in turkey did not realise people need oil rather than sock , he would not be the most successful businesman in turkey . he started to work by selling sock but he did not continue the work because he realised a good work which he could earn more money . this wa a risk for him but he did not hesitate about taking risk and he became the most sucessful businesman in turkey . according to the aforementioned , in essance , sucessful people are always make something in different way because if they insist on going old-fashioned way they can not recognise other facility . even thougy they realize facility , if they can not take risk , they can not be sucessful and also it is not possible that they improve themselves .
