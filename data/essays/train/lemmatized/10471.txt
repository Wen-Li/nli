young people nowday do not give enough time to helping their community . in my opinion , i certainly do not agree with this question . nowdays , many young people would like to spends time with their own will . however , it doe not mean they do not give enough time to helping their community , just their own will come first and it is more important than helping their community to young people . however , there are many kind of community such a their interest , friend , even theri family would be count a one of the community . although , family are one of their community , i still believe that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their `` community '' . the reason why i think young people do not give enough time to helping their community , even though it is their family , is the time they live . nowdays , young people are able to have fun with many thing such a playing video game , having a party , and going to an amusement park . young people can do anything they want to do without community . however , if they spend time to helping their community , they still have some time to have fun the way they want to , but it is not what they want . they want to have their own time , not with the community .
