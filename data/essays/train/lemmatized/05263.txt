i disagree with the idea that these day child do not have enough time to contribute to their community . there are two reason for my opinion ; activety in school and activety by government or community . first , activeties held in school give childeren a lot of time to engage in helping community . for example , evey year in japan school hold a school competition . parents of child come together with their family . they enjoy with seeing child running or playing sport . they communicate with other family in that that competition . in addition to that , volunteer actuveties asociated by school also help child to help thier community . 90 % of school in japan hold at least one volunteer activeties in each year . in that activeties child contribute to thier community . farthermore , in school child learn about their community . they have to learn about their community and do any activeties for thier community . second , activeties held by government or community also give child a lot of time to help thier community . for instance , government also hold volunteer activeties in each year . in total government hold twice ativeties a many a that held in school . government and community give child more oppotunities to help thier community . concequently , i think young people have a lot of time to help thier community because of two kind fo activeties ; school ' activeties and government 's or community ' activeties .
