there is an old saying , `` do not judge a book by it cover '' . it is true and applies to everything and everywhere in the world . it is impossible to see what the content of the box is only by looking at a box unless a person ha an uncanny ability to do so . a woman with luxurious clothes eating in an expensive restaurant might not be rich because she might have borrowed the clothes from her friend for a day and somebody else wa paying for her food . same a the advertisement . since the purpose of the advertisement is to sell product , it is inevitable to describle product better than they really are . every product is covered with some description and picture on it . in most case , the picture are not exactly same a the real content . for example , one day , i went to the store to buy something to eat . every food looked great to me since i wa hungry , and the picture on the cover looked really delicious . i bought a bunch of instant food and tried one of them at home . i put frozen pasta in a microwave , and when i took it out from the microwave to eat , i wa greatly disappointed and frustrated . although the picture on it cover had big chunk of meat and creamy sauce on softly boiled noodle , the actual food looked totally different from the picuture . from this example , it can be concluded that it is necessary for food company or advertisement company to make advertisement with exaggreational expression or picture to sell them . i bought the frozen pasta since it advertisement looked great . if there were two kind of frozen pasta with two different cover with the frozen pasta and the other one with deliciously cooked pasta , what would people prefer to buy ?
