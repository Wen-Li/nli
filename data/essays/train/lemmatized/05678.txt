i agree with the sentence that most advertisement and most negative spot make product seem much better than they really are . this is real for lot of reason . firstly , a company which product a good or a service want always show the best in it business expecially when it want to compete with another group wich sell to people the same article . for this reason they often tell people lie about their good through television , city poster or magazine and people trust it , but when someone buy their famous thing , is not really how they describe to u ! for example , one day my mother had decided to buy an hair-phon which should resist to water and repared you from electrical wave but when it fall in the ground with some water drop she broke it . she wa so scared ! secondly , for new object we have not the idea of the name of who product it . if i buy a valentino 's dress i think it would be better then an h & m 's one because the name is very important and show you the past of a work group . the company which obtain the fame with their good and their service have a best expectative in the consumer and the satisfaction of an expectative create fedelty in the buyer . in conclusion , i think advertisement are often a lie or an enlargement of the real usefulness of an object but i think also that someone with their work have increase their fame in people in a good way .
