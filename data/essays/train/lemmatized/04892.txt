i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in academy we can learn many subject . we can not have the chance to learn many academic subject without in academy . if you think you are nothing to do with an academic subject , it may be something to do with you . if you have not a knowledge of an academic subject when you need it , you have to be legret . the other advantige of have broad knowledge of many academic subject is that you can think many subject , more deeply , and more originaly . that is you can be superior to others . if you work on designer , for instance , you have to design many thing . if you have knowledge of cyicology , you can design many thing effectivity to anyone feel good . but you have no knowledge of cyicology , you can not design effectivity . in future , you can use many knowkedge of academic subject which you do n't think need . however you have to learn major subject . major subject and the other subject make you very billiant .
