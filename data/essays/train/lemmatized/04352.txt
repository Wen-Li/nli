when wa the last time you spend just an hour helping another person ? all of u -- not only young peopole -- may think about this question , because nowadays we 've became more selfish , completely dedicated to our own life and sometimes we do n't realize that there 's a lot of people around u that are le priviledged and need help . therefore , it 's true that now we do n't give enough time to helping our community . i think that there are several factor that explain this behaviour . firstable , society doe n't recognized this contribution , but instead of it , you 're better if you get two major , an excellent job , buy a car and a house and live with all the convenience . so , we spend our time trying to get these goal and forgetting about the community . a second factor could be that nowadays the time is the most appreciated value . the company pay u for our time , we spend a lot of time working , and free-time is very important for u . working on a ong project will take u a lot of free and not revenued time , so we prefer not to do it . to illustrate this point i can talk about my own experience . while i wa working for an advertising agency i tried to spend more time helping the others , i felt that i had to do it . i contacted to ` aldeas infantiles ' ( a childhood project ) and i spent a year teaching child and playing with them just friday afternoon . in the end i decided to quit the project because i worked at the office son many hour than then i did n't have enough time to see my boyfriend and my family . i realized that time wa too much important if you do n't have enough . in short , although it 's difficult to have enough time for all , we have to try it and spend maybe just an hour a week helping our community .
