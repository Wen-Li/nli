each one ha it own way in travel , so i am disagree about having a tour guid is the best way to travel . first of all , i have traveled many time in my life and all of my travel were really good even though i had not have a tour guide . because you might have a tour guide who like something special that you do not like so that will cause many thing such a : spend time in something that you do not like , and then you may not have time to go to the place that you do like . although , you could be a tour guide for yourself by getting information from many sour , and that what i do . these are some point about traveling with group led by tour guide . moreover , traveling without tour guide is help you to depend on yourself by using the map , or any other way . even though you might get lost sometime but getting lost during travel is good some time , i mean you might see something new that you do not about it . also , you could use the money that you will spend on tour guide in something different in your trip . for example , if you planing to pay a hundred to a tour guide , you can use this hundred in buying some stuff to your self . in the other hand i can not say that the people who are travel with tour guide are wrong , because a i said every one ha it own way in traveling . travel with tour guide ha disadvanteges a it ha advantage . it could the thing that i think it is right mainly wrong in other opinion . for example , some people hate to get lost in traveling while i have fun in that . actually those people are also right because if you gat lost in new sity that you do not know could be dangerous on your life , espesially if you entered those scary , and dark place . in conclusin , the people are still traveling with or without toure guide , but in my opinion i prefer to travel without led by tour guide .
