i agree to the statement that in twenty year tere will be fewer car in use than there are today . i can support my statement with few explainations or reason and example . i strongly believe that people use car a their mean of journey instead of taains and bus . i believe that people would prefer for personal , sophisticated and joyful journey . all this is possible only by having personal car . let me explain with a reasonable reason . people work through out the day . during weekend they feel to have ecstacy or euphoria to get relax from the enervatin job donre by them trough out the week . so they may spend their leisure time with their parent or friend . when it come to spend time with friend or sibling than they surely prefer to hav long ride or long journey . so the best way is to have a personal car . because if an individual go for tain or bus a hios mean of travelling than he or she ha to wait for the train or bus until it come and he or she can visit only those place where the bus or train can go . he or she can not enjoy the pleasure that the nature give . but when an individual ha got a personal car than he or she can go to any beautiful corner of the nature . there is one more advantage . whenever an individual get exhausted through his journey than he can stop somewhere and relax for a while and can visit any mani restaurents nearby to have some stuff . is int advantageous ? ofcourse it is . we can have lot of privacy in our own personal car . finally one damn advantage by having a personal car is we can reach our destiny in time instead of wasting time in wating . the destiny may be anything like office or a party etc . so if we are a bit cautious in driving than personal car are more advantageous and i conclude that in the coming year everybody prefer car .
