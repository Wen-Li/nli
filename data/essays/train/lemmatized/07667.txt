for several year the price of the gas ha been increasing . it had made people change their habit . and because there is no evidence that it will decrease soon , people have started to change their habit . first they are more likely to use common transport than they were in the past . also they use le their car for small ride . i think this trend will keep going and that year after year , people will use their car fewer and fewer , only because gas is becoming to expensive . some city try to encourage their citizen to drop the car . for example in paris , the mayor 's policy is to develop the use of public transport and to reduce the use of car . so for several year , bus have their own line in the street to be quicker and not stopped by the traffic , the day of big pollution there are restriction of the vehicules admitted in the street , and parking ' price is cheaper for the resident so their car do n't move . this policy make it so difficult to drive in the street of paris that i assume many people will drop the car either for a bike or a scooter than for public transport . of course people living in the countryside are not concerned by this policy . but other project , on the national level , try to incite them to buy clean car , or having a more responsable use . of course this policy is difficult to accept for some people who do not feel concerned about the environmental problem . for the youth such i , protecting the environment is a major issue , we have been taught on this topic since childhood . but for the older , it doe n't seem like a real problem such a war , economy or unemployment . so they keep using their car a lot . in twenty year , when the actual youth we 'll be the older , they wo n't be acting like that because of their education . personnaly , i 'll use my car a le a possible .
