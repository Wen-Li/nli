i agree with this , because i think it will be expencive gas of car in twenty year . it is getting to expencive the gas in the world now . it is getting to decrease amount of gas in the world , so it is getting to difficult to get gas and expencive to get . in addision , if it will be a war in saudiarabia , it will be difficult to get gas more and more . second , we should think about enviroment of the earth . we have a lot of problem about polution in the world . to getting warm in the world is one of the problem , so we should not ride a car by ourselves . we should be decreased about co2 in air . and if it will be expencive gas of car , we will use tranceportation , like a bus , a subway and a train . it is good way to decrease of co2 . finally , i think there are a lot of convinience tranceportation better than a car in twenty year . a car is not going to be covinience . we are going to use public trancepotation naturally . that is why , there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
