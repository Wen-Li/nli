i think that the statement is too extreme to agree with . it is true that there is a series of problem involved with car , for example the oil becoming rarer and rarer and the economical crisis we are experiencing , which should lead to a decresase in the number of car , but there are many factor which could lead , instead , to an increase in the number of car in the next twenty year . in fact , there are country such a china and india which are becoming richer . if a great amount of the people living there wanted a car , the number of car would probably increase , instead of decreasing in the next twenty year . it is true western countries are handling the problem of air pollution due to car circulation limiting the number of car actually allowed to circulate in the city , but eastern one most probably have n't already faced this problem . so , perhaps the number of car is likely to be reduced in western countries , but not in the eastern one . furthermore , new type of energy exploiting are in study . for example , electrical or nuclear car are matter of study of today 's scientist . if new energy were discovered in the next twenty year , there would be no evidence supporting the argument that the number of car would decrease . furthermore , car corporation could also build car more appealing to the customer , increasing the number of car in this way . in fact , a car sold toghether with surprising service like the possibility for the non driver to surf the internet or to watch television could improve the selling . in conclusion the problem with the lackness of resorces that the earth is facing is really a great challenge to the number of car . even the medium is raising people awareness of the lack of solution to the oil scarceness human race is facing . but there is nothing certain about the number of car within the next twenty year .
