cars are primarily a mean of transport . i reckon that the number of car being used in the next twenty year will decrease . car manufacturer might not show their anxiousness and current sale trend might not show it but other ominous sign are on the horizon . things like population expansion , price of petroleum , low availability of road space and newer technology will come into the picture . firstly , the population of the world is rapidly increasing . as developing country like china and india continue to prosper . their birthrate will most likely follow the same trend . but , not everyone will be able to buy a car , in fact the birthrate in poorer population have been found to be much greater than richer one . governments will shift policy to facilitate mass commute and stymie the increase in car . . high tax for owning more than two car are already in place in many city with large population . also , it is common knowledge that our petroleum resource will deplete in around two decade . newer fuel technology like fuel cell will come into the picture . but these technology are not expected to mature both technologically and economically in twenty year time time . people have already started going to work in carpools , bus and subway , this way they save money on the already sky high petrol price . imagine , what the price will be 10 year down the line , let alone 20 year . the last point that i would like to make is that car mostly run on big city road . most of these city are around 100 year old . they were not built to handle enormous number of car . even after much reconstruction the road space availibilty is not expected to be increase much further . congestion is a day to day problem faced by all city . people have even started proposing flying car and have built some prototype for the same . which all implies that if there is'nt any roadspace left , there might not be newer car being bought to ply on them . in conlcusion , i 'd like to say that i would much rather put my money on public transport than car a being the mean for transportation in the future . government policy , rising gas price , road congestion and population expantion all seem to point toward a decrease in the number of car , however flying machine might be in vogue . after twenty year , it just might be a novelty to go out for a picnic in your family sedan over the weekend .
