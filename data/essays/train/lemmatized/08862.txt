i agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to help their community for the following reason . first , young people are le interested in the activity of their community , although community are indispensable for people to live . for example , i participate in a clean up activity around the central station of my city . this activity is held every week and young people live in my city is strongly encourage to join , however , there are few young people among the participant . this example clearly show that young people do not spend enough time to help their community . second , the vote rate of young people in election in japan is generally much le than that of elder people , although to join political process of the community is impotant activity to keep their community active and healthy . to join political process , the voter must have their opinion toward their commutities . if young people paticipate in their community , they should have some opinion toward the situation or future of their community , and they should have strong incentive to go voting . this is the reason why i think young people do not spend enough time to help their community . third , there are many company which help elder people with their house hold errand and chore . the copanies run their customer errand instead of instead of the elder people . this business increase because young people will not help their grand parent or their parent . therefore , for above reason , i agree with the opinion that young people do not give enough time to helping their community .
