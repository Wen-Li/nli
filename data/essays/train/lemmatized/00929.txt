i strongly agree the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . tv , newspaper , internet , color and famous artist can be very tool for ad . first of all , tv and newspaper are very crucial tool for advertisement . for example we might watch tv at least one hour per day . this mean that there is a possibility to see the ad on tv . they are just showing the product , we dont know anything about the quality of these thing . they can hide everything on tv . secondly , internet is a very powerful for every kind of advertisement . for instance , i wa looking for an apartment to live in usa when i wa in turkey . every apartment looked to me great from their web page . when i came here , i checked the apartment that i saw ad from the internet . everything look different . there wa a noise on the floor while you are walking . we can see just a picture from the internet . we can not realize every property of apartment from the advertisement . finally , advertisement are necessary for company to sell their product . they would like to use different color and different famous person . every people might have a favorite color , so they can be attracted by product . for example green color may attract muslim people , red might attract communist people . they would not know about the quality of product . advertisements just give u some idea about the physical appearance of product . we would not like to see every detail of product from their picture .
