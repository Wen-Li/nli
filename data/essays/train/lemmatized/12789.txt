we do n't have the day that we do n't look at any advertisement in our daily life . there are so many advertisement such a tv commercial , plate or poster on the street , and so on . and now nobody would like to watch a boring and le interesting ad . it cause the market for advertisments severely and unfaithfully . in this situation , i agree that almost all of the advertisement help merchandise look better because the product company have to and sell huge amount of good and advertisement company must make a wonderful ad to compete thier rival . first of all , company ha to sell it product and get profit a muh a possible , otherwise it might be bunkrupt in the future because of a small change . it is clear and crucial for any company , so every company try to improve thier product even if it is only advertisement . in addition , there are severe competition between ad company . it make the company to produce good-looking commercial . now good and interesting view of product is very important for buyer to stop looking at them . hence , these company are trying to make better one than it really is . in conclusion , i strongly think merchandise must promote well . in my opinion , i also think this hard market produce a lot of lie . therefore , the position of costomer servise became extremely important part of the company in a dacade .
