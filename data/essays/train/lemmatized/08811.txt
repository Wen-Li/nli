people are constantly exposed to the fact being broadcasted through mean of book , medium , or the internet , but it is more important for the people to undertand the idea and the concept behind those fact than just learning about them . a person might know a fact , but if she doe not understand why such thing is happening , such a fact would not do any good to her . understanding is crucial , because it creates a huge impression on the mind of student while the fact impress them only when they hear about it . in most high school , the student in history class are exposed to fact . however , it is their responsibility to go home and understand why such thing happened in the past . it make logical connection between the event , which help the student to remember the fact even after a long time ha passed . moreover , the essay question on exam for such cources tend to ask why an event ha occured , asking teachers would not be asking such question on the exam were it not for the importance of them . understanding is important , because it is what brings change . when i wa younger , i did not feel any need to study . i wa getting decent grade at school wihtout much effort , even though i wa not the best . some told me that it might be a good idea for me to start studying , for it would make my future so much easier . however , i never listened . i knew that i would have to start studying someday , but did not believe it to be that moment . i started to work harder at the school only after i understood the fact that were known to me all along . i did not just know that i had to study , but i understood that if i do not , my life will be very different from the one i always dreamed of . i could finally understood , only after i met some student in their last year of high school regretting over the thing they have not done . if it were not for the understanding part of my experience , i might still be a slacker . learning fact is le important , because they can be found everywhere . the world we live in is now filled with information . therefore , we can look up the fact in second if we wanted to . understanding , however , can not be found on the internet . it is something that one need to try to achieve . therefore , it is more valuable than mere fact . understanding is more important , because it allows u to apply the idea on many field . it is possible to read a book a medical student might be required to read . however , if one can not understand what the book say , the information is useless to her . it can not be applied to anywhere else , and might be lost to her in second . since understanding brings change , requires effort , and make fact applicable , it is much more important than the learning fact . moreover , it will last help the fact to stay on one 's mind longer than learning without understanding .
