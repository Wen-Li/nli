in japan , which is my home country , some people may prefer a travel in a group led by a tour guide . however personally , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first , a group travel led by a tour guide prevents me from visiting place under my own decision and interest . for example , when i went to china in 1995 , i chose a group travel because chinese travel industry wa not matured in this time and then i had to pay more cost for a self travel by time consuming procedure like a visa premission than i did in a group travel . however , i missed visiting most interested place in china , a great wall by the unexpected change of tour schedule . second , a group travel led by a tour guide allows me not to study about the place by myself . for instance , when i went to spain with my wife , a tour guide provided u with much information about the place . however , because tour guide allowed u only to listen his explanation , my wife and i forgot almost all information which he gave . on the other hand , i went to thailand by myself in my college day . i prepared for the travel by reading many book related to the country . as a result of self preparation , i could enjoy whole travel . furtheremore , i can learn much information by heart because of self effort . of course , there are some advantage in traveling in a group led by a tour guide . for instance , in a group travel , i can enjoy a travel more safer than in a self travel . i have bad experience that i wa robbed my belonging in italy because i walked downtown in midnight alone . i believe that i could avoid such a dangerous accident by a group travel . however totally , on my opinion , a self travel 's benefit are not outweighed by those of a group travel . therefore , for the reason mentioned above , i completely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
