in my opinion successful people are more related in trying new thing but they are not necessarily more atraccted in taking risk . the reason for my thought is that people who are successful normaly lead a company or are the owner of some kind of business . therefore they have responsibility for many employee who are working in the firm . for example when the bos of a company want to develop a new , let say , a new car . the car work with a new technology which is much better for the environment but is not tested good yet and will probably not make much money . in my opinion the business leader should not take the risk to develop the car until it ha been well known in a country and ha reached high interest . because if it doe not work and nobody will buy the car the company will eventually be lost and the employee would be unemployed . nevertheless i think that successfull people are more willing to try new thing . they probably develop new thing and also give impulse for future . that mean that they are pre - thinker of future idea . in spite of my opinion i could imagine that there are successful people who take risk . these people normally are very self-confident and assure of themselves because they do not care of the people who depend on their decision . another topic to talk is the possibility to take risk in there free time , like a hobby . when something worse happens they will just be risponsable for themselves , expect they have child and wife . in conclusion i would say that successfull people tend to be more risk loving than others but they should be aware of their responsibility .
