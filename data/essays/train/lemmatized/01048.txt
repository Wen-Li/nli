knowledge is a complex process that requieres both theorical and practical concept to be present , in order to take place . that is why , i strongly disagree with the statement that indicates it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than to learn fact . i have been teaching `` introduction to civil law '' at my university to first year law student and i can assure your that , from my personal experience , student can only understand properly concept and idea , if they have an example from real life , from everydays life to support it . several reason explain this situation . first , student are familiar with fact , because they are involved in all kind of situation where fact are present . also , concept and idea are necessary in order to understand the fact , but if you do not have a fact that can ilustrate a real situation , then your student will probably forget the concept or the idea , because they are not going to find it any practical use . as a matter of fact , i have seen that the leasons i give to student that include a fact a an example of a concept or idea , are the leasons that student not only like the most , but show more interest in . i am not saying that concept and idea are not important . of course you need to teach student concept and idea , due to the fact that an important part of knowledge is based on them . but , if you do not add fact a a great resource in order to explain a concept or idea , then your student are not going to be able to relate both theorical and practical knowledge . bearing all this in mind , i have to say that i believe you can not choose between teaching concept or idea , or fact to your student , if you want them not only to understand what your are teaching them , but finding it a practical use in their life . you have to combine concept and idea with fact in your teaching method and that is the hardest part of all , but that is a different subject .
