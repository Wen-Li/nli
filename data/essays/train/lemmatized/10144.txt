i would agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their community nowadays . this is a result of the ongoing process of enstranging . people do not want to know their fellow people anymore . today no one know who his neighbour is . this is mainly a result of the increasing independence people enjoyed during the last decade . so why should younger people be different when the society ha taught them to be this way . young people are also not that political engaged like previous generation . one reason might be the huge amount of additional leisure offer you can choose from . you are mobile , so you can get to a disco or cafe at the evening . young people play at their pc or playstation . and that is more fun than getting involved in a party . but younger people are also tired of politics nowadays . they do not see politician a role model that encourage them to take the same career . politicians are boring , they are said to lie all the time and they serve not the interest of teenager but of adult . what is natural a most young people are not allowed to vote and so they are not interesting for politician . furthermore young people are very reluctant to work volunteerely for charity organization . i do not think that it is because young people do not care about these issue anymore but they are to busy to earn money with holiday job or similar activity to afford the thing they always wanted to buy . that is why we live in a society that is dedicated to consume all the time . even little kid are seduced via commercial in tv or radio to buy the product they actually do not need . for young people it is more important to have all the new stuff their friend have and that is why they do not have time to get involved in a charity organization .
