today , there are countless car on this planet . but are there suficient resource to maintain those car ? . i do n't think so . therefor i strongly disagree with the topic scentence . first , let 's think about the resource problem . even now , the price of the gas is increasing by second . in my oppinion , it show how resource are limited and how much we have spent . it is so simple that everyone can assume that , if there are limited resource and increasing demand for the fuel would make the reasource to be finish faster . so after twenty year , there will be fewer car . second , our tecnology in advancing like flesh light of camera . i can imagine how long will we use car by , for example , i remember there wa cummunicating system which can only accept the phone call . but it wa disapered after mobile phone wa invented eventhough it wa very popular in my country . therefor advancing tecnology would not let car to remain after twenty year after . the last reason that i suppots my idea might be the pollution problem . cars are creating pollution like air , noise . that refer to we need more advnced type of transport . in conclusion , i claimed that after twenty year there will be fewer car . in supporting passage , i said that scaresity of resource and rapid advancing tecnology and need for advanced transpots reason for polluting environment .
