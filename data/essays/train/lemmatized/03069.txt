there are diffferent type of people and different life style in the world . answering such a quastion of `` do young people enjoy life more than older people `` is therefore very hard . i personally agree this claim because of young people 's physical and mental advantage , time of young people live provide more entertainment . firstly , because of the effect of passed year all human become old and their physical atributes fell down , for example they can not run a fast a they can before , they need more time to sleep any way they can not do what they want . their body doe not let old people to do what they want . on the other hand young people have more energy , they are stronger and they can spent more time to enjoy themselves . for the reason older people lived their younger time more enjoyable their wish to enjoy themselves , become le important . because they did these action before and they are full of experience , the do not need to revise these action . on contrary , young people have more interest on enjoyable action for their life , they want to try , they want to know consequence and they want to taste all piece of life . in addition , by the time and improved technology , more entertaining enjoyable condition are provided to the new generation . they have an option of internet , rapid transportation oppotunities to be with people they enjoy besides more complex such a ; sporting area , cinema , theathers provide young people more place to spent their time enjoyable . however , these opppotunities were not chance of older people . because they enjoyed their life with limited way to sum up , younger people enjoy life more than older people because of two reason that they have better physical and mental ability accordong to older people , also more opportunity provided to them to enjoy themselves .
