i strongly agree with latrer statement that it is better to have knowledge in a specific subject . my reason for the agreement for specilization in a specific subject are a follows . it is a compulsory required for every one to get well skilled in any field for their survival . for this every one must study a particular subject of their interest . for example , a computer programmer , a surgeon , etc , . these people who are well trained regarding to their field subject can survive better by serving to both company and public . for example a specialist in heart surgery may serve people and often will bring a good name for his hospital . like that an economist can serve better for his country . onthe other hand if one have a broad knowledge of many academic subject like maths , physics , chemistry , economics , etc. , it seems great of his knowledge , but it will become difficult for him to choose in which field he can serve better . obviously , he can not able to choose any two option . if he chooese any one , after a short period his mind may think of another field that he is familiar with and surelyhe might be confused . how ever it is better to have askill on one subject that we are familiar . even the great scientist also specialized in one specific subject only . for example late sir newton . heis a very great scientist who wa familiar with physics . his major work in physic brought a new revolution in the field of physical science a they solved many problem . finally , i strongly believe in that the person must be specialized in only one subject rather than having broad knowledge in many subject .
