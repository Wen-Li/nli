ideas and concept will play a major role in the development any product or component . so , i strongly accept that a student ha to understand idea and concept . in today world we have come accrosed many robust and complicated product . for example , car , computer and many automated machine . these product were developed by engineer by understanding proper background information of it and it working principle , to get all these thing done we need to understand the concept and idea of it . for example , to design a bike , we have to understand the working principle and what is exactly required in order to make it work in an efficient way . when we understand the above need we can have an idea to fabricate it . today we have many student who are very dull in their study and they just memorise the answer and reproduce the same in the exam paper . but they dont understand the concept of the chapter or working of a particular componentand , eventually when they finish there education they will not have ability to implement the concept to develop a product because they have not understood the concept well . so , today science and technology ha many complicated concept were student are finding difficult to learn it . sometimes , fact also required to learn from fact . for example , when a solid object is immersed in water , an equall amount of water is displaced out which is equal to the weight of the solid object whic is a fact that can be seen . this information is very usefull for marine engineer which is got by a fact . so , i always understand the concept and idea in any subject rather then giong by a fact . i have done this from my childhood and helped me a lot to learn so that i can implement the same to invent more and more product which is favorable to the people .
