many people think , young people have enjoyable life and they think old people do not enjoy life a much a young people do . i agree with people who think like that . i have several valid reason which support my idea . first of all , yaung people enjoy life more because , thay are full of energy and that cause them to do anything in any time . for instance , if a young person decides to do something hard , that person achieves that aim very easyly , but an old person can not doe that thing easyly and it cause dissapointment and that disapointment make old person unhappy . for me an unhappy life is equal to an unenjoyable life . secondly , young people have lot of time and because of that , they do not have to be in a hurry to do something , but old people think they have several year to live so , they try to do lot of thing at the same time and that make their life unenjoyable . young people are looking forward to future but old people do not . old people heve disapointment about their past experience but young people do not because they have lot of time to fix those disapintments . the last but not least , old people have health problem due to , their age . because of that , they need to stay at hospital or need private support and i think that make them to live their life unenjoyablely . young people do not have to spend their time at hospital due to , health problem . they can spend their time more enjoyable with doing different thing such a , travel pleying pc or dating with their friend . all in all a i mentioned before young people live their life more enjoyable rather than old people do . because , old people have health problem and they are not energetic and thay are not strong enough to do entertaining thing . the long and the short of it is that , old people are not able to do thing that they want to do and that make their life unenjoyable .
