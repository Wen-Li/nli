as a journalism student , i think that it 's more important learn the fact than anything else , so i 'm totally disagree with the statement . i ca n't understand how can be possible that you can learn and appreciate more the idea or the concept than the fact itself . you do n't think is better evaluate and re-evaluate the fact and then establish your own idea ? in my opinion , learning concept and idea , is learning what other people learned about the fact . using others a a referencial group is n't bad or wrong . but the point is that learning fact make you responsable for whatever you learned . in other word you just did n't follow anothers opinion , anothers concept or idea . you create your owns , and if they 're wrong , then you evaluate your own concept or idea . precisely , is more objective the fact itself . think of this : if you learned first the idea or concept , in some way you already know something and just stay in that line , but if you go directly to the fact you can have your own knowledge . .. created by you .
