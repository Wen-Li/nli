travelling is one of the most popular pastime . most people are usually plan to travel across the country or overseas in their own life . they enjoy talking about diverse experience where each person traveled . from my experience , i agrees with the travel in a group led by a tour guide with some economical and exciting reason . firstly , i like to travel in group led by a tour guide bacause i can save more money and time . a tour guide is professional enough to give u more infomation fitted to place what we want to travel . in addition , a tour guide need to compete other agency , and it try to give more benefit for it client . a tour guide also ha a lot of experienced information about what i want to travel , so it is kind to consult to give information . the more important reason for agreeing is that we enjoy much more than traveling with a several of people for themselves . we can have chance to socialieze a lot of new people . if we travel around unfamiliar place alone , it is difficult to first talk about unfamiliar people . so it can be alone . however , traveling in group first it is easy to talke about each other . to sum up , i recommend the travel in a group led by a tour guide in term of economial and pleasing point .
