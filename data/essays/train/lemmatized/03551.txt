when faced to the question that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , different people had disaparate view for that . in my poit of view , i agreed the view that successful people should try various and new thing and take many risk . here i will explore some significant and conspicious reason a follows : the first reason to support my opnion is that in oder to make big contribution to the society where we live and a the pregress of the society , more and more thing need people who have higher skill and excellent abillities to do the tought staff . therefore , people should face this situtuation and try their best to do the this a good a he/she can , especially , for those successful people . they shoud adapt the new environment and at the same time , the successful people should try thier best to concentrate on some new tecnologies , such a knowing the skill of how to do well about computer . what is worth noticing that trying new and creative thing can help people to improve their characteristic , especially it is good for people to become brave . for example , masier is one of the famous artist in the art fieds , and he is very famous for the harmony art . at the begining , he can not find the key element of art , but he did not give up it . after taking risk about art and hard working again and agian , finally , he becomes a very excellent artist in the art field . another reason is that trying new thing can make people more hard working on the thigs what you concentrate on . the process will let people not easily to say give up and try their best to do well for thier thing and this will provide a big chace for them to find aa good job and become succeful in the end . in conclusion , i agree that the successful people should try nem thing and take risk rather only doing what they already know how to do well .
