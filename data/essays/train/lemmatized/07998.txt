many thing make the person sucssesfull in his society , and what you exist of experience in your life will addition your ability to face many problem in your life . first of all these two choises have thier benefit in our life , but when i ought to chose one of them i will chose the first choise , because it more suitable to me , in my opinion the person must have many different knowledge and many different subject because knowing is a very useful thing to the person in many way like to become a useful person in this life and it will improve his behaviour to do and speak well , for example i face some difficulty to read many subject in 2005 because i have a test that major my ability , and if i pas this test i will take a present but it very valuable present , when i get home with frustrating didnt passing the test , and without any present my mother said to me , that not every thing in our life is money , present and so on , but we have many benefit thing to upset to dont have it like the knowledge . if i had a good knowledge i would pas the test , then i understoond that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to have the present . so always when the person have the chance to learn dont miss his chance and to try many time to get it , because you will if you have the well . so each person must have the ability to learn and to learn and have many knowledge because nothing will stay forever like the knowledge , and we heared about many scholors who faced many hard situation but they complete thier study and thier learning and teaching also to let this sciense pas to many people . finally no one have adoubt that knowledge is the most important thing and the key to many achievement in our life .
