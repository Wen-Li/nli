i definitely agree with the statement . in my point of view . the willingness and determination on trying new thing and taking risk are significant the the successful people . there are couple of reason to support my view . to begin with , i think nothing is impossible . to make my point clearer , i mean sometimes if you do not try new thing , you would not know you actually can achieve the goal . for my own experience , i had attended an outward bound course last summer . everyone were forced to take a harsh task . that wa to jump into the sea on the ship . everyone wa shocked a that time a i remembered . but in the end , all the member , including myself did finish the task . we were all so proud of ourselves . to other people , it seemed nothing to them . but in our heart , we knew that it wa once a successful experience we had . apart from that , taking risk is a must for you to succeed . everything do exist a risk . in my own experience , a i would like to improve my badminton skill in order to compete for an award in a competition , i had pay extra effort on my daily practise before i have the competition . what is so risky to me is that , practise much more time than other normal day would have a greater chance to get injured . at the end , of course i did n't get hurt , but it pave the way to my succeed-the champion of that competition . finally , i would like to raise one more example . that is the man who invented microsoft . when he wa studying his first year in the university , he decided to left school and concentrated on developing the idea of microsoft . he wa oringinally already good at computer and to fulfilm his dream , he ignored the risk of ca n't graduate in the university . and of course , his development on the software wa so successful that almost everyone were using the software he invented . to conclude , if you think you ca n't achieve a goal without trying and taking risk , you will definitely not to be succeed in your future .
