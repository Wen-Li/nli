the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today '' is very strong . i disagree with it because we do not really know what could happen in the future to change our mind in that way , it would be a very radical change . nowadays , the number of car in use in growing because people ha to commute to go to work or to study to the university . the distance between our home and the place where we want to go make u to use the car . for example , we are 4 adult in my family and we have more that one car , and every day each one use our own car to our daily live . spain is a small country in comparison to others . but it doe not mean that we use le the car . thus , i could imagine what happens in the big country , where distance between tow point are bigger , everyone use their own car because is faster and you do not need to wait for public transport . i know that this actitud doe not help the environment , it cause a lot of pollution to the atmosphere . but every day , in our comunity , we listen the advice to leave the car at home and use public tranport , and we still use our own car , we do not care about the pollution if we need to use the car . it is more confortable for u . another inconvenience of using the car is the lack of parking in the city , but the local goverbent is building new parking to solve this problem . then i do not think that this problem could make that people use le their own car . i know that there are negative effect of using my car but i prefer to feel confortable , to arrive quickly to my destiny ( work , party ... ) and it also allow u to be more independent .
