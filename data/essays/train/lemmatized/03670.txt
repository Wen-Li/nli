some people claim that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . however , i hold a opposing view due to the following resons : first , gaining in-deth knowledge on many academic subject would be extremely time consuming . studying many different kind of subject requires the student to spend a lot of time and effort in it . in this way , the student can only learn some superficial knowledge about each subject but can not really have a very in-depth understanding of the subject . on the other hand , studying one specific subject can allow you to specialize in it and acquire thorough and in-depth knowledge about the subject . in addition , many career are specialist and thus require the specific knowledge of that particular subject . for example , being a lawyer you need to have specific knowledge about the law term , the judiciary system and the judiciary situation of the place you want to work in . you can not enter those specific career unless you specialize and acquire in-depth knowlegde about that academic subject . last but not least , having specialized in one specific subject can offer you chance to investigate the field which is not touched by people before . you can hardly discover new thing or finding in your study unless you have in-death and specific knowledge in that particular subject . for example , if you want to pose a revolution in astronomy study , you need to specialize yourself in it , spending lot of time and effort in it or else it would be impossible for you to make any revolutionary finding . one can see that the previous scientist who triggered off scientific revolution are those who spent their life time in the study of science . to conclude , i believe that specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge on many different subject but with superficial knowledge only .
