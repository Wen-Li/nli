in our day , the young people seem to be concerned only by themselfes . between helping their community ortake care about themselfes , their choice is usually the same : do what they enjoy . but people should not sometimes do thing that they do not enjoy doing ? do not the society provides also this behaviour ? in our day , the society is one of leisure . the most important thing is to have fun when you can do it during the sparetimes . young people live in another world , a world where everithings is possible and where everythings have to be funny . as many adult do , young people do not take care about their environnement and also about the other people . but it is an especially behaviour of young people or it is the most part of the population who do that ? for me the probleme come from the mentality . they have changed . before we did not refused to help our neighbour and moreover that wa perfectly normal . now , if somebody doe that , it is like an miracle . why this change ? maybe due to the new dream of the life witch is to know the happiness or maybe it is only a losing of the closness between people hat we had . many possibility are true but i thing the most importante one is that we changed into a society where we are more lonely and we do not like who we do not know thus , i agree that young people do not give enought time to think about something else than them . although the condition of living have changed a the mentality , i thinkit will be very harmful to become to individual .
