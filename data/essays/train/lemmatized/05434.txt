nowadays , car virtually become part of our daily life . it is hard to imagine what the life will be without a car . we drive car to shool , to office , to shoping mall , and , on weekend , to national park . but if you ask me what will be the case twenty year later , i would hazard a guess that there will be fewer car ! to begin with , energy shortage loom larger nowadays . recent year wittness the skyroketing the crude oil price is an example to illustrate the demand for oil far excess the supply of it . the excess demand drive the price of the fuel drastically , so people will find it expensive to drive a car . probably using public transportation is a more economical choice to travel to school , to office and so on . in that case there will be fewer car in use . another reason that may attribute to the shrinking of car usage is that car , through burning fossil fuel , will pollute the environment . the exhaust of car contains large amount of toxic gas such a sulfur and nitrigen oxicide , etc . when the pollution becomes more and more severe , the government will take measure to control the expansion of car . the most possible measure are to levy higher tax on using car and to grant le driving licence to driver . under such condition , people will have le incentive to buy car and use car . in addition , the room for accomodating more car is very limited . today we already feel very crowded on road and parking lot . if car continue to expand , we will have more and more severe traffic jam , which will render car transportation slow . if people find that they are always late in class or office , they will resort to alternative mean of transportation such a bicycle and subway . taking into consideration all these factor mentioned , private car driver a well a potential car buyer may think twice before using car . twenty year later , car may turn out to be an expensive and inconvenient way of going out .
