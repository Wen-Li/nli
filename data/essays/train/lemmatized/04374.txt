publicity is everywhere in our life ; it spread from the billboard across the street to the 5 minute coming right at peak suspense of our favorite tv show . the idea of publicity is to make customer want to buy one product . there are several way to achieve this goal , whether you make your audience laugh , or you get them excited or thrilled . the point is to make them feel good about themselves . for that , a no product itself can do that rightaway , it seems obvious to me that most advertiser to make their product look better than they really are . first , we can see that there is an issue of subjectiveness a it come to deciding wether or not a product is shown `` better '' than he really is . there can be different point of view about the `` goodness '' of a product . but generally , no product reach in real life the level of greatness that advertisement show . what is interesting to notice is that people are wholly aware of the exagerations that advertisement provide , but they agree to think that it is part of the game . no one actually belief everything that is shown on television . they know they wo n't yum everytime they eat a yoghurt , and they wo n't have an orgasm everytime they drink their coffee . this system preserve itself . if an advertisement ha hard time sticking strictly to it product real quality , the product will look flat compared to the other product displayed . it show that an advertisement doe have to emphasize and improve the quality of the product it is advertising for . of course there are legal limitation to the extense advertiser can get in making their product look good : this is important not to get into lie a far a quality is concerned . to conclude , i think that it is in the essence of advertisement to show people an idealistic world
