i agree that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they are already know how to do well '' . as we are in the 21 century , the world is fast changing , so we need to keep learning new thing so that we can keep up with the world 's step . if someone want to be susseccful , only follow the others is definitly not enough . a successful man , a talent , must know have to lead behind the people , he must always be one step faster than the ordinary people , thus taking risk is quite necessary . only follow the tradition and rule and do the thing `` what they already how to do well '' will never make people successful and even may destroy them , make them the one how can not follow the changing world . people should not hesitate to take risk . talents take risk , they never afriad of losing because it will only make them stronger . no one can deny that thomas edison is a successful man . he is probably the most famous inventor of the world ; he is the father of modern light . what doe a inventor do everyday ? he take risk . if thomas edison ha not invented modern light , the world will be complete different today . another example of successful people try new thing and take risk is founder of microsoft corporation , bill gates . he ha studied in a famous university but he ha stopped doing `` what he already know how to do well '' . he ha quited from the university and ha started his own business . now , he is the richest man is the world . he owns billion of dollar and everyone who ha a personal computer use his `` windows '' software program . he is successful and he take risk . `` only doing what they already know how to do well '' only make people nobody . every year , million of skilled and experienced old worker in developing country like china , retire from factory . they have kept doing their work , `` what they already know how to do well '' every workday . when they finally retired , they have found that they are nobody and are not successful at all . it is their fault that they have not taken risk . if they have started business or got other creative idea , they may have much better life now . in conclusion , successful people are more likely to take risk .
