today , car are an important object of our life , it ha become one of the base of our life and a great mean of transportation . it is also a symbol of freedom and independance for both young and older people . but with the progressive disparition of crude oil , we could wonder how it will be in 20 year . to answer this question , i will see in a first part that there are no sign showing a decrease of car in use and in a second part that there will even be an increase of car in use but different car . fisrt of all , i do n't think that there will be fewer car in use in 20 year , i mean 20 year , it is nearly tomorrow ; the situation can not change so fast . nowaday , we are in a mass consumption society , which consommates a lot of all material object and especially car . a statistic have be done and show that car are not a familiiy object anymore but are now an individual good , so it prof the increase of car bought . moreover , in 20 year there wo n't be other mean of transportation a developped a the car is nowaday . there will be new car but still at their bgin . today the scientistic research can not propose a mean of replacement to the car . at the contrary , i think that the number of car in use will still increase for some decade , but it wo n't be the same car that we have today . everybody know that there are le and le oil in the reserve , that pit are going to be empty in some decade and that the price of crude oil is always and steadily increasing . but all this fact do n't mean the end , the death of car . it only show that we need new source of energy and new ressources , such a water , sun , vegetal element . we are only mooving to a new type of car , a new age . today , there are already test which are made for new car but it is not developped enougn to be sell and use . there are some prototype of car using water a energy but it is still a begin . to sum up , i do n't agree with this statememt ; at the contrary , i think that there will be more car in 20 year that there are today . there will certainly be le car using crude oil but more and more car using new energy
