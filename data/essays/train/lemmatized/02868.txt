yes i agree with the statement , because logic of the car in a city is always based on the fact that there is a fuel present in , on which it can run . so the basic fact should be that - presence of fuel in abundance . but that is not the case , a we all know fuel ( petrol , diesel ) are non renewable souces of energy . the fuel take thousand of year ro come in to being , but they are reducing faster a compare to their presence with u . so in return their price are increasing day by day . and people have already started taking for different alternative like cng ( compressed natural gas ) , lpg ( liquified petroleum gas ) . but the irony is that these option are also non renewable . so somewhere down the line the price of fuel wether in any form which i have talked about will be so high that middle class and upper middel class will not be able to afford it and hence they will use public transport to commute . so that class vehicle will not be prent on road wether car or two weheeler . after sometime say 10 yr more the fact will hit the upper class too and we will not have any car or vehicle on road . the time line about this danger , which i have already given in the above discussion is so predictable that one can have even calculation about it if he/she ha both the population and existing fuel count . they should also have the rate at which fuel are getting depleted . so the best way to tackle the proablem is to find out renewable source of energy through which one can commute to different place . surely the work ha already been started , because the affect of this fear is already noticable in the current scenario .
