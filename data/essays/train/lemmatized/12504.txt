i agree to the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i will explain the reason why . first , the purpose of advertisement is to make people buy or consume those product . to accomplish this purpose , the weakness of the product should be hided and the strength of them must be emphasized . for example , in an tv advertisement for a medicine used for impotence , the people make that advertisement try to persuade people with impotence by using different stimulation such a visual signal and sound . when i watch it , i think i should try some day even i do n't have that problem . they comment some side effect at the end of the advertisement in very fast speed and use ambiguous word such a `` may '' , `` some '' , `` rare '' or `` most '' . second , through advertisement , the qualties of the product will be exaggerated because the producer of the product try to beat their competitor . let 's think about the competition between coca cola and pepsi cola . they use different advertisement strategy to beat their competitor . they add nice-smelling cherry flavor to attract the people like sweet taste . they develop a low calorie cola named `` diet coke '' or `` diet pepsi '' even these product do not contribute reducing weight . in conclusion , i agree to the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
