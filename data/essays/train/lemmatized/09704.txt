althogh , some people think that student need only to learn the fact , i totally to agree with understanding the concept and the idea . there are many reason for which student need to understand the basic idea . one of the reason is that the student will only use the concept and the idea from which they have been taught . understanding the concept is more important than the fact in that the concept can be involved in any suitable application . for example , a student in a physic class will propably need to understand the formula before he or she wil be able to solve the problem . another reason is that when the student learn some fact , it is easy to forget them . this is beacuse they need to be memorized . also , every information that is stored in the brain can be lost if it is not used repeatedly . therefore , understanding is much easier than memorizing . an aditional reason is that understanding is more effective in developing new thing than learning fact . to illustrate that , supposed a student in a physic college tried to memorize the content of the course without giving any care to understanding it . the student surely will find a lot of trouble in his life if he or she try to prove a new theory realtive to the information that have been taught . hence , if the student understood the course without memorizing the content , the student will be able comperhend with the life challenge . one final reason is that fact doe not provide any thinking . it is either right or wrong . on the other hand , understanding the concept can be duplicated to obtain some other new concept . for example , the conflict between the relativity and the law of motion can not be solved unless both of them are understood . once the concept is understood , the solution for such a conflict can be solved . which gave rise into a new concept called `` the string theory '' . in conclusion , understanding the idea is much easier than just memorizing the fact that are concret and non-negotiable .
