i disagree with this statement . actually it 's true that understand idea and concept are important for student . however , even the student have those thing , i think the learning doe not work without the learning fact for the student . when i wa in grade 7 and 8 , i could not success with my study that much , because i did not try to study hard at the time . however , i wa changed my mind by my mother 's word when i wa in grade 9 . and i could think that i have to study and if i study i will get good mark than before . since then i studied hard , and my effort wa permitted from my teacher . and my mark wa getting high like i have ever seen or i could not imagine before . when i got the report card from those teacher , they wrote some masseges for my mother about me on the report . and it said `` she changed a lot in this year . i knew that she is a person who have good unerstanding knowlegdes and nice learner , but she did n't try to work hard before . so her mark were low , but she tried to study so hard in this year . i felt she grew up little bit , and i am glad to see her many great idea and imagination and also i felt her good attitude in those class . i learned from your daugnter that even if we have good quality , if we did n't think we want to show the quality , the good quality never get great quality . '' when i saw the massage , i felt so happy and i thought i will keep studying hard for me , my family who support me , and those teacher who i got when i wa in junior high . from my experience , i think it is more important for student to learn fact than it is for student to understand idea and cocepts .
