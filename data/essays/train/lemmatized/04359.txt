somebody sais : young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community . i agree with that for sure . first , young people always busy for their own business such a hand out with friend , spend few time to do the homework , spent time on the cell phone to know what happen with their friend today , watching tv and play video game etc . it 's not kind of selfish but they just do n't care about other thing which doe n't matter to them , for example , so something helping community . second , except young people do n't want to spent time on helping community . they do n't understand why they have to , or what can they get from doing that thing . however , cause young people to do n't care about too much thing it might because they do n't ever know how is the feel to helping cimmunities and helping people also . they might would like to helping communites after they know that is more interesing than playing video game and talking on the cell phone .
