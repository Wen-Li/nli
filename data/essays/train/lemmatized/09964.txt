in the above paragraph author state that succesful people are take more risc rather than only doing what they allready know thing are how to do well . how ever the successful people are innovate new thing to develope the country more effectively , because they know everything on perticular work in that time they need to spend some time for the main drawback of a work and how they avoid it , for thaat they are need to think effectively and take more risk to implement the new thing . for example we take an eroplanes , an eroplanes are invented by wright brothors they very common people in the world , because they implemented an eroplanes by using a bird . one day they think that how the bird are flying in the air . in that time they got one idea , yhe bird are having wing . so it wa flis in the air . the wright brother are differently and take more risk to implement an eroplane . therefore what i am telling that the people who are thinking diferently from what they already known . if they are thinking similarly about the work . they do n't get any new idea and they are not succeeded in that perticular work . i conclude that the succeeded people who allready know the work how to do well in that time also they having a chance to implement the new thigs , but they are not thinking in a broader way . the sucesfu l people are allways trying to implement new thing , because they allready know how to do the work . to implement new thing it take more time and enthusiausm to learn the work then only they are didicated to implement the new thing .
