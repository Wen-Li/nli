regarding the statement , i disagree with the statement . i believe that people should study one specific subject for their knowledge and it make your life enrich . because you can learn a specific subject deeply that you are very interested in . also if you have a lot of knowledge for specific subject , it will be your asset and you can be a specialist at work . first of all , you usually select a major from your interest . it indecates that you are interested in your subject basically so you can learn lot of thing from the subject . so once you can enjoy to learn the subject then you can also get lot of knowledge . on the other hand , if you learn many subject that you are not so interested in , i suppose that it could not be useful knowledge . secondally , it would be expand your career option if you could get a lot of knowledge of specific subject . according to the recent news pepar , called nikkei , many company tend to hire specialsts than generalist . because specialist already have knowledge for specific subject so a company doe n't need to provide a training to them . but for generalist , they need get training when they start a job to get specific knowledge and skill . for conclusion , i would like to say that it is better to specialize in one specific subject that make your life meanful and enrich .
