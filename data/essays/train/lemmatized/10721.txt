some people believe that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . it seems to me , however , they get to be spending their time to supporting their community . there are three reason for this . first of all , increasingly , in these day , the school introduced the social communication class in the program , and young student especially student in junior hight school and high school join their community by cleaning their town , helping senior and so on . it might be a compulsory education in the first place ; however because of this educational system , young people are aware of the importance of this activity , and gradually intended to join it afterwards . secondly , it seems that young people are getting the leader position in a lot of community to contribute in these day . in some area in our country , japan , there are some activity which put the the age limit ( 25-30 year old ) to be a member of social community . moreover in order to attract the young people , some community offer the special reward , such a paying the salary or providing land . thanks to these activity , young people are more getting involved and helping their community by teaching sport , their culture , and so on . finally , in these day , it is frequently mentioned that now is the time of changing generation in japan . as you may see the election of prime ministor in japan , mr. shinzo abe , who is the youngest prime ministor , wa just elected few week ago . thanks to this trend , it seems that young people positively get to feel that they have more chance and power to join their community to achieve and help something more , even though they are too busy to spend their time to do this kind of voluntieer work . in conclusion , using these above reason a a basis , i would mention that young people nowdays have positive intention to help their community .
