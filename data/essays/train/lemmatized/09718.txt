i think it is not so simple to explain about this . why ? because i ask this question to myself different time . i am a student . i study civil enginnering in milan . during my different exam i have found some important subject : general subject ( for example math ) and specific subject ( for example road construction or structural design ) . general subject help you to understand the specific subject . but the problem is this : when i will take my degree people will see me a civil enginner . what i can do in particular is not important . i think that university must teach different accademic subject , so you can have a wide vision about a work , like a civil enginner . after a degree , every person will improve his knoledge in one specific subject . in my situation , for example , a civil enginner will specialize in road construction or skyscraper or off shore structure . it depends what part of civil enginner he like .
