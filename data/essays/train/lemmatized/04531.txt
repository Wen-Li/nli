in the context of constant competition between product and trademark , what make them different ? is it the product , the advertising or the trademark ? we 'll see that `` false '' advertising is necessary for a company and is controlled by the rule od competition . at last , we 'll see that advertising is n't the product underneath but much more a identifying suggestion for custumers . first , a company that launch a product can not possibly find a large scale of custumers without promoting it . therefore , a company need advertisments to exist or to continue existing . with the law of competition , the advertising is in a way self-controlled . as we saw last week with `` l'oreal '' , a company can not say anything in an advertisment . they have to be able to proove their assertion in an advertising campaign otherwise other company will sue it for a lack of accuracy that dammage the market competition . second , the company usually `` lie '' about their product because they wo n't tell you immediatly the side effect or problem you might encoutered with the use of the product . advertising will sell you the good effect of the product . but , i do not think the real matter is the product underneath . i mean more and more advertising do not sell you a product directly but an underground , an atmosphere or a celebrity . in a way , advertisments are here to held you identify a trademark , the one you want to look like or lifestyle you want . and , a advertising campaign is more like a dream maker , suggesting that you need the product if you want to achieve a certain lifestyle or look like a celebrity but it did n't tell you that you will achieve it . advertising just show you the way because : `` you worth it '' and `` just do it '' . to finish , advertising might lie on a product because they only show the good side of the product but they ca n't be exagerated and the real challenge of a advertisement is n't to sell you a product but to keep you for life .
