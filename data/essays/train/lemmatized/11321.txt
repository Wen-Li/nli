i totally agree with the statement that it is more important to understand idea and concept than learning fact . firstly , only learning fact is something which is kind of simple . everybody is able to do this . it is not a special feature of student . just learing thing by heart is something which you have done in primary school , and of course it is good to do that there but not at highschool or at university . besides it ist not important anymore to know many fact because there are so many book , and of course the internet , where you can search for everything you want to know . secondly , a fast a you can learn fact a fast you will forget them again . so it is much more of interst to learn where you can find them than knowing them in detail . that 's why i think it is enough to know the book or the homepage where you can find the information you are looking for than knowing the information . thirdly , learning how to understand idea and concept of thing will help the student to come along in there life after their studying time . when they will have a job they will not be asked for fact such a how many people live in ohio , but they have to come along with more complex quesions where they have to use their ability to understand the idea and concept of for instance a new project oder product and to combine this knowledge . lastly , it is not only good for the student ' job-lifes but also for their private life to understand the general idea of thing . for example when reading the newspaper it is much more of interest to verify critical statement than learning the exact number of the people who died in the iraq war . so all in all you can see that the ability to understand the gist of thing is more relevant than just learning fact .
