students should learn fact more than understnading idea and concept . there are two reason for this : effectiveness and usefullness . it is much effective lean thing with fact because you can picture the idea instead of pondering them for a long time . the physic class is the most typical example for this . it is not easy to underestand the gravity and speed on earth by leaning formules such a e = m3 . however , nobody would doubt the fact when the train stop there is a resistace of the speed . moreover , fact enable u to pictureize the idea . we know that how atomicbomb are deadly neagative for human-being and it should not be utilized ever again . but the idea itself is not a strong a an experience which we can still see through film and visiting hiroshima and ngasaki in japan where atomic bomb were thrown . it is a direct effect to re-experience thing visually and sensitively . facts are more usefull on our daily life rather than ideal concept . the concept of economic theory doe not represent the society but the currency rate are more familier to u and inevitally affect our life . when we travel to other country , we care largely about the currency rate where we go on a trip . the strength of money affect the strength of the purchase during the trip . thus , it is usefull to study how the world monetary system is working . therefore , i support that it is better to learn fact before understanding idea and concept . the fact give u more direct knowlges . it also massively affect our daily life .
