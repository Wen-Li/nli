i disagree with this statement for two reason . at first , it would be quite difficult for student to understand idea or concept , if they do not learn fact of them , or even let the student a misunderstand , to learn fact is not necessary . when a history teacher in high school teach student about a compared between industry socialty and agriculture socialty . both of the defnitions are easy to remmeber , but how to understand the difference ? acturlly student have kown the fact of industry by their living , even before the teacher explains the fact . they know that industry ha producted our model life , from telephone to internet , from car to jet . to try to understand , what doe mean agricalture ? just let u live without all the fact of industry . however , to understand idea and concept is not the full task for student , and not even the goal to study from the beginning . as adult , we know it now , the right way to handle the knowledge is to use it . teachers should let the student know , good memorry about idea and concept is just helpful in some exam , but not in working and living . in china we have many negative example , because school were only concerntreting on teaching about exam in last 20 year . a famous emploryer complained that he did not dare to hire the people who achieved doctor degree in china . because they knew the concept very well , but failed to use them in practical , and they did not know a good communication is the key in a team to use the concept in fact . as i went to germany and began my college study in stuttgart . i knew in first time , most of thing i had learned till my high school have only one goal , that is to use them in fact . i began a lot of course to learn fact there , from communication to techique . that is the key .
