one attempt to take risk of trying new thing when another doe not . in my opinion , the latter would be successful in his life . because when one try to learn everything , he doe not obtain anything i think . first of all , it is important that one ha his part in a group . when i wa in a volleyball team , i wa doing the power hitter of the team . i especially practiced for hitting rather than receiving . in comparison , my teammate who were at the back side position were particularly practicing for the receiving . it is important that one try to obatain one skill in depth rather than just to touch everything . secondly , when i wa a kid , i always tried to order a dessert of which i hardly ever heard of ; a a result , i many time had hard time finishing them up because of the weird taste or not used to them . this illustrates how new thing make people careless of thinking about choosing it before acting . because i wa fascinated by the fact that it wa a new thing to me , i did not really care about what kind of food i liked and how it will be to order it . thirdly , many people who can continue to keep on doing one thing are exparts of something in most of the case . because they can remain to think about how to improve their skill of them and are able to keep practicing for such long time , they can get the skill fully . for instance , my ex-calligraphy teacher wa of course really good at calligraphy . she used to learn it since she wa in the elementary school and still keep on practicing for herself . it is not always easy to learn one thing for almost entire of one 's life . as a result of practicing for such long time , she could become a teacher of calligraphy . in conclusion , i personally believe that it is the way to success to keep focusing on one thing rather than always try to start new thing . even though i admit that there could be more chance to find the thing one is good at if she always take a risk of trying , once one find the thing to work on , there is no more need for one to find another one . she just need to become an expert of it .
