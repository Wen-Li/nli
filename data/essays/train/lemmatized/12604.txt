during my academic education of biology , i studied a wide variety of topic . beside my major subject , ecology and zoology , i took class in botany , genetics and physiology . after getting this scientific overview i specialized on the biology and ecology of spider , which wa also the topic of my diploma thesis . later , during my phd thesis , i very glad having received a scientific overview espacially in botany and zoology because i needed the knowledge of very different topic to conduct different field - and laboratory assay . to my opinion , it is not a mistake to take very different class at the university , if this is still possible . this is because then you have the possiblity to choose the subject you like most and on which you can then specialize later in your study . furthermore , you never know , which knowledge you will need for a future job . if you have a broad but superficial knowledge of some subject , you are always able to intensitfy your study and get more specialized in the desired topic . unfortunately , the educational system at most university in germy have changed since my tand mostly , it is no longe possible to study all subject simultaneously due to limited money resource . often you have to choose your major before getting registered at a university . i think this is not a good development at university , becouse no one know what fure will bring and which qualification are needed when people have finished their university degree .
