the world is turning to be a more demanding place , especially when refering to the work enviroment . many people think that it is better to study a very specific topic and hope to be accepted in a company that work with this field of knowledge , while other perople think that it is convenient to study a many different but related subject so that his job will become easyer for him to do . the person that ha knowledge in different topi is a complet person compared to one that only focus on one subject . knowing that for example there are more and more founding when refering to science , a perosn every day more find the time and will to study interrelated subject to the specific topic he work for , like in the case of a medical doctor : every day there are new finding of any disease that imply a minimun knoledge in chemistry or physic and if a doctor only focus on the anatomic part of the person or on the biological part of the problem , he may sometimes not be able to figure out what is happening to the person , if instead this physician is aware of new finding and ha taken course about realted subject , he will not necessarilly have a hard time knowing what the problem is . science can not live without history for the study of any situation or a we know history can not exist without fact that occur in a society , that could involve art or science finding or political situation that are then trully link to one another . sooner or later we will all agree with the fact that science , history subject , art major or any other possible topic will all be in need of each other ( if not are ) and that they all come toghether to form the world that we are today .
