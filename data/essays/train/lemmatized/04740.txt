i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in three reason , it can be proved , exazageration , repeating , and useing famous person . first of all , exageration is good evidence . some company can not lie about the it production . however , they usually use other factor in advertisement . for example , there are many heathy people and they always smile in the madicine advertisement . even though people usually get a medicine when they sick , the advertisement always shsw healthy and happy people . the consumer might think that they could be healthy if they get the medicine . but , it is wrong . this is exageration of advertisement . second , many company usually use famous person for advertisement . if a famous person say '' this is good product . and i am useing this product everyday. '' , people believe it . people believe it because they are famous person . but , usually the product is not concerned with the famous person . people think that they can be nice if they use it . but it is wrong because it is just advertisement . third , repeating is one of method many company can use in their advertisement . when people hear a prase again and again , usually people remember the word and praise . it is not necessory to say that they will buy the product when they see it . for example , my wife and i usually go to shopping together . when we see the same product which we saw in advertisement , we usually buy it . because the product is only one thing that we have a information about it . even thouth it is just the product 's name or praise it often make an important roll in my decision . in conclusion , i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because many company use exazageration , a famous person , and repeating , people buy the product .
