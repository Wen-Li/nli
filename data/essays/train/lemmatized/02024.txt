i agree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community resently . these day , many young people do not care about their community and even they do not know what is happenning in their comunities . i have some experience which made me feel that some of young people do not care about their comunities . it wa a few week ago that we have the day to collect trash in my community . i paticipated in it with my friend . we were gathered at a park . can you imagin how many young people came to the park ? there are only five youg people including me and my friend . later , i asked some of my friend why they did not come . they said that they did n't have time because they wa hanging out with their friend or watching tv at their home . some of them even did n't know about it . i wa surprised at these reason since i did n't realize that so many people do not care about the comminuty . also , last year , i wa asked to help a festival which wa held in my community but i could n't help because i had some thing had to do , so i asked some of my friend to help it instead me . however , nobady accepted to do it because they may get tired . as a result , i help the festival . i think there are some problem caused by action of those who do not give enough time to helping their community . if more young people help their community , we can make community more great and good for all of u .
