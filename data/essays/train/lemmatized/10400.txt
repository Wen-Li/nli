i do agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . i have several reason to support my argument but it is not easy to make an accurate decision because enjoying life mean different person by person . firstly , young people usually have more free time than older people do . because of the fact that older people have a job and have a family to support , younger people tend to have more free time . for example , young people are usually refered a child , student and adult who is not married yet . they have planty of time to do exciting activity and enjoy their life with their friend . however , older people need to go to work and feed the family . they do not have time to do exciting activity because their tired body need a rest during holiday and weekend . secondly , young people have healthier body than older people . younger people are more eligible to do various activity than older people . such a sport that need a lot of physical ability like rock climbing and weight lifting . although if older people are experienced in those activity , they can do it but it is not that common . when young people can start any kind of activity , old people need to measure their ability otherwise they might get injured . on the other hand , older people can also enjoy their life more than young people . if they are financially free after the retirement , they will enjoy life more than young people do . such a crusing around the world , travel to the unknown country and living in a beautiful place . this is something that young people can not do because they need to work . however , i believe that both young and old people can achieve joyfuol life .
