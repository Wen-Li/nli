in recent year , our society is growing very fast . many new thing have occured and many old thing were eliminated . the reson why it is because people are trying to do new thing and do something which they have never tried before rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . firstly , i believe the sentence `` no pain no gain '' . the sentence show that people need to sacrifice something in order to gain what they expected , especially taking risk . obviously , business man tends to produce new product in order to gain more profit . but the thing is , they need to take a high risk and try thing they have never tried before . they must have the courage to do some risky thing . i do n't think they would continuoulsy doing the old thing and having an `` old '' return . that 's are the main reason why they become successful . secondly , i have heard about a theory `` high risk equal to high reuturn '' . take student a an instance . the top student often spend a lot of time on their study , they devoted themself for sacrificing their spare time and soul into study . i believe they know that theory very well . the reson why they keep doing that is , they know they will have a good return for what they did . last but not least , successful people try to invent new thing and doing new thing . we can actually tell why the scientist are so successful on their performance to their work . it is because they know that if they try to do thing that no body ha done before , they will eventully become successful people by the honor given by the public . in conclusion , i think courage and patient are the two essential thing to become successful . successful people require these two element , and they need them more that anybody in the world . that why they are successed .
