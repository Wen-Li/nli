i agree with this statement or at leat i hope it will become true since there is a real environmental need for re-organization of our communication mean . climate overheating call for it . that said , this wo n't be possible without in-depth modification of how people consider their way of living . cars are now very successful consumer product for several reason ranging from comfort to social standing . first of all they are very comfortable for they can transport individual easily from one point to the other , avoiding the inconvenients of public transportation ( like suffering the weather while waiting , the noisy and narrow environment that is to be found in bus or train , etc. ) , bringing you exactly where you have to be ( contrary to public transportation that is only present on main road ) and being immediately available . the second reason is that they participate to one 's appearance . in a period where appearance are - sadly enough - worth more than money or gold for a lot of people , they are a very ostensible element of one 's ( self - ) identification to a social category . lots of people put a great pride into their car and worship them more than what would be expected of them . i think there is a need for change . and being a frequent car user doe n't inhibit all logical reasoning in me . the street become overcrowded with car , getting from one point to the other take more time than ever , pollution is becoming so heavy that it endangers our eco-system and our health . the solution will be found in public transportation . more precisely , in a densification of public transportation route , in an increased quality of public transportation mean to offer more stability , more silence and to offer other service , some of which can be of great use to professional ( think of the internet , for example ) and in a reduction of their cost . i think the train is a very interesting solution for long-distance transportation ( think of the success of the tgv and eurostar ) while subway and tramway are better for short-distance . buses should be reserved for spot where there is no possibility to set up tramway route . let 's not be too lazy and forget the bicycle . a quick look at amsterdam and belgian city like ghent could be a good example of their utility and of the fact that habit can be changed in favour of a healthier world .
