the best way to explore a city or a hole country is with a good group of people and an excelent tour guide . city knowledge , fun and respect are well related with this statement . when you first travel to a new country it is important to find someone that can take you to the place that you can not miss in your trip . eventhough you can get some knowledge from book and internet about the city and important place , tour guide give you the exact information you need to know such a theorical fact but also myth , leyends and belief , which many time are more interesting and not found in book . besides city knowledge , traveling with a goup of people is a very interesting activity because you get to know new person with different characteristic which help you understand different culture , attitude and way of thinking . for example , the first time i traveled to europe i did it with a big group of people , although they were all mexican i realized there are a lot of different customes in my own country . it wa a great experience because it encouraged new friendship . finally , respect is a value well-related with this kind of trip . time is an important aspect . a lot of time we do not think about people 's time , but in this kind of trip everyone depends in the other so punctuallity is a very important topic . there i understood an excellent frase from an argentian economist named david konsevic : `` never take people 's time , when you do this you are taking part of their life '' . not only time but also respect for people 's belief and customes which in many case are different from ours and some time hard to understand . in conclusion , by experience i can support the statement which mention that traveling with a group led by a tour guide is best way to do this activity because of better city knowledge , fun and learning to respect people 's time and belief .
