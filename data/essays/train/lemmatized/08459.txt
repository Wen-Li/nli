life go by every second of our life . as a person get older , not only his or her body is in constant deterioration , but also his or her mind , ideal , and thought . an elderly can hardly jump the rope or play football , but a teenager can accomplish those task with great facility . young people can practice a wide variety of activity with little or no limitation . from parachuting to eating a family-size pizza , the young are always on a better condition , mentally and phisicaly . therefore , young people enjoy life more than older people do . this asserttion can be exemplified by a personal experience that i had with my grandfather when i wa 14 and with today 's war . as a young teenager , i wa always able to spend time with my grandfather . i felt a great respect towards him . yet , i wa able to regard the difference between u . i ate hot-dogs and he vegetable . one day , when we went bowling , he felt on the middle of the lane while slowly throwing the ball . i panic at that time , but later i apprehended that not everyone is similar . i wa able to discover and to realize that my grandfather could not have fun a easy a i could . his step were slow and hardly-accomplished , while i ran in and out of the house . this experience let me to the belief that when one is old , it is no longer possible to enjoy life much . not only i have found experience of myself for stating that young people enjoy life more than olders do , but society arrangement prof it by itself . the war that today affect some part of the world is a clear and vivid example . very young people on the middle east are violentaly in combat . it is not neccessary a ` fun activity ' , but rahter a way on defending their belief and their way of enjoying their life . it is not often to see a 70-year-old dead by combat mean . the possibility for a wide of spectrum of activity offered to young people aloud them enjoy the fascination of their life . life is short and our ` young life ' are even shorter . we should discover and take advantage of the inmense possibility that we have a child and a young adult . years are limitants to our capability . run , jump , swim , and climb today ! enjoy now and think later !
