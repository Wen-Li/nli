knowledge in any form is welcome be it in depth or breadth . for the development of a society both type of people are required , those who have in-depth understanding of a particular subject and those who have a generic understanding of many subject . in my field of consulting it is important for me to have a broader understanding of business rather than focus on any one . therefore the pattern of knowledge would primarily depend on a person profession and futrure aspiration . i support the statement that a broad knowledge of many academic subject are required , but even specialist are necessary . there is no-doubt that specialization in subject lead to further development of technology and theory which help the society at large . for example the invention of various kind of vaccine were done by eminent researcher and scientist . however , research alone doe n't guarantee the success of an invention , it wa a collaborative effort of businessmen who funded this research and made sure common man ha access to it . so it is not only specialist but also generalist that we require , who have a bigger outlook and can co-relate thing . but again it is the job of a person that should decide the apttern of his knowlege . for example if the aspiration of the individual is to become a professor or researcher , then surely an in-depth understanding of the subject is indespensable . which would require him to focus on a particular subject . on the other hand , if the person is a journalist or a politician , a broader perspective of society is requred , to perform well in their job . on conclusion , i would like to add that both form of study are important . generalists and specialist both are required for the development of the society .
