many people today use car for transporting , going shopping and etc . as the society is developed , people use car more and more . so i do not agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than today . first , many people who have not car will buy a car when they earn a lot of money . as world economy is increasing , many people will have money which could be used to buy a car . secondly , in the future people will like traveling more than these day . then , people need a car . in conclusion , i believe that there are many car in the future .
