the writing is about usage of car in coming twenty year . this four wheeled machine is widely used mode of transport all around the world . the technology is evolving with a zooming speed that with we frequently find a new car on road that promise more speed and more comfort with the best performance assured . with the increasing usage of car even the demand for fuel ha also increased . to counter the scarce of the fuel car are being manufactured with a technology to be driven with out use of any petroleum fuel instead can be driven by electric power and other source . for example , reva . we have number of manufacture like ferrari , lamborgini , maybach , mercedes , hyundai , fiat , opel etc. are competing everyday in the automobile industry to manufacture or to produce a new car with all the amenity or luxury along with the performance . one who buy a car considers parameter such a speed , performance , comfort , capacity , availability of service center etc . many research and development center are being developed to make a car which is different from the existing and which is unimaginable . there are many machine geek in this world who love to own the latest car which ha almost everything that they always dream about . car are being manufactured considering the position or status of the people . for example , in india , company like maruthi motor , hyundai motor , tata motor etc.have launched different range of car . cars have become a part of our day-to-day life . for example , in colder country like us , uk , swiss etc. life is quite difficult to travel with out a car . if time come when the car can not be driven easily on the road due to the traffic conjestions or because of availability any alien machine which can replace car with it best feature which are not available with car . or , if cost of flying machine come down then probably we may possibly take a look at it . therefore , i disagree that the usage of car could comedown down the lane in coming twenty year .
