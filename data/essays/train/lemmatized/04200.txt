many of u are eager to become successful people . however , many successful people did not magically succeed one day . they all took a risk of being a failure or overcame the struggle . therefore , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk . for example , bill gates , one of the most successful businessmen in the world , did not even graduate from the university . his great invention , windows wa nothing but a program with simple design at that time . his courage and plan , however , wa not simple nor easy at all . as if he needed to prove that he is a talented businessman , he had to visit numerous number of people to pursuade them that his invention is amusing . additionally , bill gates did not always succeed . his business went through several hard time . his business went through several trial because people were jealous of him all the time . once , he had to leave the company for dominating the market . this is very absurd in my opinion because if running the business really well is a problematic , how come many people are trying so hard to become a successful business man ? gate 's another great invention , xbox , show another example . at that time , the future of xbox wa very unclear . the market wa already being dominated by sony 's playstation ii . plus , if xbox had failed to success in the market , that would have been another life time crisis for bill gates . bill gates took the risk of selling ungaurenteed product to the market and thanks to his idea , xbox almost dominated the market in the north america . now , consumer can enjoy different kind of machine . to conclude , successful people can not success without taking a risk of being a failure . however , it is not the luck or fortune that make the sucessful person . it is the courage and careful plan that creates one succesful person . hardly anyone seems to realize this and often blame god for not having enough luck !
