i really agree with this statement but i agree if we speak about really successful people and not only about people that had too much fortune . but concerning on special people i think that we have to think what there is under success . the most successful people are talentous , open-minded , ambitious and very self-confident . this feature can bring you to success easilly but these feature make also people never be satisfited . so when they reach an important target immediatly the happines for that becomes an aim to reach another new and more difficult target . for example , speaking about job , i think that the most successful people are not really interested in money itself but in becoming the best one on his job , without limit . i think also that there is a particolur and exacting emotion when you see that you are able to become always better and that nothing can stop you , and perhaps there are person that feel alive only when they risk to try always something new . there is a faomous phrase that is : `` risk is my job '' . it 's obvious that when a common person see someone who is rich , powerful and that got everything you can dream risking evertything only to try new experience or emotion , he colud say : `` he is really crazy ! '' , but we know that genious and madness are often joined . we can see some example in real life . i want to give a real simple example speaking about sport . foe example the famous valentino rossi , the motorbiker , had been three time world champion of the top class with the honda team and he had the best motorbike and if he had stayed with that team he wa sure to win again , but afeter having won for three time the title he decided to change team and go to yhamaha . at that time yamaha had a no-competitive motorbike and it wa a very hard risk for him .
