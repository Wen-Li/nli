i agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are a lot of advertisments of many organization that are looking for young people to help the community and this organization apply for many different kind of job . for example when i listening to the radio or when i watch the television i see many advertisments about company that try to increase these kind of job . if there are so many advertisments , it 's will mean that they need other people , especially young people . secondly in my country i know some boy and girl who help their community in their free time , but it 's not so common . i have just known two or three person who have done that in their life . i have many friend and of course they study or they have a job , but they also have a lot of leisure time . in my opinion the problem is that young people in thei free time prefer for example to go to the gym or to go home just to relax , or to go to a pub to have a drink . it 's a question of choice , it 's not that they do n't have time to dedicate to their community . for example if during the afternoon you go along the street in the center of the city you will see that is crowded : there are a lot of young people that are having a walk , to go shopping or just for fun . if the same day you go in a company who work for the community it 's not so crowded !! you can do some different job for your community and you can help your community in many different way . furthermore it doe n't take you so much time , you can work just an hour a day , or just two time a week . i think that it 's would be better if there wa much more information about this , for example more advertisment in the school or in the university . but nowdays i do n't think that young people give enough time to help their community .
