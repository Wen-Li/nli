this summer i wa in usa and faced with the fact that how car became an important part of our life . the transportation system wa much more different than we used to have in turkey which caused me to get in trouble many time . then i started to think about the importance of car and how they will be one of our obligatory need like water or food in the next future . i believe that in twenty year time there will be more car in use than are today . there are mainly two important reason that i can see to support that idea . the first reason is the increasing world population . when we think 20 year before today , we will notice that the traffic problem wa not a serious a today . by the increasing population the number of car are increasing a well . people start to settle the area that are not occupied before . this mean new living area appear that travelling long distance become obligatory . as i had mentioned previously , my usa experience had really showed me that obligation after seeing people travelling more than one hour to go to their work and school every day . the second reason of why i believe there will be more car in use is the technology and the thing that it brings to our life . with the new improvement in our technology we realize that our life become much more easier . it is a fact that people follow the technology a they want to use their time much more efficiently . i believe nobody would like to spend half an hour or more by waiting in bus stop or standing in the crowded bus . another fact is that car become cheaper and available a the technology develops the novel one wich are more expensive . it seems that it is not very far to observe that car will be an obligatory part of our life that all the family member have their own car by considering the increasing world population and the developing technology .
