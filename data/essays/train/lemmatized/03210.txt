the statement , ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' is telling u that , to success you have to try new thing and take risk rather than always doing the way you are really good at . i agree with the statement . i think it help to make something you are not really good and and make it one of the thing you are good at . it also make you experience many thing and smetimes success , and sometimes fail . that teach u what is right and what is wroge . in your life , you have to try many thing . when you are a baby , you have to try oto get up and walk . if you do n't start with that kind of risk , you will never walk , and not be like a normal person . taking risk might be something very diffecult . it might also be very easy . when you try something , you can like it , or yo9u can hate it . it 's all your chose . for example , this term , it tried for all the sport team in school . i thought i wa really bad at basssket ball , but when i tarted the team , i figure out that i really liked it , and wa actually beter than what i thought . making my self made me have a new hubby and try more to be better at it . tring and taking risk help you to learn what is wright and what is wronge . when you try , you sometimes success , and somtimes fail . my dad told me that fail make you success more and help learn what to do next to not fail t \ at the same thing . for exampel , my brother really liked tennis even though he did n't do it . when he tried , he find out that he did n't like it at all . from then , he did n't do tennis , and find out that one of his hobby wa n't really his hobby . in that case , he failed and also successed on what he tried . he failed on guessing what his hobby wa , but he successed in finding out what his really hobby wa . i think successful people alway try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it help people to try and be good at something you tried . it also make you learn what is right and what is wrong and make you not do the mistake you did again when you do it again .
