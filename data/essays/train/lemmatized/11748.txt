although some people consider that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i disagree with this statement . there are mainly two reason that make me think it is false . fisrst of all : what doe ` enjoying ' mean ? i think that this term is too often associated with party , and all these kind of thing that young people do . usually , young people enjoy going on holiday with friend , to the sea , to the mountain and so on . or they can have fun by organizing some big party , or by going to music show . that is the way the most of young people ` large it up ' . but i think ` enjoying ' life is more than that . maybe that older people have not the same expectation concerning their evening and their life . for example , they meet friend to discus or to play card instead of dancing all night long . they may also be happy because they have child and they see them growing , and because they form a family . to conclude i think that enjoying life depends on what you mean by ` enjoying ' , and that the criterion of enjoyment vary with the age of people . that is why i wrote that it is possible to enjoy life at an equal level , if you are a young person or an older person .
