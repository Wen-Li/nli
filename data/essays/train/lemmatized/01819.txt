i agree whit the statement that successful peolple try to do new thing and not only what they are already good to do . in my opinion this is a main aspect of a successful person , indeed successful people have the ability to understand what they can try to do even if they know that they already have n't the preparation to do that . someone ca n't became a real successful person if he does't try to risk . he ha to have the ability to understand that he can try to do something even if he does't know how to do that . in modern society it is more difficult to rase over other people than some year ago , so people , who want success , have to go over their own limit to try if they are really able to do some thing . it is like when someone bet , he doe n't know if he will win , but he know that if he will win he will be happy and successful . nowadays there is n't so much space for weak people in the high level of the society . but there is a big problem about this aspect of successful people , and it is a proplem for all the society . i think doing this , there is a low quality of activity . in other word , if someone stop to do something when he becomes able to do that , because he want to do something else , there wo n't be a person able to do that work and so there will be le quality .
