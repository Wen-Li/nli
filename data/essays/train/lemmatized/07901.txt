i do n't agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . as for me , traveling is kind of like trausure hunting . why traveling is always interesting ? that 's becuase a unknown futrue . once u are on the way , you 'll never know what will happen or who will u meet . every experience will be like a surprising gift and ever friend will be your valuable fortune in your life . the best thing to explore the world on your own is to crate memory by yourself . some people would think it 's convenient and safer to follow a tour guide because he could lead you to visit the most important spot right away . that way , you do n't have to wasting too much time finding place . and even the tour guide could explain the information or historic story to let you know without a book . actually , the tour guide nowadays only show the traveler to the spot who can make them money . the rush schedule and the arrangement from a tour guide will ruin the true meaning of travel . most of people usually feel physically tired and empty in their mind . the point i want to make is the real meaning of travel is not only to relax yourself but also to learn the experience from the real world , not from the book anymore . it 's not hard to arrange a safe and fun tour by yourself . before you go to travel , you can collect much information from the internet , your friend who have ever been there or even the traveling book . through the suggestion they give you , and do a well prepartion in advance , there 's no doubt you 'll have a wonderful tour without a tour guide . you can freely charge your time of staying or decide what kind of place you prefer to visit .
