first of all i would like to approve my opinion on this statement . this is just what i would like to talk about , people who take risk and try new stuff tend to get more successful in their life , on the other hand people who tend to be close minded and only do what they know and in the same way over and over again , this would improve them at all . when people try new thing they discover new information , they allow themselves to think differently , to act differently , not only would it help himself , it would also have great change on the country . this type of behaiviour is what we call a part of leadership . when people do what they already know how to do well and keep on doing it over and over again , that would not help them at all , because they are doing the same pattern , without interacting with new feature and by that they are n't learning . in case of newton , we would n't have known today how to measure force and gravitational field if it wa n't for his discovery and his dessive state of mind . in other word if newton have n't tried and experemented the stuff in different way , he would n't have done what he did . scientists are trying really hard these day to find a cure to canser and they are trying new stuff and thing and taking risk , in order to do the best they can to get to the cure asap . in my point point of view i would take risk and try new thing to get to the best state of knowledge i can get to . i am working so hard at the moment , trying new stuff and hoping to become a great man someday , hopefully soon . my advise to you all is to experience new thing and tryout stuff u never imagined your self doing it . you never know what might be the thing that you would end up with .
