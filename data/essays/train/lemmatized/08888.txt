do young people enjoy life more than older people do ? personally , i do n't think so , even if it 's quite difficult to know how much one enjoys life . i do n't see specific reason why young people would enjoy life more . one could argue that their physical ability are at their maximum , but in our modern society , older people do n't necessarily suffer from health problem , and physical ability are not the only source of happiness . i think some people enjoyed life more while being young , and others prefer life ` now ' , that is , while being older . an idea widely spread is that being twenty year old is the best time in life , but the famous french writer paul nizan said he would never allow anyone to say such a thing . this show that it really depends on people . furthermore , it is not because one would like to be younger that he enjoyed life more at that time . this can be explained by the fact that he would like to be younger , but also to know what he know now . alas , if young people knew , if older people could ! the kind of enjoyment is simply different , depending on the age of people . maybe young people enjoy it more obviously , or , may i say , noisily : they want to make this known . but people get - generally - wiser a time go by , can enjoy other aspect of life , and are not concerned anymore by problem that , now they know it , are minor . to conclude , i would say that this general statement - young people enjoy life more than older people do - is untrue . this depends mainly on people , and the wise man can enjoy differently each period of his life .
