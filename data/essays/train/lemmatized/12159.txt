there are different opinion about what is best method in order to prepare student . according to me they could be associated to the school system of two country , italy and the united states . some people sustain that it is more important for student to have a theorical preparation based on idea and concept , than a pratical preparation based on fact . a reason in favour of that opinion could be that a student ha to learn the technique of a job before practising the job itself . another reason could be that with a theorical preparation a student will always be able to learn and develope by himself new concept and idea . on the contrary other people affirms that it 's more valuable for a student 's career to practise activity ( such a stage , training etc ) instead of reading them just theorically . in fact in many situation student study at school a lot of thing that seem to not be useful at all when they go to work . in my opinion learning fact is the best way to prepare a student for his future job , especially when he is at university . for example i disagree with the italian university system that obliges student to study book of thousand of page instead of providing them with some real work experience . i think in this way student would forget almost half of the information they study just the day after they took the exam . in addition , when they will have to look for a job , farm often say they lack of experience . consequently i prefer the american university system , where student have le to study but they do activity that make them become familiar with their future job . however i have to say that in some case theorical preparation is important , for example in order to provide the student with a good general culture ; and in this way i think italian university system is better than the american one . in conclusion i believe that a student should have a very good preparation based on fact ; but it would be important for him to understand idea and concept in order to improve the technique of his specifical job and also his personal culture .
