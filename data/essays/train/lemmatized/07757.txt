in the recent year , the number of car ha grown up to a level that wa never reached before . nowadays , the traffic problem are getting more and more serious . the question of reducing the number of car will be one of the most preoccupying matter of concern . there are the argument that sustain my opinion . first of all , since the number of car ha ben growing up fastly , the society have to face with a major problem : how to regulate the trafic and to deal with the queue that happen every day on major highway and in major city . it is now getting more and more difficult to circulate at the rush hour . if the number of car still grow like it doe nowaday , the risq to face total blocking of the circulation will be real . another argument is that the oil and gas reserve are getting rarer everyday . as a long term consequence , their price will increase in a huge proportion . scientifics know the problem very well even if they do not know when the reserve will be over . if we ca n't find a substitution energy , we 'll have to change our habit . one of the consequence is that we 'll have to live in area close to our job or to choose for another medium of communication . both of those situation will lead to a decrease of the number of car used by the citizen . last but not least , using the car is one of the global warming 's major cause . the consequence of the phenomenon will be desastrous for the future generation , such a the increase of the level of the ocean , climate 's change , ... i think people are getting more and more aware of this concern . sensibilisation will make people change their own mind and consider to choose for new medium of communication , such a bike , roller , ... in any case , i think that , according to those argument , there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today .
