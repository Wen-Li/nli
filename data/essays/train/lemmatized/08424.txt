i truly convinced that the relation between `` idea '' and `` fact '' is so strict that it doe not make sense to discus wheter it is more important for student to understand concept or fact . i am engineer and during my own experience i can provide some example to explain better what i think about this issue . one of the most difficult course is optical communication , there are thousand equation to explain the trasmission of an optical signal from one point to another , i read the book and payed attention to all the lesson but althought all the mathematical implication were cleared to me , i wa not able to apply them and in that semester i failed to pas the exam , i did not understand the reason for my failure after all i knew all the concept . i decided to ask my problem to the professor who took me immidiatly to the communication lab , showing all the application of what i supposed to know . thought that experience , learning `` fact '' i deeply understand the main point of the course and passed exam in a relative simply way . in this case the concept could not provide me all the necessary information to a full understanding . sometimes could happen the countrary , we can start from theory to understand a fact . everyone know the story of newton , one red apple on his head represents and important fact : newton learnt this fact and starting from that he introduced the concept of `` gravitation '' settin up idea and concept in order to explain that fact . galileo galilei , one of the most famous scientist in the history , deal with the importance to support idea and concept with fact and experiment that could be replicated several time in order to very and prove the validity of a theory . in conclusion i think that idea and fact are two aspect of the same `` world '' and one can not claim that one aspect is more important than the other , but indeed they live toghter . in my opinion a good student ha to pay attention to both of these two aspect if he or she want to have a full understant of an event .
