i believe that both thing are necessary . this is a great question and also it could be a big dilemma . based on my own experience is how i reach this conclusion . nowadays i am dentist , but i just got my degree five month ago . while i wa still in my fourth year of university , i came up with the same question . i wa a very good student with high grade , but all i could talk to people about wa teeth and the oral cavity . i even used to say , a a joke , that i had tooth-shaped brain ! i felt really bad about my reality so i looked forward to find an extracurricular activity that had nothing to do with dentistry . thus i registered myself for the selection of the universidad central de venezuela in the world model of the united nations ( worldmun ) . worldmun is an event organized by harvard university with the purpose of gathering student from university from all over the world , in order to discus the current agenda of the un ; in other word , student play the role of diplomatics that defend the position of certain country , regarding an especific topic of real life . i have to admit that it wa quiet hard for me because the training process implied to study and know many thing about general culture , universal history and current world event , and those where subject i wa not familiar with at all . but after a huge effort , i finally got to go to beijing , china in march of this year , with 28 other ucv student . the team got the first prize among more than 200 other university from around the world . that doe not mean that i am not interested anymore in getting an specialization of my career . on the contrary `` i want '' now to do an oral and maxillo-facial surgery specialization . so my conclusion is that someone doe not need to be completely in favor of one option , i believe that one person can manage him or herself to have knowledge in many academic subject , but at the same time , he or she can have a specialization . the mind ha no limit , you put the limit !
