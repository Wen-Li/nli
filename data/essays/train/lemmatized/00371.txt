do young people not give enough time to helping the community they belong ? i think young people pay a lot of time to their own community . moreover , they ha a healthy mind than others . first of all , teenager have more time to do something helping the community . i think that adult work all day and maybe they do n't have many time to help other because they are too tired . in my school , there are many vulenteers help the old men who ha no son and daughter . one of my friend go to the old men 's home and cook lunch and dinner for them everyday and read the book and newspaper for them if she ha free time . in addition , young people 's power is always stronger than others ' and they are tenacity . as the proverb say , a healthy body brees a healthy mind . for example , about two month ago , there wa a terrible cat-abuse news on tv . the bad guy bit the little kitty on his home 's window side and put the picture on the website . at the time , a lot of teenager found every apartment all over the country which ha the white window look like the picture on the blog . finally , some young people found the bedman 's house and saved ten kitty . because the young people ha a healthy body that who can fight and conflict to the man who abused cat and help the news be know by many people . to sum up , the teenager help their own community more than others .
