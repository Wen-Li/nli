i agree that young people do not give enough time to helping their communites in korea . first , young korean people ( middle and high school student ) have to study hard to enter the good university . because they and their parent want to be successful in life . we , korean , think that the good university is the first step to be successful in life . when i also wa a student , i just focused on the study . so i did n't think about our community . second , when we enter good university , we have to also study our subject . for example , i study dentistry at my university . i always take a test 7 to 10 time per month . so i just concentrate on study . sometimes we have free time , but we always sleep . and other student ( law , economy , .. ) tried to get good score at toefl , toeic , .. etc. they always live in library . so if we tried to help our community we have to contribute our time . finally , when we were student ( from elementaty to university ) we did n't have much experience to help someone . i think our habit can not be changed easily . we always think much of ourselves . in conclusion , if old generation in korea want to change the mind of young people not to be individualitic , they have to try to change their own mind . we learned that my success wa more imprtant than anything else . so we are so very private . we learned this for more than 15 year , so we ca n't change easily our thought . of course , all of them is responsible for old generation . we , young people , have to change our thought . i 'm also growing , after few decade i 'll be old generation . that time i and my friend have to change our environment .
