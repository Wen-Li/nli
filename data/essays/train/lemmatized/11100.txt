some people insist that broad knowledge of many academic subject will be background knowledge for the future , others say that deep specialized knowledge will better because real world do not need broad knowledge . in case of me , i strongly believe that broad knowlege of many academic subject will be better for the following reason ; one is good for the real world , the other is good for the relationship between others and me . first of all , i worked in posco `` pohong iron and steel company '' for a 13 year . according to my experience , i did not use well specicalized knowledge which learn in university because i have to learn real world knowledge of my company . on the contrary , i often use other common knowldege , for example , communication , statistic , and six sigma , which educated by our company 's institute . when i wa in university , i applied and studied other foreign language , japanese , because i think that japan is most short distance country from korea and will be help for the real world . my expectation is correct because my company 's facility wa imported from japan so i can easily understand the system of my work and go faster than my co-worker . secondly , to get maintain good relationship with other people , you will need common knowldege because you will lose your chance if you did not learn at school . you will easily see the person who have good specific knowledge , we called professional , do not assimilate with hierarchy structure like military and company socity . in conclusion , i strongly believe that broad knowledge of many academic subjets is better than specialized in specific subject because i can prepare for the real world by using broad knowledge and maintain good relationship with others . for the above reason , i strongly believe that broad knowledge is better .
