in the present world a their is a rapid change in the development in student in all the aspect i.e in iq , sport , information technology , electornics , medium and many other field and more over in school study . the student main aspect of learning thing is by understanding the fact beside it and the other way is to understand the idea and concept about it . in olden day student used to learn thing by learning the fact about the thing which they are going to learn , as it certainly take more time to learn a particular subject a they i ha to know what actually the subject is and how it is going to work , but it is time consuming thing to learn a particular subject . while coming to learning subject by knowing or understanding the idea and concept about the subject is the better way how to student understand about the subject and solve them easily . let u consiber an example to solve an mathematical problem to find the area of the given triangle , which is given to two different student in the class , who can solve the problem by knowing the fact and the other student who understand idea and concept of the problem . response who know the fact of the problem and the student who understand about the idea and concept . the student who know the concept and idea about the triangle can do better and fast by using the formula of the triangle , but the student who known about the basic i.e fact about the triangle will take more time . in this developing and competional world one should be more effecient and more faster to survive in their life . so in my opinoun the student who understand idea and concept is more important than the student who learn fact so a to face different compitative exam which are likely to held in every part of the life , where they test only the output of the student rather than how much he know about fact
