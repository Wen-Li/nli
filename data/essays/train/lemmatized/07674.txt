i believe that the degree of stress that a particular person is exposed , or ha to be exposed , throughout his or her entire life is very important . most of u are not aware how stress consumes our energy and finally , limit our ability to live in a more relaxed way . i am convinced that stress doe n't contribute in the level of happiness for a person . i 'd say that the more stress a person experience , the le happiness he or she will feel . happiness is the state of mind that help a person to enjoy life and it 's the emotion that make u appreciate the thing that life ha to offer in a more positive manner . there are people who consider that young people just do not appreciate life with the importance it ha . young people just do not pay attention to small detail and their way of life go rather faster in comparison to somebody who ha reached certain age . on the top of that , a young person is expected to make major choice that will change him or her for the future , such a finding the proper school and study , starting a family and other stressful decision . on the contrary , some people would claim that is is older people who are experiencing a better way to live theirs life . they do not have to be worried about what most of the people do during their whole life , such a education , professional goal , and so on . instead , they live with greater experience and emotional maturity that allow them to be le aprehensive and stressful . however , i think that age alone play no significant role in term of enjoying life . i strongly believe that happiness is the result of a number of factor both in the environment and in the personality of a particular person . medically speaking , depression can be associated both in young and older people a well a there are people that consider themselves happy regardless of their age . finally , i think that we all have the opportunity to enjoy life no matter how old , or young , we are .
