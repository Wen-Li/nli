i think the best way to travel is in an group of people led by a tour guide becouse traveling will be more confortable to all of u and we all will get the information of the place we visit . in the other hand traveling alone will be more expensive that traveveling in an group , cost will be split for all traveler . i remember one time i traveled alone to mexico city and my money wa really short but took the risk and i travel . then when i wa in the city i realized that the best will be traveling with someone . i spent the ninght with some friend becouse i had not enougt money to retourn to my city , then next time that i consider to tavel by my self would not be a option . traveling in an group not only have the economic benefit , you can meet people and have an nice long trip chating with new friend . i met someone in a tour to acapulco , and we all have fun i still have touch with them but they are n't in mexico anymore . the best way to have my next vacation will be by having a tour guide , they may know more the city that i do , in fact that 's is their job , to show up the city and indicate the best way and place to spent time . i will recoment to have a tour guide , family will have much fun that getting lost looking for some place in special . that is really usual when get parent think that they already know about the place they will visit . i agree with this point and will not get any tour by my self , not if i do n't the exactly information .
