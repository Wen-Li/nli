i do agree with statement i.e successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . iam of the opinion that because of there are several reason and example , to support my opinion . man is a gregarious person and greedy person man ha no satis faction with his already achievement . he is raedy to take risk and pain to invent new thing . for example in early stage scientist are invented bycycle , and then invented automobile , plane etc . there is no end for invention , because technology ha developed day by day . great people are always thinking and thinking they are always look for some progress . compared to olden day now technologyhad developed more . great people are think there is no end for success , it is going on going on there is no end . if there is end no meaning , because great people are searching for better to best now day population are increasing like temperature increase , if there is no place for humanbeings on land people can live on moon also . so i strongly support the statement , people want change in life it will be help ful to better living . if great people are also thinking like this . they have no rest , if they are taken rest there is no further improvement in our life .
