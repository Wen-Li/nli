behind the idea of education , there lie the ability to understand idea and concept . thus , the aim of education - a i understand - is to teach student understanding the basic idea and conceptualization upon which the individual student can independently learn fact . without such an understanding no fact can be learned . in the due course , i totally agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact . as to begin with , without idea and concept fact do not have any meaning . although such a statement might sound too large , it is actually true in the sense that anyone can learn a fact by reading the newspaper or watching the television . however , such a learning leaf no room for questioning and basing the fact on concept and idea of other people . therefore , student firtst must be taught the important concept and idea . for instance , a student who know a theory on inequality or developmentalism would look at the fact about povery from a very different and critical point of view . with the idea of others and conceptualization that have been made , the student doe not readily take the thing that she learns a given . rather , the student tends to compare and contrast with other idea and try to base the fact on different concept . in the due course , first the student should try to understand idea and concept . in addition to this , another reason why i think it is more important for student to understand idea and concept is that fact sometimes be misleading or misinterpreted . when the student is directly confronted with fact to be learned , she take the knowledge for granted and doe not question the validity or trueness of that fact . for example , sometimes we are confronted with false news on medium . such fallicies are only visible to the open eye of the student or people who are well equipped with idea and concept . another example to this is hrant dink 's - a famous journalist in turkey - death because of his statement of turkish nationality . he wa murdered by a young nationalist boy who only know fact about nationalism ; yet , he ha never understood the idea and concept of turkish nationalism . all in all , it is plausible to suggest that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with this statement due to the fact that learning fact by themselves alone doe not mean anything but taking given fact a absolute truth and the fact that fact might me misleading sometimes . without understanding the idea of other people and conceptualization that have been made on different issue , learning fact ha no validity . thus , student should first understand idea and concept and upon such an understanding fact should be learned .
