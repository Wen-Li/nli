everyone in the world ha a life , and everyone want to enjoy the life , but not every one can ha what he or she want , whatever , i am agree with that statement wich say young people enjoy the life more than older people because the young people are good at sport more than old people and young people have more time to live . first of all yong people are good at sport , and that meke them have a more thing to enjoy , for example i do not see any one in the sacore feild any one his or age more than 35 year , also in valyball , and the pasketball , so when we think about this point we will faind many thing in the young people life that make them alot happers from older people . not just that make young people enjoy the life more than old people , but also the young people have more time to live and that make them enjoy the life more than older people such a a chaild with amother and a father the chaild ha long way to go and to start her or his life and time to enjoy it , so that make them alot more enjoy the life more then an older people . fainaly , the young people are good at sport , and the young people have more time to live , make them enjoy the life in more than these way . in the end i thank that young people are so laoky unless they still younger . even i want to stay ayoung man .
