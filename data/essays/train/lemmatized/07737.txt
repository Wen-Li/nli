ok ! today we talk about be a successful person . some people think that be a successful person , you need to try new thing and take risk . another group of people think that do the thing they already know and try to do it a best a they could . wow , these two way are seems that sound work . what do you think ? now , i tell you my opinion , i agree that be success is to try new thing and take risk . well , i am not saying that you wo n't be a successful person if you just do what you already know and do it a well a you could . waht i mean is `` improvement is come form trying '' . we need to built up our own success we need to try to take the risk . ok , let say you in a football team you are the kicker . you work really hard to kick the football everyday and you keep every single step to kick . what you try to do is you never want to make a mistake . you want , once the ball is in front of you , you can kick it in . ok , finally you are the best kicker . but you forget something . the way you kick everyday is the old way . you did a wonderful job in kicking the football in old way . but there are a 1000 people in the world try to find out another better way to kick the football . so by the time they find that out , you are not the best anymore . no matter being success or be the best , is the same way to do that keep improve , keep try , take the risks and never give up . success is a compare word . you need someone next to you doing some thing le successful than you , then it will show that you are the one more successful . if you just stand in you own spot never go out to try , one day the people who try will pas you , if you still stay in that spot ten you will makre more people to pas you . so if you you really want to be successful people , you need to rtry new thing and take risk . otherwise , somebody will pas you one day .
