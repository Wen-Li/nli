if someone asked you , `` what would life be like today if we did not have technology ? '' would you be able to answer it ? computers , cellular phone , television , and ipods are all example of success in technology the people have made today . they have all become a part of our life , and it would be difficult to live without them . thanks to the inventers who invented them , we know the life that we are spending today . although some people never succeed in something no matter how much they try , people who do succeed in something , are always working hard in it . they have imagination a well a curiousity . without imagination , people would never be able to think of something new . one could always fail , but failing open up a new path to success . i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk . for example , one of the president of the united states of america , abraham lincoln , is one of the successful people who took risk , but try to thing . abraham lincoln lead the north union of the us during the civil war . he believed in himself that slavery wa wrong and fought with the south . he later became president and officially made slavery illegal . back in his time , most of the us citizen of the south were against him because they lost there servant and worker . however presently , lincoln is considered one of the most important leader in world history . he risked his own life and future to stop slavery , and by making a step towards complete equality of men , such a colored people and non-colored people . those who succeed are always imaginative , hard worker , and take risk . they do not fear mistake and always believe in what they are doing . people who fail to do so , are the people who will not reach their goal . experience many thing , and make a new discovery ! it could change your future .
