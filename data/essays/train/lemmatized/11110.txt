young people enjoy life as older people do in my opinion , old people enjoy their life a the young people . in some case , old people will more enjoy their life than young people . because they truly know that so precious is time that they can not affort to waste it . some people will think that so old is the elder person , they can not do anything . but i don not agree with them . the elder people can also have a colourful life . besides , they can do anything they like to do . for instance , they can go to dance with their partner in the old people assosiation , going to sing is also a good idea for them . by going out , they can make more friend and be happier . sometimes , elder people can go to the child 's house to have a visit or walk in the park . as a teenager , we should take care of the elder people , which is our responsebility . of course , young people also have their paradise . there is no denying that the most important thing is that studying . as a studet , nothing is more important than to receive the education . it is our responsebility to study well . furthermore , the teenager can also have some thing you like to do after school . such a do some sport , go shopping , do some reading , or listen to the music . addicting to the computer game is not a good thing , or spending the time in drinking beer is also not good at the childern 's growing . in a word , we must value our time and life , both the young people and the old people .
