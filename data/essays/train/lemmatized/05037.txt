some people prefer to deem that fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year , and others believe that it would be not true . newadays some may hold the opinion that we should limited the quantity of the car , but others have a negative attitude . as far a i am concerned , i agree with that thinking of limited the car quantity is a good choice . my argument for this point are listed a follow . firstly , in the modern soceity , we can easily to consider the traffic jam is become the most significant problem that embrassed u . for example , every day i go back home by taking bus , i must to spent one hour , however actually the distance so closed . why ? the reason is clear , because of the traffic jam . this is a example not rare , more example have showed about how horrible the traffic jam wa . now if we decide to go to some place , we must to account how much time we should prepare to stay in the road , and make sure we will not delay our schedule . i saw numerous situation about how people delay an important meeting or lost the oppotunity of job . secondly , our city wa a very beautiful city in the past , but after the advanced of people 's life , the more people have the car , the more air pollution wa happend , now i could not see the blue sky and smell the fresh air . according a recent survey , the research show that the pollution of air quality ha been added more than twenty percent more than last year . may be after in ten year , we will be not able to know the sky color is blue . however , the goverment already set some method to limited the pollution by car and make our traffic become more flexible , though decrease the numeber of the car and prevent some large car with pollution gas driving in the city , furthermore , to convinced u do not buy the private car instead to take the bus or subway . from what ha been discussed above , we can safely draw the conclusion that in twenty year there will be fewer car id use than there are today .
