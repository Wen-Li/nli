when we are kid , we want to do all a we can when get into adult . i remember that i want to be a doctor , a spanish teacher , a clothes designer , and maybe a policeman . why i 'm bringing that memory ? because sometimes we have to be more like childrens . they just want to do all and i perfectlly agree with that because if we have the capacity for learn more , why we did'nt ? i think that is much much better to have a broad knowledge of academnic subject . in my personal experience when i went to high school i took a vocational course of food administration , preparation and service while in the afternoon i went to the school of music . that experience make a more independent human right now that i do n't live in my house . my plan in that moment were keep studying to become a chef but i abondon them because i decide to study music in a bachellor 's degree . then when i start studying in the music conservatory i found a new thing : `` i can sing too '' ! the opera becomes for me a very important thing and that open me the way to start dooing a minonor in voice . that thinge make me more sensitivity to music and help improve my tuba performece till now . after that we realize that the conservatory give a theather class for sinnger 's , `` let 's try it '' i said . again a great experience came to my live and i become a better human with the discipline of theather . any discipline that we can learn i think that help for our life . it 's like have a tool box . you buy the tool and keep filling the box , in the way you have more tool you 're gonna be better prepared . you 're gonna have more live experience . and that for me is the better that we can do . really , just the live know what i 'm going to do in 20 year but , i sure that the all i 'm doing know are gonna help me forever .
