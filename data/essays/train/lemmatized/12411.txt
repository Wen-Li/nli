about the statement which is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' i agree and we are going to see four point through this topic . in the first point , we will see the behaviour of the child , secondly the problem and stress that doe n't concern the child , thirdly the way how a child think and live and finally the fourth point is about their way to act through someone else or something . on the fisrt hand , we are going to speak about the behaviour of the child . indeed if a child is in a good and normal situation , he is all the time positive and his objective are to play , to smile , to watch cartoon , to do some paintaings and all thing which concern leisure and pleasure whereas an adult ha a lot of problem and thing to organize all day in the life . however the child could have some stress and it is what it is going to be analysed in the second paragraph . on the second hand , obviously the child confront some problem but they are really poorly compare to the problem we are going to confront during all our life , adult life a the job , the house , to organize and gain some money to live and so on . the problem for a child is to have some friend and to be in good relationship with them and so on . however the child could have social problem but it is felt different when you are a child or an adult . indeed , the child ha a special way to feel the life . thirdly , it is true that foe the child , everything is beautiful , marvellous and good , like the believe in santa clauss and so on but when we are adult , the life is often le magic . their mind is pure . fourthly , when they act , the child do n't think how to act and to do this or that , they are not worried about confuse somebody or nothing like that . the way to act is like they want to do it . finally , to conclude i think that when we are young , the life is magic and we think that when we will be older , we will ne doctor or anything and everythinh is simple to achieve .
