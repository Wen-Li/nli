in twenty year there will be fewer car in use thene ther are today . some people agree with thes statment and some do n't . there are many advanteges and disadvanteges for it . the advanteges of having car or not are many such a the air polution will be le because many people will use bicks . the second thing is people will not need to pay for gas every week . the weather in my country is very hot so we must use car espsialy is summer and that is a disadvanteges of not having car . at the end my opinion is that i disagree with this statment because the weather is to hot in my country and no one can walk or u a bick is such a hot weather .
