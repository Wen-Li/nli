indeed , young people enjoy life more than older people do . the passion and inexperience of youth allows people to embrace new challenge and experiment freely with circumstance and situation . for instance , while the care of home and hearth may not allow an older person to retire early and travel the earth , a younger person , who is not similarly attached , ha the freedom to back-pack around the planet , without worrying about a wife , a child , an income , the rent , or the various other mundanity of everyday life . real world experience informs u that a most people get older , their life tend to follow a pattern . the natural cycle of birth , life and death , is interspersed by the human cycle of education , work , marriage , family , retirement and old age . while in the early stage , we seem to be writing our own destiny , the concern of a spouse , child and work ( while they may be enjoyable in their own right ) , tend to limit our freedom , and establish a time worn pattern of life that each human being replicates in his/her own fashion . youngsters are not only bereft of responsibility , they also have the singular advantage of being healthier , having more energy , vitality and vigour than older people . this allows them to stretch their limit and accept demanding challeges , both physical and mental , that allow them to enjoy life to the fullest . while on the one hand , this could translate into a bungee-jumping thrill , or a rigorous race , on the other , it could mean the ability to balance a college education with an extra-curricular pursuit , such a dance , music or art . the most fascinating aspect of youth is the tremendous hope and opportunity that lie ahead . while in college , we may dare to dream about conquering the world , and single-mindedly pursue our goal , a we get older , barring a prodigious few , we are restricted by the knowledge of our own limitation . while experience and maturity have their merit , nothing can rival the optimism and endurance of youth .
