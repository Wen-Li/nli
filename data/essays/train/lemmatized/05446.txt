some old men usually say that with the daily university guy know `` everything about nothing '' . i think that this claim come from this particular idea : course at university do not prepare people about a field of study but they want to direct student on a specific direction . in my opinion this is not true : course often give a general knowledge ; i suppose that the first sentence could be true some year ago , but not today . however i agree with the statement in the above question . from my personal experience i can say that a broad knowledge , of any subject , is more useful than a specific one . a wide range of opinion , idea or theory can allow a student to comprehend better a field of study . if you own most opinion about a topic , also you can build your personal idea and maybe you can also find a more peculiar interest afterwards . in this way , for a student it is easier to find his own goal . in addition i think that a guy , coming out the high-school , can not decide what he would like to do five o six year later . so the university give him a possibility to make an idea . i met people who decided to change faculty after few month because , thank to this wide range of subject , they understand that the particular faculty they have choosen did not fit with their interest . nevertheless , after the university , this broad knowledge could be a `` skill '' that factory or laboratory do not require , i am sure that they want people with experience , but here we are again , exeprience is something that you can achieve not suddenly in university , it is something that you can build working . a job can give to a student the necessary ability about a field that , of course , it is more specific than subject that he ha studied before . all in all , in my opinion it is right that university provide a broad knowledge to their student and moreover i think that the specific skill must be acquired afterwards , maybe during a job experience .
