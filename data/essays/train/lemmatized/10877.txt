the question at hand is that `` will there be fewer car in use after twenty year than there today '' . the automobile technology ha been climbing acclivity of advancement over the past few year . but at the same time the challenge introduced due to the fast depleting petroleum resource ha impeded high hope of the industry . but still i would say that the industry would continue to flourish irrespective of the fore mentioned challenge due to several reason . the most pressing reason would be the earnest research in the field of new and renewable source of energy to substitute of petroleum . a few company have already come up with electrical car while the research on the hydrogen cell are speeding up . these energy source not only answer the challenge of depleting petroleum resource but also picturises an ecofriendly future generation car . this is because the expected emission from electrical or hydrogen cell based car are much lower than the car of today . although the initial price range of the new generation car are rated above the car of today , the running cost is expected to be considerably le . for example in the case of an electrical car the running cost is all about chargin the cell which would be much cheaper compared to the oil price twenty year later . so in the long run the next generation car would be cheaper than the pesent day car . another important factor is that pocessing a car ha become an important part of one social dignity . the purpose of buying a car ha grown much beyond the sole purpose of transportation . the hype on the formula1 racing and automobile exibitions ha ha influenced people in all stratum of the society . despite the rise in oil price the number of car buyer ha never looked down . the medium ha been quite successful in transforming the once adomant car market into an inelastic senario . when all the automobile industry have charged up their research sector and with the existing medium hype it is impossible to belive that the auto industry will collapse .
