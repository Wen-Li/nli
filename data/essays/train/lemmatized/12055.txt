mostly there is two kind of people . one is trying to do new thing and take risk . on the othere hand , people like to do only thing they know it before without takeing any risky thing . each kind of these people have their reason . i will discus more about them in this assay . first of all , people who like to do new thing and to involve in risky thing , i will call it a `` risky man '' . this man have the feel of challenge . there fore , he like to do arisky and strainge thing and he enjoy it . for instance , a man who like to claim mountain , sailing a round the world or , for more risky , swiming from country to others . why do the risky man do this thing ? propeply he want to grant a huge number of money and to be a famouse and unforgitable . further more , most of these people you can find them in ginnes record . secondly , people who like to do normal and ussual thing , i can call them a `` calmy man '' . this man like to live in peacfull and calm life . he prefer to have a happy family than making risky thing . plus , he think that person who do a risky thing is craizy . more over , this calmy man ussually have a job with loving partner . how ever , he rarely go on travils and trip . finally , i think being a risky man it is not good due to the risky situation that he face during his life . also , being a calmy man is not good too . his life is very quite and boring . in my opion is that compining between the two personality is better . so then from time to another you can make little risky and new thing like saling about or building a wooden house . more over , having a nice family with a good job .
