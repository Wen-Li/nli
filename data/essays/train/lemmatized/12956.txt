i agree on this statement . i think people loose stenght and other physical ability a they get older and also they loose free time to have fun . young people can enjoy there time without any matter of money or time . i think that older people doe not have time to enjoy life . what they have in mind is the reponsibility of there family and the worry of of child , so they need to work work and work for their family . if they stoped working no one will help your family nor your self . this belief is a common sence to teenager . we all believe that people working doe not have the extra stenght to entertain their self . on the contrary , teenager have both the srenght and time . we use our time luxurious a it seems eternal . we do not have to think of responsibility . therefore what we do in our dily life is to have fun everiday any minute , and do not think about the future . we use our time only to entertain our self . teenagers are free to do any thing . most of the teenager in japan think to enjoy life . young people still have not seen the hardness of life because they still do not have the responsibility . but i think that is not bad . young people can use that time freely to get mature . the young age is filled with experience and their experience make their life so enjoyabl
