i agree with the statement that student should understand idea and concept rather than learning fact . understanding idea and concept is important for student to acquire knowledge . once if the student get idea of the concept he can easily understand the fact . let u take an example regaring this statement . suppose if a student ha a brief idea of politics then he can understand what is going on in the present world and presenrt country . he can even describe how is it going on and what is wrong and right . i state that understanding concept is the main criterion of the subject or lecture . if a student understands a concept throughly he can score good mark and he never forgets that concept and idea in his life time . this is the way of student to develop in his thinking and he can easily grasp the fact going around . ideas and concept play an important role in the present education system and present world . suppose if a person is having nill knowledge about politics it is difficult for him to understand the fact going around . if he dont know what is the concept of work and energy he cant understand the common day to day activity . let u take english if a student dont know the language and alphabet of english it is difficult for him to learn grammer and spelling . if a person ha nill knowledge about a topic he cant write an essay . concepts and fact are very important in all acepts . if he just learn fact he get half knowlege of the concept . he can understand only a part of the theory not totally and completely . so i conclude that idea and concept play important role in understanding fact . '' as great philospher said that half knowledge is always dangerous '' .
