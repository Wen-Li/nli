young people and older people enjoy their life in different way . some people think that young people enjoy life more than adult , however other people think the opposite . i will discus both point of view and finally give my opinion . young people enjoy their life in several way . children have fun playing with their toy , they can spend hour playing with them and they do not get bored . teenagers like to go out with their friend and also to go to party . for example , a a teenager i like to go to the beach with my friend and go to disco and pub . young people also enjoy life when they reach a goal . for instance , i felt really happy when i won the first place with my friend in a rugby competition . children also enjoy and feel happy when they know someone protects them and give them love . older people have fun and enjoy life in many way . adults feel happy when they reach a goal or they get something important . for example , when my father wa hired in a very good company in my country he wa really glad and i noticed he wa enjoying it . other way to have fun is travelling , most adult like to travel and meet other people . for instance , my mother is a person who like to travel a lot and i always go with her , i enjoy it too but i know thats the way my mother enjoys her life . something that is very common is that adult lay on their bed and watch television and they seem to enjoy it , even though some people find it boring . in conclusion , i think that younger people enjoys life more because there are more moment of happiness while they are child and teenager . they have fun in easier way than older people . therefore , in my point of view , child and teenager enjoy more their life .
