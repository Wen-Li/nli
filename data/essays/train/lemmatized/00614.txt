when we are young we spend a lot of time following amusments and keeping enjoying , but when we grow we begin to leave these kind of entertainment . the youngest people are le of problem or responsability and so they can spend time only to enjoy themselves . in my humble experience when i wa young , my life consisted in having fun . i keep meeting with my friend and i wa not interested in thinking about my future . but while the time passed , i would keep growing and also my idea and my kind of life . in fact now i have many responsabilities and i must have the just maturity to decide when i can enjoy myself or not . for instance , i 'm studing fashion design and i want to became an important fashion designer so sometimes i must make some renunciation to obtain my goal . in according to my experience i agree with the statement that is , `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . but there are other case in which also old people enjoy their life like child . i disagree with these type of living because i think that when we are old we must reach a certain maturity . we can not enjoy ourselves forever .
