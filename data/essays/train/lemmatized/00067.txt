in ancient korea , there wa country called cho-sun . the king of cho-sun , sejong , said that knowledge give people to live with a fortune , and hope . but knowing many knowledge , but just half of it is worth nothing at all . the world we live in now , information and speciallity became the most valuable item to get a job or success and get lot of money . if a man who have broad knowledge of many academic subjuects , he sure will be having not much problem to live and he probably wo n't get stuck by some kind of problem . but if it me ? i would rather gamble my life to become the best not just middle . having a sepcific but deep knowledge about one subject . it can be very dangerous thing . he should worry about even he is specified about that knowledge , what happens if the world , the society think that that subject isnt that usefull and not important . because he is speicified to it , he could not be able to get a job leaving that subject . but , like this day he is specified in a subject that is so usefull in this world . he will be welcomed by anyplace that he go , and he will get lot of money and people would see and get to him closer . what ever people chose , i think that a man or a woman should have faith on the subject that they like and want to know about . and with out a doubt keep going on within that subject .
