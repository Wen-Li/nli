i think that is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , because once they have clear in their mind the concepst about some article , called science , mat , phycology , any thing tha they are learning , it is posible to follow up with the learning procecess . i completly agree , when i have idea of what my professror is talking about , when i comprhended the base of any discoution , is the point to opened the door to the understatndin and after , i can memorize and learn the fact . many time student , include myself , are seeting in a class , where the professor is showing the fact , but seems like professor and student most forget that how can you have an example or talk about a fact with out understand the mean idea . i am in a nursing class for example , if i do not understand the idea or concept about the heart mechanism , how the heart work , how the blood it is pump , thense i will never understant the fact tha a patient is having a heart attack due to high blood pressure . it is really important for any student , of any profetion , for any area of life , to understand firts the idea , the concept , it is the idea that show up first in our brain , that make u think , is those thougths that motivated u to find the fact , i think the fact should follow a good understanding of the idea , finally if a student is in a class with out undestend idea , is better to ask question , express themself about how they fell , and have some help with book , web , or talking with the tacher , it is better understand than learn fact , once i understand , the rest is easy .
