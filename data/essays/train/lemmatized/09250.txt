i do agree very much that the advertisement make product seems much better than they really are . i would say that the company that want to sell a certain article , have to present it a something you must have . some time they tell you that will make you nicier , some time they tell you that it will make you smarter , but they allways try to convince the customer that if you have `` that '' product you will be better . companies invest a huge amount of money in the advertisemet field . they know those maney are well spent . this is increasingly happening since the world of the telecomunication ha been globalize . an example often mentioned is the coca cola . in every corner of the world you go you will be able to see the advertisement of coca cola . and it work ! there are many place in le developed country where is easier to find a bottle of coca cola rather than wather , and some time it is also true that is safer to drink coca cola insthead of water . actually i believe that the company , sometimes doe not present them product better than they are , but they make the advertisement in a way you think that `` simple '' thing is now nice and usefull . of course behind this process there are plenty of professionist that just work on it all the time . to make you feel , you can not leave without that `` mobile '' phone . i am old enough to know that the life is possible ( and may be better ) without that mobile , even if it seems to me , when i think about it , that it ha allways exist . pruduct can be a good a they are advertised , the trick is , how to make peaople think that thay ca n't leave without it , and i am sure they will find a way to sell you anithing they want . there is also a copmetition between them , i mean between the seller , so that they have to show his product compare to a `` common '' one , and tell you the reason why his product is much better compare to another , wich is usually le costly . but this is another issue .
