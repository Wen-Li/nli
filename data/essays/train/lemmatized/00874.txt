ii do n't agree with the following . is very difficult , in my opinion , think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all we have to consider that there are a lot of countries that are in expansion , countries like china , india , brasil . in this place there is an economic boom that in my opinion will increase a lot the car 's production . if we consider that in this country live 1/3 of the world ' s population , it 's simple to think that the use of car can only increase . another reason cause i do n't agree is that we , and when i say '' we '' i consider the '' rich '' world , do n't want to use a different way to move or different solution instead car . in my own opinion is possible that in twenty year we can find a solution for the pollution using elettric car or another ki
