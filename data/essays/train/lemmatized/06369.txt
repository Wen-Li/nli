the landscape of our cityes ha completely changed in the last 100 year . during the last century our grandparent were used to move through the city with horse or just by walk . but after the introduction of the car , and also the blast of economy in our country , our parent were the first to buy a car for their family , instead of a charriot . the industrial and economical revolution is keeping to let u think that we need more technology in our daily activityes , but i 'm not so sure . i really think that we actually can not controll the rise of our factoryes and also the pollution that they produce . at the same level i do n't think that we can stop the industrial revolution and the idea that `` we are reaching the perfect society '' a they would like to teach u . this is why i really think that is quite unreal that in the next twenty year there will be fewer car in our street . i concour with those who think that the number of car are going to increase in number without control , especially those car that are particularly made for specific purpose , such a the city car . i live in rome , where we are actually almost 4 million of people , and i think to be right when i say that every family owns a car , sometimes more than one . in the last 5 year in rome we have been witness in the introduction of a new type of car called `` smart '' . this car look like a toy . it ' s small , compact , coloured , and the most important fact is that it 's easy to parck , due to it small dimension . the fact is that in rome we actually have almost 400.000 of these small car in the street . once i have read an article on a german newspaper that showed this phenomenon . the fact is that all the big factoryes that produced this small car , that by the way is designed by mercedes , are closing worldwide . smart factoryes are out of business in china , germany , france , but not in italy . in fact in italy , of course mostly in the big cityes , the problem of the number of car is huge . besides our government have been so clever that in the last 10 year they have always thought that a good way to solve this problem wa to economically help people in buy a new car , instead of improve the bus service or the subway line . besides i really think that our economy is based on oil . all the principal war worldwide are based on the oil possetion : iraq , afganistan , iran . i know that almost 20 year ago someone discovered the possibility to let our engine work with water , or alternative propeller , but still our car work with gas . thus a long a our economy is based on oil , the number of car will not decreased in our cityes , but they will also increased in our small town and country .
