as an old saying go , in order to be a good scholar or scientist , one should know ` something about everything , and everything about something ' . this statement obviously refers to an idealistic condition , a it would be very hard , for any real-life person , to thoroughly fulfill any of the two requirement ; it doe quite effectively convey , however , the idea that a detailed specialistic preparation loses it purpose , without the background of an adequate general culture , and conversely that generic knowledge itself is futile , if one doe not pick up a field of interest in which to seek excellence . i think that broad knowledge can be useful a a support , a an exercise for the mind , a an extensive source of model and possibility that may be applied to one 's own specialistic need . specialistic knowledge , nowadays , change by the blink of an eye : i 'm thinking for instance of medicine , which is my own field of interest . a good general culture will help you absorb new idea and technique more quickly and efficiently , and will help you find new way around problem . in fact , gathering specialistic knowledge is all about following the step of the great who preceded you in your own path ; but if you are looking to open a new way , you may well have to use other model and idea that can be found in your own , peculiar culture and experience . on the other hand , it is very difficult to actually do anything constructive , without choosing to specialize in some branch of knowledge of science . ` knowing something anout everything ' , to get back to the old saying , can hardly take anyone to having a job , or to do it well . .. drawing my conclusion , i would say that i mainly disagree with the statement provided , in that i think that specializing is essential to play a productive , original role in any branch of culture and , i daresay society . general knowledge , anyway , remans a powerful tool to help you excel in your own specialization field . i would end by suggesting that , until the age of 18 or so , education should be aimed at building up general knowledge , or , better , to formation rather than to instruction . then , everyone who chooses to go on studying should be encouraged to choose a fitting specialization . i think that in my country right now , committing choice in young people 's learning path are being way too much anticipated , and the risk is that the professional of the future be narrow-minded super-experts .
