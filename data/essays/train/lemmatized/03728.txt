nowadays it is said that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . is it true or not ? to come up with that question we should make a comparison with the past and today . at the past before the technological improvement there were lot of thing which a humanbeing wa not able to do alone . for example think about not having any washingmachine . when we think about the time that the female humanbeing must be doing all the housework . at these time family are much more crowded and a a result people have to wash much more clothes . washing all the clothes by herself is not possible for a woman , all the other young people ha to help their mother to have clean clothes . but now almost all of u have washingmachines in our house . when somebody in the family have dirty clothes he \ she do n't have to call anybody . he \ she put clothes in the machine and in an hour they are clean and ready . year by year the population of the world is increasing . there not too much place to work and earn money . at the sum people prefer having small family such a parent and one child to have good life condition according to their money . at the old time people were usually making farm work . when you are a farmer the more people you have in your family to help you , the more product you will have . because of that people used to prefer having crowded family . and when a child ha brother and sister it ha to be social and help the others to have something to eat , to earn money or to have clothes to wear . finally by the improvement of technology , life is much more easier but technology make youngster selfish . young people choose playing computer game or surfing on the internet inspite of helping their mother in the kitchen and giving enough time to helping their commutinies .
