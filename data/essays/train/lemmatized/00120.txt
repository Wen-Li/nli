i strongly believe that experience and the knowlege come from the chance . we get more knowlege and experience by chancing our main subject than specializing in one specific subject . also we would have a chance to find the subject which we really like by chancing our subject . whether you believe it or not , different kind of subject give u more information than the same subject . this is because we have a chance to improve u in many area . for example , if we study a a computer engineer , we would develope u in the area of art history by this method . and i believe that the fact that we take art history couses in the school make u more important engineer than the ordinary engineer since he would desing the internet site more interesting and more exciting . working in different subject give u a chance to find the subject which we really like . let ' imagine a person choose a subject which he doe not like very much . if he doe not take the course which is different from his major subject , he will never find the subject which he really like . on the other hand , working in differnt subject make the people more aware about the the other thing . for that reason people would see the differnt thing a a hobby , not a stranger thing . all in all , chance contain many advantage in term of information and our hobby . by studying the other subject we have a chance to undrestand what the subject we really like , and we get more information and experience for both our social and the professional life .
