historically , student have been thought given facs and definition . but recent development show , that a new form of education , namely teaching the principle guideline , the basis of complex structure is more useful for student in order to understand a certain problem . that raise the question whether or not the old form is still appropriate ? first of all , i would like to point out that i 'm a student of a university that strongly encourages the student to think for themselves . therefore it is very essential to understansd the basic structure and the idea behind a problem . simply learning fact is not only boring but also very likely to be forgetten soon . for example , it is possible to learn chemical reaction simply by heart but is also possible to learn why element react in a specific way and how they do . not only that it is easier to learn one concept instead of a whole set of formula but it also make you able to understand how the element behave under different circumstitions . that simple chemical example is applicable to a whole range of problem . moreover it is essential for a later job , to have completely understood the principal of certain structure . with a broad basis of concept , you are able to solve problem more independently and to anticipate possible future problem . it is no use for anyone being able to respond to a certain problem with fact that have been learned , but not having understood what stand behind them . finally , i 'm personally convinced that lerning too much fact is a waste of time and a barrier when you try to communicate with specific people over a complex topic . to conclude , it should actively be encouraged to learn the essential sructures and to build one own opinion , rather than learning fact
