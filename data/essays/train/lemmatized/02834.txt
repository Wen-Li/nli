`` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' it 's really an intersting subject , and i agree with statement and i think it would be better and i have three reason to support my opinon . my first reasone for beliving that it 's would be better to have fewer car is , that if we have fewer car in the city , that will help to reduse the crowded in the city , in addtion every one will reach his work at early time , and olso we can stay a way from the late and absent at the unviersity . on the other hand we will stay a way from accident , that maybe happend becuase of crowded . my second reason for beliving that it would be better to have fewer car is , to protect the envirnment from the pollution which is happend because of the crowded i mean when we have a milliones of car that will cause many dangerous poisione , so if we have a fewer car that would protect u and hepl or child . so i think that main point that we have to protect it and stay a way from it `` crowded '' . my third resone and it the last one for beliving that i would be better to have fewer car is , that maybe when we have fewer car , that would help the other , imean if we have fewer car , many people will use the other way to go from place to anthore . it will encourge the other tranportnation like the train and bus , so that will help the people to complete i mean to get the money that they need . in conclusion , i want to say it really important to reduse the car number in the area and i think i would better to have fewer car in the world for these reason . because it cause the crowded . because it maybe pollute the envirnment . because it maybe help the other people by giving the money a i mentioned in the third reason .
