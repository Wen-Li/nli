we have all kind of people in our society . some people are successful and some people wo n't . but i feel successful are some some maverik they try out new thing they take risk in there work to gain success . i agree to the following statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' i have many example to explain the above statement but i choose one of that is the maverik actor , director and singer kamal hassan . he ha been successful in his acting career because he try new thing rather repeating story or anything else sometimes he fails to gain profit on introducing movie . but he never stop to try different thing in industry . for example he introduce a special movie in that they wa no speeach or we can call speeachless movie he dare to produce this flim which wa a great success in his career and he did not stoped producing different a such a this . but sometimes he fails to break the box office but he did not stoped producing such movie . now he had got 17 flimfare award and he ha called the greatest actor in indian flim industry
