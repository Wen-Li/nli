i clearly disagree with the following statement . i believe that the phenomenon will be the opposit and that , in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . the reason supporting my opinion are the following : first , i think that population increase and the devevoppment of certain country are two main factor that will make the number of car raising . as we all know , population is increasing . in consequence , the number of people using a car will increase too . second point , the economic developpment of country such a china or india will also represent a higher number of car sold and used . in addition to that , i also believe that even polution problem will not stop the developpement of the car industry . the reason why is because new energy such a gaz or solar energy are being developped . i think that people will be more and more concerned about environmental problem and will use these new energy . the last reason why i think the number of car will be more important in 20 year is because people are more and more individualistic and are really exigent concerning their confort and freedom . so , they will prefer using their car instead of taking common transportation such a bus or subway . to conclude , i would say that car industry is not going to lose importa
