i agree with the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . when i wa in korea , i took a trip with my family . we traveled japan . we were in a group led by a tour guid . they helped u a lot . first of all , we could n't speaking japanese , and we did n't know direction of their location . also , we worried if there is dangerous thing go around city . however , we got a tour guide with our group member . she took u a lot of place that we did n't know before . also she took u a lot of popular place in japan and restaurant . we had a good time with our tour guide . they help people to enjoy their trip , also they are so helpful if we get in trouble with foreign language . secondly , if we travel in a group led by a tour guide , we can meet a lot of people a a group member . as we travel in a group , we were in the group with other family member . they also loved travel in a japan . we shared beauty of japan with u . a tour guide led u popular place and we took a lot of great picture from there . it made me one of beautiful memory . finally , a tour guide teach u to view world widly . they tell u and teach u different culture and different costume . they were not like teacher , but it seems more comfortable when i learn about different contry and their culture in the class . it make me more enjoyable and more interesting . also it helped me to view world widly . i 'm getting more interest in other different country . i wish i could visit all of the place in the world . a tour guide make people to learn different culture comfortably . it 's really enjoyable when we travel in a group led by a tour guide . as travel in a group led by a tour guide , more safety and more enjoyable than when we travel by ourselves . we can learn different culture easily than by alone . it help people to getting more interesting in different culture and country ,
