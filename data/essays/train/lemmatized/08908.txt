`` i'ts all youngone 's after god who can do everything if they wish to . '' mahatma gandhi . i agree with this fact that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . at present if you see all young one 's are just trying to have a good job or other source of income rite after the begning of their career . then after gaining this they are just involved in all that and just forget about their country , their parent . with the advancement of technology , many new mean of entertainment a television , computer , internet etc were discovered . when child enters from childhood to young age , he ha all meens of entetainment . he doe not even need a friend to play with . he us computer to play computer game , us internet to have chat with others and all that becomes a part of his life . thereafter he generally becomes isolated from all the external and public work . no one want to join any community just because he think that it is all waistage of it time . the time which he spends in computer or just with some of his friend for gossiping . but it is very necessary for everyone to have a life which he spends in helping others or just of other task related to public . it is a great source of motification and influence in work if u work in community . no one know his shortcoming if he just work alone . if we want all around development of our earth then we all have to work a a community , for which all of u should give our precious time . all of u are very energetic in our young age . if we 'll waist our time and not give it to help our community now that ultimately we 'll have to suffer after some time , when next generaion will come . young people should place an example over upcoming youngster so that they might also follow their path and will join community which could be helpful for all others . i think that we all should join atleast one community and give atleast half an hour per day for it development .
