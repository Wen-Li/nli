`` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . '' according to this sentence i come up with many idea , and i would like to say that i agree with this statement . i have traveled in many country , such a japan , america , canada , australia and korea . most of the time i visited other country by a tour guide . the best thing about a tour guide is that they have been there before , so they are very familiar with there . they know all the best part of those country , so they will show u in a order time . in addition , a tour guide will book everything for you , for example , hotel , restaurant , park , bus . .. they know all the time ! for example , when ha a big event or show , when the park are open , when the restaurant close , and where the place the visitor have to go during what time . they also know which hotel is cheaper , but still nice enough to let u sleep comfortable , so we wo n't have to worry about where we are going to sleep tonight . furthermore , they will tell you how to get to the place you want to go , and tell you what you should buy down there because it 's cheap and can help you to keep memory . they also will tell you what kind of restarants are around here , and which one is famous , so you do n't need to waste a lot of time on thinking what you should have for dinner . however , because you are in a group , so if someone is late , you have to wait until all the people in your group together ; on the other hand , you wo n't spend too much time in one place because you do n't have much time and they still have many place they are going to show you . in conclusion , i think travel in a group led by a tour guide is a great thing if you do n't want to book everything by yourself . it is also a good thing if you do n't know how to drive or never been to there before because someone familiar with there will show you around so you do n't need to worry about it . therefore , i like to travel with a tour guide very much .
