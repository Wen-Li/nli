i disagree with the statement that it is better to have knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . today due to vast expansion of infrastructure and man power , specializing on a particular subject would lead to a positive and creative solution . the globalisation which is rapidly growing across the globe requires totally refined finished product unlike expecting for conventional product in the primitive time . this statement can be clearly explained with the help of an example , let take civilengineering into account , civil engineering is an unision of 6 area of specialization namely foundation engineering , structural engineering , environmental engineering , construction planning and management , water resource engineering and transportation engineering . if we try to gain a broad knowledge of all these subject it would be difficult for an engineer or a researcher in these field to deliver a refined design which would suit the present trend . this is because all the field of specialisation mentioned above are entirely different from each other . the foundation engineering deal with foundation design , structural engineering deal with the super structure design and in this way each ha it own entity , so a good engineer having a sound knowledge in any one area can excel in that field and would be able to deliver all the requirement needed in that specific field . taking highway engineering into consideration , it totally distinct from other field a it deal with pavement design and harbour design . hence for an efficient engineer or a researcher in this field would be able to derive better design from the knowledge he gained through this specialized field . in the similar way an environmentalist could give proper suggestion on air , water and marine pollution more effectively than a person having a broad knowledge in this field . the branch of civil engineering is just an example to explain why gaining knowledge in a particular specialization is needed rather than gaining broader knowledge in all the field . the strong belief which is coming from our primitive age that , it better to concentrate on one particular thing rather than putting hand in various field in order to get positive result . this conceptual belief prof that `` old is gold '' and is very much applicable in the present scenario a each and every individual is aiming for an accurate result in all the field . this belief can also be explained by a concept called `` six sigma '' , this concept is used in firm which produce good of various kind , the accuracy level achieved through this concept is that only one part produced is proven to be defective in 1 million part produced . this accuracy level is achieved through rigorous research and effort made by technologist in this particular field . hence i strongly believe and personally commit to the comment that having specialized in a particular subject fetch excellent and innovative result rather than gaining broad knowledge of many academic subject .
