i agree with the idea that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specializing in one specific subject . there are two reason for that . one reason is because i believe that broader knowledge make me possible to interact with more diversified people and this will result in creating a new view or new perspective in my mind . if i were someone who know only chemistry and ha no intimate knowledge of other academic field , people with whom i can make friend would be only someone like me who is a glutton of chemistry . i imagine this would not be salutary for myself , being aloof from the rest of the world . in the contraty , if i had interest and knowledge about , for example , german literature a well , aside from the major in chemistry , it would be possible for me to get acquainted with german people a well a to join a literature club . in this way , i can broaden my friend network which enables me broaden my view . this broad knowledge would also be favourable for childeren when we conduct education . the child tend to ask u so many question , this or that . if we could not answer at all , it would be disastrous for their growth . the other reason is a little bit more practical than the first one . in my opinion , having wider knowledge make u more advantageous during job-hunting activity . this idea may not be applied if somebody want to become an university faculty or scholar . in this case , we are requred to have very specialized knowledge on one topic . however , if you want to work in an organization , the personnel department check whether we have diversified knowledge , so that we are such people who accept any kind of direction , which show our flexible attitude . from these two reason , i think it is better to have a wide-ranged knowledge .
