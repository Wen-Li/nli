nowadays , the topic of the abusive use of car by men all around our planet is often discussed because it is quite relevant . it ha been observed that since the industrial revolution , which began during the mid-eighteenth century , the span of many environmental change ( such a the melting of the ice in the north pole ) , which wa previously of several thousand of year , ha been reduced to a few decade . it seems that there is a direct relationship between this abrupt reduction and the recent activity of men around the earth : the fabric in which we produce various material a well a the car we use release various type of gas in the athmosphere which are causing serious damage to our planet . however , i doubt the acknowledgement of this damage is a motivation powerfull enough to lead most of men to change their habit . there will always be a need for u to move quickly from one place to another . thus the real question is not whether there will be fewer car in twenty year : many research team have understood that the real challenge is not the reduction of the number of car , but the creation of a new generation of car . as a matter of fact , this new generation already exist : already thirty year ago , electric car a well a a new type of fuel ( mostly based on biologically non-harmful component ) have been created . however , each one of these two solution ha it drawback : the electric car are either too slow or too fast and this problem ha not been solved yet . as regard the new type of fuel , a lot of pressure is being put on government by lobby which have financial interest in the selling of the traditional type of fuel , i.e. petrolium . thus i suppose the future of our planet ( to which the use of car is closely related ) entirely depends either on the progress of science , or on the goodwill of the people in charge . ..
