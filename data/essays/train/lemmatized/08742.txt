in my opinion older people enjoy life more than younger people do . i can count two reason for this . firstly , a younger person doe not care about time . he think that everything in his life will continue a before . but when he start to get older , especially after thirty ; he understands that the thing are gradually changing . for instance a young man spends most of his time playing sport , going to club , watching film etc . after ten year the habit start to change . you start to make a program in which you can use your time efficiently . instead of playing sport most of the time you just play 1 hour a day . or instead of watching tv all night ; you seperate this time into more part and do many thing in order to make it more enjoyable . moreover , perceiving enjoyment of life differs from person to person . from my point of view adding some value to humanity is the prominent aim of my life . for instance when i used to be a freshman student , i always cared about passing the exam . i rarely to think about finding new thing and contribute to science world . i thought that after graduating i would have much time to do research . but now i see that if i used my time efficiently and prepare myself to my goal it would have been better . so a time pass people realize that enjoying life is connected strictly to what you want to do in your life and whether you achived your goal or not . when you get older you will be targeted to your dream closely . in conclusion ; when people get older ; they understand the meaning of life and try to enjoy it more . it come with maturity .
