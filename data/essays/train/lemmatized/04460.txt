i agree with the saying that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . as in many case i have seen product are generally low quality product , particulary in the case of eatable and face cream or hair gells . the company simply make fool of people by showing there product a the ultimate product you are looking for . it make false promise to people about it quality and it effectiveness . i remember one instance what happened in india few year ago , a lot of pesticide were found in coca cola and pepsi drink . these drink were found unsuitable and unfit for drinking purpose but still they were sold in indian market without controlling those pesticide in them . i think they wereselling just because of there huge brand name which i think is really unethical on part of bussiness . i remember one more instance , i brought one fairness cream , it advertisement showed a person getting fairer and fairer day by day by using that product so i thaught of buying that and finally when i brought it and used it it caused some rash on my skin so finally i had to consult doctor who reccomended not to use that cream anymore . so this is how thing worked . in my opinion company should not make any false promise or those promise which will not come true to there customer . in that way they are decreasing there long run profit and people faith on them . however advertising is the best way tointoduce and launch new product in the market and make people aware of different substitute available for the product in the market . thus creating healthy competition in the market for the companiesand allowing new entry in market .
