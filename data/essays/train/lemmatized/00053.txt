at the learning process wherever at school or homestudy , it is importand to teach student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . most student do n't like study math . because student are used to study by fact . there is no active reaction during the class . the teacher write down the roman numeral on the board and force student to memorize that there is no make sence why student should learn all about these kind of complicate question . however , if they would have known , math is need when they have plan to get morgage for thier future house or to calculate the discount of the purchase at the store , it will be motivate to them to learnd math . as a student who study music composition , i have a class to write a fugue like bach style . when i have a list of all the stuff of writing such a canon , imitation and inversion . i wa so frustrated . because those stuff are not music , that is just fact which bach inventer to me . it doe n't give any challenge . after the class . i go to library to find the real concept of writing a fugue . it is german word ; mean one follows another or one try to escape the direction from the other . it wa understandable and give a mitivation to write a fugue . why doe n't fugue teacher explain the concept of the fugue ? student want to know about the understand idea more than the fact . learning ha to be full of will and purpose with a pleasure in student 's mind . the pleasure of learning came from knowing the idea and concept . the fact is le important than that .
