capitalism can not survive unless it alters the social reality we are experiencing . this alterance of social reality is most visible in the case of advertisement . in this essay , i will argue that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , since advertisement are the facade which are needed in an environment of intense competition . first , i will start with the need of the company to make advertisement . afterwards , i will give several example to support my argument . capitalism in our age ha produced a society which some thinker name a `` consumption society '' . in this consumption society , even cultural event are mass produced and the proliferation of all kind of product result in converting reality into an hyperreality , if we may borrow baudrillard 's and eco 's usage of the term . the mass ' experience of hyperreality leaf them in a passified situation exposed to all kind of advertisement of product . people may do nothing but think that the advertisement are telling the truth about the product whereas they are not . some specific case will illuminate this point . as a result of globalism , production ha shifted mainly to east and south-east asia . many firm making the production by exploiting the labor force in these part of the world although the consumption of these product mainly occur in the west . for example , all the firm producing ` iron ' for ironning , except moulinex and roventa , produce it in china . all ! so the production process of different brand-names are the same . therefore , the item that is produced is also the same . just the brand name differs . however , the advertisement manipulate our thought in such a way that we think one brand is better than another one , whereas there 's no difference at all . another basic example would be one of the advertisement of ` colaturka ' . the brand ha adopted all kind of cultural value in order to make it attractive to the turkish population . it ha , in fact , succeeded since the sale ha increased when colaturka wa first available in the market . however , then it ha dropped because people comprehended that they were manipulated by the illusion of the advertisement , and , after all , the taste of colaturka wa not really good . to sum up what i have put forward thus far , i have to stress several point . the global economy of the world ha favored capitalism in producing a consumption society . products and brand have proliferated and since there wa serious competition between different brand , advertisement have become the ring to fight . in this war over the product ( which are basically the same since they are produced in the same place or are exposed to similar production process ) , the advertisement display the item in such a way that people are manipulated towards buying it . there are , of course , exception . there are really good product which are advertised in a good way . however , most advertisement make product seem much better than they are because this is the only way of selling the product .
