do you think that young people enjoy life moer than older people do ? i think that most people agree this statement . i think that it is natural that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . because young people have there thing that it is hard for older people to get ; time , curiosity , and responsibility . first , young people have enough time to enjoy their life . young people have class on school but it is not spend whole day and they have free time everyday . on their free time , they can do anything what they want to do , such a playing with friend , doing club , doing homework , and doing part-time job . also they can go everywhere they want to go . they do not think that they enjoy life more than older people , because they just killing their free time by doing something . they just use their time effectively . second , young people have much curiosity to enjoy their life . for young people , life is unexpectable and there seems many interest thing . there are many wonderful thing to challange . they act a soon a they think . sometimes , not thinkig carefully lead them dangerous but their curiosity make them have possibility to get more specific knowlege and find something new and problem . third , young people do not have responsibility yet . they do not have limit for doing something and they also do not care about their fame of authority . they will act before not thinking that their action is good or bad . when they feced some problem , they will notice the importance of responsibility . from these reason , i think that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . their free time , their curiosity , and their irresponsibility , sometimes , connect to their social experience . by enjoying their life , they can get variety of knowlede , experience , and moral and then they grow up to adaluts .
