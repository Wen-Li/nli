i agree with this sentence . even though most of young people have enough time to give a help for theif community , they doe n't do , i think . most of young people have time for themselves . for example , they play sport , see movie , and so on . they always enjoy `` their time '' . there are few young people who have such `` time '' . but in most case , they do n't help their community . because , of course , it is funnier to play sport , see movie . probably they do n't argue that they have enough time to help their community , but in fact they do n't think that they want to spend `` thier time '' on helping their community , i think . we can understand this when we think a young person who is really busy . he doe n't have time to do many thing . naturally , he want to do something he like to do and probably he doe it . there are n't many young people who like to help their community , i think . then , why do people help theire community ? it is because these people have much thanks to their community . they want to do `` reply '' to their community . so they spend their time on helping their communitiies . so , i argue that it is important to educate young people . for example , i think that it 's good to make time to know work of their community a one of school work . young people do n't know work of their community well . so , they do n't have enough thanks to spend their `` precious '' time on helping their community . that is , it is necessary that young peple know local work of the people who help their community very well . i agree with this sentence because of these reason .
