nowadays , student are exposed to learn thing that they do n't even understand . it is why , `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' when student , must learn fact without knowing what they are talking or learning about , mean nonsense at all . i agree that a fact is important but if they do n't know why it ha happened it wo n't be necessary for them to learn that because the day after , it would be off their mind . usually , thing that you learn at school must help you for the future , so if a student learn the fact before the understanding , he will not use this information again in his future . consequently , it 's better to understand an idea and a concept , because when you understand something it will be print much longer in your mind that you thought . when an idea is understood , the brain will stock the information because this idea could be useful for another time . a concept or an idea are exactly the same and they work together . first you understand the idea and then when you know it you can imagine the concept more easily . a student will learn more in defining and understood an idea or concept than just learn a fact . otherwise , sometimes fact are important in a way that they have a relation with real fact in a sense of natural event . for example , when on bbc news they introduced the tsunami event , everybody wa shocked but they learnt something before they understood why . .. finally , i will say that the best for a student will be to understand first the idea , imaginate it and finally learn it .
