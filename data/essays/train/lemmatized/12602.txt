since ford started to produce car in great number , in the early day of the 20th century , the rising did n't stop and we are facing today a major problem of mass car construction that can lead to a catastrophy . where would we be in twenty year ? the answer to this question must be definetly for a decrease of car number and this idea could be supported with two main argument . firstly , a positive development is that the transportation system are spreading in all the major city , wether it is called subway , tube , train or metro . this evolution come in favor of a popular mutation : people are leaving their car for a better choice : public transportation . this mean is faster and cheaper than car . and we see that it development can encourage people not to buy car . secondly and the most important idea is the dangerous consequence of the astonishing large number of car . the rise of the use of car is causing infinite traffic jam , risk of car crash that cost human life , plus the air pollution caused by the high amount of carbon rejected by the engine . these factor do not encourage car production growth , but on the contrary , the use of public mean of transportation which are secure , le polluting and save time for their user . but finally , admitting that there will be fewer car in twenty year , we must notice that these future car will contain a considerable improvement . in twenty year , car will be le polluting , more comfortable , and cheaper because of the advance in technology and mass production . in conclusion , if we try to make a comparison between private mean of transportation - car - , and public mean , we can definetly see the difference in security , time economy and pollution , and the choice of the public mean is a better one . for this reason , focus on the improvement of public transportation should be made in order to make it more comfortable and energy saving .
