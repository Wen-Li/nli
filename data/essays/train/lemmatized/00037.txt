i agree that successful people try new tthings and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . one thing is good about successful people they already know how to do what they know and succeed with it . now , they need to move on to another level and have more experience . they want also to to come with new project wich can make them more successful . successful people should come with more project , make more reseach for their knowledge because the more they know is the more they succeed and it will worth for them too . it is important for people who a large opportunity to what they know to attract the popularity of success . in the other hand , people with creativity is a benefit for the world because they always come with new project and they can handle the future easily . therefore people every body in the wold can count on them , such a the government , health care provider , section of cultural , section of education and commercial . wich can make their work easily by comming with new project . successful people who try new thing and take risk wil be more success ful than other people who affraid to take the risk and try new thing ; because they will limited to what they could learn and they could help . unfortunately , they wo n't helpfull for people who will need them , and the future will limited also for them and others . the world will reject them and it will bee waste of time for them .
