from my personal point of view this matter is a very hard issue to agree or disagree with . because we can not predict the future . i think that car are something that cause a lot of problem nowadays . for example , in big city such a : madrid . paris , london or new york the traffic is horrible and this cause a lot of problem . people are late most of the time because of traffic , have a lot of problem , such a , accident because of traffic , some people even have bad temper because of the traffic jam . and all of this is caused because we have too many car on the street . i know that having your own car ha a lot of advantage . because if you have your own car you can go wherever you want and whenever you feel like it . but in my opinion people should not be so selfish and think in all the disadvantage . for example i think that car cause a lot of pollution that damage our enviorment and damage our health too ! i can not agree with this statement , at least at this point . because i think that people is very lazy and preffer spending their money in a car than spendig it on public transportation . people preffer doing this for many different reason not only because they are lazy , i think that public transportation is not good enough to trust in it one-hundred per cent . becuase public transportation sometimes ha a lot of problem : ( it break down , or it delay . .. etc ) i think if public transportation improves within twenty year we might have le car on the street than now . but is that posible ? i do not think so . in conclusion i do not agree with this statement for all this reason .
