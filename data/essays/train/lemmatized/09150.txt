i agree with this statement , because the ultimate goal of education is to promote knowledge of a subject . knowledge of a subject only come from the full understanding of the idea and concept related to the topic . it is a important to know the main set of fact a it is to understand the idea and concept around those fact . in my experience being able to understand the idea and concept have often time help me to arrive to the same set of fact , proving that i have acquiered the knowledge necessary , but also the tool to conduct individual research and investigation . while it is true that there are exact science ( ie , chemistry , physic , or math ) which depent on specific unchangable fact , it is important that student of those subject are able to deconstruct the formula , paradigm , and algorythms that have produce such fact . this creates a deeper understanding of fact and when the researcher is faced with a problem it is easier to solve it in a succesfull manner . education should not concentrate on merely fact , specially in science where new discovery are happening everyday , which change the way we understand our universe . in the case of social science , such a history or anthropology , where fact are the building block to understand later development it is important to realize that those fact are normally told from the winning party in the conflict or the prevailing specie in an environment . in these case the understanding of idea and concept will help the student investigate how different event may have changed the final outcome . full understanding of idea and concept would lead to more complete and complex research , which will help to understand our world better and not remain in a status quo where fact are unchanged and become dogmatic with time .
