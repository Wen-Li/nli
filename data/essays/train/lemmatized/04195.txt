according to the statement `` if it is better to have knowledge of many acedemic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' i agree with the the statement to specialize in one specific subject . the reason for this is if we are involved in specific subject then we have very great opportunity in the future . why i disagree with having a broad knowledge of many acedemics is because it will involve you in various different issue and you wont be perfect in any of the subject , a we know half knowledge is always dangerous . the example why i choose to specialize in one specific subject is , you can become master of that subject , and start with the research orienting to that subject and which will help you in concentrating on one issue rather than many issue and it would end up with a chiotic situation . another reason why i believe to be specialized in one subject is , for example if you are in field of architecture , once you are done with your bachlore degree you would definetly like to do your post graduation in a specific subject , which will model you to become a better architect . for example master in emergent architecture which is not known in a country like india , and many other country and construction is boom in this part of country so for u to stand out in this global world we got to be creative and diffferent , the specific subject is not thought in india in a wide range and if we specialize in this particular subject then you stand at top of the world . now let me brief about this subject , it give various option on the morphogenisis of the module of any plane through various software , which creates amazing structure or graphic to the contemperory world . finally i agree with the statement to specialize in one specific subject .
