nowadays it is considered a a very popular topic that one should have knowledge of many academic subject or specialize in one topic . many people ignores this topic but it is very important for the university student and one who have an aim to have an academic career . opponents of the idea ` having one specific subject ' consider that one should have relative subject like math and physic , so when they see an integral in the middle of a physic lesson , they should avoid the problem with ease . moreover they think that one can earn much money when s/he ha two or more subject . in addition to that it will ease the communication between student and teacher , when they have many thing to talk about . although in first sight it is seen that one should have many academic subject , it is not like it is seen . first of all one should know a lot of thing about maths if she/he is a physician . so s/he doe n't have to make longer his/her study and be also an mathematician . it will bore the teacher when s/he is young and a university student and s/he can change his/her plan being an academician . in addition to that it is always considered that one can earn a lot of money when s/he ha two or more subject . the answer is simple : no ! the academician are paid by the hour that they teach . no one pay you much money even if you have ten subject or one . the payment is always the same . thirdly physician do n't have to know much about psychology . because thay have no time to spend with another subject for just finding a topic with student to talk about . if they want to talk about something they can talk about football match , tv program etc . . at last we should consider that academician are busy people and they are being waited for the research and new technology . the second subject will reduce the chance of discover the new part of the modern life because thay wo n't have time and energy to focus on the new research . if everyone could do just his/her own job , the world would have been probably different and lovely . .
