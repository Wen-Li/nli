i agree wit hat point tha l people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they aalready know . if the person is successful them will take oppurtunity and take risk to do some thing new or to create something new . scuh that it will increase his abilty and it will gain him self confidence . if he is sucessful he will gain the prestige from other people and his name will incerese and will reach his achievement easily . so importantly the abilty to take risk wil help him to succed in his achievemnt . so he will be able to make his own idea to create new ting exist in his work . and he will able to create the thing masterly and perfectly such that it will help in many way such that his ability to handle the thing which are newer to him will be be solved in profically manner or new preventoins can be handed easily . so it will increase his abilty to do work . and most impotantly he will gain self prestige , name , fame , etc. so this will change his whole life . and dramatically he will reach new height in his life . so where a in knowing the work you know will not increase his abilty but remian same for that period and will not increrase his abilty to master the thing and he will remain same what he wa and he will not gain fame and publicity for doing the job . and his creativity will be le and he dos'nt have capacity to take risk which will lead him end or not succesful at he end . and in these he wil be able to gain the self prestige for doing that job . so this will take him for failure in his life . so we have to try new thing and should be capeble of taking challenge in life . so it will take him to the way of success . so more important he will increse his knowledge . and gain self respect and more importantly he will gain fame , prestige , money in our life .
