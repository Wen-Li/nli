i personally disagree with the given statement . in my opinion there is only a different way to enjoy the life between yougers and olders . young people are in the beginning of their life and they have still so much to try that they are attracted to the more exstavagant thing to do . also substained by their young age and lower experience they can afford more risk and try situation that make their adrenalin level to the top . but all of this is only giuded by their desire to become experienced about life , this is not a real more enjoyng way of life . the older part of the society doe not spend a sad life . they have tried all that emotion in the past and now they can enjoy through others experience . with many resposabilities to take care of , they can now get their enjoyment from what they have built , their family , their social relationship lasted many year , their job and so on . i do not think this is boring or le enjoying . may be the difference that many underline is in the impact of the two kind of enjoyment . it is clear that what a boy do is spectacularly enjoying , i do not want to say it is not , but also the style of living fo an adult can offer a real enjoyment , just a different kind and perhaps more deeper in the soul . in conclusion we can not do a garduatory about what give u more enjoyment but , in a easier way of thinking , i want to say that every age ha it own enjoyment , the problem is only how to catch it .
