in my opinion the most important thing for a student is not to learn fact , even though it should be useful , but to understand idea and concept . when somebody try to learn a fact he can do a lot of thing in a wrong way : for instance he can forget it after few year , or he can also alter some essential part of it . the result is to change the fact and alter completely the meaning of the information received . this can led to problem of understanding and , in the worsen case , to bigger crisis . this is the nature of the fact , somethink closely linked to our memory and therefore on something we can not completely rely . facts could also change a new fact come out or new proof are considered . what we should never avoid is the understanding of concept and idea . everybody can forget something that ha previously learned but nobody can forget his own idea . while fact are not part of our brain or of our spirit , idea are the most secret part of u . students should be educated to understand the idea of philosopher , politician , poet , writer etc. because in this way they can catch the real spirit of men . to make an example everybody can learn a poem but after few year a lot of people can start to forget it , but the idea hidden in the poem it will never be forgot . on one hand fact can change or can be altered by the time or by new discoverings they are the material part of the world , on the other hand idea are the spiritual part of our world , the part which will live forever . students should learn this main point : the real image of a person can not be understand by fact but only by his idea .
