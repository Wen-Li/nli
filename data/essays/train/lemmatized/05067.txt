knowledge is a very important part of our daily routine . gaining knowledge may be a very imprtant part of a student career . students gaining knowlede are offered job in view of their knowledge towards a particular subject . it may be a point that it is essential to have a minimum grip over the remaining subject rather than just having broad knowledge about a single acadamic subject . so by the following we can say that it is better to have a broad knowledge about many acadamic subject rather that just a single or specific subject . there may arise different situation by which the broad knowledge ove a specific acadamic subject would be sufficient . just consider a software engineer who ha a broad knowledge about the software part of his system is not capable of solving the hjardware issue arising . in the same way a person who is good at computer can not work for a company where mechanical engineer are required . hence if a person is capable of having broader knowledge about the various acadamic subject there may be chance that he mey even jump from one sector to the other just like a person findin softaware job more interesting thjan the mechanical job . he can change his platform only if he ha a broader knowledge about the software concept . having broad knowledge over various acadamic subject would help u out in various situation . let u even consider a person attending an interview in a huge establishment . ther is no gaurantee that the inteview may contain question relating to his subject , rather the interview may even consisit of question over various issue relating to various other subject . a person who is capable of containing broader knbowledge over just one issue may not be able to get through the interview to get the job . we can even consider the part of quiz competetion that include the subject of various other subject rather than just a single subject . a person with broader knowledge over various subject may only be capable of clearing the quiz competetion . hence we can say that `` it is better to have broad knowledge over many acadamic subjects rather than just specialize in one specific subject '' .
