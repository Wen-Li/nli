every person ha their own definition for enjoyment which might even change according to the various stage of life . i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . their is a vast age gap between the people compared who are in different phase of their life . young people enjoy life from their pure heart . they can do the activity which make them happy , excited and feel them elevated on top of this world . no matter how small the task they have done they enjoy it completely . in contrast the expertise of life . , ie the old age people enjoy their life for the matter of satisfaction . at this age they start living for their child , their family . they will be ready everytime to compromise their dream for the sake of their child . at this age they start thinking that they had lived their life completely now it the time of their child to live life , as the person grows older the problem of ego start , he ha to maintain his dignity according to his profession , the status in the society do matter , all these thing deprives them from the pleasure that they could experience by doing few thing which is really going to make them happy . young people , specially the child can perform certain activity which can not be posssible in the case of old age like asking few silly question to their mother which mother do reply patiently , playing in muddy water , child a such do not have any responsibilites on they shoulder . coming to the adolascents , they do enjoy life but here the definition of enjoyment change . they imagine themselves a independent individual who ha entered a competitive world which is even filled with fun and entertainment . they have a huge responsibility on their shoulder of leading a successfull life . they are the young blood who can party hard , work hard and accept the challenge of their life . in accomplishing them they gain experience and they even enjoy the difficulty faced by them . every person should enjoy till the time they are alive in this world . they should look their life a a challenge and face it darely and enjoy every aspect of it . young people enjoy more compared to others .
