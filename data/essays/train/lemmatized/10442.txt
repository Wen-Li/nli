nowadays , the more the student are educated , the deepest knowledge they will have on their subject . however , some of them may have two major . which idea is good ? in this essay , there are several reason why i do not agree with having broad knowledge of many academic subject . first of all , everyone ha got the same time . in other word , the condition to have an amount of study may be the same to everyone . if you spend all your time on a specific subject , you can impove a lot rather than the person who spend his or her time on two subject . this is because he or she should devide the time . let u assume that there are two student and the same time is offered : a person who only doe economics and b person who doe economics and politics . compared with a person , b person would know about politics more . however , a person would know about economics more deeply than b person . secondly , in the sense , broad knowledge of many academic subject can be useful for normal life . however , you would lose the competetion with others who specialize on a particular subject . a firm is a group of all the specialized people on their people . in the other word . there are several team and sub-organizations classified in a firm . it doe not need one who ha got narrow knowledge . for instance , every unversity ha got many departemts and would accept the person who really want to specialize his or her faviourite subject .
