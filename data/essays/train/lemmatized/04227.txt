i agree with this opinion . i have some reason to help my opinion . first , idea and concept are always basis of everything when we make a new product or fact . if someone have only a fact , he/she can use that fact but they ca n't use proper usage of this fact . we can use our fact to know their idea and concept . when i wa a child , my uncle gave me a airplane of paper craft . i can throw it and it will be flying on air . it wa surely intersting and exciting for me but i could n't understand why it can fly . it is a childish question but i wa so serious . so , i learned to know idea and concept are so important at that time . in addition , some people feel annoying on fact if they did n't know idea and concept . one of my friend will be angry when he ca n't understand anything . we can say mathematics is also consisted on idea and concept . he wa answering a question while we were taking a test , and i guessed he had a question which hard to understand when an incident happend . suddenly , he kicked his desk and went out from opuor class room . sometimes not to know idea and concept make people upset or somthing feeling bad . at last , if we know idea and concept , it will be fun to live in our life . because we might find other usage to enjoy playing or knowing on some fact . this discovery might be big achievement . it might be precious treasure on our life that can help other people life or influent good fact to our precious person . so , student should learn idea and concept because it can help them to know importance of everything how can we change something bad to good thing . it can supply u positive thinking . conclusingly , these are my opinion to understand idea and concept that it is more important than to learn fact . i think it is important to know how those fact consist on what idea and concept .
