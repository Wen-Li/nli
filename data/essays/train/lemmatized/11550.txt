every person should enjoy their life a much a they can . the life is not long , and it will end . so should n't we enjoy our life when we are young ? i disagree the statement , and i think older people enjoy life more than young people do . first , older people usually have more money than young people do . when you have money , you have the power . money is everything . although sometimes people say money ca n't buy happiness , without money you ca n't do anything . old people can use these amoung of money to travel everywhere around the world , and buy anything they want . in th other hand , young people start to find a perfect job . the power in them are not much . second , older people usually have family , which is the happiest place to be . when they see their childern grow up , they enjoy that happiness . when they have the grandchild , the happiness become more . old people have their own family to hang out with , they share everything everyday . but young people do n't stick around the house very often . they want to play , and they do n't want to be controled . although they are happy with their friend , not with parent . they 'll miss that . final , older people have more time than young people do . old people do n't worry about the work because maybe they are already retired , or they already have the position in the company . they can relax a much a they want without worrying their job . but young people have to work hard everyday and try to improve themselves to their bos . they try to find the mate , but they are too busy to find . young people ca n't enjoy themselves because they always have the pressure in mind . i am a young people now , and i try to balance my school and relax time . i ca n't say i am enjoying the life right now because i have n't get my goal yet . i want to be successful , and then having fun . i realize that the only way to enjoy the life is working hard a a young people and playing hard a a old people .
