i do agree with the following statement . i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i have several reason to share : first of all , young people have usually much more energy than older people . for exemple , young people can go do all kind of sport like skydiving , scubadiving , dancing , and a lot of other sport , without really think about the heart or bone problem . second , yound people still have to live many year and experience many different thing . a teenage want to become independant and go to travel all around the world to make his own experience , but older people are often already set with husband or wife , and with child , and prefer to relax at home during the week-end . third , yound people have much more free mind than older people . young people from today in france for example , live a life with a lot of comfort and do n't worry much about war or hunger , but some grand-parents experienced the war and remember the difficulty of this time . some have resentment against germans for example , but young people live all together in peace germans , spanish people and all because they did n't live the war . fourth , young people can experience much more thing with the evolution of the science . there are many innovation today that young people can use for their everyday life , that older people did n't have at their youth time . like the mp3 that can carry many song and most of the young people use it . to conclude , i think it 's normal that young people enjoy life more than older people do . everybody is young one day , and become old an other day .
