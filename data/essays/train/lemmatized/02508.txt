i do not think that traveling in a group lead by a tour idea is a great idea . while many would point to the benifits of having a seasoned , knowledgable resource who understands the lay of the land , the local language and is familiar with all the place and fact in the area , the idea of traveling in a tour group definitely doe not appeal to me . my personal experience have not been very good with tour led by tour guide . first , the guided tour try to squeeze a much in a possible and a such the schedule are very gruelling and tough and one doe not get to enjoy the thing one want to do . it is not always easy to tailor a trip that suit everyone 's requirement . human being are different and have different preference , for example someone interested in art may want to visit london only for it museum whereas someone else may prefer to go to london primarily for it fabulous shopping . it would be very difficult to tailor a tour that keep both these interest at heart and the outcome maybe a combination which satisfies neither . secondly , there is always the factor of control and independence , an impulsive side trip or extended stay may not be an option on these tour . imagine being worn out from a trek up the hill to see a castle and not having the ability to turn back to go to the hotel because the tour bus ha a schedule to see five more place . finally , there is the question of lodging and dining choice . individual taste are very diverse and since it is very difficult to cater to the taste of different individual the tour guide may choose the least common denominator which again will leave many dissatisfied . to summarize i would not recommend guided tour a a way to travel on account of problem you may face due to the reason highlighted above .
