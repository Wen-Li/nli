accoding to my opinion young people do enjoy life more than old people do . the first reason that support my opinion is the age factor . young people are free from trouble or fear that come with old age . talking about the fear , i mean the fear of death and the fear of physical ailment that come with old age . although old people are free from the basic responsibility of life but still they cant enjoy their freedom from responsibilites the way they want or deserve because of thier old age and the problem that come with it . young people live with energy and a youthful and positive attitude towards life . even though they have responsibility and goal to achieve , but still they are always filled with energy and an attitude to achieve what they want from life . this is because they are free from all the barrier that come hand in hand with old age . these barrier discourage old people from enjoying life to the fullest . they are nomore in a mental and physical situation to accept challenge in life . they are not capable of setting goal in life and this inturn keep them away from the ecstacy and joy of achieving a goal that younger people have the ability to enjoy . another point of view would be the advancement in technology and the generation gap . the older genration is still suffocating in the claw of orthodox and conservative idea which also stop them from enjoying life to full extent . they are also unaware of the technological improvement that have taken place and are also not ready to identify with them . they still want to stand by their old orthodox tradition and dont open themselves to the fresh breeze of today world . they want to keep a closed mind and dont want to breathe in the fresh air of the modern world . all these factor act a big barrier in the way of their enjoyment .
