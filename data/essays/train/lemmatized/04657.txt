i completely agree with the statement which say that for student it is more important to understand idea and concept instead of learning fact . i think that the basis for a wide personal culture , which stay forever with a person , are to find in what the person himself understands , not in the quantity of thing he can learn ; obviously knowing fact , date , name of historically relevant people is very important , but not much a the greater quality to understand the idea which bring you to the fact . for example , if you have to study a difficult subject a macroeconomics , the most important thing is to understand what you are doing , not just studying all the model given by your text , because the concept are at the base , once you have made them yours you will be able to solve all the exercise without knowing all the model by heart . i would light to highlight that learning by heart is , in fact , something i do n't really agree with , because i think it is just a loss of time , spendable in a more useful way , also for the long time you need to learn and the short time you use to forget ! it 's true that learning fact is a compulsory part in everyone 's study , absolutely not to avoid if you want to be really prepared , anyway i would like to underline that it is not enough , nor really useful , if you have n't understood what is behind the argument you are studying . even if you know all the fact , you have learned all the date written in your book , if there is a lack of comprehension , in my opinion your study in an useless effort . when i wa young , my grandmother used to repeat me `` what you understand , none will never steal it to you '' : i really believe that a statement like this can support my opinion , because memory is something that can go away in a whisper , but once you got something , you have it .
