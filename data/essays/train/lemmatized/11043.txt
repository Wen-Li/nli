young people have future . i agree this statement . now i am a person who is thought young people . i enjoy my life now . may be i will have some problem in the future . these trouble will cause difficluty that i can enjoy the life . now a day many older people have these problem . on the other hand , young peole have a long future . most of them will live longer than older people , so they can plan many thing what they are going to do in the future . this is also mean that if they have a trouble , they have enough time to solve it . for example health problem and finance problem . at first , ususally young people are healther than older people . helth problem is seriou and it aboid happy life . in my experonence , my grandmather always suffer from her disease . because of this disease , it is hard for her to walk aroud her house . she can not go to shop to buy food . unfortunetly , recently sometimes she can not go to toillet on her own abilliy . she always say that she wish , she can go back her young day . many japanese old people say that how your health is when they met some old person . the second , older people can not work , so they have to consider about their finance . they have to manage the money . it is stress for them . however young people can work well , because they are fine . they do not have to care about it . also it is easy for them tothem to rend money . in conclusion , i do not have a serious problem that she older people have now , but i will have soon . what should do is not only enjoying this life but also prepare for the future . therefore , i suppose this statement is true .
