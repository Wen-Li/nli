i agree the following statement `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise in one specific subject '' .because for several reason one reason will be a the student will know many subject in different area . because he may helpful for these subject in future instead of learning in one subject . for the future he want to know every section , so for practising he will learn the a many subject a possible . the another reason for this will be a some student should have more talent and hard work to learn more subject in different area like language and know the different tradition and culture , for such type of student it will be a very useful the learn more subject . for learning one subject and known fully about such subject is useful in such subject in certain condition , but the several condition it will not useful for the people . so learn more is better than learn le , the people known about many skill will have a good compare to the others . the main reason for the learning more subject than the one specific subject will be a , the opportunity of the society in now condition will be high to the knowledge in several area . the people should know the subject clearly and understandble them , then only he ha a opportunity . learning different subject in a same time will also be a good skill and it will useful in future life for learning new object fastly . the reason should a man capable of understanding different area at a time then will be a good communicator in several way . the knowledgw of many academic subject will be the good aspect for every one , so a iam considering learning more subject is helpful compare to the learning one subject .
