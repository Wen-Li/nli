how to be successful ? is it rather by only repeating thing that you already know how to do well or rather by trying new thing ? on the one hand , i think that to succeed in anything , everyone ha to practise . for instance , a tennis player , before winning competition , ha to practise for hour and even day . when you repeat something , it becomes easier to complete and you will even be able to do it faster and more accurately . the first time you try something , you will most likely fail . then , with the habit of doing it , you will improve yourself . consequently , successful people may be successful because they have practised enough and now know how to do well . but on the other hand , with only repeating the same act , maybe you will stop thinking . you will begin to act mechanically , therefore you wo n't have the will to improve yourself . so i am strongly convinced that trying new thing is also very important : you have to learn not to be afraid of what you have never met before . for instance , i have studied mathematics and i wa told by my teacher to practise with long and complex problem , that i had never seen before , rather than with small and repetitive exercise , with a view to learning how to deal with new question . moreover , if at some moment of your life you do n't take risk , if you do n't put yourself in danger , if you always want to be secure , you may lose many opportunity : for instance , if you want to get a better job for which you are not quite prepared , you must be courageous and not be afraid to apply for it , to tru everything to get it . to conclude , the solution of this concern is far from easy . what would be the best behavior ? to my mind , both are relevant , but at different moment . you should n't hesitate to try new thing , even if you feel unprepared , but to succeed in new thing you must always keep in mind everything that you already know : what you know how to do well can prove very useful to do new thing .
