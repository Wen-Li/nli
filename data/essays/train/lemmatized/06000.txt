i completely agree with the statement . successful people try new thing and take risk because they want to invent new thing . for example indian president `` abdul kalam '' he is a great scientist , he invented nuclear weapon but still he doe not give up his research in his 80 's . success doe not totally based on economy . for example `` mother thersa '' who came from other country to india to serve the people . she took risk all over her life to serve the people . now she is called a `` mother '' by the whole world . i dont think that any one call her unsuccessful . successful people try to get success in almost all of the business . they are not satisfied by doing only one business . for example ambani who came from a poor farmer family , he did a small garment business . he wa successful in that business , but he wa not satisfied with that . he took risk in his life and did couple of business . now he became famous world wide a we well known him a `` reliance . '' if he would not take risk he would become famous in india not in world wide . therefore i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
