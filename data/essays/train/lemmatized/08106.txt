on the one hand , the following statement about advertisement show u that there is a real opposition . as far a i m concerned i would say that it seems to be true about this , because advertisement are present to inform people about something . but a we can remarque , is that finally people doesnt understand all the signification on them . but on the other hand , we can remaraue that peaple take lot of interest about them because they product better than they really are . for example , we can underline that child or teenager point theirs finger on them because advertisement creates a social movement . be at the top is very important for young people . everyone want to show to the other that he can bring or wear what he saw on the advertisement . that s why , sometime , avertisements can product much than they are . but , there is differents form of advertisement . so i think that , it create the difference . obviously , internet , tv program or paper in the street can influence people bying . that why , i can say that advertising take a big place and certainly most .
