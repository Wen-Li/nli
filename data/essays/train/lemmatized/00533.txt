i agree with the statement wich deal with the importance for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . since student chilhood , teacher teach in a way of developing student brain and so their own idea . the behavior of teacher is to push student to develop their own analysis about different subject more or le important . but the aim is to increase some capability to think by themselves and not discus about a subject only in telling the fact he or she learns before witout any construction in their comment or their way of thinking . if a student study scientific subject for instance , he or she need to have a certain knowledge that is to say , he or she need to learn theory and history of the subject . he or she can not have a right thinking before learning how to understand idea and concept . a student can not talk about fact without having a minimum of knowledge . he or she would be lost . this example is also available when a student ha to comment current event about news on televison . if news deal with politics and the role of the government or the whole political organization , the student ha to understand idea and concept of different party of the government for instance , in order to understand better and to be able to learn more easily the fact of the society and understand why the society react in this way . if student would be more encouraged to learn fact first of all , it could be a little bit `` dangerous '' for them because their own way of critic could be affected whatever the subject is . finally learning is in gerenal more based on knowledge that teacher can give to their student in order to improve and develop their critical analysis .
