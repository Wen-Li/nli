i do not agree to this point of view , that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are a lot of aspect , which speak against this . the best example is in my opinion a doctor . a doctor help people , when they have physical problem . i do not think that a doctor try new thing and take risk , because this can lead to very negative effect , if he doe this . so he always ha to do , what he ha learnt and nevertheless he is very successful , although he always doe he know how to do well , but he help other people . another example is the racing sport . the car pilot can not take risk , because also there this can lead to very negative effect and they would risk there own life , if they drive dangerously just to win a race and to be succesfull . there are a lot of other job , where you can not take any risk because this would have great effect on your own or other people ' life . but zou can also be successful , if you take risk or trz new thing , what the example show .
