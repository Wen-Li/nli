the issue at hand is `` young people enjoy life more than older people '' . i agree that young people are better enjoyer of life a they have their inner zeal and attitude towards life and also life ha many thing to offer to them . the first reason i think that older people dont enjoy life ethusiastically and fully a compared to younger one is that the older people have already done lot of enjoyment in their life and they know the meaning of enjoyment so their approach is not much enthisiastic towards enjoyment in life . on the other hand young people have to go through their time what their elder have gone through hence they are more energised and enjoys thing more another reason i think that young peple are better enjoyer of life is that they are physically and mentally much more fit . their attitude towards life is to enjoy thing and their physical and mental ability let them do these thing easily , for example not going far away if i ask my grand father to go for city disco he might refuse a he might not be mentally willing more over a every old person hasdiferent problem related to his body like pain in joint in this age even if his mind allows his body might not . so to enjoy the life one must have his physical fitness and soul energised only then one can enjoy thing in life . finally i agree with the statement because younger people are having much more exploring approach and attitude towards life hence in their eagerness to learn more they go through each and every situation curiosly which make them better revelling enjoyer . in conclusion , young people are better enjoyer of life a their approach towards life is new and fresh and also their curiosity and their physical and mental fitness allows them to enjoy the juice of life at it best a compared to old people
