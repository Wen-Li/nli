there are large number of people who are intelligent in this world . they have a lot of knowledge and they do know many fact about the most type of studying . can we really consider all of them a smart and the most successful people in the world ? maybe , but certainly not all of them . i say we can call a person intelligent if he/she understands the idea and the concept of the fact they have learned , not only solid fact that are memorized . in order to educate our student , more intelligent and successful , it is more important to make student understand idea and concept . it is not hard to find people with lot of information and fact in their brain . it 's also not rare to find them having difficulty of explaning thier idea of how those concept they know make sense or funtion . one of the reason why most of them are not capable of doing that is because that they just have memorized what the teacher or others have told them . they just remember what they are told . those kind of `` smart '' people know that 1 + 1 = 2 but they do not know why , because their teacher never explained them or they did not tend to know about those thing . this derive u to the fact that they are smart because they know the fact that some others might not know but not really because they do n't understand the idea and concept that are related to the fact they know . students are prepared for their future life in a bigger society in school and what our society want are the people who are smart , who know how to apply their knowledge in certain situation . people who only learned about the fact but not about their nature or concept do not really know how to use their knowledge in a real life . they have their knoledge in their head only . on the other hand , people who know the fact and also fully understand the idea and concept , know how to apply those knowledge in any situation they encounter . they do know how certain thing work so therefore they can change thing in order to their understood idea and concept , and make it work for most situation . a school is an institution where teacher teach student to be prepared for their future . it is not a factory where worker just put some information to their computer ' database . in order to fulfill the goal of the institution and also to make sure educate student in the way where they are able to use and apply their knowledge in their everyday life , the school should teach and the student should tend to learn idea and concept rather than just to learn fact because it is much more important .
