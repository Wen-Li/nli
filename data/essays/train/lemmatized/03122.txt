i am strongerly agree with the statement . i faced the same problem everyday during studying . students can be more rely on the idea and the concept of what we are learing . i will develop three important reason why this statement is true . first , it is more easier to learn idea and concept . when we try to learn the fact , it 's more harder to understand and it might confused them more and more . also it can bored out the student when we focus on the fact . it might be interesting , and it might help u more . but what is the point if we do n't understand . there is no point to learn about what we need to learn . second , i think that udeas and concept seems to stay longer than the fact . when we understand the idea and concept , it stay in our memory longer , because it interest people more than the fact . i have been taking anatomy class . it wa really hard for me to learn something that uncommonly used , but if i applied my concept or idea to the definition or the body part , it 's certainly helping me to understand what i am doing and also easy for me to memorize . third , it is important to understand what idea , because that help me to think more what i am learning and to make me think more and more . thus , learing fact doe n't hurt . but to understand idea and concept can help student more effective . also this lead them to be more interested what we are learning .
