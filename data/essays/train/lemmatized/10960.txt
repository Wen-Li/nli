in modren society , travelling bacomes a atracktive entertainment for people . people like travelling around for relaxing . some people hold the opinion that the best way to travel is travelling around by themselves . personaly , i prefer to travel in a group led by a guide . my reason are listed a fellowed . first of all , trevelling in a group can offer a oppertunity of making new friend . suppose when i am travelling in a group , i have the chance to meet a whole group of people . by communicating with others , i believe i can have a group of friend soon . take myself a an example , in the last trip to japan when i wa still studying in high school , i met several person who were also studying in my school and we never met each other . we became froends soon and keep in touch with each other even until now . if i went travelling by myself that time , i would miss several good friend . in addition , travelling in a group led by a tour guild help me save much more time than travelling alone . when i get to a new city , the first and the most improtant thing for me is to go to the most popular place in the city . if i am travelling alone , i am sure it is difficult for me to even just figure out where is the place located . furthmore , travelling with a group of people can recive many help in case i am in trouble . for emample , my trip to europe about four year ago . in that trip i insist going out alone , the result is i got lost . the problem is i did not speak english that time . few hour after i supposed be back , all of the people in my group went out to look for me and got me back at last . each coin ha tow side , travelling alone may also have some adventages such a : saving money , having the freedom to go everywhere i want . however , travelling in a group can not only make friend by giving or reciving help but also save time . compare to the advantage i mentioned above , i agree with the statement .
