i agree that young people now a day are not giving enough time to develop their community . they are not having a much time to help their community because now a day the yong people are more intrested in enjoying their life by simply going to movie and just by roaming . moreover , every one is seeing their own life style not bothering about the society . which is very harmfull to the nation . and life had became more mechenical . no body is showing intrest to help their community . while living in a same place avery body in that place must be communicate each other . only young people in that particular area have to move by their own to help the community which will show the right path to the next generation . we have give motivation to others for helping their communties for the better society . just by spending 5 % of the day we can acheive a lot , moreover it give self satisfaction of their own . from the age of schooling only parent must give right direction to their child to acheive the target . by this the spirit will also develop more in the child . the thing that we can do in little time to help the community will show the long lasting name . which will give more spirit and encouragement to do more needfull thing in future . so , the younger people are to be motivated in this way to help their community just by spending little amont of time that ha been wasted by roamin and chatting . if every body do the same we can acheive better society at a very short time thus , the younger people must have to spare some time to halp the community which will be shown right path to the next generation . .
