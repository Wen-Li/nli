i do not agree with this statement , although i would be glad if it were true . in my opinion it is too idealistic to assume that the number of car will decrease . it might be possible if a new technology were discovered and brought into use , or if several societes around the world learned to depend only on public transport . unfortunately , twenty year is not enough to come up with a completely new way of personal transport . there would have to be a phenomenal invention like a little individual airplane for everyone to replace the car . as i said , i do not regard this a possible . concerning the public transport , it would be necessary to reorganize whole city or even country in order to make the car a le practical mean of transport . one could argue that because of the concern for the environment that people have they would not buy new car anymore . especially because of the increasing pollution of the air . however , i think that the number of those who are really and honestly concerned about the future of our environment are too few . there are still those who do not care about pollution and who regard it a more important to be able to posse an individual car . a lot of people might have ideal of a cleaner and le polluted environment , but a soon a it come to their personal comfort they are not ready to give away the car . another reason why there will not be fewer car is , that the biggest part of the world 's population consists of people from poor country or country that are now growing and increasig their wealth . it is most probable that in these country the number of car will increase immensely . for example china . more and more people gain money through commerce , people that before lived in poor condition . these people will now be able to buy car , so that in the end , the number of those who buy car is by far bigger than of those who decide not to use them .
