this is a topic that sometimes turned over in my mind and i think that is not so easy give a corret answer also because probably doe n't exist a real corret answer . i think that for the student is important understand concept and idea but without learn fact they do n't have a complete knowledge . is sure that if the student know only the fact they are like `` parrot '' so they could only repeat in a mechanic way the information , but if they undertand the main idea and concept they could do an elaboration and express also their opinion about the matter . so i think that understand the main idea is of paramount importance and learn fact is important but not enough . in other word i think that undertand the gist is really important also if you do n't know very well the particular fact but is not possibly the reverse , the fact without the main idea are unusefull . i must confess that i did n't used to study a lot in the school , so i wa n't sometimes able to remember very well date and particular fact but with a good knowledge of the concept i could be safe . the problem is also that many theachers think that the fact are so important and want that the student only repeat like a machine the information . i think also that for them is easier theach fact that try to explain the main idea but fortunatelly not all the theacher are the same . i always really appreciated the thaechers that do n't try to give only information but want that the student undertand the concept and reformulate the idea with their own opinion . finally i can say that is incorret say that is most important understand that learn but is sure that without the first one we have an `` robot knowledge '' .
