the statement in the question is deniable . i am not agreeing to the point that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise in one subject '' . i have very good reason to contradict this point . i would like to highlight few reason and example in support of my view and these are presented a below . in my opinion it is better to learn one interesting subject in depth . one can not afford to learn a many a diversed subjets with in course time because one should posse variety of talent to complete all the course with in the le time and so usually it may not possible to an ordinary student . all most all of the university throughout the world offering specialisation like journalism , enginieering , medicine thing like that suppose if we take medicine field it includes specialisation like dermatology , psychiatry , cardialogy , neurology , pulminology etc ... , if we take engineering field it includes specialisation includes electronics , mechanical , chemical , computer science and civil . many university are choosing this path because it is almost impossible to learn every thing by one individual . if one doe specialisation in a perticular area then he may have better chance of accustomed to a subject one can hope for . it is very fruitful in practical to obtain a good job . then he may have chance to survive easily throughout his life . that is his practical performance on that subject make him popular and brings him good salary . in that way one can satisfy his financial requirement . if one is having a broad knowledge of many subject then he or she may perflexed in choosing a career . and one can not survive much longer in that field since he is only having broad knowledge on what he is doing . in conclsion i believe strongly that one can not afford to learn knowledge of many academic skill until he is very intilligent . one may confuse to choose a career in which he or she suit . he may be unable to servive in the choosen field because of lack of depth in that field . so it is better for a university to educate a person in any specialised subject so that one can posse enough knowlege to deal with real time problem .
