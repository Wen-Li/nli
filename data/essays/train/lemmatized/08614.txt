regarding the statement i consider myself absoluley in favour , since under my perspective , advertisement are intended only to persuade the reader or listener to buy the product . they dont really care if you like or not the advertisement , they just focus on the economic effect of it . as a result they are willing to give a wrong idea of a product in order to ensure their economic profit of it . as a matter of example , we daily see comercials of food , where for instance food is prepared in a certain manner that it simply look irresitible to your eye . they tend tu use severall implement that provide a changed version of what the food really wa . recalling the example of a burguer we can appeciate the way in which they will show the burguer a a tentative meal . some aspect such a it texutre and physical appearance might be modified in order to ensure that you create a mental image of the burguer and your future meal might be it . also they can create or manipulate people comment regarding the burger so that for instnace you get to know what other felt when eating such meal . another type of prduct that tends to be used for advertisement are the excersice machine , that are shown to be easier to work on , and proved to have inmediate result . the main objective of this is to sell a determined apparatus that will provide what they think your body requires , for instance the ab pro is a machine to work on where you by just slightly moving train your muscle and reinforce their shape . the advertisement us well prepared and fine physically people to use the machine in order to give you the idea that after using it , you will end a that person . the truth is that advertisement actually provide u of information concerning severall product . however due to the fact that their objective is to promote a product they are prepared to modify the product in some aspect in order to ensure the selling of it . just like the example given of the buguer and the machine where you actually see a changed product in order to persuade you on buying that particular object . obviously the modification they do on the product is intended to make it look better , so that you are willing to buy it .
