in china , there is an old saying that say , ` if one have one hundred subject , all of them are poor and nity-nine of them is in the air . ' this saying well describe the relation between the quantity and the quality of the subject . i 'm for the statement that it 's better to have a speciallize in one subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic . first of all , nowsdays , the sociaty need expert that mean deviding work into many part and ask the expert on this aera to solve the problem he 's good at . there is one good example around me . in a computer company , there are many part of the aeras . some do with the computer , some do with the machine such a coffee offer , the air conditioner , or the car . once i went to see my friend working in this company , the coffee offer wa broken down by accident . i asked my friend , ` why do n't you repair it , it is so important in the daily life . ' however , my friend said , ` the cechanic is coming , i think the job suit him better and i am for the computer . he 's absolutely right . he 's job is working with the computer , he do n't need to repair the coffee offer because he is n't professional about this . in this way , a person do n't need to know every thing . deviding job can make working professional and in this way , the effection will increase and the quality will also get higher , therefore , people can safe a lot of time and finish work well . in another view , it is because we are not good at everything that our life is colourful a we meet many new people when we are working in a new field . one of life 's goodness is that we can communicate and coopertion . to sum up , it 's better to speciallize in one specific subject than to devide a limit period of time into so many subject .
