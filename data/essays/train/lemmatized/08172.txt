i think that the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are is right . in fact advertising is made for the purpose of push people to buy a product even when it is not needed . to do so the good ha to seem much more better than what it really is . the funny thing is that the mismatching between what is advertised and the real product is openly declared everywhere a it could be read in small font that the object can be different than how is picted on the advertising or the box . an example is when drug are advertised on television . they show someone that feel sick and a soon a the little pill is swallowed he or she get back to work a nothing ha appened . i guess this could be dangerous too . another example is when in a fast food restaurant there are picture that show wonderful hamburger that do not look like the hamburger i get to eat . i also remember when i wa a little boy and i saw an advertising about an ice-cream on tv . the ice-cream looked so good that i felt that i had to have one . as soon a i could i went to buy that ice cream , but when i unwrapped it and i saw how the ice cream wa in the real life i felt like a fool and got very disappointed . as a conclusion i think that when we look at advertised product we should do it with criticism and be aware of the difference between picture and real life .
