ideas and facts are two side of the same coin . while idea bring about new experimentation , new technology , new behaviourr , new way to do thing ; thier success brings about fact . i personally beleive it is important for student to understand idea and concept a well a learn fact . facts usually give the basis of an idea . they know that this is what the charatersitcs are ; they can formulate an idea with the existing fact . focusing on only one facotr , i.e an idea or fact would mean invitng more error or having thing done the monotnous way . for example : new techonology have been invented in the recent past becuase of new idea being generated ; however , the existing fact about the present technology ha helped them develop news one . knowledge of fact help student realise the limitation and the strength of a certain subject . concepts on the other hand are the basis of understanding any subject . if a student ha not understood his concept well , he would be unable to understand the fatcs and not bult up on idea . concept is the backbone of both ideras and fact . for example if a student ubderstands newtons law of gravity , he would understand that every thing around is attracted by earth . once he understand the concept , he can understand the fact about gravity and then built on new dieas to built a parchute or an aircraft . ideas , concept6s and facts belong to a viscious circle where one thing is realted to the other and can not survive without the other . now , if student are exposed only to concept and told to built on idea then they might be building the same thing which is already exisiting , or they might repeat the same mistake made by thier forefather . similarly , if student are only basing thier knowledge on fact they might not be in a position to invent new thing and stick to the same old way of life . hence looking at all these matter , i conclude that idea , fact and concept are equally imporant to student .
