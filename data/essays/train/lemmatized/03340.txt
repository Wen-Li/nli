i believe we live in a whole world . i mean even if physically and intellectually people are different , we live together and we have to feel good about that . to feel comfortable we have to understand each other , that is why i think a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . first i plan to work in the hotel industry and why not a day running my own hotel . in order to achieve this goal i need to be polyvalent and know about many different area . i have followed business study which lead me to learn thing about many different topic such a management , finance , strategy , language . .. i found very interesting to learn about different material coming from different part of the world . then i believe that acquiring knowledge of several academic enables people to be more open minded and autonomous when they face problem perhaps not in their work but in their daily life . i think the main goal of standard education all over the world is to teach people a base of vital knowledge which involves different topic : reading , counting , speaking , writing . to finish i am sure that many people need to specialize in order to achieve their goal , but this is not my view of life . i agree that some professional need to be highly specialized in their domain like surgeon , trader . .. but it doe not prevent those specialist to have interest in other topic . that is why i believe that a broad knowledge of subject is more valuable than to be specialized .
