first of all , i disagree with the say of having broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject becuase of the important of been a specialize in one subject mean that you have more information anf knowledg in this area more than the others . to be specialze in any subject help the people the be expartise on there work and they can intreduce more help and knowledge on this one subject . as an example , if i am working in onlu houbara conservation which is very rare field that mean that i will know more that other people in the mithids and the tool to save this indanger bird . if you are specialze in one subject you will have time ti fine and to do more resrach on this subject and also to find solution if any problem hapen and attached to this subject . other example to be a doctore , if you sick you will go to a specialze doctore but you will not go to any doctore . specialize mean that when and how you use what . fainally , to be specialize is meaning that you but the tight thing with the right pearson or specialist .
