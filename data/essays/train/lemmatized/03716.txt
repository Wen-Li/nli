there is no doubt that nowadays the competition among people develops dramatically . as a result , the thought is put forward that a person should acquire a broad range of skill and knowledge . however , from the perpective of mine , i obtain that it is better to be concentrated on one certain area . on the one hand , it is beneficial for the academic study to specilize in a subject . the man working at a specific area is more likely to make a rather deep understanding of the subject . for instance , an overwhelming majority of mathematician devote a long period to computing a well a thinking about the solution of one problem day and night . resulting from the lengthy time which they dedicate , they are capable of detecting the answer . on the other hand , specializing in one area doe not lead to a waste of resource . supposing a man spends half time learning the chemistry with the other half time on biology , it is not likely for him to center on one of the subject which he study . as a consequence , it conduct professor of both cources to waste time of teaching . futhermore , the man is possible to occupy the place of lab which may lead others not be able to make a experiment . depite the fact above , concentrating on a specific subject perhaps give rise to some problem . imagine every peole purely have a study concerning one academic area , it pose the treat to scholar from varying subject that they are n't capable of communicating with each other , due to the specialization . from the statement discussed above , i still hold a point that it benefit u more to specialize in a certain subject .
