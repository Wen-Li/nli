i believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . our current academic system creates expert , encouraging specialization of student , orienting them into specialized domain : electronic engineer , modern litterature , greek art , south american civilization . .. of course , the society need expert and people able to answer specific question , highly skilled people in order to make the science , the philosophy , the technique , the whole society evolve and progress . however , i believe that in order to have a comprehensive and accurate vision of the society , the world , the past , the future and the present , one need to have a broad knowledge of various academic topic . we should draw lesson from our ancestor who were philosopher , mathematician , physician , writer , politician . .. they were truly able to relate one field of activity to another and to use the knowledge of one field to progress in another one . nowadays , researcher and scientist work on genetic manipulation . intellectuals , philosophs , writer , discus the scientific breakthrough from an ethical point of vue . would this specific situation of a clear separation between the scientifical and the ethical could exist if our expert had a broader expertise ? i really think it is dangerous to specialize in only one field of activity because thus you miss a significant contribution from other field . besides , i think that it is important for the construction of one 's personality and to live in harmony with other people to be able to understand other people 's interest , to be able to question thing , to be able to think ` outside the box ' ... with over-specialized people , are we heading towards a communitarian society in which scientist live and think with scientist , artist live and think with artist ?
