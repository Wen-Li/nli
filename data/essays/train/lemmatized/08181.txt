the main meaning that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact is generally stated by the student themselves but almost rarely by university or institution . in my student time i made the experience that in exam often detailed knowledge is affordable and not only the understanding of the main concept and idea . if one might think about this topic both manner of learning have got it advantage . for the more general learning a i will call the understanding of the main idea , the student get an good overview of the topic a a whole . thus he or she ha an understanding of the sense of an assignment and perhaps the possible practical application . the student doe n't could give further detail , which often also doe not count in the pracise of the working world . for example for driving with a bus in another country you do n't have to learn specific difficult vocabulary . l the detailed learning with special fact and additional information to a topic ha an advantage for the student if he or she want to specialize that topic . perhaps in case of personale intererest or also because it is needed a an requirement to be taken for application . for instance a additional qualification in the historical development of polymerase chain reaction , pcr , a special method in molecular biology . or also for a job in future you in conclusion it depends on the personal situation and academic circumstance which kind of knowledge is affordable . for me it more important to learn fact for a subject i am interested in and what is essential for my working experience later on . but in total i also try to be concerned about getting additional more general information of other general topic , so that you ca n't loose the view for the essential and practical thing which are equallz important a well .
