the controvery , if successful people who try new thing and take risk rather than people who only do what the know is an interesting one . i agree with the idea that innovation and taking risk will rather lead to succsess than on remaining your knowledge you already have . think of the world of computing : + a company which invest a lot of efford in research ( computer ) and new idea will probably introduce innovative product . the customer are attracted to new feature , the new product will pushed away the old one . + moreover , a company is be able to gain a higher price for it new product , because it ha more function or is better to use , you can ask for a higher price . that will lead to bigger economical succsess . + when you have new idea , you are always one step ahead , you are better prepared for future event . someone who is doing only the thing he already performs , he can react only . think of car-makers such a chrysler cooperation in the us-market . they sell big suv 's , which need a lot of fuel . toyota introduced a new generation of hybrid-vehicles . their car are quite succsessful in the market , environment-frindy car became popular . daimlerchryler instead had to close whole plant because no one want to buy their gas-guzzling car . and this is just the beginning . the change of climate on earth is just to begin to change . people are going to change their mind sometimes , and you are better of if you have new and better idea for the future . this lead to the idea that if a person ( or a company ) , who is not dealing with future event , try new idea and take risk , will never be succsessful in the future . as a summary i would say that new idea are an investment in future growth .
