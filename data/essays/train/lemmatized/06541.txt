i do n't agree with that statement . in my opinion , enjoying life doe n't relate to the age directly . of course , usually a young person can make an advantage of his youthful and healthy body . he can do more extreme sport activity , like snowboarding , surfing or bumgee-jumping . but more often young people are not that independent a they wish to be . most young people need financial support from their parent , especially during the studying time at unversity . that mean one ha to explain the expediture exactly to the parent every time one need money . that can be very exhausting and demotivating . after university , financial worry decrease on the one hand , but on the other hand concern on the job arise . as a rule , the first year on the job are the most stressful one which are accompanied by immense pressure to establish oneself in the new company . thus , i think that the thirty-somehows can enjoy life better than the younger people . those people usually have already gained acknowledgement in the job world and in society . moreover , they are financially independent and do n't have to fight for the career that intensly . as a result , that group of people can spend more time for their hobby and their family . older people are also enjoying life , because they have more experience . i think they know how to appreciate the real thing and value in life and are more confindent .
