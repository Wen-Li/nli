professional or general ? in our current society of learning and studying there are a lot of theory how to achieve the best result , how to get the best mark and how to get a well paid job . on the one hand some people think that specialising on a certain topic or subject and having an entire knowledge of it will be the solution to achieve the most . on the other hand there are people who think , that it is necessary to have a certain knowledge in many different subject . both of these way to prepare for life have their advantage and disadvantage . if you are specialised on one subject and you really know much , nearly everything , about it it is going to be easy for you to get a job in this area , because you are very well qualified . but therefore it is important that there are enough job to be offered in your area you are specialised on , because it is not appealing being a professional in your subject without having a chance for a job . but when you know much about many different subject , but not a much a you would if you were specialised on each , it is also not easy for you to find a job , because maybe you are not qualified enough in the area that is required from the company . so you are not specified sufficiantly , albeit you know very much . in contrast there are also many company that ask for such a general knowledge in many area , so your chance for getting a job also depends on the kind of job which are offered . so there is the contrast between superficial knowledge in many subject or entire knowledge of one specific subject . i am the opinion of that both thing do not benefit getting a job . i think it is necessary to have broad knowledge in maybe two or three subject which match together very well ( e.g. mathematics , physic and biology ) . but furthermore it is also important to have a certain based knowledge in some more subject , but not a specialised a in the others . as result you will end up with different level of knowledge in nearly every subject . with such a qualification i think it is going to be easier to emphasize your general knowledge and to get a job .
