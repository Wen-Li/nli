i believe that every one have an experience of watching or listening to a advertisement . do you ever think those advertisement really play and important role for their product ? or are those product seem much better than they really are ? in my point of view , advertisement really work well for those who make the business , it motivates cunsumer to purchase on their item , but if we take a close look at some commercial on the tv , their always presenting you the positive side of their product , instead of the thing that have left behind , for example , we often see some shampoo commercial on tv , using those lady with long hair showing you that if you use this brand of shampoo you will have the same shining hair a the lady have on the commercial . this obviously is not true , on the tv they are putting on some chemical that make their hair look smoothly and shining , but not the really affect that cused by the real product that they persuade the consumer to buy . that 's why i highly do n't agree with the commercial . another example , if we go on shopping at some supremarkets , you will see all kind of delicious image on the pace , like forzen pizza , this image show you that it got variety of ingredient on it and the size of the pizza . we might think this is what the pizza going to be look like after i take back home and cook it , but infortuantly it 's not what you thought , those image are only look good on the pack for cosumers to buy it , in order to get the profit form the consumer . so would you still believe in those advertisement ? these advertisement might have a good looking on the outside , but what really in the inside we 'll never able to know . so think carefully before you purchase , do n't let those unreal image affect you and take away you money .
