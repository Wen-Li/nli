the issue of to be successful , whether people should try new thing and take risk or do what they already know , is a controversial one . on the one hand , by doing what one know well , the result of the action are predictable and the method are probably already proven . on the other hand , risk taking and tyring new thing open new and unexplored avenue to success which one could never have imagined . on final analysis , i belive trying new thing and taking risk is more rewarding and brings about more success than doing what one already know . successful people have always looked to the new way to success , which were not necessarily the area that they were expert in . these people venture into doing new thing , learning a great deal in the process , and then end up creating a new path to success . microsoft corporation is one such example of one such creation . created by a group of people , who belived in something new , in a time when the term ` software ' wa known only to a handful . today , that belief held by that group of people ha given u a software that ha changed the way our life function . inventions and breakthrough did not happen because of people who did what they did well . it happened because of people who moved out of their comfort zone , confroned norm , broke shakles , to prove a point . and have these people been successful ? most certainly so . right from albert einstein to micheal dell of dell computers . the argument in favor of doing what one doe well is that one can predict the result , be assured of a short term success and then claim to be successful . but to achieve the next level of success , one need to go further and foray into territory which are le trodden than others .
