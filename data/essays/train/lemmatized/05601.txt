the topic `` whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or have specialised knowledge '' is subjective . in my opinion having specialised knowledge is more important than having little knowledge of every field . i support my opinion by an adage `` jack off all and master of none '' a per the adage a person who know bit and piece of all the subject but doe not have complete knowledge of one field end up knowhere . a specialisation is must because if person tends to select a career path the he must be focused on following it , he must be able concentrate on his or her desired field without bieng distracted by other influence , for example many people tend to switch career because the pay is good or work is le taxing , they tend to obtaind knowledge of other area which may be beneficial , but a trend change the motivation also change . i.e if the particular field get to crowded then people tend again to switch their area of expertise . in doing so people may intially get better pay for their skill in different department , but when it come to progress they may find themselves at lower postion then if they had specialised in a particular area and waited for better opportunity secondly having broad range of knowledge in itself is not detrimental if a person is able to keep with development and progress that are being made , in this fast changing world thing get outmoded quickly for eg in the it world people tend learn a lot new computer language but a technology develop some of them get outdated so a person must be able to keep up with progress . having said this , it is not humanly possible for each human being to keep himself updated with myriad of change taking place in limited time he ha each day thirdly it is not only the knowledge in the different academic field that matter it is the application of the knowledge practically that matter if a person is not able to apply himself or use a skill practically than the skill is worthless for eg if a person ha knowledge in the following area computer , medicine , law : all disparate field with little or no relation to each other and he can not repair a computer when the situation demand or save a person when he is ill then the knowledge in different area is of no use unless he able to do complete justice to all the field having said this having basic knowledge in some field which is required for day to day functioning is good for eg basic computer knowledge is required in almost all office in addition to basic knowledge it is necessary that person must specialise in particular area so that he can continue to prove his worth to employer and continue to progress in his carees in conclusion it is better to specialise in particular academic subject than to try to gain knowledge of all area and a result end without proper direction to one career specialisation bring a sense of accomplishment which diversifying can not
