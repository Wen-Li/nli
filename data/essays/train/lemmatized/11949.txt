the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide i am agree with the statement because when you travel with a tour guide you have the chance to go to the most interesting place of the country you are visiting . you can also meet the bether cultural , historical , and representative place , that you would n't know if you dont go with a tour guide . for example , when you go to buenos aires , argentina , is better that you do it with a tourist agent , because they would take you to the most historical and representative place of the city and you will know their history and learn special information about them . when you go there you cant miss the neihgborhood la boca , the place in wich is located the stadium of the best club team in latin america , `` club atletico boca juniors '' . it 's a very beatiful place to walk but you have to go with a tour guide because in other way you would'nt appreciate all the history that is behind it . if you travel alone , you will miss the chance to learn something new , and to live experience like meeting new people from all above the world . it is difficult that when you go into a trip by yourself , you wil meet all the pople that you can meet in a guided tour for the city . in that way you could not just learn about the country you visit , but also about other country in the world that you could go on a later trip to visit . the advantage of going on a trip with a tour guide are huge . you can not miss the chance of doing it , because on that way you will live the best vacational experience of your life . you can learn about other country customes and live for some day like a person of that country .
