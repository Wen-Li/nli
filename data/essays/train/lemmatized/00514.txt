i agree with this statement that said `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they alreary know how to do well . '' the reason because i agree with this statement is this . if successful people only do whatever they know very well , we will have around the world the same thing . for example , car , if the people who are encharge to biuld new model of car , and they do not try to do something new , how boring , we do not have a lot of option , but because they take risk we have a numerous option when we are looking for a car , you , me , everybody can buy all kind such a : a bmw , a jaguard , a camry , a jeep , etc . as well people who want to start a new restaurant , the want to oppend something new . if in the area where they are going to biuld this new restaurant are some chiness , greek , or text mexican food , but they do not have a real mexican food , i think that the best thing they can do is started a restauran that it is not in this area . another example is fashion , woman love fashion , they do not use the same clouth , they changed almost the 365 day during the year . the new disainers are fightting each other in order to have the best disign , they are risking , but if he or she disign is the best , they will get a good income . if you do not risk , i almost sure , you wo n't win . take a risk and you will be successful in life . in life we need to risk most of the time . you make risk when you want to change to another job because you can get better salary , but who know that you will be there for a long time , or when you move to another city , it is risky but do not be afraid , you will be fine , the only thing you need is trust in yourself .
