everyone in the world wish to have a car . so will the car be le after twenty year from now ? . well in my opinion i do n't think that the number of car will be le . because people need car to travel , to work , visit there family or friend , use it a a home if it wa a van and it is cheap compear to the other transport . so i dissagree for several reason : firstly no one in the world ha the ability to o to there work using there leg every morning in there life . because if that happens everyone will be tired at work and suffuring of leg pain . and that mean people will preser to stay at home . another reason is that a a buisness person for sure car will be there best way to let the way of the buisness go well . for example when i wa in the city of my country . the main thing to travel is to use a car rather than walking . and if the roud is closed just for one hour that mean that the buisness will stop or atleast the market will be low . second come that car nowdays are at everywhere in the world . so how it will be fewer than it is now ? . i do n't think that it will be easy to distroy the car and find a place to burry them under the earth . however , most of the people need car ( van ) to use them a their home . that will be a travel home . they can take their home when ever they need to do that . at the end a an ower of a car i hardly beleive that car will not be fewer in future unless there is a another wirld to throw all the car in is .
