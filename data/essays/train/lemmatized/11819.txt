most people like doing what they are used to , what they have learned from their family and society over the passed year . this is a good way of living to avoid making any mistake , and to keep thing the traditional way . but the trueth is , only a few people are the one that take risk in life and make a difference . people openminded , who enjoy exploring and trying new thing are the one who take risk , encourage themselves to try uncommon thing and see thing in another perspective . this kind of people most of the time find success ; however , some find may it after their death . an example of this would be the famous artist vincent van vough . he wa a pioneer in a new painting technique ; he wa a great paintor whose work did not have much importance when he wa alive . but it wa after his death that his work rechead the value it had hidden , and it became famous . an example of a successful person who had reccodmission while alive wa the pope john paul ii . he wa a brilliant man , that accomplished to do many activity that were not tipically done by a pope . he wa the first one that have ever gone to almost every country in the world and he spoke several language that helped him through all his trip . his charisma wa unique , and because of this characteristic he could stablish a sense of brotherhood between catholics and other religion member . successful people are also good role model , not only for young people but to adult too . they show another way of living , probably a more difficult one , but it result are not represeable . i believe that not all human are destinated to have success , but everybody can try new thing . it just need determination and hard work .
