young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i am disagree with the statement . generalization of young people absence in helping community can not be made . community is a group of people who live together and share some commen base and solve problem of each other . it can be a small residential community where the people live , or can be a hostel dormatory in which student life , or can be a hospital or a university . with time , society grows , and communites within the socities also change . this change may be due to modernization . young people are part of communites , and if one say , due to modernization , young people are not much involved in community , this is a wrong interpretation of the situtation . present condition in society , ha exposed young people to new challanges . they are getting bigger plateforms to develope their qualtites which are eventually helping the community in more effective and innovative way . for example , there is a peasent boy , whose duty is to go with his father to the farm and grow crop . this definitly serf the community . but because of modern interaction and globalization , that illitrate peasent boy is exposed to new technology of agriculture , he will learn and improve his quality . the learning might take time and may cease the direct involvement in the community in short , but in long run , being a educated talented farmer , he can give the time to the community by producting more effectively . today we can see young people in various position in the community itself . they are leading manufacture , they are docters , they are engineer , and even in the univerisites , there is large enhancement in the young people taking teacihng a a social proffesion . all these fact show the enthusiam of young people is helping each community in both direct and indirect manner . hence involvement of young people in community ha improved a lot in a effective manner .
