`` if one know all , he know none . '' all around the world there are people trying to do all the thing they want to do , and causing other people of that expertise to be unemployed . if a person is a professional in his or her expertise then this person should try to be useful for global research about that expertise . in other word , a person should not be trying other thing than he is a professional on , but be the best in his own expertise . in my country , turkey , there are many people who are trying to be the best in everything . for example , there are a lot of model who are trying to be singer or actor . this cause the true singer to fade in the business in time . not only model , but many celebrity are doing the same too . we have an author who also , tried to be the governer of istanbul . not that he would not be a great governer , but he is an artist , he should do his art . if a person is succesful in his or her business or area of expertise , he or she should try to help the worldwide research about his or her topic . the sharing of idea would bring better solution to the problem of the world . i believe that china is in a great position to support my thesis . in china , people are doing the thing they have to do and they all think that their job is a `` great job '' for them . this may be a hasty generalization , but china 's improvement throughout 21st century prof this statement . if everyone doe his or her own job , then every job get to be the `` great job '' . while concluding my word i would like to state my future plan about this statement . i will try to be a professional in my area of expertise and try to share my knowledge with the world by all mean . this should be the plan for all to achieve great development .
