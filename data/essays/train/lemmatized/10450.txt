broader knowedge for a broader world ? in my opinion , there is no denying adult need to be aware of various issue , especially in a globalized system , because individual way-of-leaving influence global phenomenon . schools have a great role to play in order to give people this knowledge , then people have to keep it in their mind their whole life along . first , let 's briefly summarize what is a broad knowledge of many academic subject . it is an education which give key to understand the world in which he life to the student . history , mathematics , language , economics , philosophy , let 's call them all the scientific way explored by scholar for year to understand matter of common concern . terefore , teacher are greatly responsible for child to become open-minded adult , or on the contrary narrow-minded people . indeed , teacher help child to learn the world is not limited to what they see . they can guide them throughout flow of picture medias publish every day . because people need to learn early to deal with huge amount of information they daily get . and school is the only area were every child can receive the mean to be able to defend himself against wrong or biased information . these mean broadly consist in strong knowledge of various topic . then , adult will be able to stand critically about information they receive . as a matter of fact , if they have learnt china is a communist regime , they will not trust every information published by chinese medias . the same thing about advertising ; thanks to a comprehensive education , with hisotry and economics , but also mathematics , he will be able to better chose the product he need . he 'll fail le easily to notice lie . for all these reason , i think it is more important to have broad culture . nonetheless , it doe not mean specialised scholar ar not needed , on the contrary they play an essential role in progress .
