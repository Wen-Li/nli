through an academic training , you usually get broad knowledge of various topic . but you can also decide to specialize on a subject that you may be keen on studying . to my mind , i think it 's better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to have a specialization . you can have an overview of many topic and have a generalist training . also , you do n't get bored by such a diversity of subject . firstly , having broad knowledge give the opportunity to learn thing about an unkown subject . for example , i studied for one year in grenoble ecole de management . this first year wa very generalist and i could learn the basic principle of many subject . i studied accounting , finance , marketing . i reckon that a futur manager must have a knowledge on each of these subject and master them . it ' a condition if he want to succeed . thus , i believe having broad knowledge is an opportunity to learn more thing . above all this diversified knowledge will be useful in the future life . secondly , i think that if you study only one specific subject , you can get bored and became fed up with it . indeed , having a specialization mean studying the same subject for long hour in the same day or week . even if it can be a subject you find really attractive and interesting , the fact to focus on it can have negative effect . the interest can decrease so a the attention paid to the subject . after long hour spended on the same issue , you enjoy tackling another subject and consequently another interest arises . thus , in my opinion i think having broad knowledge of many academic subject is more beneficial . it allows to have a generalist training and to get the basic principle on subject , useful for daily life . moreover , with such a diversity you are more involved in each subject and do n't get bored with the training .
