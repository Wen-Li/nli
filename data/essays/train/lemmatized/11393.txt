our education system is always being criticized because of it non-analytic education . for example student learn something without even asking question about the fact and the idea of it . they just learn . however , it 's important for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact . at first , i will try to summarize the advantage and the essential part of understanding idea . ideas and concept are the first step of creation . giving the idea of an event or a problem force the student to think aboout it . as a result , the student not only asks question about the event , but also take it further by trying to make an explanation to the cause of the event . this is what is called analytic reflection . for instance , we can talk about the exam in turkey before graduating from college . we study for 2 year or more without understanding the main idea . consequently our future depends on one single test . on the other hand , learning fact is also important but not a important than understanding the essential . if a student is only learning fact , he ca n't get any further than providing simple relation between event or comparing them . he just ca n't figure out why . but a student wh understood the concept can ask question , `` why ? , who ? , what ? , where ? '' . he can eventually answer them too . we can see this a an escalade . the idea help u to get to the top , while the fact help u to see two step beyond . in conclusion , both system are important . they help making progress to the student ' view of aspect . however for me , understanding the idea and concept are more important . they provide an analytic reflection .
