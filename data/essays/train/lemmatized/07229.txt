in university i am often confronted with this kind of question from my friend or other student . of cource both , a broad knowledge of several academic subjekts and a special knowledge on one subject are important . in my opinion one ha to find the right balance between these to option . on the one hand , it is more important to have a broad knowledge of many different subtjects in early stage of studying . i try to illustrate this on an example . i am studying geography . this main field consists of many different fileds such a geomorpholgie or climateologie . when you start studying geographie you even do not know about the existence of these field . this is the reason why you first have to get known all the different part and field of geography . you first have to find your field of interest on the other hand it is really important to specialize on one specific subject when you achieved a certain amount of broad knowledge in the second part of your studying . after you finished university you have to find a job . therefore it is essential that you are specialized in on certain field . companies do not nead people who just have got a broad education . to come back to my example of geography , the special subject of geography `` geogaphic information system '' is a really uprising field . persons who specialice in this field will have it easy to find a job when they leave university . in conclusion i think the right answer to this question depends on the point of time . first of all you have to reach a certain amount of broad knowledge such a given in the bachelors degree . later on , it is important to specialize in your field of interest such a given in a maters programm .
