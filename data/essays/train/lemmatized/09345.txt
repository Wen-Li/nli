even if i agree with one aspect of the subject , i disagree with an other . let me explain . when you learn many different thing in many different subject , it make you having very interesting discussion and debate when you meet people for example . when the people you meet get interested in what you say , or when they see that you are understanding what they say on specific issue , they will appreciate you and what you are saying . when you are specialised on one specific subject , people will think that you are very smart and that you know a lot of thing , but they wo n't always be interested in what you say . for example a specialised botanist who will talk during hour about flower to someone who is n't interested in it , will seem to be a boring person . someone who know many thing will have more different friend . there are also job where you need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . for example , journalist are expected to know many different thing on different topic , they would n't have time to get all this knowledge if they had to get specialised . i can not imagine a journalist who would n't know some thing about politics , sport , history etc . on an other hand being specialised , mean knowing almost everything about an issue . when you work or learn at school with people who share the same interest , they will appreciate all the thing you know . when someone ha a passion in one field , why would he need so much knowledge in other subject . finally , at school it is better to have a broad knowledge of many subject because if you 're good at one and not in an other subject , you will fail your general exam and do the same class one more year , whereas when you are specialised in one subject it is good but it is not enough . so even if i understand both opinion , i do more agree with the first one which say that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject .
