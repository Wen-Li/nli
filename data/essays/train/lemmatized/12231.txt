is advertisement misleading ? that i think the way we can rephrase this statement . the question implies that actually yes it might be the case . but let 's review what is advertisement and discus whether the process is aimed at `` embellishing '' the truth ? what is the role of advertisement ? it is , i believe to make aware the largest population of consumer possible of the existence of a new product . so advertisement technically ha a value of information . at the same time it ha the mission to promote to graeter number of people the product . the ultimate aim of the advertisement is to convince the majorite of consumer to buy the product . but i believe there is clear distinction between informing a poulation of the existence of a new product and promoting a product . informing is communicating fact in it minimal and truthful way . for example , a new drug come to the market and a health advocate you want to inform the community and health professional . what are you going to tell thes professionnals ? you will give all the element about the drug ( chemical entity , mechanism of action ) that help people to understand what it is , who it is for , and what are the risk associated with it use . now when you see the avertisement for a drug , a drug for arthritis ( painfull debilitating disease ) for example what do you see ? the add tell you what it is and who can benefit from it . but it is also showing you some great , slim , lady happily jumping , running , . in addition , in many case , it 's also telling you that it 's much better than so and so . so what doe it mean . is this drug much better your cure ? does the advertisemnt refklects tell you what to expect from tyhat drug ? my answer to that is not so simple . the advetisemnt is not lying but it doe n't give you the real fact , the truth . it doe n't telll you , for example , thatthis drug is good f for only one category of the population , that drug may have some unplaesant side effect . so my advice : be circumspect when it come to advertised drug .
