help of the young people to their community have always been important for all community . it is also a fact that the need for their help is increasing a the size of the community are also increasing . in spite of this increasing demand , young people of our day do not give much time to helping their community . but we should not blame them because there are reason for their behaviour on this issue , such a harder education system of our day , the place young person generally live and the bad condition of community service . the education system of our time are much harder than the past time . harder topic are included in major in order to give the student the ability to compete with other student from different school , while trying to find a job . moreover , student now have to spend too much time for preparing for this hard education in order to be successful , which limit their time a lot . secondly , the increase in the number of young people who are attenting to the school made the school to build big campus outside the city , in order to provide more capacity . therefore , student started to live in these campus a it is hard for them to go to a school which is far away everyday . because of the distance of these campus to the city and the limitation of the time of the student , they can not attend to the social event or community service which generally take place in the city . moreover , it is a fact that the government do not do anything that will attract the young people to take role in community service . the environment of such service are really poor and also there is not enough chance for young people to have important role in these organization . governments should support the young people and provide better condition in the community service in order to attract the attention of young people . to conclude , it is clear that nowadays , young people are not giving much time to the benefit of their community than they were giving before . however , it will be wrong to blame them for this a they work harder during their education , live in place far from the city and are not attracted by the terrible condition that community service mostly have .
