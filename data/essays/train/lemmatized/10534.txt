while i wa in school i wa very unhappy when it time to learn the fact and memorize them because i wa having more fun when trying to understand the idea and concept . i still believe on the same way . i think that trying to understand idea make you think on it more and you learn easier . in an other way the thing you have learned keep in your mind in a longer period of time when you try to understand the idea or concept . when you just try to memorize the fact and do not pay attentinon to the understand it concept i think it like being a car engineer who never seen a car . a car engineer can know any technical detail about a car 's mechanic but if he had never seen a car he would not understand the what it is for and how it is working . i had two different history teahers in high school , the one i had in second class wa always want u to memorize and learn the fact . the history teacher i had in third class want u just to understand the idea , like why the war begin istead of when did a specific war begin . i still remember the thing i had learned in 3rd class but still have nothing in mind from the fact that i had memorised during second class . as a conclusion , the reason that trying to understant the idea instead of learing the fact make you think more and help you to understand more , i think it is more important for me and most of the student to try to understand it . in add'ition the thing you understand stay in your mind longer .
