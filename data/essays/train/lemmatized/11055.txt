i agree that student should understand idea and concept , because if they learn the concept they will be familiar with that particular topic . and they should also develop the idea it is also a important a concept . nowadays , if we have concept we are easily getting job . for ex .. , if a student do his lab work in particular experiment and which is also important for his theory examination if he do his experiment with concentration and with concept then if that particular question come in the theory examination without preparation also he will be able to write that question . if he go for any interview by chance if he ask about that particular topic he can easily answer that question eventhough if he asks in depth also that is the main advantage of concept . the idea are not knoen when they come to our mind but it better to develop from our childhood by getting idea only many people are succeding . for ex. , one of my friend like to drive cycle and he thought that everybody are riding the cycle but i have to drive in a different manner . he thought lot but suddenly he got an idea to drive cycle with scating shoe then he brought the rope and he tied it to the handle with balancing the cycle he use to drive the cycle , then slowly he developed by riding on bike he is now succesfull in that . i gave the ex for such idea he got and he entered in to the `` gunniess book of world record '' and all the friend and family member were very happy because of that idea now he became vaery famous thatwhat idea is important . i conclude , that if concept and idea are developed that we will make the person to in huge hights . a person may definetely get job if he concept but it may be late but he definetely get job . nowadays company are looking for the people having concept . if suppose we dont get jobe but using our idea we can earn better salary then person earning through job .
