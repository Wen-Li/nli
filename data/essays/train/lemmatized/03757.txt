i do not agree the opinion of that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping community . i argue that this opinion is not true for tree reason . first , i think that all youngers are living by suporting each other . though my experience , my friend always helped me when i got trouble . even i wa supported by my fliends more than my friend . i can say that if i did not have any friend , i could not get over the so many problem that i had in the past . of course when my friend are in trouble , i try to help them . we have learned the importance of frieds and support each other freom thouse experience . secound , in the public , i see so many young people who help eldery people . for example , people give up their seat and give them to old people on train , bus or on any public riding . in addition , some people carry havy bag for eldery people in store . tired , in my school , when someone breake his leg , arround his friend help him by carring his stuff or leading him . or when someone is appcent , his friend take note for him . i believe that all young people know the importance of helping other people and everybody helpes their community .
