the statement at hand express a strongly generalized opinion on a nowadays very fervent issue . it state that young people are disinclined to get involved in their community . one must pay special attention to the fact that the statement only concern a particular group in society , which is defined by age , and disregard any other group . at first , i want to point out my personal opinion : i do completely agree with the statement at hand . but for generalization reason , one must explain why young people behave the way they do . to utterly comprehend the everyday life of young people and the prodigious amount of stress and challenge a young person face today , one must view the world through the eye of a young person : one might assume that academic achievement and the fulfillment of the need for social interaction are the only two major challenge youth is facing nowadays . this is , however , slightly superficial . the competition in time of economic hardship and rising unemployment is tough . in order to maintain the hope of being able to compete against lot of applicant for all sort of institution , one must maintain excellent grade . this is putting the current generation under severe pressure . moreover , there is a growing gap between the individual and his/her parent . the relationship with one 's family is increasingly troubled , which lead to a loss of love and personal support . friends have to compensate for this . the world of today is fast-moving and seldom is there a moment to settle down comfortably . youth ha to overcome obstacle which range from suffering support by one 's family to drug and loss of orientation . youth face much . consequently , helping one 's community is not a thing most young people pay particular attention to , because they are overly concerned with much more `` important '' issue .
