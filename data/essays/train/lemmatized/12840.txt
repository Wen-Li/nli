this question is a very important one , since it refers to the entire education system , and how , in our society , people have decided the way thing should be teached to others . in this essay , we will discus the importance of understanding idea and concept , and learning fact , and try to determine if one of these can be considered a prevalent , regarding the other . learning fact is , to me , the very basis of education , because it allows people to know what happened before them , what important people lived , and may have changed the world by discovering thing , writing book , being an artist . it is very important to know these kind of information , to be able to consider the world outside yourself , and the thing directly surrounding you . plus it is useful in your everyday life , to understand what people are talking about , to be able to discus with people about various subject , to simply socialize , and live in harmony with others . interracting with people doe not only require knowing a lot of fact , but it also demand reflection , understanding of what you have learned . and yes , understanding idea and concept is also very important , because fact alone are not very useful , if you do n't try to dig deeper , to think about what you 've learned . philosophy is a great exemple of a domain that absolutely need both : you need to learn lot of thing about the philosopher , about there time , what they have said and thought , and then you need to understand all those information , to theorize them , in order to think by yourself , and create your own opinion , based ( but not necessaraly the same ) on what you have learned and understand . to conclude this essay , i must write that i do n't agree with this statement , i think that both understanding idea and concept , and learning fact , are the key to a complete education . indeed , i think that one is n't very useful without the other .
