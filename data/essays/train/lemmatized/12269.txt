nowadays , and a it is spread in the mass medium , a popular misconception is that young people have a far more interesting life than olders . indeed , they make party , they drink alcohol , contrary to the '' old men '' who spend their time playing card , talking about business . .. i am deeply opposite to this vision . i consider first that there are a lot of different way in order to '' enjoying life '' , then i would like to point out that young people have obligation too , and finally i want to highlight a substantial thing : it is olders , those who have the mean to enjoy . but let 's talk first about different leisure . to begin , i would like to say that enjoying is not necessary connected to party . indeed , you can enjoy life in your work because you make an interesting job . for the sake of example , i think that a singer like michel sardou , or a business man , like steve jobbs , can have fun being at work . moreover , when you are older , you get experience which allows you to enjoy other thing : a teenager can not understand the same thing visiting a museum than a senior . and playing at trivial pursuit when you are 12 year old is not so pleasant . then , even if i can not deny that young people have usually more time for leisure , they have obligation too : for a lot of working people , they have finished when they come back to their house . it is not the same for a student who ha homework . and it is noticeable that adult chose their work , whether pupil and student are at school because it is an obligation . so , they can feel le involved in what they do . finally , we can not forget the fact that , for a lot of leisure , you have to pay to enjoy . speaking about sport , about cinema , even about attraction parcs , nothing is free . and in order to earn enough money , you have to spend a certain number of year , so you are older . to conclude , and being a student myself , i do not want to complain about my situation , and i know that my parent wo n't let me without money , but i do think that , with the age ( so with the experience and the money ) you can enjoy your life in a different way , without becoming a vegetable in a chair !
