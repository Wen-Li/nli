i think for somethings you need the youth to start to create and with the time you will get experience then you 'll start to enjoy it . when you 're young you have le experence than the old people even you try to experiment all kind of emotion or situation you ca n't really enjoy it because you 'll need to have more experence . in the opositte way , when you are old you wold like to do thing that when you wear young you could't do and then you try but your physic or phsucologic contions or habilyties are not so strong enought to go on . for example to sky , is a very exaiting experence , you should start to learn when you are young and tried once and again till you start to feel the enterteiment , that will be when you are not so young anymore , that mean that to learn how to sky perfectly will take you at le 10 year , after you can developped your own tecnich and only then you will enjoyt the life 's sky . you can not conclued if the young peapol enjoy better than the old people because depence of the situation , on the topyc or on the way to be to each person . i know many young people whose limitated their life to dink alcohol , go the party on party , to be in drogs or easyly to be infront of the tv plazing videogames , and thats the way to enjoy the life , because if you ask to them the quite answear will the `` thar the way to enjoy the life ''
