some people feel that it is more important for student to learn fact rather than to understad idea and concept . such peole tend to think that learning fact can be the most effective way of increasing their knowlege in a variety of subject . in my opinion , however , for student , comphrehending idea and concept are more important than learning fact . this essay will discus two main reaons to support my opinion in more detail below . firtst , i am definitely convinced that it is more important for studnets to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason is that by understanding idea and concept , student can improve their academic achievement more effectively . in my exprience , for example , when i wa in junior high school , i hated remembering a lot of formula to solve math question . in the realm of mathematics , formula mean fact . however , when i took my math class from mr kimura for the first time at the age of 15 , i began to be good at math because he could teach me the concept of formula in very convincing way . that is , what i learned from his class is that in order to learn fact , understanding concept or idea which are strongly related to fact are indispensable to improve my academic achievement more quickly and effectively . second , i feel that it is more crucial for student to comprehend idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because understanding idea and concept can help student to improve their imagination and creativity . for instance , in my personal experience , when i encounter unfamilitar word and phrase for my study of english , i always try to come up with the concept of those word and phrase by myself before looking into my dictionary or referenced book , and i do believe that repeating this kind of practice day after day , i will be able to be skillfil in my creativity and imagination . all in all , i strongly believe that for student , understanding ieas and concept more important than learning fact not only because they can promote their academic performance more effectively and quickly but also because understanding concept and idea can be beneficilal for student to improve their imagination and creativity .
