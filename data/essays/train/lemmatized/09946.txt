i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . since young people are making our society these day , in my opinion , the society is made good for young people . there are many place in which young peple enjoy and older people can not . for example , game center is the place where we can play many game . many young people go to there and enjoy game . however it is too dangerous for older people to visit there since there are many bad young people . also , i think that young people have chance to communicate with people more . young people go to school and meet friend . they also can join many activity out of the school . older people may join some activity but there are not many activity for older people . in my experience , i went to the usa last year a an exchange student nad i met alot of people who i could not see if i wa in japan . if i were older , i am sure that i could not go to america and have great experience . in addition , older people have physical problem . it is hard for older people to go to many palace and enjoy all of them . however young people have more enagy so they do not get tired easily . therefor i think that young people enjoy life more than older people .
