yes , i totally agree taht young people enjoy life more than older people only in normal situation ( that is neither of them is sick or ill ) . most of the young people during their studieng period do not have any responsibilties becuse their parent are taking care of them from the expense to the living . all what they do is thinking about party like birthdayes , celibration and meeting with their freinds . lots of them have plenty of aspires that they will to acheve . some think that they want to travel around the world and the other is workinkg hard to build him a good live . also when they graduate and begin to separate from their family lot of apportunities is waitin for them eather merage or job . they also have a healthy body that let them be more debendent on trheir self . but lot u look at the old people their body begin to be weeker and weeker . they can not do what they used to do when they are young like traveling or plaieng sport . they can not debend on their self they need a help in every thing they do . even some of them can not continue in his livleyhood and lot of them star the yto lose the interist in every thing . thats explain that why in some country we see some old people after they retaier from work they chang their place of living , they try to travel do difrent citeis whch they think it much pecfull and comfortable from capital citeis . people say that the communiteis and the culture is built on there young people hand and that explains that young people have lot of enjoiable thing that they live for and old people must give the cahnce for the young people becuse they had theier own chance .
