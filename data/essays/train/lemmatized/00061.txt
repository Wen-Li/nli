the way for student to understand idea is a really important thing if they want to succeed in life . some tend to understand the idea and concept , but in an another way , there are some who perfer to understand only the fact . nowdays , it is true that most of them prefer to learn fact . but in general , what is the best way ? personnaly , i do not think that learning only fact is the best solution . indeed , this type doe not help u in our everyday life . for example , in history , i do not think that learning only fact is enough to understand the main point , they juste pick them out and forget them later , so the work is not using . however , this kind of understanding can work sometimes of course , but one day , you will not be able to deal with any subject . now i am going to deal with what i think would be the best way to do in life . first of all , comprehenssion is the base thing that everyone must learn and improve in his whose life . indeed , if you are able to understand the idea and concept , you will be self confident and all step of your life would be easier for you to overcome . for example , in school and espacilly in highschool , the best student are those who use their brain in this way , that 's we uselly say that they are clever . by the way , a friend of mine understand only idea , i mean , he work only with his memory . thus , he is not so well in school and i am better than fim because i focus on understanding the concerpt of thing than learn fact . finally , we havve seen that is important for student to understand idea and concept . althought many people regard this way a a wrong thing , they are probably wrong . everybody who think like that should change .
