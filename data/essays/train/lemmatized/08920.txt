in my opinion , a choice between understanding idea and concept , instead of learning fact , can not be made . both clearly appear to me to be important , for different reason . understanding of idea and concept is the final purpose of the study , and it is what student will retain for all their life , even if they would have forgotten fact . knowledge about main political idea , or major historical process , will always help them to understand the world they are living in , even if they could have forgotten what happened in paris on july 4 in 1989 . knowing all detail and date of french revolution is not helpful in itself . but on the other hand , without fact , idea and concept are only empty box . one could not understand where they come from . e. g. in the case of french revolution , it would be difficult to recognize contemporary french patriotism 's root in the country 's modern history . moreover , connecting concept to reality is very helpful in memorizing . students can be best helped in learning if a complete frame is provided them . the best way to teach could be to present student with fact , and then stimulate them to draw their own conclusion . anyway , it must also be noticed that the weight of these two skill - understanding idea and concept and learning fact - is different according to the matter or subject of study . for example , in a physics course , the most important thing is learn physic 's law . in this case , understanding concept would be more useful for student than knowing how scientist formulated a certain theory . on the contrary , without a strong knowledge of fact , many theory of anthropology could not be fully understood . finally , what is the priority , must be evaluated differently case by case .
