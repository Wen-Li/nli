there are many job , place to go and way to enjoy thing . as the world becoming more and more complicated and the society growing . and the mentalistic thing should also be growing , too . now a day , i see few young people helping their community . so i agree to the subject because of 2 reason . first , i see only few young people helping their community . when medium interview the poor or the old , they say that they want to be loved and cared , it 's the young people 's job to do this . they just care for themselves and not others . the young people should know that helping the society is helping themselves secondly , the young people only think of themselves . their are many way to help the community , but they are avoiding these . they say that they are busy working , but are n't other people busy ? now a day , there are many people who think they are the most important thing and they only have to work for themselves . because of these reason , i think young people are not donating their time to help their own community . they should make a time to volunteer and let the society be helped by themselves .
