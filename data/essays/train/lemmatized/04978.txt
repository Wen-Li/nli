i agree with the statement that it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i agree with the statement because in this competitive world of today one ha to really master his skill in a wide variety of subject rather to specialize in one subject . in this modern world the technology ha so much advanced that without having a broad knowledge about a variety of subject a person can not becom successful . having a knowledge about a variety of subject not only improve his intellectual power of thinking but will also improve his effficiency at work . a person can not succeed in his work if he doe n't have thorough knowledge of his subject . for example , medical field ha become so advanced and ha introduced so many latest technique that without thier thorough knowledge it would n't be possible to even operate a machine . a simple example of such machine is mri which is also known a the magnetic resonance imaging . its basically consist of two part one the hard ware part and the other is the software part . hardware part consists of all the mechanical system including the couch and magnet and the software part consists of the computer system where imaces of the different part of the body are acquired and saved for further evalution . now the hardware part is based on the engineering perspective and a requires a person to have a thorogh knowledge of it to operate the machine and should know the function of each part . on the other hand software part requires a thorough knowledge of different software like the different language used in the compiter then he should also be able to study the image . so , in order perform any tast seuccesfully person shuold have a broad knowdledgwe of all the subject rather than one
