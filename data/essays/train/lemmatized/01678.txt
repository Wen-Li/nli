nowadays , there are many people belive that only doing what they already know how to do well is true . nevertheless , i absolutely disagree this point at all . i think that a successful people show try thing and take risk to beome successful . there are many successful person also take many high risk before he/she beome successful and well-known . bill gate is a typical example in this situtation . when bill gate wa still a student in university , he realized that he would be a great man and hired by a big company with great amount and stable salary after he gratuated . although he realized that situtation , but he still decided to take a risk to abandon his study and started to invented some software . moreover , he asked asked on of his friend to abandon study and go with him to create a business . nevertheless , he rejected eventually . a few year later , bill gate became the richest man in the world with several million of dollar . on the othr hand , although his friend wa graduated from the university of oxford , he wa only a manager of a small company . an other example is my father , he w not skillful in studying when he wa young : therefore , he started to created his own business instead if studying or working for a company for many year . now he becomes a very successful person and my idol . in conclusion , i think people should try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is because if we are not skillfull in studying or working for others , why do we have to waste our precious time to do the thingd without any result . moreover , i think people should try new thing when they are young , because it is useful to regret when they become old .
