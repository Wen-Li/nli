it is thought that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i agree with this idea . despiteif student study hard , they can not memorize a long time ; if student learn just fact , they will not memorize what they learned . when a student read a book about their study , if the student just read all text with out understanding , the student can not explain how wa the book is . if a student have excellent memorizing ability , a student can remember everything without understanding ; not only is it hard for student to have , but also every people can not do . to understand idea and concept are provide student with an opportunity to use information atpprociately that they lened in study . only student learn fact , they can use information . but without understanding ha limit to use . students learn more easily if they undertand idea and conceots then if they learn only fact . when a student learn a vocabulary , a which way is more easy to use and memorize ?
