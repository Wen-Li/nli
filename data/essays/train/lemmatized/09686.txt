the question about generalisation or specification is a very important topic because it is an ever lasting dicussion . my opinion on the question wether it is better to specialise or generalise is according to the generalisation , to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in this text i will state my opinion by showing the advantage in private and office live . the first reason supporting my view is having the possibility to see more different aspect of a topic . imagine you are a leader of a firm . managing this firm mean cooperation with different stakeholder who have different interest . when this manager now ha a general knowledge in different academic subject he save a lot of time by understanding what these stakeholder want from him . for example when you speak with researcher you know a few thing they are talking about . second it is important to be able to combine different knowledge . this possibility enables you to solve a problem by your own . insted of always asking people from different sector you may be able in some situation to get the solution by your own . this is also an aspect for saving money in a firm , by doing thing on his own instead of outsourcing evert small task . the last reason for my opinion explains the advantage of broad knowledge in private live . having a large range of knowledge you are automatically interested in more thing . being intersted in different thing will help you to find more friend . and with these frindes it is possible to connect a network of reliable person who will help you in the job or beside the job . these are a few reason that follow my opinion to be better wide spread educated then having only a small range of view . you can gain a lot of advantage getting and using the knowledge out of many different academic sector .
