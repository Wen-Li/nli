global warming , cold , the ozone layer becoming thinner . .. etc . what do you think is causing these problem ? yes . it 's mostly because of car . we all know that car are polluting environment and cause many disease . and yet , we 're still using car very often . why ? it 's because it 's fast and comfortable when it take u to our destination . i disagree that there will be fewer car 20 year later . in my opinion , even the time go to 2026 , the car will still be our number one trasportion . there are some reason why i think this way . first , car are very fast . it 's much fast than running and walking and biking . even though there are bus and train , it 's crowdy and also too big and slow for u to use for our daily life . but car are different . it 's fast and comfortable . it can took u to the destination in short period of time . unless we can invent transportation which is a fast and comfortalble a car , i think we will still use car in 2026 . second , car are private for one or one 's family . you ca n't really talk private thing in the bus and train because it can annoy people around you . also , you ca n't really talk privately since there are many people listening . however , in car , you can talk freely since there are only your mate or your family in the space . not to mention that you can use car anytime you want . third , car have unique design . some rich people even collect many car . unlike other transportation , you can decorate your car in what fassion or color you like because it 's quite small and cheaper than the other transportation . nowadays , a technology developed , you can also do many thing in car . for example , you can listen to music , watch tv , cook some food , etc . i think even the time flow 20 year , we will still ca n't find transportation like car , which ha unique design and many us . i think car are great transportation to human even though time flow to 2026 . but , polluting the environment got to be stopped . many scientist are developing new way to find resourses , such a solar energy , wind energy , tide energy and so on . i hope to see a wonderful car without polluting air in 2026 .
