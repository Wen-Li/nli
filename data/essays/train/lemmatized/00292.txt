some people are called successful people because they try for something that others can not achieve so easily . because of these successful person we are able to see refrigerator , micro owen , television , computer , aeroplane etc . successful people are unique and risques are always part of thier life . they never mind taking risk during reaching thier goal . for example take the case of wright brother of america who ha led to the discovery of jet plane , aeroplane . wright brother saw a bird flying in the air and he thought that why can not a similar structure be made and make it fly in the air using two wing and a tail . he went to ahill and ran from the hill to downwards by letting to fly with the modelled plane . he had tried several time and ha eventually failed . even there wa risk to his life he never minded and his goal wa to run the plane . atlast he finally succeded oneday . from this one can learn successful people try new thing and take risk . we can also take the case of newton who wa responsible to find the gravity of motion of earth . he wa once sitting down an apple tree and he wa seeing up towards the sky . while he wa seeing towards the sky an apple ha eventually had fallen on his head . he wa surprised by seeing the apple that had fallen on his head and he thought that why doe the apple doe not go up towards the sky and why is it falling downwards . this typical thinking lead him to the finding of gravitational motion of earth . he wa also responsible for finding the three newtons law of motion . from the above example we can conclude that successful people always try new thing and those thing make these people unique from others . without risk we can not do any thing great and we all people should do something new and find something new and contribute something to world .
