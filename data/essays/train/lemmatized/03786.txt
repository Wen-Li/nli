idears and fact can be thought two different part of a song . idears like the melody of a song and the fact like the lyric of the song . both of them are important , however , if we change the lyric of a song , it seems it still a song and just with different meaning , but if we change the melody of the song , sometimes , it may not be a song or it is already another song . compareing with these tow different part , i agree that it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . first , i believe idears and concept of knowledge is the main core a the most important part during our learn . there are million and million fact of each subject , and it is impossible for u if we want to get ench specific aspact of the fact , even though we spend our whole college life to learn them . so the best way of learning knowlege is to get the main idear or concept in the first step , and then pick up some relative fact to help u understatn it and empersize it . on the other hand , there is no nesseary to learn all the fact but we must to get the idea and concept , even when we do the extra-activities . in the extra-activities that we orgainazed in college , we usually need to prepare a lot of detail thing in oder to keep it going a we expected . but , there are still more or le new problem emerge during the activity . if we only focus on the fact that we learned or we prepared , we will never ever find the right way to solve it immedietly . however , if we have a well-understanding of main idear on this compain , we will do everythings quikly and in the right derection . that is why i think getting the main idear is more important than learning fact .
