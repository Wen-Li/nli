in reference to the proposed question i must say i 'm mostly disagree . nowadays young people probably have more free time than ever . if only they dedicate a little part of their free time to help each other in their community , a lot of problem could be reduced , not only for the community that receives the colaboration , also for young people who participates . conciencing youth about enviromental problem in their own town or city could make they were more responsable to the nature . i also think that it could prevent the youth to be atracted by drug in general and alcohol in particular . in the other hand it 's true that young people nowadays have more expectatives of the society over them and they also have more stress . i also must say that young people now can have more and more free time posibilities , and for much of them it ' s hard to renounce to them . in part our society is more individualist in our time , a a whole , not only the youth . because of this , all adult may participate helping their community , not only young pepole . there are a lot of activity that both boy and girl can do : working for old peolple ; childcare ; enviromental work , such a conservation of local fauna or helping in the plantation of tree ; cleaning the road near town . ..
