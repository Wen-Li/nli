i belive the young people enjoy life more than older people , because young people always think that there are in the begining of there life and they have a long life in the future . on the other hand we have the older people who think that there life will end soon . another reason that i think why young people enjoy life more than older people is that they do not have the experience of life , so everything they do is interstinting and new to them . but for older people they went into a lot of situation and problem , so they gain a lot of experience and when thaey go threw it again , they will think it is boaring and old . young people are always active and looking for some new and enojoyable adventure . older people do not like to chanege there situation and want to keep the same old stuff . whenever the person is young and healthy he ha more ability to enjoy what he is doing , and whenever he start getting old he start losing these ability . young peole always look and search for thare fun , so they can enjoy there life before getting old . when you ask an old person about his long life he will always mention the enjoyable time that he had when he wa younger , and he will love to start doing it from the begining . young people are easier to have fun and enjoy life than older people . at the end i belive that young people is easier to make them enjoy life than older peole
