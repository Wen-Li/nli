the statement whether there will be fewer car in use than there are today in the next twenty year is a controversial one . on one hand , the number of car are bound to increase since spending power of people is increasing which enables them to buy car . on the other hand , it may be possible that there will be a vast reduction in the number of car due to lack of resource which drive the car i.e. gasoline . however , i believe that the number of car in next two decade are going to increase . one reason for my belief is that the ease with which a consumer can buy a car in today 's world . even if the consumer is short on cash , he can easily buy the car on installment , a facility which is provided by most of the showroom . moreover , bank also play a big role in purchase of car by introducing auto loan which enables their customer to borrow the money from bank and pay them later with easy installment with marginal interest rate . another reason for my belief is that the human in today 's world are looking for comfort . gone are the day where people believed in physical workout to make sure that they stayed fit . today 's generation hold the thought that comfort is the best pleasure of life . with such ideology , it highly likely that each individual would like to own a car for his comfort . not only owning a car lead to comfort , it also considered a a part of ` status symbol ' in our society . people owning luxury car are given a high status in the society whereas people owning no car are generally looked down upon . if a person doe not own a car then many people form the opinion that he is not financially stable which is why he can not afford to buy a car . perhaps the best reason for my belief is that even though there is going to be shortage of gasoline in coming year , scientist are continuouslly trying to come up with alternative source which can drive the car . many such invention have already taken place such a a solar powered car which get it fuel from the sun 's ray or a battery powered car . although these car are not widespread in use a of yet but it a great possibility that they will be widely in use in the coming decade . in addition , there is also no restriction imposed by any governement in the world on ownership on number of car which lead the consumer in buying of car without worrying about breaking any law . that is why we see many family owning more than one car . thus , the above reason substantiate my disagreement with the statement .
