`` success follows those who sweat '' i strogly agree with the statement since in life we have to take chance i.e risk . by taking risk it not only increase our confidence level but also give u self satisfaction , acclimation to our action . for example scientists try to discover new way or invent the thing which work faster , effectively , low cost and higher reliabillity and which out date the present product , so they try new idea to invent a product which have a high risk , such a marie curie ha devoted her life to study the radium and it 's pattern with high risk factor . second example is of stunt master who always take risk to make a shot for film , each time he performs new feat with courage and risk and so he is rewarded , third example is of japan technology since , each person in a firm ha his own importance , such a take the manufacturing of television , in this one person manufacture only picture tube and other manufature only the equipment of the television , by continuously manufacturing they innovate new idea of manufacturing with some bit of risk , because of it their technology is now very advance . in my opinion man ha to take risk since after risk it would be definetly success , which follows in one or the another way . a succesful man need not to look for oppurtunities but turn the risk in to oppurtunities . in summary man ha to take risk .
