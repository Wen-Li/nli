time is the precious thing in people life but noone is aware of it end spend so generously . life energy begin in childhood and raised in youth ended in death . especially in youth age everything is so simple for u ; . we don t think about earning money or the job problem . .. we try to do our best to enjoy life a we can because we have energy to do this . but when we get older we ll be scared to do something on our own and we ll delay our will because there will be other person in our life under our responsibility and their will will be more important then ours . i want to give example from my life . i m 25 year old and i m living on my own in istanbul . my family life in other city and i want to study in america to be hired at reputable firm in istanbul . i m about to change my life and i quit the job and take the risk because i know i m capable to do this because i don t have to lose at this age and i want to do everything i want in this age after year and getting married this energy will not be only for me it will be for my husband child and work family . . etc . . besides this emotional energy there will be lack of pyhisical ability in old age to do thing that we want . mostly old people use medicine for the deseases related to aging ; for example blood pressure ; could nt move faster and feel tired mostly . it mean when they feel healty and if there are some people araond them they enjoy their life mostly it is physical and emotional fact that young people enjoys their life more then older people because younger one have great expectation from life and they have time to do . i think we have to worth the time now we re in because it s go on so fast and we will not be young again .
