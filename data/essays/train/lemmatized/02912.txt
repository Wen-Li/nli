i agree with the statement because i think that spot make his product seems better almoust always . from the producters point of view it is a very good think because in this way they think that it is possibole for them to sell mach more product and so it 's possible to make much more money . i think that this is not true in fact when someone go to buy something because he see that on tv or by some other kind of advertisiment , he mants to have that product with the propiety that were illustrated . if he come back home with his new object and whene hi try it and it note tha the propiety are not seems a the advertisiment 's one , he is not sadisfaction at all . when happens something like that the client will never buy again the same product and he will never buy anything else by the same factory . for example : is chrismas , you want to buy to your son a new toy . you want to buy a small nice train that you saw on a tv spot . it ha the railyway station and it is full of light . the spot say that the light turn really on . on the chrismas day you give your present to your little son and you say to him the the light turn really on . he is vary happy for that but when he try to turn on the light nothing happens . by now i 'm sure that you will never buy anything alse from the train 's factory . for this reason i think that a producter have to make a real and true advertisement for his product , in this way people who buy something from him are sadisfy and so they maybe will come back to buy something alse from his factory .
