i have to say before entering this topic that we can not know what will happen in twenty year or even if car will circulate around . but , if everything continious to progress a it ha been doing for the last ten year i think that hopefully , there will be lot of car but not a much a today . the reason are that globalization is making u move around the globe more than ever before but also more quickly . another task to have in mind is that city are expanding , and this make it impossible for car to succesfully attend the requirments of people in term of transport . so , if we have to cover longer distance in a shorter period of time i think it will only be possible if public transport become more accesible to people , more confortable and , of course , more efficient . also for longer distance , air transport but speacially train will bring the solution to the problem . trains are more confortable in term of working experience ( for example with a laptop ) , reading , having meeting or conversation , than in plane where taking off and landing do not permit nearly anythything . of course between place where there is sea or ocean in between plane are the only option , and i also think that they will continue to imprive in many aspect . but returning to the city ( where by the way i have more experience ) , the rush hour are a complete waste of time . governments and private institution need to promote public transport or for example taxi cab . this transport have two main benefit . the first one is that people in charge of driving are not in a hurry so the will drive more carefully . also they will know the better way to follow and will transport more people in le space ( what doe not necessary mean that you can not breath ) . the best example would be the metro ( or underground ) . cities like paris or ny need to invest in their metro service ( witch are old and smell really bad ) , but others like madrid have invested a lot in it and , not in twenty year but now , today , there are le car than before . also city where motorbike and bike are promoted experience a big fall in the number of car .
