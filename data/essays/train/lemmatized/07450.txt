according to me i feel that it is the best thing for a person to have better knowledge about specialized subject rather than seeking knowledge about several subject for several reason . firstly seeking knowledge about a particular subject can make him a master in that subject . he can expertise soley in the subject . for example if you are interested in general science . you can concentrate on that subject only and know the subject study the subject deeper . secondly a person can study the sub jecft and know the deeper strength and line of the subject . the person can get a chance to know and study more detail about the subject . in contrast if we concentrate on all subject we may not achieve perfecton in any of them . thirdly there is a saying that a person can do only one thing at one time . for example if a person dream is to become a scientist , it is of no use if he concentrate on other subject such a economics or art etc . although they are only important for him to have a basic idea about this subject not any thing thing more because they donot contribute him to reach his target or his destination . fourthly a person may get several opportunity in future which may wecome him or her . for example if a person attends an interview he or she may be asked that in which subject or area you are specialised , or interested . based on his specilization of subject the interviewer may ask the question . a person get an opportunity to be an expert or master of his subject being specialised . to sum up although other academic subject are also basically important to seek knowledge but it is always a good idea or beneficiary to be an expert in any particular subject . it is bette to lspecialize in one rather than mixing of all other subject .
