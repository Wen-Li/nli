it seems that because of young age and so more flexible body young people are enjoying life more than their parent or older people around them do . it may be so , technically , but in fact not , at least not from what i have learned from my experience . first of all , young people are at the beginning of life . they are just trying to collect the tool to explore a new , unknown and charming land . so they are focused on constructing their life for their future instead of living in present time and enjoying their experience . they have to go to a college or a university first of all to guarantee a sustainable living . and preparing for all those exam and trying to cope with all unpleasant side effect such a stress , sleeping problem and depression is not so enjoying . going out with friend sometimes and getting into drinking rituels doe not mean that they are pleased with their life or they are enjoying life . because of the pressure of a comfortable future life , real life is forgotten . to graduate from a college is even a problem because that is the end of your student life and you are now expected to find a good job and try to survive , you can not depend on your parent from now on , nor your friend : you are completely alone in an unknown world . you have to woork a lot , to be considered a a succesfull person for yourself and for the people near you , you should buy a car , and then a house . untill here , these are my experience . here are my father ' and my mother ' : my father ha just retired , he is an actor and he worked for a state held theater organization more than thirty year . he had to put off all his wish and desire because his child were in college and they needed money . but he doe just what he want now : he is travelling a lot to see different artistic performance in theater , he is working on his own play , reading lot of book and he is passing three monts of the year along the sea coast in our summer residence in that unique environment in one side a forest , in another side the bluest sea of the world . my mother also pass most of her time in our summer residence , where i hadnt seen for four year . she go out whenever she feel bored to the nearest theater to watch the coming film and it wa age ago when i last saw a film . she sometimes visit my brother living in one of the most beautiful winter sport center of my country . so , whenever i look at them , i feel that enjoying you life is a very very long experience , a gift perhaps , attained after so much struggle , or may be a sort of achievement and can not be wholly understood by young people . we are just at the beginning . i hope that someday it will be our turn .
