`` why is someone more successful than others ? `` . many people would say that luck favor him/her , the star for this individual seem to be glittering but at the end of the day , a critical analysis of a success can be quantified in term of the magnitude of acknowledgement that the person ha drawn from the world . and the attention commensurates with innovation , an unprecedented action that apparently urge the people to set their eye on the performer . the advocate and policy maker somewhat form a decent example of people who have intrinsic ability to crystalize their risk taking behavior in to action . the placement of the four ball of social justice `` desert , need , right and equality '' requires a critical examination and high level of judgement because an experiment with society and it belief can be really threatening at time and might end up dumping the indivdual to a professional death . but still bold step have been taken by individual who remained die hard fan of constructive criticism that perhaps honed their ability to take on new idea and thought and use their risk taking abiltities to perfection and produce societal outcome and reform . the success barely come a an idle incentive but primarily involves trying new thing at the expense of risking your present credential . the individual reap the benefit against a solid input of courage and the positive consequence come with huge vote of applause which is then termed a success with an equal opportunity of failure that always run parallel till the last minute of coronation . another good example is a pole vaulter `` sergie b '' who is famous for breaking his own record . to him every success wa determined to add a few more inch to the height of his next action . this interprets that innovation and risk taking behavior are somewhat governed by the success itself .
