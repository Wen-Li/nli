it is well known that gazoline is the main driver in car production . in fact , if the gazoline cost too much , people will le be likely to buy car . as a result two potential hypothesis concerning the future of car can be find . first , the decrease of gazoline will limited the number of car . second a new powerfull subtitued will be find . to answer the question : ` will the number of decrease within twenty year ? ` , this essay will explain the two hypothesis , their consequenses and it will conclude buy answering the statement . the first hyppothesis stating that a decrease in gazoline supply will decrease the number of car . it is comon sence . if the gazoline suplly is limited the price will go up . as a result comsuption and demand will go down down . in twenty year , people will find-out that having a car and especially with gazoline into it ha becomes a luxury good . people , individual , will not be a afford the new price of gazoline , only major firm or government . the second hypothesis is more relevant . find new source of energy is possible . we already develop the nuclear which is of course not the best solution for car but show how human been can find alternative solution . the ` ethanol ' which is a comple nature source of power can be a solution for car . what we need to underline concerning the ethanol is that the smoke created out of the car using it is horrible . it just smell very bad . unless a solution concerning the smell is find it will not be the best solution . entire city of ethanol 's car can not be . to conclude , i belive that the number of car will decrease within the next twenty year . alternative solution are possible but , not easy to find and use . however , the price of the alternative power or the comon gazoline will be high or going up . as a result , the number of car can only decrease with time . lets not forget that number of car must decrease unless the hole earth will suffer .
