during an academic education , personc face with a challenging contraversion mainly , specilielazi on one subject to study or being more versatile when makin thjis desition . in my point of view , iy seems resonable to chose , specililazing on a certain branch rather then many of them . this may lead to cultivate your knowlege diligancely in a branch and also it is more easy way to be succesfull acedemicly . first of all studying many subject at onec may seems u to know more abouth acedemicly . however when you try to be deal with many subcjects . it deduce to miss the major point of them individually . next semester for examle , i try to take extra course a a result of my high grade , whetre i thought achive succesfully all my major , i realize that , i miss lot off point when i try to deal whith both diffent branch . moreover specilizing in a single era , ha a crucial importance for an acedemic person . if you completly understant the subject broadenly both way , you will be able to aqcuantind about all featurs of this branch indeed , it contribute to became a major this era , and provide to expedite the time to became more adequte to acedemicly increase . of caurse i have the same manner that , working diffrent subject may reveal to easly make preferances abouth , which of them you want to work about , however try to now lot about everyting is indisputably im possiable gaoul to achive indeed . so in conclusion , i firmly belive that to prevail the rivilies in the contraversiol u academic conditiouns may only possible to be now comprehensively about a subject indded .
