in order to gain an opinion on the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' , i would have to first observe typical activity of both age group . i would then have to come up with a system to measure enjoyment . the latter i am not capable of incorporating in such a short format , so that i am going to analize typical activity and - where appropriate - associate a value with them . what do young people like to do ? they travel , they like to consume fashion and music , they study and they do sport - and very often all at the same time . they certainly have the physical ability to do so . not quite a often do they have the funding . if indeed they do n't , they like to spend big portion of their time in front of the television or computer , watching show , surfing the internet or playing video game . often , these medium represent a world , that these people would enjoy even more than their own life . if young people do not do , what they `` like '' to do , they are usually too busy to enjoy life . older people are not busy . they have time and money to travel , enjoy culture , and do sport . but all of that they can only do , if they are still healthy and active enough . otherwise they like to fall into pattern similar to the one described do . often , these pattern involve tv or crossword-puzzles . by sarcastically creating prototype of young and older people , i am expressing an opinion that is beyond agreement or disagreement with the opening statement . none of the group enjoys life more than the other . it all depends on the individual and what they make out of their living situation .
