i think specialization in one specific subject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . in the academic life in university , every student wishing to graduate from the university must represent a specific subject a finishing project . after than for instance , a specific issue is selected in the master 's degree . every scholar is expected to focus on a specific issue . moreover , no one can claim to be best at all field . in this sense , there are many sub-titles below the issue . as a graduate from the international relation department , i can give many sub-titles such a europe , middle east , far east , territorial waters , weapons of mass destruction , etc . .. examining one specific topic give the person more detailed information on that subject , subsequently she/he will be called a a expert on that subject . by getting more and more information on the subject she/he will be more self-confident person . if a sensitive issue are raised on the subject , she will be applied firstly in order to get her thought . writing book or essay on a specific topic could enable her to gain more prestige a well a more money . paralel to raising in her/his profession , living standarts will also improve . on the other hand everyone ha some information about the daily life . the people must attach importance to the politics , economy and international relation . we must take an active role in all social platform in order to audit the political process . we must keep a close eye on the happening in daily life .
