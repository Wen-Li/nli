the author say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in my opinion , i prefer travel alone than travel with a group of people . the reason are talked below . firstly , the target of my travelling is relax . i would not like to plan it typically and would like to go somewhere i really like . if i can choice i will stay in one place for enough time . after hard work , people want to relax themselves and do not like to obey the schedule . for example , when you asked one whether he or she would like to plan their leisure time . many of them will say no and give the answer to stop telephone going somewhere one like , no guide , no many people , quiet , really relax . people do not like to bring schedule in leisure time . because the hard day secondly , travel alone is a popular method in the world and people can explore new place than the old one . we really like go to new place than the old place . but travel with group do not meet the need . people like adventure . for example , in china there are many famous place just like the great wall and the summer palance . if somebody choose the group to travel the famous place , he or she will disapointed because there are so many people in the great wall that one can not have a good look at it . on the other hand , when one walk alone and choose the best day , he or she will please themselves with the great picture of the nature . thirdly , the tour guide is somewhat troublesome . he or she alway lead the group of people to the shopping mall buying many thing that the tour people do not really want . the exactly time of the visiting is short and one can not have pleasure with the visiting . it is a question that someone travel with group can meet . and many people do not like . last but not the least , there are many benefit about travelling with group by a tour guide . such a safety , saving time , well planned . it is a common choice for many people and also a tradition for much family . in sum , in my point of view , i like go somewhere myself and enjoy the place i have never gone . i would like some place that there are not so much people and really relax from the study and work . enjoying the happy life .
