yes i do agree to the statement hat young peopleenjoy life more than older people do . this is because of the fact that age withers body and an ageing person is laden with more number of problem than a person in his youth . a younger person ha le responsibility comparitively . younger people tend to enjoy the technology and the happening in the world around them more than the older people . this is because of the problem that older people find it more difficult to adapt themselves to the change around the world compared to a younger person . family problem and crisis add to the woe of older people . the fear of being rejected by their child is always on the back of their mind and the tension that the age brings with it seems to make older people more and more devoid of entertainment and enjoyment . health problem in the older age are the primary cause for older people to enjoy le than the younger one . with the increasing pollution and the rapid growth of disease and the appearance of newer disease day by day , older people are devoid of their joy . a stamen and the resistance power of an older person is comparitively le than a younger person . the older person is more vulnerable than a younger chap . the pleasure that youngster derive in spending their time with friend and frolicking is immense which is not so in case of the older people . there may be some case wherein even the older people might meet their friend and have some fun time but in practical sense and especially in the present day scenario , how far is that possible and how many such older people are really enjoying their life ? thus the health problem and being more and more burdened with problem with increasing age , older people find it more difficult to enjoy than younger people .
