in today 's world , it is highly advantageous to know a wide spectrum of knowledge . since the chance that you may switch into another field increase day by day . what 's more , a mr know-all seems to be welcomed everywhere . in my eye , however , it is better to specialize in one specific subject rather than to splurge too much effort on unrelated subject that may have nothing to do with your future life . firstly , every human being 's energy is limited . believe it or not , even a genius like einstein could only dabble in other field than physic , how can an ordinary doing too much in a short lifetime ? focused effort do not pay off for everyone , not to mention scattered time and energy . secondly , to survive in this fullly competitive society and earn your bread in the rat race , you 'd better have your strenth . specializing on one specific subject can make you an expert , broad knowledge of many academic subject may not most the time . thirdly , brought up by our country , we are all eager to do something for her in the future . but without a deep knowledge in one specific area , how can we contribute largely to her ? take my major , ocean-engineering a an example , without specialized devotion in the style and designing of ocean-structures , we ca n't go any further in our future . what 's more , there are too many thing worth pondering over , if you are given the chance to pick some from an ocean of academic subject , which one are you going to selct ? you may probably get lost in the immense subject , or achieve nothing wandering among these subject . what i have argued above is based on my own experience , but we can neither go far when being tightly enclosed to a single subject . it is better to have some know-how about your related subject , but our major time and energy should go to one specific area . `` roman wa not build in a day '' , so wa the knowledge . dedicate more to your target , and you can achieve more .
