i don `` t agree with the affermation . today , the global popolation is cositituite of seven thousand of people and more people use the car . i think that in twenty year , the popolation will be augmentation and thus , people will have more car . a medium family had today two or three car and when the global popolation will be major , there will be three or four car for family . however , i would say that african `` s popolation , or however all poor popolation , will have major rich and thus it can take a new car . but exist also the problem of the petrolium . this resource isn `` t infinite and likely , among twenty year don '' t will be others fossil combustible . today , the people that study this problem think that it is important research a solution . a possible solution is take energy `` s sun for develop a car that it going with the light of the sun . an other solution is liquid hydrogen but it cost . there are other solution for to try at limited the problem of the petrolium . however , all this solution are realize also for the pollution , that it is a factor very important in the good life of the people . among twenty year there is more pollution than today if we continue to use the car each day . other scientist had propose of add more pubblic trasport , in way of to reduce the pollution . in twenty year there will be more car for this motif . global popolation will have more rich and the popolation of the country more poor will be le weak .
