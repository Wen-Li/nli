when human society stepped into 21st centry and technology developped , more and more people realized that understood idea and concept were useful . it is no doubt that idea and concept were mostly like a key to crate something especially for student . i totally agree with this statement : it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i will list three point to support my opinion . the most important thing is to gain the knowledge from the idea and concept . i 'm a student which have learned our history . for me , i think most of the antiquity history like mirror . history reflect the current event . also , there are many idea and concept in history . no matter what we did , it still come from our history . the other factor , which is equally important , is that the ability which is the view of thing from one to three . for instance , my roomate who come from northeast of china are good at hard science . when her lab teacher told her to finish a project , she always do it right and fast . you know what , because she got the idea and concept , not just learn from fact . it more important for student to have this skill to study . the last one but not the least one is that the appearance of new technologhs . everybody know that japan were famous for it small technics . producting others country product and absorbing that then having their own technology is their action . do n't borde that . more than 50 % country wa follow them . because japanese got the idea and concept form other technics . from what i mentioned above , we can draw the conclusion that for student , understand idea and concept is more important than the fact we learn . i suggest the student who want to be success to keep this mind in your head .
