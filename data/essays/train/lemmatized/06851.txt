i do not aggree with this statement . there several reason explained in the analysis below which will indicate the opposite . first of all , the historic development of the automotive industry ha to be taken into account . in the last 30 year the number of car sold worldwide increased year after year . in western europe an the united staates the number of sold car might not have increased at the same speed it did in the 1980s or 1990 , but it still ha been growing . furthermore , the statement claim that the total number , not the number of sold car , will be reduced . that mean that people whose car are demaged will not buy new car , which certainly is unrealistic . emerging country like china and india and also country in eastern europe seem to develop the same way country in western europe and the u.s. have a few year ago . therefore , the demand for car in those country will rise year after year . when anayzing the location of production site of the automotive industrie it is obvious that they currently focus on these country . this show that they expect to sell huge a amount of car in those area . other country in africa have not even started to develop to an industrial country . in 20 year those country will properbly have began their development and consequently their need for car will have increased . the growing population in the develloping country and in the whole world will go hand in hand with the growing number of car . at the moment the importance of the environment becomes obvious to people in developed country like germany . this might make people think that the number of car will be reduced . but , the conclusion that the will stop buying car is wrong . it is possible to invent environmental friendly car which only need a little amount of gas . at the same time the first prototype of car using differnent material than gas have been develloped . this give people the opportunity to drive a car and to protect the environment . the argumentation above show that it is very unlikely that the number of car will decrease in the next twenty year .
