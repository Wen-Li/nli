i agree with this statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . there are two reason to support . first of all , it will be boring for them to learn only the fact . if the student just only learn the fact , they will be satisfied with their knowledge and wo n't try to think any more . thinking is a important process to improve their knowledge . if they just learn the fact , they do n't need to think why it happened or how it happened . they will just know the answer right away without thinking . in fact , thinking is exciting . when they learn an idea , they will try to use it in many situation . for example , when student learn about static electricity , they will try to make electirical shock by rubbing object and find out which object make the most electricity . they are thinking and also enjoying the method . but if they know the fact , they will just chose the right object and done . that is very boring . secondly , understanding idea and concept are very important . from my experience , i really think so . when i wa playing basketball in middle school , i just did a the coach said to me during practice . i did n't really think about why are we doing this practice and just did a we were told to do . but a time go by , our team became weaker and weaker . we searched for the reason . finally we found out the reason . every practice we did had a meaning . we were n't just running , we were running a if we are in the game . we were n't just shooting , we were shooting a if there are opponent blocking . we were just doing the fact that the coach said but we should have understand the idea and concept of the practice . after we noticed the fact , we started to work hard and we became the second place in the competition . i wa really happy and thanked the coach for teaching u for not telling the answer and made u think by ourseves . from this experience , i learned that understanding idea and concept are far more important that learning fact . this is why i agree with this statement .
