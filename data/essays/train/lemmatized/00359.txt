i am agree to the statment because i think too that the succesful people is the people who try new thing and take risk , but i think that it is n't the only reason to say to this people succesful . i think that you need more than this statment . the people succesful is the people that believe in his own , and this peopla have a lot of goal in his head , and do anything for obtains all the thing propouses . this people known that they have the possibility to do the change of the thing only if they have theirs knowledge in minde , they know who they are . .. and know that they could be if never disapoint . for example . an student want graduate and he want study anrchitecture , it 's a dream . now , what can he doe ? ok , this it 's simple . he have had aptitude and ability for the carear , he should want study and never leave his dream . but not only the road finish here . he should take the decition of be responsable , and be intelligent to dominate all the information . the student had to start to have more relation with people of his carear , this pont is because not only you should be intelligent for this project , you have to findding the wat to obtain a good job . he had a goal for obtain , and he continues in the knowledge process to be the person who he want to be . other example could be a famous people like an actor who win an oscar . he feel exciting for obtain a goal . all the day we find many people like that . the succesful people take a lot of risk because they know , they can do that and all the thing they want to do . this people can be anypeople , but this person shold be take the decition to do something for change and something to grow ever . the world is in hand of successful people ! people with dream , people with risk , people with posibilities to grow . they have a lot of fight for , they have a goal , they have a plan . they do n't know the fear and they give to the world the best of theirself . all the person would try to give the best of
