according to my opinion it is better to specialize in one specific subject than having a broad knowledge of many subject because of the following reason . firstly , a person is exposed to different kind of subject in the elementary school to help him understand his interest . for example , i liked biology in my high school . so i chose to become a doctor . so , i concentrated more on biology so that it helped me when i started my graduate course in medicine . so , i had good knowledge about ` cell ' and ` reproduction ' than algebra or geometry . even though i had to study other subject , my idea about them wa just to improve my general knowledge and not to go in depth . secondly , i would like to mention that if a person speacializes in one particular subject , their is more room for growth and improvement . such a person will not be lost in the bundle of different variety of subject , he will not be confused in his approach to the subject . he might aswell do good research on the particular subject and write several book and conduct many seminar to share his knowledge . if a person is not a specialist in a particular subject , he may not be in a position to explore and invent new thing in any subject , a the saying go `` jack of all trade but master of none '' . eminent people world over are being recognised for thier meritorious work in a particular field and not for their work in different field . we all study to contribute something to the society god ha gifted every indivdual with some hidden talent in a psrticular field and we need to reconise them before it too late . concluding , i would like to say that `` it always better to be a lion in the jungle than an ant in a colony '' . i will always choose to specialize in one subject than have a braod knowledge of many academic subject .
