trying to guess what is waiting for u in twenty year is not an easy task and making an accurate forecast is almost impossible . nevertheless , we can try to analyse the current situation to guess what is to come in twenty year a far a car are concerned . during the last fifty year , there ha been a constant increase in the number of car , and when we consider the new market like the chinese one , with more than one billion people , we may think that yes , there will be more car in use in twenty year than there are today . nevertheless , other point are to be taken into consideration . the demand is increasing , but can we really supply that demand ? and more precisly , can we fuel all these car ? our fuel supply are slowly but inevitably decreasing , and price are getting higher and higher . this is why we will have to find new solution to be able to reach the demand . solutions are being developped , and with the fuel price rising , there are getting more competitive . some car are already powered by ` eco-fuel ' , made from plant like beet for instance . these new fuel are told to be le dangereous to the environment and are pretty efficient . obviously , they are only part of the solution and not the solution , but with this example , we see that alternative already exist . this is why i think that in twenty year , there will be more car than today . people want car and the technology is there to make sure will be able to get these . i actually believe that this is just an economical problem : when the fuel price will rise enough and corporation will see that they can make money with new technology , they will . as a conclusion , i would say that yes , there will be more car in use in the future thant there are today , nevertheless , these car might be really different than those we are using nowadays .
