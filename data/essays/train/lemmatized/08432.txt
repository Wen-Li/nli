this question ask about `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' i agree with this question because the understand idea and concept is more important than to know the fact . idea and concept have a lot of information . and it can learn and concrude the information to see the fact is more interesting than just find out the result . understand idea and concept are like a untouched diamond . untactched diamond rock is a lot of material in and not so beautiful , but people separate the material they do n't need to make pure diamond . this is the metafore that i use to discribe the `` understand idea and concepts. '' understand the idea and concept are very interesting than just to learn fact . why it become fun because i do myself to find a good result or fact it is very interesting for me to learn the way to finish . i can learn the process of solving the question . that is the good part of learning and understanding idea using the information . if you do this process you would understand how much fun to get a result with joy . learn fact are not a good idea . it like you face the question but you would get the answer right away . it is not fun just you get the answer and not the process . that is why learn the basic process to understand the way to answer is great . the process of get the result is good for student because if they learn the enjoyment of learning they would think hard and more concentrate . learn fact is not a good thing because i can only learn the sarface of the fact . if i understand idea and concept i could find a great information that hide in the sarface . in my conclusion is i agree the idea of the question . the first point is it would be fun to do the process in middle to get the fact . the second point is the student would learn about abustruct or hidden idea under the surface .
