i totally agree with the sentence . if you do not try new thing , you gain nothing even you suceed in getting what you want , a you have not gain any expirence in the process . columbia will not find america if he doe not dare to sail out to the strange sea neither will we know who he is now . we can only get real success if we do the thing in our own way not to follow others . this quality should be in everyone 's mind especially those doing business , if you do not dare to invest where can you get your gain ? it go the same in every thing , life is doing business , we should dare to invest smartly and only by doing so we can get the gain , the experience . this prove the saying no pain , no gain . people always like to follow the step of other people , without thinking if you are really suitable for it . a specific example the choosing the course in the university , you can do a survey and check to see that how my percent student choose their future according to their own liking , i think about only 10 % . most of the student follow the instruction given to them by their parent , they do not dare to disobey them even though the course they choose is not to their liking some might say that the adult or the people done before know what is right or wrong , the are experienced and know what is the best , it is true that they have the experience , however it is the experience of their not our own one , inorder to really learn thing we need to learn them the hard way , go facing the problem on our own , do not be a coward . another example of a successful person who suceed in what he is doing by trying is bill gates the world richest man . will he be rich if he doe not dare to introduce windows to the world ? i doubt so . if you want to be a successful a bill gates , dare to try .
