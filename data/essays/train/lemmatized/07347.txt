i generally agree with the statement . i want to stress that in my opinion succesful people is n't people that earn a lot of money or that is only on the show business . obviously most of sucessful people reach a better quality of life and it is generally well considered by others . let me state that two well known and sucessfull man are bill gates and einstein . the first is among the richest man in the world , the second i suppo wa n't so poor , but whom of the two did something usefull for all of u ? mr. gates leaded u to a standardization that make save a lot of time and the second enlarged our vision of the universe . did they take any risk ? i suppose that mr. gates spent a lot of time in his garage taking the risk to waste his money . the same for einstein that tooked the risk to be joked by collegues and to abandon his career . as a further more and quite obvious example : if primitive human did n't approach to the fire probabily i wa n't using this computer now to write . i agree with the statement because person i consider among the sucessful people are those whom do something that can be useful for others , and generally this cause what generally is called success . about to take risk rather than doing thing in the well and old fashioned way it 's really true that from a stationary situation nothing new can come out . for shure risk have to be evaluated in advance and an assesment of the real and current situation should be performed ; we are discussing around succesful people and not around crazy or mad people .
