i strongly agree with the fact that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communites . being a volunteer myself at the national university hospital for more than three year , i have sensed that the community doe need a lot of help from the general public . however , the young people involved in this project are extremely few . there are numerous reason for this phenomenon . the first reason would be a lack of interest . we face a great difficulty to recruit people every year . they are simply attracted to other booth that are considered more interesting , such a outdoor activities club , dance society and rock climbing club . these activity involve a lot of physical movement and help them to bond better with their friend . they have a golden chance to know more about people from their age and build firmer friendship via such activity . helping the community , on the other hand , usually requires the interaction with people outside the school . most of the time , they are from another age group . it is very difficult to get the young people interested or excited to talk with the elderly patient for two hour straight or to play with kid who hardly know any ` hot ' music or movie . young people believe that they could hardly gain anything out of helping the community . as a result , most of them are not interested . this also explains why ministry of education in singapore set compulsory hour of community service for the junior college student . if not , young people would not set time aside for such activity . secondly , time contraint usually hinders the young people to helping their community . young people nowadays are preoccupied with simply too many activity , such a school work , co-curriculum activity and other entertainment program . in singapore university , we have to attend lecture , laboratory , tutorial and seminar for almost 30 hour a week . during our spare time , we have numerous project meeting , assignment , essay and test to prepare and study for . in our mere free time , we tend to relax by chatting on msn , surfing the internet , playing computer game , watching movie or joining club activity such a bridge club , skating club , outdoor activity club etc . this simply leaf u little time to help the community . thirdly , young people , especially people from rich family , are not mature enough to face the reality in the community . grown up in a wealthy family who live in condominium or private house , young people do not see the other side of the society . they do not recognize the existence of people who work 14 hour a day and earn a meager income , who live on public pension of 200 dollar a month ( equivalent for the cost of their newly bought nike shoe ) , who live in a house without electricity and gas supply , who are sick but have no money to see a doctor and who are too weak to see the sun-rise on the next morning . helping their community provides too cruel a reality for them to accept . as a result , they opt to escape from facing them completely . in conclusion , it is my stand that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . this may be due to their lack of interest , time constraint or their intention to escape from the cruel reality .
