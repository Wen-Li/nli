i completely agree with this statement because idea can be adapted depending on the circumstance and this adaptability can evolve into a successful result that wa expected , so student can have the idea that if all circumstance are optimal , this result will be given . moreover , concept are also important because they are not orientated to specific detail of a situation , but to the general situation , so student can have a good aproximation of the result depending on the interaction of this circumstance . on the other hand , fact can be different depending on the circumstance . the result can vary and therefore it is difficultier to enclose a result . in addition , fact are disputable because they usually occur in system in which the interaction of different subsystem in that particular time brought that result . but it is possible that the same result can never be repeated again unless the same subsystem interact at the same time and in that precise moment . for example , wal-mart , one of the biggest retailers in the world , sell idea and concept to it client . these idea have been changing throughout time . sam walton , once a wharton student , stated that idea and concept can vary through time , but fact depend on each circumstance that can vary the result interacting with each other . the demand change constantly and the idea that once worked for this business are now useless . so student must learn the idea and concept that can vary through time and can produce different result other than fact that depend of the interaction of different subsystem . students will then be capable of directing those subsystem and managing them so a to get the desired result and be successful .
