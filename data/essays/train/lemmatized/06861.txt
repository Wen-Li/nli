i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . because young people can do many thing which they want . young people play many game which older people cant do . young people rome every where but older people cant because according to their age their stamen will be decreased . young people have much stamen to do everything . the thinking of young people go with the present generation which older person cant do . for example a young person know much about computer and new software . but older people they dont know and they dont need also . a young person can play game to be healthy but a older person , they have to do exercise to be healthy because they cant play all game against the youth . as a people go old , they behave vey matured . young person behaves a a child sometimes . young people can enjoy the new technology and new thing in the market . they can get all advantage and make easier all work . older person cant enjoy with that new technology or science because they have over come with many thing in their life . young people go to college , office , party where they can entertain themselves in many way . but older people cant . because they have already enjoyed their life . young people dont have any responsibilty and stress of family . older people have responsibility and stress with ahich they cant enjoy . they did n't get time after all responsibility to enjoy . and one thing what older people can do young people cant do . once in my life i struck in a position that i wa not able to solve that problem . that time my grand father handle with that problem and solved . it clearly tell that young people enjoy life when older people take care of them . young people walk with the present life , fashion , style . young people enjoy walking with the generation . older people are simple and make generetion to walk properly .
