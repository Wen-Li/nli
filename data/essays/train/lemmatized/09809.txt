advertisments are a good way to sell product . in fact , they can make product look much better than they realy are . therefore , they can make them look in different size and more beutiful . first , tricking customer eye is a realy good way to get more money . first , you can make your product smaller or bigger than it is just to make it in the desired look poeple want . for example , i remember a tv show that wa unnouncing to win a sport car if anyone ansewrs the quistion showed on the screen . however , the quistion wa so easy that i wa going to call them . i saw alot of people calling them ; in fact , the tv show got alot of money from the people calling it . a person won the sport car , finally , and he wa so happy . however , the funny thing is that the car wa a really small car . actually , it wa a kid car toy . therefore , they showed the car , and everyone thought that it wa a real car with a real engine , but that tricked everbody even me . i think that this a smart way for marketting product . second , advertisments make the producets look more nice and beutifull . in fact , they are using proffisional and careful worker who can handle the product without making any mistake that let the people notice any disadavtage of it . for instant , i saw a knife advertisment . the knife seemd so sharp . that wa just because of the careful worker . however , when i tried the knife in my home i broke it . in brief , advertisments make change the product size and making it more useful . i think that it is not a crime because company do not say any lie or show any different product . they are just giving adantages of their product ignoring disadvantage .
