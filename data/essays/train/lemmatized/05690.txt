i had just read a saying `` knowledge is the art of knowing things organisedly '' i strongly agree with this statement . a person may have a knowledge of many things , but only to a certain extent . but what is the use if he intends to specialize in a particular field . ??? in this case he will just struggle in all the fields . he will not have any thorough knowledge in a field . he will have a mis - match option as to what to chose as his main stream . consider a person who is well qualified for a particular training . similarly also consider a person who is just a person with wide knowledge with every field but no specializations . suppose if both attend a job interview , it would be a cake-walk decision to chose the peron with the right qualifiations for the right job . if a person in his childhood is questioned what his plan to do in the future was , his spontaneous answer would be a doctor , engineer so forth . but no one responds that they have plans to have wide knowledge in everything . i prefer that learning a subject which interests us most is definitely increasing our goals . specialising in a particular subject has its own advantages . we get to have a thorough knowledge and further work on the subject more keenly . but my idea is not to be a book worm !!!!! we should explore the world as if it is our own . but specialisation is also neccessary ! though a wide knowledge in all fields is also essential , specific goals also ought to be present within everyone .
