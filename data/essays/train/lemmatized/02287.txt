i agree with the satement that `` it is more important for student to undersatand idea and concept that it is for them to learn the fact '' because , a student can also learn easily if he undersatnd the idea and concept on the topic he is being learning . for example , let u take an example of two student who had attended a lecture in their school . the first student learn the topic and try to memorise the topic in the lecture class only whereas , the second student try to understand the lecture and put his own idea to learn the topic . after the few day the first student ha many chance to forget the lecture which ha been explained in the class whereas the second student doe not forget the lecture topic . secondly , if a student understands the idea and concept of the topic he can do well in implementing his own idea in his future whereas if a student try to learn he can not he might get through the present situation but will not be able pursuade in his future without the concept of understanding . a person can be success in his life only if he understand the topic which he is learning otherwise it is nothing but saving the data into maching which can not understand or don any thing without the help of others . thirdly , let u take an example of student who are goin to appear for a competitive test . in this the student who is understand the subject and get through the test and the student who had learn from the book will not able to succeed in the competitive exam . one should be through with the topic he is learning . thus , i agree and stand with satement since a person can be successful only if he understand the idea and concept otherwise it highly impossible to a person to successful in his life without basic idea .
