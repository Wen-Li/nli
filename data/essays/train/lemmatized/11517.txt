the concept and the idea that a person ha developed in a particular subject is a direct implication of the amount of profound knowledge that he ha acquired in that subject . in my view understanding the idea and the concept is more important for a student that to learn the fact . facts just act a the supporting information to the concept and the idea , but they do not play a major role in learning about the subject . in any major stream , the person who know the concept and who is capable of understanding the idea will have the leading voice . for example , in a software industry the fact are not at all considered . they just act a the background information for the work that should be done . the main thing that matter is the concept and the idea . furthermore , if we take any entrance exam or any academic examination the main emphasis is on the type of the idea that student is capable of generating for a particular problem . a minor importance is given to the fact . fact just support the idea and the concept . they act a the evidence only . for example , many of the scholar and the scientist had a firm believe in their concept and the idea and moved forward but they never considered the fact . only after they arrive at a conclusion about the study upon which they are working , then they co-relate this result with the fact . fact are not reliable . generally fact change when a new discovery ha been made . but the concept and the idea will not change . they are the building block of the subject . facts just support the concept and the idea . further , when a person ha a strong knowledge about the fact about a particular subject , which generally tend to change then he may not have a profound knowledge about the subject . the amount and the depth of the concept that an individual ha in any core subject is a basis on which his knowledge in the subject is measured . and also , a person who ha the keen and the depth knowledge is likely to get fruitful result than to a person whose main emphasis is on the fact . furthermore , in an elementary school and in the high when the student are at a tender age the main emphasis is upon the concept but not on the fact . facts are given minor importance there . in sum , i think that the idea and the concept play a major role for a student than when compared to the fact .
