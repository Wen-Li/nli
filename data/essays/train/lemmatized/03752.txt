i strongly believe that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion , the main cause for this being so is that that 's precisely the aim of advertisments . during the 20th century , the approach on selling product have shifted from believing that having a good product wa enough to sell it , to believing that aggresive marketing wa a must . this mean that nowadays company believe that having a good product is not enough , but that you must make the public aware of your product and convince it of how good your product actually is . but , why is n't enough to show a good product a it really is ? simply because such an approach would n't make most product stand out in the wide varierty of product now available . let 's look , for example , at washing machine 's soap : every company , from ariel to ala , claim their soap is tremendously better than any other competitor . or car manufacturer 's : every single brand state their car are the fastest and most secure car in the market . clearly , all of them ca n't be right . most of them must be making their product seem much better than they really are . another way of seeing that advertisments make product seem better than what they trully are is thinking about this : when wa the last time you heard an advertisment state any disadvantege to their product , any weak point ? i do n't think i ever did . but clearly , product have weak point and disadvantage . even if all good thing advertisments say about their product are true , those product are n't likely to be perfect , so by stating the good thing and hiding the not so good one , they are making their product look better than what it actually are . this can be understand if we keep in mind that advertisments aim at selling product , and so will do everything possible to convince customer of buying them , without attempting to provide an objective view . in conclusion , most advertisments make product look better than they really are , and this can be seen in the fact that most of them claim their product to be the best in the market and fail to mention any weak those product may have .
