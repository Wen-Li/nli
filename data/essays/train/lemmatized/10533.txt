during our last few school year , we are faced with choosing subject which we would like to specialise in , in the future . some student choose a small number , while others take almost a many a possible . the student with the more subject will be more skilled than the other , and will have better career opportunity later on . when one specialises in one specific subject , he or she can excel at it perfectly . this can benefit u in many way . for example , if a person is so good at something , he or she will be so skilled , and will be able to perform the task successfully and efficiently , saving time and energy . on the other hand , when specialising in only one particular subject , we are limiting ourselves and are unable to reach our full potential . having a broader knowledge of many academic subject is more useful than excelling in just one , a not only doe it give you more skill , it also increase your chance of success in the future . think about it logically ; would you rather employ someone who can only perform one task , than employ someone who can perform dozen ? i would choose the latter . studying a variation of subject also keep u more fulfilled , and le bored . if you studied the same subject over and over again , for a vast period of time , you would get extremely weary of the subject , and therefore would make it seem very uninteresting . you are given so many opportunity in this life , so what is the point of wasting them . you must always strive for the best and want to learn more . why limit yourself to just one thing ? although sometimes it is useful to excel at something , i disagree with the statement ` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
