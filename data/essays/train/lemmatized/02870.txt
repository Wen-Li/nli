nowadays , in our society , we have two important problem that make me agree with the statement given . the first of that problem is the pollution . human being are generating a lot of pollution , and one of the most polluting element is the car . many expert explain that problem like the climatic change and the problem with the atmosphere is cause by the smoke of car and factory , specially factory related wtih the production of fuel for the car . the second problem is that it is thought that energy source like petrol will disapear in few year becouse of his great demand , so maybe in few year there are not going to be car because of the fact that they do not have petrol , so they wil not able to work . on the other hand if someone could discover a new energy source , like for example the water , the second problem told before would disapear . instead of that i believe that in a few year some new invention will be discover , a new transport way will be designed and so the car will be an old fashioned transport . i think that something will be invented for two reason , the first one is that in the era we live now , the technology is in constant develope so the discovering of a new invention is only a question of time . the second reason is that becouse of the problem of pollution , if we want to preservate our enviroment it is neccesary the discover of a clean and safe tranports . in conclusion , i agree with the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than now , with the help of the technology we will apreciate this in few time .
