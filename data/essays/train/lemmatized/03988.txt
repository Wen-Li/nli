most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are to sell more thier product to consumer . however , i really disagree this becase of three reason : disappointment of costomer , destroying brand image , and decreasing company 's profit . first of all , it brings the disappointment of costomers . for example , let 's assume one woman buy a product thorough seeing advertisement . at first time , she is very happy to buying that product becasue it seems really great on the advertisement . however , she will regret buying the product soon becasue the product is not good a much a she expects . therefore , this costomer will never try to buy the same brand 's product . next , it destorys brand 's image . if one company keep advertising their product seem much better that they really are , we costomers will not buy them because we already know that the advertiments doe not tell the truth through our experience . becasue of this , the company 's brand image will be destroyed and need a lot of time to recover the image again . at last , it brings a severe loss to the company . maybe , at first time , the company want to sell thier product than other competitive company ' prducts by making product seem much better than they really are . however , the company will lose the costomers and costomers ' faith becasue the costomers really want to buy some product that seem a much a good they really are . because of these three reason , i really disagree making product seem much better that they really are . a false advertisement brings disappointment of costomer , destroying brand image , and decreasing company 's profit . altoought the company can sell it product than any other companise at the first time , the company will cost two or three time more than they do .
