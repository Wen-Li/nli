i agree with the statement that idea and concept are more important than learning fact . in the following paragraph i will try to defend my stand using various reason and argument . any learning process is useful only when it ha some real world application and make a significant contribution to the life and personality of the learner . just take an example of any engineering or science subject . you know that an induction motor produce electricity in such and such way , and that this type of combustion may give this result . but what is the use of these fact learned ? the learning is complete only when you see that motor installed anywhere and doing something that is very useful for the individual or community , like drawing water from a deep bore and when you go to any smelting unit and see the same combustion process being used to process metal and make alloy . so , we can say that to understand concept and idea is actually application based learning whereas learning fact is just theoratical learning . unless theoratical learning is complemented with application based learning , the entire learning process remains incomplete for an individual . this doe not apply only to science and technology subject . consider a student of dramatics , studying a subject , say `` shakspear 's plays '' . he can very well learn the entire plot and scene , story of any play , but how will that do any good to him ? only when he is able to understand the message and implication , like what is the emotional aspect of the play , why is a particular character behaving in a particular manner , what were the circumstance in writer 's life under which he wrote the play , that his learning can be said to be complete . so we can safely conclude that understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact .
