the evolution of humanity and society is a curio phenomenon and it is still in progress . i believe that one of the most important element of modern society is the division of labor . that is how humanity managed to evolve and advance . therefore , i strongly argue that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . in order to clarify and explain this thesis statement , this essay will first explain the advantage of division of labor and consequently focusing one particular area of concentration . then it will point out the drawback of studying on multiple academic subject . the division of labor mean basically that certain people will work or specialize in certain task or issue area . for example a normal city would have seperate police department , firefighting department and medical center . people who work in these different job would be trained accordingly . it is pretty much the same for the academic subject . a person who receives a proper medical education and training would not be the ideal candidate for a further education for education or architecture . secondly , in order to have broad knowledge on many different subject requires so much education and training that probably a period one lifetime would not be sufficient . there is also a very good chance that people will lack the reqired drive and enthusiasim or simply the interest to study and work hard in order to gain knowledge in various issue area . also people are generally good at certain thing . for example , i feel confident about my skill on social scinces . i like to read , listen and discus international relation . however , i have never been good at math no matter how hard i try . in other word , people like me may just lack the talent or the capacity to succeed in multiple and disparate area of academic subject . as a result of all the pittfalls mentioned above about the multi-disciplinarity and the obvious advantage of the specialization on one area of concentration i firmly believe that people should work on one subject and master it .
