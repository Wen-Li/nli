basically , i disagree the idea that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . for starter , there ha been a countinous increase in demand for car since car wa invented . because it is a very simple and effective mean to transport something or to move from place to place . and second , car have been evolved so fast . manufacture of the car ha been considered a a very lucrative business that many coporates are spending enormous amount of money on developing , manufaturing and launching the state-of-the-are car equipped with new feature . by doing that , they are making more consumer want their car and keeping people to spend thier money on car . and this business is going to stay lucrative for a long time . because like country in korea , govenment is also investing a lot of money on car manufaturers like hyundai since it wa one of the business that ha great effect on korean economy . plus , a population increase and a they get more affluent , they want nicer car . for some people , it is a mean of showing off thier wealth . they like to drive expensive car and enjoy the attention on them . and it will probably countinue to be like that for a long time . but there 's still a question ; `` how about fuel ? '' gasoline may disappear in the near future and we 're running out of fossil fuel . but alternative energy source will be invented also in the near future like hydrogen or solar energy , which is free from pollution . it is not the kind of thing will be changed in twenty year .
