for student , they should understand idea and concept in class for getting good mark on their test or some important exam , at the same time , they should learn fact in their life a well . actually it is not easy to tell which one is more important , a both of them are essential element in life . however , i prefer to choose learn more fact for the life , because you will not always stay at school a a student , but you will need to know fact for dealing with your life forever . nowadays , more and more parent want their child get higher education , a it not only help them to get a good job in the future , but also help them to know how to use proper way to deal with life problem . in china , student are learning so hard that sometimes they just can not get enough sleep . i will not say it is a wrong way to guide student , i just a kind of worrying about what is the student and their parent really want ? just understand idea and concept in textbook , and then get good mark ? no , they do n't . anyway , some example already make people think about this problem . a friend of mine told me a story about a tipically `` good '' student . ming is the best student in his school , and his parent , all his teacher and classmate are proud of him very much , a he always get near perfect on his test . .. it mean he understands idea and concept of textbook very well . once , he got like 96 % on a exam , and one of his friend beated him a 97 % , he wa so crazy about it that he hurt himself using a knife . i just can not believe that , can we say ming is a perfect student ? no , he is n't . he should know he can not always be the best one in the school , and he should accept fact that others will be better than him . another thing is he should learn to make good friend and share his talent and life experience with them . maybe you will say this example is extreamel , actually , when your parent and other people around you require you too much , you will feel so stressful and upset that you even can not do anything , at this time , you need to know more fact to face it , like how to deal with stress , how to stop people around you require you too much , and how to enjoy the life . for example , we should know one fact , which is a person living in a world , we should be educated for sure , on the other hand , we need keep our hobby , and share our joy with people we love a well . for me , school is not the most important thing , i would like to learn more fact in the life , that are more interesting !
