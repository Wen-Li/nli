i have experienced both travel in a group led by a tour guide and travel by myself . some poeple think that travel in group with tour guide is better than travel without a tour guide . while , others have opposite idea . i agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a gruop led by a tour guide . because this is the most safe way and enjoyable way for travel . the first reason that i agree this statement is because we all want to have a safe travel . it is dengulous that you do not really understant the culture or lendgrages where you travel . i read a news that some chinesses travel to malysia without leding by a tour guide , they have been sent to jail because they played ganbo in the hotel room . some thing are not be a problem in our own controy doe not mean that is no problem in others either . therefore , i think that having a tour guide is the most safe way for travel . another reason that i think that travel in a group is better idea is because we do not have to worry about : ha the hotel booking confirmed ? or where i can take bus for the place that i want to go ? all you have to do is just follow the tour guide . because of they ecperience , i believe that they know better than i do about the city that i visit . like where have good shippingmalls or restaruants . i like to follow the tour guide and listen to them explain the history of the city or other interesting story . this is also a advertage that you do not have by travel along . although there are some advertages of travel by along such a not time limite or no shchedule need to follow . however , the advertages of travel in a group are more obvious than travel along . in conculsion , travel by follow some one who ha experience is the best way for travel . expecially the place that you have never been . so than we can ttotally enjoy our vacation .
