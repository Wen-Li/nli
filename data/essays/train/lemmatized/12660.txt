cars have been a topic of concern to all of u . who doe n't own a car nowadays in the modern world . they serve a a mean of transportation , they 're fun to collect , ride and even take care of . so will they be there for u in the future ? everyone dream in at least one stage of his life being that of a kid , teenager or adut to own a car or drive a car . it seems that car are more of a culture than a just a vechile . personally , i 've been asked several time about my favourite car . in contrast , more people are tending to use car . it 's a fast method of transportation , faster than conventional method like bike . it is also personal which differentiates it from public transportation . it come in all size , color and shape and model , so it 's fun to collect and ride . all these factor combined may make it difficult for people to accept the idea of not using car and heading to other method of transportation . on the other end , there are also some factor that may have some influence on decreasing the number of car . more attention is being placed on the effect of car , especially when we mention all the pollution that it produce , be it aucostic or environmental and safety issue . some city ( one of them in turkey ) which i visited have rule against using car . it 's a small village of course but it 's really wonderful to live in a noise free , non-polluted environment where the only noise you can hear is horse carraiges , walking people and bike . today , lot of environmental restriction have been placed on car company to address pollution and help develop `` clean car '' , one example is in california where they have strict rule agianst pollution . safety is also a main concern and different measure are being applied to help develop `` safe car '' like the deployment of safety pillow , abs system and anti-slip system . in my opinion , the only way that car are going to be reduced in number is the invention of some new vehicle that can replace car ( small jet , like the one viewed in the jetson cartoon which i saw once . ) i think that the number of car will remain on in a steady increase a newer model are produced that minimize the con of such automobile which include the reduction of pollution emitted and that that address safety issue of the driver and pedastrians .
