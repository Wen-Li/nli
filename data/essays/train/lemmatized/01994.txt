a scene in which private car disappeared , instead many mini and high-tech bus run and roar on street seems like a complete science fiction ; but i believe this will come ture in twenty year , because too mush space is possesed by human , huge cloud of dust and polluted air hanging on the sky , and new way of transportation is needed . currently , a huge number of building are under construction in our tiny city . we already felt that grass and plant for u were scared . however , facing big profit of constructing a new building , people wo n't stop building until we are run out of space . and that day will come sometime in twenty year . since there is only scared space , le car will be on street because there is no room for them ! people will rather walk within short distance than drive car . it is also to avoid traffic jam . since public area is too limited , public transportation such a bus and subway will replace private owned car . with the growth of technology , bus in twenty year will be high-tech and of good quality . people will enjoy riding on bus more than we do today . choosing public transportation is also a way to save our endangering natural energy . most importantly , government will play a profound role in regulating the number of car . as i stated , there is le and le space and energy in our globe ; thus , government of country all over the world will take action to reduce the number of car . for example , increasing import tax can lead to a decline in car demand . also , government would award family for not driving car but taking bus to encourage others not to drive . those action may not benefit motor market , but will certainly help making a better environment . the global village is where everyone life and ha responsibility to protect . to make a better home for everyone , car will be sacrificed . thus , there will be le car .
