i would like to dicuss on the question if young people nowadays do n't help enough in their community . by thinking about this notion the question arises what is the communitie for the teenager today . is it their household , their family , is it the life at school or their position in the society ? all these setting changed like everything changed in the world . in the consequence of new aspect in their life and new influence which affect on them , a new realtion to all of the cummunities , which could exist for a teenager , is build . so you can not compare the attitude of helping in a community from nowadays with the situation 20 or more year ago . you could juxtapose the society and communties in realtion to the helping of teenager at this time . before around 40 year all people neede the community to stay alive . this dependence is one of the mainfacts why the attitude of teenager with helping in nower time is another one than 40 year ago . i agree with the position that they do not help a much a around 40 year ago but i 'm opposed with the statement that they do n't help enough . everybody will feel if they need to help more than now , but just now our the society is fed up with people who want to work and can not work because of the le job . anther point is the communitiy at home - the family . it could be that there 're a lot of child and teenager how do n't care about their family and the staff in it . i would not mention that the parent have the foult at this situation , the social sorrounding of their child influence them more than any other asepect . i 'm convinced that something have to change in this . but for reason already stated i would suggest that the development of the society is the reason for that . the teenager do n't need their parent anymore , or they think . because the reality show that those child who run away from their home , or those who doe n't care on their family they will not be succesfull in their future . they think they can use their time much better that spending time with their parent . all thing considered i would state that there is no problem with the realtion between the society , the state and the young teenager because at this time they are not used to work or give their power to the general society , but in realtion to their family i totally agree with the given statement . i is justified to say that there have to change anything to cope with the now situation . they have to realise that they need their pa
