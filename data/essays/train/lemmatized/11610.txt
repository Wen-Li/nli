although there is a good reason for advertising product , i believe that advertising make product seem better . three reason convince me that advertising is making product appear much better . firstly , with the development of new technology it is much easier today to adjust picture or film a you wish . flaws or even scratch can disappear by just a mouse click . the use of moderne software even help to make fat thing look slimmer , which you can see on picture that show leg wearing stocking . secondly , good looking thing sell better . the first reason for a company is to sell their product because they live on it and exist on it . therefore company are willing to do the best to let their product be the best even if it ; s only by appearance on a big screen or wallpaper hanging somewhere at the train station or elsewhere . a product that is not attractive to the customer will stay with the company . companies are using female and male model to support their product . they want to give u a feeling that if these model use this product we - the customer - can trust them becuase face and behavior in front of u can not be a lie . thirdly , company use movie to offer their product . when ever people switch on the televison they can not escape the comercials shown for hour and hour on the screen or at the cinema in your hometown and of course all over the world . by using this intensive propaganda technique customer are not save anymore . customers rarely find a niche to avoid advertisments and their apealing look . for this intensive attack on customer the company spend libarally amount of mony . they develop special movie to reach all customer around the globe . even in movie we find again the above mentioned method that model are use to support a specific item and it ; s advantage . so , many actor and actress make money by the way . customers like to identify themself with these movie star and this lead to an increase in selling . even if customer have n't tried such product before thy just rely on what thy are told or have seen . in summary , we only knew thing from tv or movie but we have great interst in buying it because we have seen it or believe an artifical picture
