i disagree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for i believe that the purpose of travelling is not just to have fun and relax with other people , but it can also be an opportunity for you to increase your own knowledge about a specific event that occured in the place in the past . thus , i think that the best way to travel is not always in a group , but it can also be in an individual or in couple , depending on why you have chosen to travel and what you want to gain from your trip . when i travelled to hiroshima last year with my sister , i wa convinced that travelling in a group is not always the best . the reason why i wanted to travel to hiroshioma in the first place wa that i wanted to learn more about the japanese history regarding it surrender during world war ii . the aim of the trip wa therefore not to have a fun , relaxing time being free from school work or anything , but it wa for me to increase my own knowledge about my own country . it wa meant to be serious . i decided to take my sister with me a i realized that she knew more about the specific event than i did . i expected that she would help me interpret the thing we would see in hiroshima , like the atomic-bombed dome . as a result of this trip , we both had a great time . i managed to learn a lot about the history japan ha gone through , and my sister also enjoyed guiding me in hiroshima . the way we did not take any of our freinds with u allowed me to concentrate on the aim i had for the trip . furthermore , we were given an opportunity to have deeper conversation than we had ever had , and we became closer than before . i can surely say that the trip would not have been a good a this if we travelled in a group . as it can be seen , it is totally possible to have a great trip even if you are not travelling in a group . how great the trip would become depends significantly on what you wish to gain from the trip . if being in a group is not the best way for you to fulfil your aim , then that might mean that travelling alone is better for you to fully enjoy your trip .
