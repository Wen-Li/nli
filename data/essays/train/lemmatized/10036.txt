being succesful person is the dream of nearly everyone . since we have started going to school , our family and our teacher advise u to be successful people and they show u many different tecniques for being successful . i believe that being succesful can not be done with the tecniques that people show u . i agree wit the idea that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . just a stared above , for me being succesful mean being innovative person . i believe repeating something that ha already done doe not make people successful . but of course for being a successful person should know what people have done before . for example a sociologist already know what other theorist have said . so it is so easy for a sociologist to repeat what other teorist have said in his article . but i think this is not a success . successful people should bring new idea and even sometimes should take risk and challenge the existing idea . without challenging existing idea or bringing new perspective a sociologist can not be a successful person . when we look at the history we see many name who originatd new idea . but nobody know the other name , only their name are known . it is obvious that , trying new idea always take some risk but do you think , we would be familiar with the einstein if he did not take that risk ? of course no , einstein wa perceived a a crazy man when he originated his famous theory but the time showed that he wa right and time proved that he wa a genious . of course he faced with many difficulty because of trying new idea and if he only applied the thing that he already knew , nobody would remember his name today . it is obvious that making the thing that you know very well is the easiest way . you can be happy by doing that , you can also be rich and famous for a short time however , this doe not make you successful . the key of being successful is producing new idea .
