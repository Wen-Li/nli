on the history of modern civilization the question of having broader or specialized knowledge ha produced many conflict . mostly , the question is evident in the academic realm that implact individual thinking . a very brief look at three era will help me to explain why i agree with having a general knowledge . the modern idea of having an universal kowledge , led to the creation of university and educational center where humanism , a well a other subject were part of a cult individual - for me this is a person with a broad knowledge . then , the classic thinking - a well a the constant socioeconomic change - brought the idea of being speciallized in order to compete in a work market . finally , the balance aroused from the interdisciplinary point of view that suggest the combination of subject for getting a better understanding of the society . in this context , i agree with the last one that promotes the idea of having a broader knowledge than a specialized one . even tough i accept not all of u are good in everything or have the ability of all field `` know-how '' , i sustain a tolerant person is one who move easily from one knowledge to another and who respect other subject ' complexity . i think this is fundamental for keeping our academy open to new idea and to academic a well a professional collaboration that can result from interdisciplinary view .
