i am not such kind of people who have many chaces to travel , but i do experienced some trip hitheto . sometimes i made my excursion by myself alone , sometimes with my friend and sometimes , of course , joined a group led by a tour guide . comparing all these way , i should say that to travel in a group led by a tour guide is not the best way . it is true that being led by a tour guide doe ha some merit . for example , that will be safer and we can get more introduction and imformation from the guide in the trip . but for me , i think the significant thing in a trip is the freedom and pleasure . why do n't we just stay in a library to seek the intorduction more derectly and excatly ? the reason why i choose to travel is to get rid of all the unhappy thing in my daily life , trying a new surrounding , enjoying the ladescape , thinking nothing just being relaxed . without a guide , i can go any place i want to go , not only walking along the route decided by someone . that should be moring interesting and exciting . and also , i think the fee of a trip is another reason . it will be more expensive to get a tour guide . i wourd rather pay my money on some other thing than on a tour guide . so , next time i plan to have a travel , i wo n't adopt the way of having a tour guide . maybe just myself , maybe with my good friend , the point is the same , just go my or our own rout , enjoying the fexible and exiting trip .
