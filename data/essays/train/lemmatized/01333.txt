i completely agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . after all , if all of u continue to do what we currently do , and are good at , the human race will never evolve . innovation ha been one of the key strength of human . some of the most important recent development have taken place because a few people decided to try out something new , something that wa hard to imagine before it actually happened . whether it wa the telephone or the aeroplane , it wa all because of people who wanted to try out new thing . mankind could make it to the moon only because one individual , of the name neil armstrong wa ready to try out something that wa never tried out before , even if it meant risking his life in the process . even in the acient time , mankind discovered fire only because there were certain people decided to try out something new , even if it meant taking a huge risk . ordinary people like to do what they are good at . they are content with the idea that they are trying to get better at something . however , the real succesful people are the one who try out newer thing and take risk , and hence , contribute to the evolution and betterment of the society . if we continue to pursue what we have been doing , our life would become monotonous . trying out new thing and taking risk give u the excitement and the zeal which propels our learning . we look forward to coming across newer expiriences , which teach u more and more , and give u idea to make our life better . we live in a competitive world and a key to success is to try out newer idea and take risk - to find out newer method and idea of improving your life . in order to develop a individual , we need to think out of the box - challenge our imagination to come up with idea which have never been tried before , idea which give u a significant edge over others . if you think you have something new to try out , it follows that you would have to risk a lot to make sure that it work .
