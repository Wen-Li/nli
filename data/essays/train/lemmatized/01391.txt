everybody ha it own point of view on a certain issue and it not neccessary that the my point of view may corrobarate with other or say in accord with other . coming to this particular topic of weather it better to have a broad academic knowledge on many subject rather han specialization on one , i personally feel that keeping in mind the present global scenario and growing competition it better to have a broad knowledge in many ascpects rather than to limit yourself to one particular field . why i think so is that , it give you the cutting edge over the others to survive in this otherwise predatory competition . by having broader knowledge you are not limited to one field only . lets understand this by an example , suppose iam a laboratory technician and in addition to that i have a basic knowledge to handle the account and also to manage a office , this not only addes to my profile but also give me an extra confidence to work in different work condition if iam imposed to them . ( here i have an standout advantage over a only laboratory technician . ) not only this it can be a source of some extra income which is very neccessary keeping in point of view the rising price of commodity around the world . this can be understood by again looking into the example explained above , suppose i get from the laboratory early during the working day i might take some tutions of account a iam well verse with it also , this could add extra income to my pocket , doe n't it feel great . i am sure it feel so . and lastly but most importantly it give you a sense of secured future in a way that you are not limited to a particular field , if you are not satisfied with your current job environment you can easliy switch on to the other a you are not limited to a particular proficiency . you can also change job when you feel ennui because of the same stereotyped work . so i would rather advocate to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . my idea looking to present secnario is `` it 's better to be jack of all trades rather than master of none .
