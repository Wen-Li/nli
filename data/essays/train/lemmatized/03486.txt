when considering this issue , some people agree that it is better to specialize in one specific subject while others seem to agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . as to me , i agree to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . currently , in this democratic and economic-free world , we need people with variable ability no matter where they belog . people who are used to working alone may be disliked because every work seems to be created by `` coporation '' in today 's society . `` coporation '' mean respecful and multi-cultural . only through it may human being create a better consequece of their work . therefore , it is not the matter how much quantity one can contribute to the group but quality one can produce by his own , even that a little bit but precious knowledge , which suddenly occurs to his brain , may come to a significant key to success . i remembered one time we classmate had a huge project to be done , something related to `` fantasy literature . '' we were terribly nervous about that presentation because finally we decided to talk about the great volume , `` the ring of the king . '' we spent a week for preparation from searching to powerpoint . actually , only two of u had finished the three book , and others just `` tried '' to understand some episode . however , we did make effort to use variable angle to do analysis , especially when we began other related book reading . so , when the day of the presentation wa coming , we group not only had full preparation about the main top but also some material developed by our extra reading stuff . through this experiece , i realize that it is not matter how much you have learned but what more you can possibly give out , which is being developed and potentially erupted by individual effort . therefore , in my opinion , i think it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
