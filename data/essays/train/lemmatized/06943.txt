sometimes we can see the article from newspaper , in which the successful company or person is introduced . they always develop their company or themselves through finding new item or new trait . moreover , we know they take risk whenever they try to new thing . so i agree , successful people or company try new thing and take risk rather than doing just one item . at first , i would like introduce my professor . she wa originally a high school english teacher . in my country , korea , the teacher is the best job to woman . it gurantees good salary and reputition . furthermonre , the teacher can take a rest for a vacation and get many education program about music , exercise , because these field are necessary for the teacher to teach their student in many way . but she decided to be a professor . as many people know , people who want to be a professor require a doctor degree in univ. and it take about 5 or 6 year to finish . anyway she determined to study abroad and to be a professor even though she could n't take care of her child in korea . i think it would the hard decision to her . but she finish whole course perfectly , and then she became the professor . i think she is successful person because she succeeded her dream thanks to trying new thing . the samsung , an international company , is another example . samsung wa a small company until some decade . at that time , samsung had only few item that it can afford . but the chief always looked around to search what make his company bigger . he representatively found the field of a cell phone . and he start to study that part even though he had many risk . eventually , he succeed and made his company a international one . these two show u how important trying new thing and taking risk . i think unless they started someting under the unstable situation and conducted what they thought , these success were impossible . in conclusion , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk .
