i agree with the statement . in my opinion it is common knowledge that advertisement make product seem better than they really are . for verifying the statement you just have to think about what advertising is for . what is the sense in advertisement ? this can be answered quite clearly : companies use advertising to sell more of their product . consulting a psychologist or taking survey is quite common nowadays for understanding what the costumer want or expects from a product . companies try to fullfill these expectation or at least pretend to do so . they know what the costumer want to see or have and they are more than willing to give it to him . so , actually , advertising is mostly about illusion and psychological trick . the colour , the music , the script of a tv spot . .. everything wa set up before . even the colour or the shape of the product itself . advertisements are often so exaggerated , that it really becomes hard to believe , e.g. whine stain on a white carpet which dissapear within 10 second . these are high standard being raised ! one might say that it 's the quality of a product that count , but how often do costumer actually buy a product , because they had seen it earlier on tv or in the newspaper and `` just want to try it '' ? i guess it happened to everybody at least once or twice . some were dissapointed with the result , when the product is not at all a it wa announcend in the medium . no matter if it 's the quality of clothes , the taste of some new ice cream or the sound of a new cd . often , the product ca n't reach the standard raised in the medium . of course , if you want people to buy your product on a regular basis you have to add some quality . it justifies the higher price and can convince the costumer of your product . but , nevertheless , it is extremely important for people to make themselves clear that advertisement do n't show reality , but are trying to persuade them to buy a certain product .
