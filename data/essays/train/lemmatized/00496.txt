there are alot of way to advertisment the product for example the company can do it in tv , newspeaper and radio these are the most important mediea in this time . the most imporatant qusation is it is really the product look the same on tv or in news peaper or in the radio . i think some ad show the product for people oppisite of what they are for two reason first they shoe all good stuuf in the product and they dont mention the bad thing and secound some time they used some lie to sell their product . in the most ad the dont mention the bad thing in the product they just show to the people how is it in a good way . some of the statistic said that in 2002 there wa alot of ad that show to the people the good thing in the product and they forgot or they dont mention about the bad thing and the descovered that the bad thing in the product are more than the good thing . some of the ad use some lie so they can sell thier product for example they ask some people in the street about the product which is they are trying to sell and they but this conversation in the ad and before the make the conversation they deal with the person who is going to speak about the product or mabye this person working to the company . also we dont have to forget the people and how the ad effected them and who they have to dominate thier mind about thinking more than one time pefore they take thier disagion . so some time they used some trick so they can sell thier product in tv . the people who watch the tv alot some time they watch the ad and say it might be a good product . they started to ordered after the ad dirictlly and they dont asked about the company if it is famous or not and some of them beileve all the ad even if someone said to them this ad make the product seem much better than they really are . indeed some of the product seem much beteer than the really are by showing the good thing in the product and ignor the bad thing and they are using some lie to help them so they can sell thier product .
