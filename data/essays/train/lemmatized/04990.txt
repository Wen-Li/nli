i agree to the statemenyt that the in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the eveidnece , limited resource problem , new resnportation would support my idea . to start with , we are having limited resource . all car are generated by traditional resource , such a fuel and gas , however these resource are scarced , which mean there is limittation . as the resource is limited and also depleate , the resource price will go up gradually , and cause people unable to maintain their car or unwilling to buy a car . therefore there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year , becasue there is not aboundant of resource left to generate the car . lastly , the development of new transportation will contributes to idea that fewer car in use in future compare to present . the industry of create the new transportation is going on nowadays . it is said that there would be time that each person ha a plane of their own . in twenty year it would be possible to see indiviuals have own plane , since there is a investigation going on . as the technoldge developes , the new indiviual transportation made and would result the fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . in the conclusion , i strongly agree the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are toay . the idea i illustrate would lead me to support the stament .
