in the present day situation , car are not a `` luxury '' item , they 're a necessity . every place , whether it be household , or in factory , etc. transportation is incomplete without fourwheelers . looking specifically to car , or technically `` light motorised , four wheeled vehicle '' , one cant really expect there number to sink , at least for sure within 20 year . one of the practical reason is that the road that carry the current capacity of car , are already there and functional . if the number of car will reduce , then the traffic level will go down , and one of the biggest disincentive that prevents a person to buy car ( the congestion on road ) will also die down . so if the car number will go down , it will in itself , motivate people to buy new car . a nice alternative to using car is using the subway system , or the railroad , or airway , or bus . but still , one cant make a subway station everywhere in the city , or a run separate train between every two pair of station . although for long distance , people might opt for subway or rail , but the `` number of car '' will not decrease , because some time you may need to do extensive shopping , receive your kin from different point in city , move to various location in the city or out the city where there is no rail connectivity , or no station , the travel plan can change suddenly , with no prior notice . all mass transit system have a schedule , they arrive and depart in fixed manner , but urgent situation dont . so people might prefer to use mass transport facility in daily life , the density of traffic may reduce , but the `` number of car in use '' wont decrease . neither can one expect such a huge development in mass transport system to come within 20 year , and continue thereon . one may say that fuel used in car can get changed . it is said that petroleum reserve will get over within 100 year ( too long !! ) . however , hydrogen powered cell to run car on electricity is a concept that wont let car stagnate due to nonavailability of petroleum based fuel . they can be said to be not secure owing to road accident , but accident , to point out , is driver fault and not the vehicle 's . also , accident can happen in any vehicle , but in car you can have seat belt , air bag and all sort of safety device not possible in other vehicle . if earning is said to give financial independence , then car can be said to give transit independence . you need not ask anyone , you need not worry where to go , when to go , how long to stop at any place , and your driving safely confirms the safe transit of other person in the car . although bike can be an alternative a a transportation medium , but it mainly a 2 seater . .. and no more , and you cant afford to carry various luggage .
