i think it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . indeed , it is important not to focus on only one aspect of thing and life . the world around u is made with plenty of different thing that one should be familiar with . having a large scale of knowledge allows u to understand almost everything that happens in our society , and therefore we do n't have to rely on others ' knowledge in order to make our own opinion . there are many different way of seeing thing and event . if we are able to watch thing only from one point of view , we might miss the most important . for example , when you listen to a politician you might have some economical knowledge and thus understand part of his speech . thus , if what he say is economically accurate you will tend to agree with him . but if instead you have law knowledge you might understand it a totally different way and if what he say is not accurate in a law point of view , you will totally disagree with him . on the other hand , if you have knowledge both in law and in economy , you will be able to take the speech a a whole and to make a balance between law and economic interest . then your opinion seems to me more valuable to me . on a more practical point of view , i think that , in today society , we must be able to adapt to very different situation . for example i will certainly have to change of job several time . if i am very specialized in one specific subject , i wo n't have a large scale of possibility . thus , the larger the scale of my knowledge , the more chance i will have to find a job that suit me . in addition , employer now ask to their employee to be able to adapt to different situation and to be able to manage very different issue . therefore they need to have broad knowledge of difffent subject . but on the other hand , i am conscious that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject should n't lead to have only superficial knowledge . it is also important to be able to go depper into a specific subject . but i am of the opinion that if you are able to understand a large scale of subject , it will then be easier to focus more specifically on one , being able to understand all the implication the subject can bring , not being trap in a narrow way of seeing thing .
