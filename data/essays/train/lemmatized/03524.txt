i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the advantage is that when going on a trip , you are not familiar with the place , so being led by a tour guide is better than going around the place by yourself and getting lost . the disadvantage is that you ca n't choose which place to go to , you also have to wake up very early and get prepared for the journey you are having that day . last year , i went to guilin , which is in china . my family hired a tour guide . i remember that we had to wake up at 7am and had to be ready by 7:30am . we went around the city and my leg were very sore by the time we returned to the hotel . the tour guide wa not really friendly and my family wa not pleased with her . we also had to go in a group , which wa not such a pleasant experience . there wa another family who wa always late for arrival . and everybody wa displeased with them . another experience wa that a few year ago in malaysia , my mother also hired a tour guide . the tour guide wa very greedy and not very polite . on another trip to bangkok , we did not hire a tour guide and we went around bangkok by ourselves . i think that my family and i had a much more delightful holiday and we had a lot of fun there . in my opinion , i think that hiring a tour guide is not a good a going around by yourself . though you may not know the place very well , you can always ask the local people who live there , i am sure at least one of them is willing to tell you the direction of the place . tour guide may not be very professional and their manner may not be that polite . so i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
