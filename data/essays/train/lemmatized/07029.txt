the idea that people who take risk have more opportunity to succed rather than people who do n't , is a concept that is gaining more and more attention in modern society . in most of the case , people who experiment wiht new thing can prduce a massive effect in society , creatting a whole new paradigm . this idea can help u not only to apreaciate the individual talent of some mebers of a group , but it also can be understand a a synonim of progress . nowadays , there are many example that reflects how succesfull people usually take more risk . in the last three edditions of `` harvard bussines review '' , the main article defined inovation and intuition a a synonim of succes . they also pointed a big list of bussines men who were able to reinvented their own companmies , trying different thing and avoiding `` what they allready now how to do well '' . althoug for many people this can be a safe way to run a bussines , i belive that if a company or organization is not able to push it own limit and see what others ca n't see , the pressure of the model will make it dissapear . another example that reflects the succes of people or entity who try new thing is the case of amazon . com . this company basically offer a frienly paltafform to have acces to service online . althouhg it look very simple , amazon wa able to fill and space that wa empty : sell product online . at the begining this plan wa considered unprofitable and maby too `` crazy '' , but soon they became one the most profitable company of the world , and they still remain a the most visited website since the internet appeared . in conclusion , i belive that inovative people who take risk and try new thing can deffinitly have more oportunities to succed , but what is more important , the can push the limit of society helping u to find a new way to progress .
