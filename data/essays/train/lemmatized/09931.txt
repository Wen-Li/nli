well , my openion about this subject is that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . and it not just about time that they dont have , it that they dont have the `` will '' , a they say `` if there is a `` will '' there is a `` must '' '' . nowadays young people that are between 15-25 their mind are only settled on playing a a major idea , then studying a a second , and ofcourse beign a center of attraction in any king of subject . in soccer for example , at our school student especially age between 15 and 18 , they do their best just to achive there goal of eighther being the centre of attraction , or that he hate the other team or a player in the other team . and some student like to be the `` the fashion boy '' , that he wear every new brand that ha come down , eigther it nice or bad , `` its fashion '' , also a old men the say `` tailor do not make men '' . well let say 10 % of these young people alittle bit of time to help their community by working hard and studying in order to achive a goal . to put a goal in your life , in the future of your own , your your family , is the main idea of life . putting a goal in your life will lead you to the best , and whatever right you do , you will have confidence in your self , and what you do now will reflect the life of your family ( kid and wife ) , a my father always say : the more you do , the more you get . well ill talk about my self and goal in that limited life in just a few word , my goal im this life is to be the best architect in the world ( well thats what i say , atleast in town ) , and thats my last year in school , and im trying my best to get hight mark inorder to go to the university that i want , and have a nice and happy life .
