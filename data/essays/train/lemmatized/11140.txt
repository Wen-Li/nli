specialization versus generalized knowledge the question of specializing in one particular topic or becoming a all-rounder with a broad knowledge confronts every student in his beginning of academic career . it is difficult to give a clear-cut answer and again the buzzword `` everything depends on the context '' seems to apply here . there are certain profession which are dealt better with specilization in a very particular topic rather than having general knowledge . someone who would like to become a dentist doe not need to distract himself in other `` superfluous '' topic . on the other hand , the world is becoming more complext and many cross-cutting issue can be only covered by a broad range of knowledge . just to give an example : the question of legal property of genetically modified gene is something that can not be answered soley from a biological point of view . it requires a more holistic approach by including ethic , law , politics or environmental science . personnally i could benefit from a large scope of academic topic ranging from economics , history to sociology and law . all these course helped me become a `` swiss armyknife '' enabling me to understand and deal with various issue in professional life . this question of specialization versus generalized knowledge is a personal choice and my personnal positive experience with the latter doe not necessarily apply to others . let u also bear in mind that this question doe not stop at the academic level but also continue in professional life . if one ha specialized himself in one academic topic it is never too late to broaden himself up in the professional world and vice versa .
