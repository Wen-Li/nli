people go through different stage through out their life span , starting from childhood , teenage , maturity and then getting old ! for the past 23 year ive been hearing different comment from different age starting ; `` i cant wait to grow old '' to `` how i miss my old day . '' the question now is when exactly is the most enjoyable period in our life time ? `` younger people enjoy life more than older people do . '' lets focus now on young people and what they do . young people start their life starting childhood living with their parent having the support they need , having the time to play and enjoy every moment with their friend and family , not to mention that they have no responsabilities . if we put in mind that teenager are considered young , i believe that the only difference between a child and an 18 year old girl will be the same only putting into consideration that responsability will be more obvious but only in-terms of study while on the other hand they still got the time to have fun with both friend and family and having the time to travel across country and visit new place . as for older people , starting the maturity stage which is after graduating , at that time although responsabilities start increasing rapidly , on the other hand new factor are being added to the equation which add to it the sence of excitment . to illustrate my point ; a we grow older and start getting into the real world , this is where we start making a family , meeting our spouse and creating a foundation of ours . the idea of providing the support to our family and creating this opportunity to our child to have fun just a we did , is enjoyable in one way or the other . we all know that achieving this is challenging and in my own opinion the sence of challenge is fun ! moving on to an older age , if we managed to accomplish the foundation that we were working on , we will be able to feel the sence of achievment by also creating support to our childrent ( who are now matures ) creating for them the support they need to build their own foundation . life a a whole is enjoyable , if we tend to take it from it dark side and it difficulty starting our first day at school it will never be enjoyable , but a for me i believe that when we are young we enjoy the idea of having free time , no responsabilities and at the same time creating our life time plan , which is if we manage to accomplish one day we will be forever happy . in conclusion the time which is more challenging to u is more fun and thats why i disagree with the statement .
