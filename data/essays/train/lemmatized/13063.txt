i disagree with statement . in my opinion the best way to travel is alone or in a small group of people that have approximately the same degree of knowledge of the region . there are several reason for my belief . first of all , a tour guide will protect the traveller from most interaction with and exposure to the local inhabitant by organising transportation , accomodation , food etc . this is , of course , convenient and efficient but it often mean that the traveller will not use the local language nor will he encounter local custom of communication and everyday life . thus , he miss out on many new experience and cultural insight . for example , when a friend and i were travelling in turkey on our own , we had to learn a couple of turkish phrase in order to communicate with local peasant , and the priceless reward wa that we were invited to stay with the family for a couple of day and experience how life in rural turkey really is like . this would not happen when travelling with a tour guide , using prearranged facility and no need to talk to the local people . second , a tour guide will have specific idea on what to show and what to hide of a country . the traveller will only see what is esteemed a cultural highlight , or entertaining , and he will follow the footstep of many tourist before him . if he travel on his own , he ha the chance to leave the usual path and discover the new environment on his own . he is likely to encounter nice a well a unpleasant thing but his picture of the local culture will be more balanced and more complete . similarly , travelling without a guide might be le effective in term of `` visited sights/day '' but it will be a more thorough and individual experience . when travelling with a guide one face the danger of falling into a passive , consuming position where prepared piece of information are delivered . in summary , travelling alone mean active involvement , challenge and individual experience a opposed to the convenience and superficial screening of tourist attraction provided by most guided tour . it depends on the preference of the traveller which form of exploring a new region he chooses but i believe that without a guide the experience is much richer .
