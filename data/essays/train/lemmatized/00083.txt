some people say that in order to be successful you must `` try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what you already know how to do well '' . personnally , i do not agree with this statement . i am going to give you two reason why you should do only what you already know so a to be successful . first let 's define ` success ' . in my opinion , the ` successful ' characteristic should be given to someone who is good at what he 's doing and even better than others . in this context , we must admit that the only reason for success is training . in fact , training lead to success . but what exactly is training ? actually training is all about doing what you already know over and over again . let 's take the example of sport . in every sport , you spend the main part of your time training in order to be successful at the next competition . therefore , this is exactly the same idea in everyday 's life business . another example is the success of fordism , back in it time . here , people were meant to perform the same task over and over again which lead to an improvement in industry . firms which used fordism are now known to have been successful . another idea of the statement is that if you want to be successful , you must take risk . actually , this is completely wrong and the reason is simple : if you take no risk , you are le subject to failure . and knowing that failure are the exact opposite of success , you should take this advice : if you want to succeed , never take risk . instead , you can let others taking risk and watch their result . this way , you will see if it is a safe and efficient way to do the thing . finally , success can be achieved using two motos : `` only do what you already know '' and `` never take any risk '' . look at how sport champion prepare their competition : they train a lot whithout taking any risk . then you will succeed like a real champion .
