i totally disagree we a the youth give our time to help out the communitiey . well people might seem like they do n't care but they do novadays people think that caring and feeling strongly about something is a sing of weakness well i beg to differ . there are ton of great example of how the young people misbehave but remember although they might be young they are referred to a ` people ' therefore they should be threated a such . as you might remember just a couple of year ago there wa this huge concert held in couple of diffrent place called ` live 8 ' just just like angel from above these thousand of selfless youngster came from all around the world not to see their favourite singer , band and etc. to perform but to give the le fortunate one another chance to ` make poverty history ' what day said . that is a perfect example of how much young people care about their surroundings . i for an example do charity on a regular basis for example not because i want to but because i should i sometimes go out with le pretty girl it doesnt make me more popular but it help girl feel confident of them self . now if that is not caring and helping i do n't know what is . once a great man said ` we are the world we are the child ' a much a i dispise the man who said it i have to agree child are our future and if people have problem with the way they behave remember it 's becasue of how your generation effected our 's . to sum up young people know are a caring to their surroundings a you are because thats what they learned from you and that is exactly how you learned from your father and mother . but we will break the chain thus once againg prooving my point that we are infact caring and helping .
