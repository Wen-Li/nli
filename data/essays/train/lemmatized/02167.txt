i agree that most advertisement made product seem much better than they realy are for many reason . first , they made a style that acceptable from customurs by puting thier product in a good shap to attract people to buy it . for example , i will buy any product if it is not having a good shape . also , the must know what people love in thier product and do that so they can write that thier product contain some material which dose n't exist . for instance , i love natural material in my product not chemical one so they write on thier product that it contains only natural product and that is not true . besids , most advertisement love to gain much money even if thier product would n't allow them to . they get a cheap material for thier product and say it had good one to gain more money . for example , i used to buy a product for my child and suddenly he fall illness so the doctor do not allow me to this product for him again . in sum every thing know a day is not a good a it appears .
