the number of the car increase everyday . people who do not have car buy car . this will be controversial situation in future , the number of car in twenty year will increase or not . too much car will cause traffic problem , people will not go their job on their time . in my opinion , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today by the improvement in new transportation system . in future , the underground transportation system is going to improve , a the construction technology is improving . it is going to be easier to build new tunnel for the subway in every part of the city . the number of the subway station will increase in future . as a result , people can travel easily around the city . for example , in one station there will be five or more line , which will have different direction . in city , people prefer to use subway without having park problem , traffic jam , tax . also , the resource of petreloum is decreasing everyday , so price are increasing and car become expensive transportation vehicle . second reason for not using the car is going to be the scooter . as the improvement made in the electricity engine are applied on the scooter . for example , the segate scooter wa started to sell in market and people interested in . in twenty year people will be using scooter instead of car . third tranportation vehicle is plane which cause in the fall of the car in twenty year . as the technology is improving , in future the airplane will be cheap , easy to fly and small . so , people can buy airplane . for eaxmples , airplane will take off from the roof of house and land on where the people go . also , airplane will be much more fast than car . as a result people will travel quickly . to sum up , in future there will be alternative to transportation with car . so , people will prefer new tranportation system which cause a decline on the number of car in twenty year .
