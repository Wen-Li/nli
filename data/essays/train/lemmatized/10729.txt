from my own experience , i will have to agree with the idea that older people enjoy life more than younger people do for different reason such a money , time independance , previous life experience and even wisdom . people usually say that money can not buy happiness , but i say that money can certanly help a lot . older people usually have paying job that allow them to safe money through life , money that a young person can not easily obtain . one can use money to buy ticket to music concert , to go to expensive restaurant or even to travel all around the world . these activity enhance the experience of life . time is another good reasong why old people enjoy life more than young people , because when young , someone ha activity that can not be avoided . for example , a kid can not choose to go or not to go to school , the parent do . time is an asset that only old people have lot of . older people can engage in activity such a art , traveling , cooking and studing because they do not depend of a school or work schedule to live their live by . old people also have more experience , a quality that i personally believe that increase the possibility to enjoy life . for example , if a young man travel to paris , he will see thing in a way that may differ from the perspective of an old man . the young man will probably see only an old city full of old bouilding and museum , but under the experience eye of an old man , paris is full of art , culture and history . the old man will enjoy more the trip beacuse his year of experience . finally , wisdow may not apper to be a good reason to support that older people enjoy life more than others , but i think that wisdow can help a person to take the right decision in life , this will contribute to a more rich life experience .
