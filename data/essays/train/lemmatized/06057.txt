in school we are been though to understand idea and concept but there are some student who lean the fact and take it the easy way out . most of the school teach how it is done and why but there are some exception where school teach to learn by heart . firstly , these school just make them know that this is the information and they are suppose to learn it . so such sitautions just make the student remember the fact and not know what it mean and why is it like that . the student should be tought the reason of the subject and they should understand . by this if for example , someone come up and asks the student do they know the meaning of this or why it is like this , they all should be able to reply them back instead of saying no it just suppose to be that way . secondly , by learning the fact when the student is young it help them a they grow up . there are some thing which have to be know a fact and not have mean to it . when they learn the teachnice to learn the fact when they are some , a they grow up the learning process increase and they can then learn fact aswell know the concept and understand the idea . overall , i feel that the it is important for student to understand idea and concept aswell a learn the fact . so by this the student will experience both and gain more information , which shall benfit later on in higher study or after study .
