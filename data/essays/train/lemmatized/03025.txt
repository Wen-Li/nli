the difference between young people and old people is that older people have already done what young people are out looking for to do . this doe not mean that every older person ha done it or that every young person is out to do it , it just mean that people are different at different age . young people for example teenager are mostly going to high school and getting ready to go to college . the reason teen look forward to college is because in college they get to meet new people and get to learn alot more in detail the subject they most enjoy . also in college they get to move out of home and have alot more freedom than they would have at home . but some young people at this point in life are learning to take responsabilities and that sometimes is a hard task to learn when they have not really been brought up with it . what young people are out looking for is traveling , boyfriends/girlfriends , school , party , money and maybe even once in a while parent . if we look at it from this point of you most loder people have already lived their life to the fullest . they have had child and are probably about to have frandchilderen . maybe to young poeple that is not exciting but to older people im sure that is the best time of their life , just because they have seen and experienced it all . this question is so generalised that there are so many different point of view , but this is just one . also we have to keep in mind that young people have problem a well a older people . for example sickness or familly probelms to both young and older people .
