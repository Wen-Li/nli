it may be plausible to claim that one should aim to specialize in and obtain a better knowledge of one specific subject , rather than to gain broad and shallow understanding of many subject . the strength of each person varies in different area of study , and people tend to choose their career according to their strength . it seems unnecessary to obtain knowledge that is unrelated to their job . a painter would perform better at artistic expression than mathematics , and for him , it seems to serve little purpose in pursuing to study mathematics , a it is unrelevant to his work . opposite can be said about others - scientist , for example . it seems useless for them to have knowledge of , for example , the orgin of opera or movie . it is much more approriate when a person focus in the specific subject which their job are related to . it also appears that people often find it easier to improve their understanding of a particular subject if they are interested and feel passionate about it . it is probably much more efficient learning when one learns about his or her prefered subject thann others . while having broad knowledge surely open up a person 's perspective in life , it seems more efficient and appropriate to focus in particular subject and to improve the stregnth of each individual .
