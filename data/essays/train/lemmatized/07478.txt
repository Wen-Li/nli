i am agree , but ! ... if we have to be very optimistics , because you never know what is gona happen with the war and the growing of the radicalism in the world . also we have to take a look to the audience who can demand this kind of product . everything , is so complex if we see the petrol market , thousands , of people , are die every month directly or not directly because this problem , so . .. of course the first world is asking for the development of new industry in this field of the consume ( car ) and this also , demand a lot of petrol and a lot of social politics inside the problem . is a delicated tool to use from eeuu against the arabian world to impose his power to take the fuel for the car , because directly or indirectly all the industry of the car ( even if exist in japan ) have something made in america . in my opinion , ... could be too long to explain my real idea about that . .. i mean , last week i passed my driving permission , now i am crazy about drive , i would like to buy a cheap car to carry my double-bass with me , to go to the gig without the help of anybody . .. but in twenty year , may be i would like to go by bus and train because the stress and polution , i thing that if we are still alive in this time , the politic about the public transport have to change , at least in spain . if we compare this kind of thing with the country of the north of europe , like holland we are very far . . there , the public transport are much more eficience . also , for the people is cheaper , there are much more tram , and train ( wich is more ecologic ) and they have more bus in the station . so i am agree because , if we do n't have a social revolution before , finally , we are gona be more `` european '' , and more civilizated , but we are gona lost humanity anyway . ..
