some people will like to understand the idea and concept while some people will learn it from the fact they experienced . but i agree with that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than they learn fact because if they understand the concept of the particular they can face the fact confidently . that is if you understand a problem and the concept behind that problem then u can understand the type of problem and you can think an idea for the problem and you can solve the problem when you really face it with much better way than you face it directly a you have never face that situation before that time . for example , in the study of medicine why to teach about how to deal with patient and how to recognize the disease by readig book first than going to the hospital and examining the patient , it is because we need basic theoritical knowledge first to face any situation first we should know how the patient will be then we should know how to recognize the disease of the patient then we can eamine the patient about the disease he is suffering with but we can not go to the directly to the doctor room with out any knowledge about that and go and ask the person about their symptom of uneasyness , a if they say also we do n't know the disease first to give medicine . it is also important to learn from fact but before that we should learn some what from concept and idea about the thing that wa been done by the people before u that how they faced the situation for that instance if it is well we also follow the same way of approach otherwise we will think of the better way how to solve the same thing in a more effective way when we face such a type of situation it not only in the field i mentioned above but it is also applicable in all field of work and this is mainly for student a they learn thing newly so gaining more theoriticall knowledge for student is better than learning it from fact .
