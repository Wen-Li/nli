some may argue that successful people do n't try new thing meaning that they do n't take any risk in the life . however , i disagree with this opinion and for some reason i beleive that one should take risk in order to be successful in the life . first of all , trying new thing develops one 's imagination and creativity . in other word doing the thing which we already know brings ordinarity and make people 's life monoton . i think , imagination and creativity play very important role in being successful . only if you have some extraordinary imagination and creativity you can succeed . i wolud like to qoute from albert einstein saying `` imagination is more important than knowledge , knowledge is limited but imagination encirles the world . '' on the other hand , the life itself , i beleive , is a risk . no one can know for sure what tomorrow will bring . so , if we are living in a risky life , then , it is unnecessary to hesitiate to take some risk in the life . by taking risk , people increase their chance of finding new opportunies to make their life more enjoyable , confortable and desirable . i think , most of the successful people taking risk beacuse of the invevitability of risk . thirdly , no one can know what something new will bring without trying it . i mean , of course , while something new will have both negative and positive effect , not to trying it restricts the probability of getting the positive side . i beleive that making some preliminary study , i mean thinking , one can easily take risk in the sake of getting the positive side . for these reason i stated above , i am of the opinon that successful people try new thing and take risk in the life .
