acutally , the people getting much older than at older time . that is a result of the development of better drug . but in additon to getting more older the old people have a better life than the younger generation . in my opinion they can enjoy life more than young people can do , because of some basically reason . first older people do not have to go to work . they had worked for an average of 35 year and so they are getting pension . they have more free time that mean all the time they have in leisure . they can sleep 10 hour a day . i think that can not do the younger generation . for example my grandmother sleep 11 hour a day . so she is fit and do not feel tired . younger people are often feel tired because they can not sleep so much time because they have to go to where they work . another reason is that older people have more money than the younger have . the older generation had saved money in the time they had worked . the young people had not saved so much money . the older generation can buy a lot of thing . all time of the day they can do a shopping - tour because they have enough money . in addition to this the older people can fly everywhere they want for holiday . they are very flexible . in contrast to this i do not think that the younger generation is so flexibil in time . another example is that older people have more social contact . they can meet each other for breakfast , for a cup of coffee or something else . younger people have the problem of the flexibility because if they have free time their friend might not have free-time . as a result of some basically reason , more free-time , more flexibility and more money i think that older people have more fun their life than the younger people .
