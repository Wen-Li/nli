according to me the advertisement do make product seem much better than they really are . the sole purpose of advertisement are to promote the sale of a product . in today competetive society , the advetisers would do anything to attract our attention . they put famous celebrity in their add and pay million of dollar to the t.v . station to broadcast their add . almost all add are different and inovative , however they all have one thing in common - they all highlight only the good point about their product . they never inform the consumer what their product lack . often , a person find a difference of day and night between a product seen in the advertisement and the actual product . the company usually ameliorate the appearence of the product when they advertise it , through computer graphic . they make it more appealing than it really is . once i saw an advertisement of an acne face wash . the result of the product seemed amazing . the interview of the user were shown in advertisement . they were all happy with the product and asked everyone to used the product . intimidated by the add , i ordered the product . the product seemed completely inaffective and useless . i wa dissapointed and from that time on i made a resolution of never using a product without personal research . hence , we should not fall prey to the tempting advertisments which the company show u , since they are far from reality
