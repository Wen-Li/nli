i think that there is only a little chance that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today for a lot of reason . first of all today car or similars ( truck , bus etc . ) are the most common way to transport everything , people or material and there are a lot of road ( like highway ) destinated only for car and it will be a very big problem to change all the system that we use in few year and i am sure that twenty year are fewer time than the time we need to make this change . onother evidence of this is that the selling of car is not in a decrease . i think it 's possible that , beacause of the problem related with the decrease of petroleum reserve and the rise of gas cost , car will change and they will use some alternative resource to function ; biological and refreshable resource like wind , sun or hydrogen are the future of the transport problem but today i think they are only a future far from u . the thing that is also possible is that the way to use car change . today we see al lot of car in every road that contains only one person . for example there are often a lot of car that are obliged to go very slow beacause there are more car then a street could contain ; i take the bus every day to go to the university and i know very well this bad situation . a way to change this think is to use more public service , like bus or train , but i know that they do not work very well so people prefer to take the car . one other way to change this is to organize people to have car full of them and not with only the driver . i definitly think that in twenty year there will be more car or the same a today beacause to reduce the number of car you have to change the mind of the people , and this is very hard to do in a few year .
