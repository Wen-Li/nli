i disagree with the statement . i believe that it is better to specialize in an area that to be familiar to a whole lot of academic subjects . my response is based on an experience that speeks for itself . being from an engineering background i wa faced with a similar situation where i needed to choose between a spealized course of information technology ( it ) and a general stream of computer science which also includes it . i would rather be good at one thing than know about a wide range of area . so i took it . now i can proudly say that i specialize in it n get a brilliant job rather than saying that i know about many area n settle for an average job . similar case where doctor after doing mbbs have to specilize in a stream to be successful . suppose a person is just mbbs . he know about every part of the body but doesnot know how to handle a patient who urgently need a heart surgery . this again put light on the topic where specializing count a lot . in this specific case it could mean life or death for the patient . when a person is good at a certain area he/she can persue a career in that stream . everyone ha like and dislike for subject . no one can say that he/she like all area of the academic curriculum . thus the person must persue the area which they are most interested in and specialize in it . this will not only make him/her happy but also keep others happy . and the person is most likely to do well by studying something they are keen on . on the other hand the person who is jack of all trade is most likely to be unhappy n make people around him unhappy by not being good at what he/she is doing . thus we can clearly conclude that it is better to specialize than to have broad knowledge about academic subject .
