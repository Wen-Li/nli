the our social life is changing fater than ever before . in this society we always using car for our living . the car have the mportant part of our living . in my opinion , i disagree with the statement . this is because the car are the definition of the modern transportation , the first reason is that , for example , in my case i usually used the car when i went to the supermarket and school . this is because the car are the most comfortable to me , it is not for me , everybody feel these comfortable , but we think about the aspect of the envirometal . i worried about the air pollution , the air polution often can be acontroversial issue . however we dont have to do this worry about that , the other resource from nature are developing in thesedays . so we will can ride a car that derives from energy of sun . and the final reason is that the money for the car is the le than other transportation . for instans , nowadays , the price of fuel is going down . for in my case , my car is small , so it need le fuel than other big car , and than i do n't need to waste my money , we often take airplane . the air plane fee is largly waste my money .
