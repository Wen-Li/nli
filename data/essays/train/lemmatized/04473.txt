i disagree with the statement , that is , i insist that in twenty year there will be more car than there are today . i have two reason . one is about the continuous construction of road , and the another is about the conviniences of using car . the first reason for me to disagree with the statement is that the construction of the road for car are continuous . it will make the benefit by using car widen more and more . although of course i agree that the construction of road are often connected with the intent of politician who are eager to earn money by producing too many road , and it often said to lead to the damage to environment , these construction can not help continuing without the dramatical change of law that restrict these behavior of politician , which i think will not occur in twenty year . the second reason for me to disagree with the satatement is the convinience that car bring u . by car , we can go exact place where we want to go to , while for example train can only brings u to the `` station , '' which might be very away from the place we want to get to . as shown in the fact that road are so widely spread in the world , we are so benefited by car that we ca n't stop using car . so , it is easy to see that claiming bad effect car have , such a polluting air , even though these effect are important enough to carefully think about , wo n't be able to stop u using car in twenty year a we are n't now . for these two reason , i disagree with the statement and insist that the number of car will rather increase in twenty year .
