i agree with the following statement . why the successful peole are success ? because they would love to try the thing that never happen before . then they succeed and these new stuff let more and more people interested in it . the ending will be lot of people want to work with you and it will be developed . it 's pretty hard to do a known thing . there ha already been some people getting knowledge and doing well . in some way , it 's hard for you to do it better . because the people , who ha already known it , their next step will be to do it better . you just start it . that 's not impossible to do it better but it cost time . if you use the time to do some thing new , it 's much better to another way . finding some thing new is liked a travelling . you can feel many new feeling and get more express that never happened before . then , more and more people will be interested in your travelling and join you . it will be developing . but anyway , there 's still some problem . because it 's a unknown stuff , no one ha experinces before and you must be your alone when you were starting it . it 's so difficult that so many people failed . you will face a lot of challenge and fight with them just by yourself . maybe some one will laugh at you or you will lose yourself in the finding way or you will enter to a dark land . yes , it is difficult . also it 's the why you succeed . it mean you are better that the loser in this way . you are the winner . you are succeed . you will get some honor and prize . but the greatest thing you got that is the knowledge and express and how to deal with these challenge . to do it .
