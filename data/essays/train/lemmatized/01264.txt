long ha been written whether young people enjoy life more than older people do , a well a how old people enjoy life more than young people do . nevertheless , i consider that enjoying life ha more to do with people 's attitude toward life than with them being young or old . therefore , i will try to describe some idea in order to support that enjoying life ha much more to do with an attitude than with age . for example , many people could think that enjoying life may be related to lifetime , therefore if you are young person you could enjoy life more than if you are old . old people could think that young people have much more energy , or more activity in a day and therefore they enjoy life much more than them . the only thing they do n't stop to think is that usually young people do n't have a much spare time a old people could have . on the other side , many young people could possible think that old people enjoy life much more than them since they are retired and the could do whatever they want with their time . as i have stated before , i definitely consider that enjoying life ha more to do with waking up every morning feeling a if you need to do something , either walking , running , eating , sleeping , working , etc. and how you will manage to take the best part of the day . no matter if you are young or old , if you have lot of thing to do every day or no , the only point is the attitude you put to live every day in order to be able to enjoy it . finally , i could say that enjoying life is not related to age since both being young or old you can enjoy life a much a you want .
