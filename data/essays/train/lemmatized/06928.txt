some people think that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide and other people prefer to travel alone . i prefer to travel alone with my own organisation for different reason . i disagree with the fact that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i want to explain you my opinion and give you personal experience . first , when you travel in a group led by a tour guide , this person proposes you to visit only the most important place and not obligatory the most interesting place . for example , i travel in india for two month alone , without guide and i visit and i discover a lot of small place very interesting . i visit village and i can undersand the real culture of this country in this small place . second , the tour guide is often an international person and not a local guide . i think this point is very important . nobody can explain you a country like a local people . one time i travel in paris and i take a tour guide to explain me the story of `` versailles '' . this guide wa japanese and she speaks not very well french ! i like to spend time to speak with the other people of a country . third , i like to be free when i travel . i like to stay one night more in a place if i like this place . when you travel in a group , you need to follow the guide . i understand that a lot of people prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . for instance , old people can enjoy , because they have a good organisation with this way to travel . however , i prefer to travel alone an to be free . i respect an other opinion but i am sure that the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide .
