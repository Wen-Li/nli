from my point of view , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . there are many reason that suppport my opinion . now there are more car in the city than habitant , so it will not be suffer more time , too many traffic jam , slow traffic . .. that disturved the citizen ' life . they probably , in twenty year , will not buy more car . the public service are improving every day . public bus , train . .. make the life easier in the city . people do not like to waste time waiting in their vehicle , so they are using public transportation more and more , this fact show that in many year , people will not buy car . moreover , goberments are intelligent , they offer excellent prize in the public bus , with good conections betwen the city and that make easy the life without car . futhermore , nowadays , we are suffering a lot of car ' accident , people are scared from that and the authority will take decision to stop it with paying lot of money if somebody drive so fast or if driver are drinking and driving . .. in some many country they can take your car off . . in addition the air commications are being improving a lot , it make faster travel around the world and through every country . i believe that finally people will not want to spend five hour in the car in order to visit a relative if they can do the same trip in one hour by plane . also i think that citizen are concious of the huge pollution that car produce to the enviroment . in contrast , i believe that in twenty year will be more motocycles in the city , because these are vey helpfull in there . base on the argument that i have exposed about , it can be infered that i am agree with the statement .
