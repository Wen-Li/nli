i completely agree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . younger people enjoy their life more than older people because of the fact that they have to take care of lesser responsbilities than the older one do . younger people need not worry much about their future they need to worry mostly about their subject , while the older people have to worry about a lot of thing ranging from tension in the office to what to cook tonight . younger people enjoy life with their friend they go out for party and club with their friend more frequently then the older one do , even though older one go out to party their mind is always preoccupied by tension . for older people the burden keep on increasing day by day and they find little time to enjoy , but for youngster every second is for enjoyment and they enjoy their nlife to the fullest . older people also have the problem of taking care of their child . older people also are worried about their future the time after they retire . younger people also have the privelage of being taken care of by their parent whenever they have a problem and need not have any worry . younger people have the privelege of a number of holiday when they have plenty of time to enjoy their life . though most of the younger people enjoy their life more then the older one there are older people who enjoy life more then the younger one do , for example dr. vijay mallya who enjoys his life more than any youngster doe . i feel that younger people enjoy more than older people do because they have lesser burden than the older one . they have the privelage of being taken care of by their parent and need not worry much but only have to enjoy .
