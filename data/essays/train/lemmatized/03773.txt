as an italian citizen working and living within an american environment , after reading your question whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept rather than learning fact , the first thing that came to my mind wa the difference in the teaching and learning principle that i could identify between the italian and the american system . until recently , the italian education system ha been focused and built on the importance of theory on practice , to the point of delivering highly educated graduate student that due to the poor or complete lack of practice , experienced a very tough time once out in the work market , trying to get a job . on the other hand , what i have seen of the u.s. education system tell me that it is centered more on letting the student learn from fact than from theory . personal experience : my husband is a computer network engineer and i recall his first computer network college book including several chapter explaining the mathematical and physical principle related to issue like band-width and associated data transmission speed . well , knowning that unfortunately my husband ha a very poor math and physic background , i asked him how come he ended up getting an a to that class and his answer wa really astonishing for me italian student , used to the italian education system . basically , my husband told me that their teacher simply told them to skip all the math/physics chapter , because they really did n't need to know why thing happened in a certain way , but just the way they worked . hopefully , i am sure that not all u.s. college teacher are like the one above that wa teaching computer network to my husband and most likely his case represents just an extreme . nonetheless , i do deem that a little more attention to theory may benefit the u.s. education system , just like more practice would benefit the italian one . basically , in my opinion , `` understanding idea and concept '' and `` learning fact '' should be considered a factor equally important to student . actually , to me the ideal education system should contemplate an equal distribution of either learning system . in conclusion , to me the appropriately educated person is the one that know not only how thing happen ( learning fact ) , but also why the world run the way it doe ( understanding idea and concept ) .
