every stage of live ha it own priority and way to enjoy the moment . i do think that young people and older people can both enjoy the life they are living . however the intesity with which someone can enjoy live mainly depends on the effort and the sacrifice he had to do to reach to that point . in fact we can take the exemple of a young boy : his live , his universe is quite simple . a single simple thing can fulfill him like the consideration of his teacher when he ha drown a beautifull tree or learnt a poetry . but i think to enjoy that moment of proudness he had to concentrate and to make an effort . on the contrary , i am sure that some student who doe n't really work hard to succeed in his study and who think that what he is doing is just enough to pas his exam ca n't really enjoy live . in fact even if he ha all the time and the possibility to go on hollidays and to party with his mate , he would soon or later fill that he is not doing his best and wo n't enjoy this live anymore . that 's why i am depply convinced that in order to enjoy live , we have to see in our past and be proud of what we have been able to perform . moreover , after year of work in a very fullfiled career , older people have earned money that can allow them to travel , to have the live they have always dreamed of . but they have earn more than money during their career : they have earned the ability to be sincirely proud of what they have done . that is to say , the familly they have built , the education they have given to their child and the good memory they are giving to their grand-children . that is why i think that older people can enjoy live more than younger one .
