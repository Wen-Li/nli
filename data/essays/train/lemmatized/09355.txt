with the young and the old people , we have two different way to see thing . in some point you enjoy more your life a a young personn than an old one , but this statement work in the other sense too . for a young personn , life is a train that you do n't have to miss , in other word , you must enjoy your life a much a possible a a young personn , because when you get old you are not able to do all the thing you were able to do before . when you are young you have a permanent energy that give you this happiness of living that allows you to do everything , like go out on the evening and go to work the morming after without being tired , or just pratice a lot of activity like climbing , scuba diving . . for sure , scuba diving is not advize for old people because of heart problem . this example justify why being old can appears a the end of the freedom . you are more fragile , your body is not the same , you are not the same . but being old is not essentially the end of life . as the wine is getting better when it 's getting older , people become better when they getting older . in fact , you become more confident because of all your past experience . you become a brain who know everything and who did everthing ! that 's one of the biggest advantage of being old , you have a knowledge of a lot of thing . it 's not the only thing , when you are old you can make a comparison with the past , society change , new product appear , you enjoy to see all the improvement of the world you used to live in before . by the same time you become grand parent , and you enjoy a lot to be with your grand child . in my opinion , you enjoy more your life when you are young , because you are more able to have fun . when you are old you are often seek , your body doe n't work a good a it wa used to , and futhermore you just remember the past , when you were young .
