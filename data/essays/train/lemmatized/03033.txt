the issue at hand is the amount of car that we are going ti have in the future i am totally agree with the satatement that in the future there is going to be a fewer amount of car than we have today . the fir argument thet i have to agree with this is because today there are a lot of tecnologycal development , this mean that transportation company university and also the goverment are trying to research and find diferentes way of transportation such a fast train , faster ferry and others . all this with the idea of cleaning the street of the huge ammounts of car that only mke noise and traffic congestion . because this tecnologycal development i thin in the future there will be a few number of car . additionaly we have to consider the importance of internet on this day this importance is leading u to take onlines course at the university this mean non presential class , and also there are long donstances job , for example you can work in a call center but from your house . the increasing ammount of this kind of job demostrate that in the future wiil not need to cross long distance to make our life therefore we are not going to need a car . thus i think there are going to be le car due to the the idea that we are not goin to need it . finally a think there are a lot of enviromental issue every day people is more consient that we have to take care of our enviroment so for that reason they prefer another kind of transportation and think to take a train or subway is a beeter idea . then tecnoly development , internet and online work growing an enviromental issue make me think that the satement that in twenty year there is going to be fewer car than today is vali and i am agree with it .
