i disagee , for me the best way to travel is by your slef . becose traveling in a group leded by a tour guide il not comfurmtabeul , and he will take you to the most touristique place , the most expensive plea . if you go allowne you will be abule to see the real parte of the cultur and the rieal peapul . for exampeul , if you go to india with a guide he or she , will chow you the monumunt 's but not the villigis . .. you will not be aibul to teaste every thing becose thay will teal you that you will be sick . .. but if you go allowne you can take your time in the stors and in the monumints . .. if you go allowne you can talk to how you want . .. you can give monny to the needy , but if you go wiyh a guide he ou she , will teal you not to give them anny thing . som peapl licke to be allowne . in a bus you ar not allowne and there are smell , a chidran crining . .. wen you go by your self , you are more relaxte then in a bus . .. a guide will teal you to harry up and teak photo , but you are on a oliday , and you wante to take your time rith ? if you go by your sel with just a travel bag you will meak meny contaks , riche and poueur peapel . .. you will lurne muche more by going by your self . the poueur peapeul will com and beg more wen they see a goupe of with peapel then wen they see juste own . so that is wy i disagee with the facte of traveling in a group leded by a guide .
