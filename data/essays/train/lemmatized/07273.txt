i do agree that young people enjoy life more than olders do . youngs are young , they have time to do what they like . they may go to a dance hall every night shareing a wonderful time with their friend , or sleep for an entire day just because it 's comfortable . youngs are unexperienced , so they can try everything that they fell exciting . they may climb tree and hill , travell across river and ocean to experience the glory of the naturl . they may easily take bill that take all the money , for they got a idea to try a new thing , and then they think it 's worthy . youngs are confident , they will do every thing that they want to do . they may just have a little company with a little money , and then try their best to made it gloomy . they may also get crazy in they dream , to be a painter , dancer , engineer or many other career . youngs are never to young , if they want , they can do anything . no matter how others are considering their behavior and how astonishing thier behavior are , once deiced to do that , they will never stop . youngs are free , they have not too much to think of . they do not have to worry about how much money they still have , or how they get rid of the next poor day , or climbing in the rain may cause illness instead of appriciating the great natual . so i think young people enjoys life better than the older people . youns are belongs to theirselves , they can do anything they like , they can choose any life style they want to
