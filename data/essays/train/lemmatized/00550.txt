i disagree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowdledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , because today a specialization is more useful than a broad knowdledge . however , it depends on the kind of job you want to do ; for a child 's teacher , for example , perhaps it is better to have a broad knowledge . if you are specialized in one specific subject , only you and other few people are able to understand this subject in deep , and so some people will look for you and your knowdledge . think about me : i am studying material science and engineering ; i have n't a broad knowledge of many academic subject , but if someone ha problem concerning with material , i am the person for him and i will be payed lot of money for my suggestion . thus , specializing is a good way to have better chance in finding work . otherwise you must n't be an ignorant in the other subject , because you are required to know what are you talking about , when you are speaking with another person . for example , if someone speaks to me about gear or engine at work , i have to know how they work properly , more or le . also if someone ask me an information about an important philosoper like barouch spinoza , i am supposed to know something about him . however , i think that this broad knowdledge should been given to student by high schools , and not by the university . if you have done your high school properly , you are supposed to have enough broad knowdledge to support all the discussion you will take in the future . thus , in my opinion it is better to attend the high school in a good way in order to achieve a broad knowdledge of many subject , and then specialize in what you like the most when you are going to the university .
