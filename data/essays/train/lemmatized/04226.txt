i agree with the statement a successful people try new thing and risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . according to my opinion every where successful people mean hardworking people are try to find the new thing . because of they were knowen where the risk and prolems are generated . thats the resone the successful people done every thing at where ever . and also hardworking people try to know about new thing such a to find new type of product and make it where ever any risk . then publised into market . now a day the information technology wa growing day by day . one company released one type of product and onther company released that type but with more feature . why because in those company were type of empyoement . in one company had the normal eployees and the other had the successful or hardworking empyoee . this is the majore example of the successful people and othes . hardworking people knowen where the conflict are rised or generated . example of successful people in the world are rathan tata , mittal and somany are there . they are all successful in thier life and also they are thaught that to produce new type of product in to world market . the hardworkig wa come from their family and from teacher they learned in to their instututes . successful mean when ever a man or woman got happy or got victory from their job . there are somany scientist are successful in their experiment , then they whould successful on that experiment . successful people always thinging about the new topic from the socity . successful people got the full relax and happy from their work . and the people do ndt happy those are normal people .
