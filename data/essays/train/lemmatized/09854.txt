some young people do enjoy life more than older people do . but that is not 100 percent correct . some of older people they worked so hard during the young life , they spend almost more than 12 hours for work just want save more money for the future old life . they might play after retired can around the world use this money . my father was crazy of work when he was young . he works almost over 12 hours . he got back home usually after midnight for everyday . i even did not have chance to talk to him . now he is retired he took my mom travel a lot of different countries . many of their friends were jelous of them . in china , old people said `` if you not work so hard when you were young , you will get regrated . '' my parents always told me `` you have to mork harder when you have energe because you will not know what will happen in the future . '' but this words now is change to ues in the young people . nowadays some young people just want to have fun in this world . they west time and money in playing and doing nothing . when they have no money they ask their parents to get . if you ask them why do not you work ? they will tell you `` life is short , you will not know what will happen for tomorrow so just enjoy your life do not be so serious and do not need to work so hard . '' my father 's co-worker has a son . he did not go to college after high school he just stay at home and playing computrt game until now he is 27 years old . he never work . the resion is he think his family do not need to work to make money so he rather stay at home enjoy his computer game life . it is not called enjoy life . i think some of them called enjoy life just get lazy , they do not want themselves so tired . i can not say young people enjoy life more than older people that is depends on the person , just do not west the time to doing nothing . time is money .
