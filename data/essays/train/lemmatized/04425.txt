i agree with the statement . today young people think only about themselves and their problem instead of giving time to helping their community . they want only enjoy themselves having a lot of hobby and going out with their friend . i know few young people who do activity for athey withdraw from the reality which sometimes is full of people that is sad and have phisical or economic problem . young people do n't want to see that there are person who have to be helped and are near to them . but there are also a lot of association that want to do something to help who is in a difficult condition . i think that everyone should care their community because he is part of society and if he try to change a bad reality he life better too . young people should have more respect to others because they are the future and it should have to be better than the present .
