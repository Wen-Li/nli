many student believe that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i am afraid i completly disagree with this statement because of several reason that i will clearly explain . the first reason is because having knowledge of many academic subject is helpful only if you do not plan to work . think about it . if in the real society , in the real word i mean , each individual wa not specialized and did not have a specific job , it would be a disaster !!! for instance , research would not have had so many discovery in all this year . moreover , doctors must be specialized to take care of their pacients in the correct way !!! the second reason is because not specializing in something doe not allow you to pursue a real carreer . for instance , the fact that genius did so much for u is a concequence of having specialized the subject that fit better to them . moreover , it doe not solve our problem being all aware of general information . we need expert to progress in all subject . furthermore , having a gift for a subject help you to trust yourself and to be proud of yourself when you succeeds in this discipline . you feel special and it help you also in your private life . in addition , specializing in one specific subject help you to focus in something that you like making you happy !! why should i study math if i do not want to ? why should i do that ? if somebody is not capable to study a subject because he really doe not understand that why shoud he be obliged to do that ? to sum up , i am convinced that individual must be free to do what they like and there is no reason to dny this right .
