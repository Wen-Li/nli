i disagree with the statement , nowadays , young people seems they do not give enough time to helping their community . but it is because the way of participating their community is changing through time . in the past , community are so small that everyone in the community can know almost everything about other member in community , and they spent most of their time in the community . but nowadays , community are getting bigger and bigger , one member in community can hardly know about other member in community , and people spend more time at work than in community . so , it may appear this statement is true . but the willingness to help other people is not le than that of past time . some young people help other people by internet , donating disabled men 's committee and the other spend more time to helping their community at work . ( work place can be a community . ) so , a time go by , the way of participating community activity is just changing , not the willingness of participating community activity .
