advertisements can change consumer 's mind about product . so , i think that most product excessively make use of their advertisement that are making product seem much better than they really are . for example , during past summer , i participated in western america which are lasvegas , arizona , and los angeles tour program for forigner . according to tour company 's advertisement picture , we were supposed to accomodate in a luxury hotel that have a swimming pole , a casino , and diverse show program but it wa just picture . we were accomotated in like a motel . so , this is one of advertisement that are exggarated . when we watch tv advertisement , we propably can not find product that look ugly and can not work well . however , when we use product , we can find the difference of the quality . therefore , i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . although advertisement are very important to increase selling , consumer are not stupid . eventually , they will chose the really good product not by advertisement but qualliy .
