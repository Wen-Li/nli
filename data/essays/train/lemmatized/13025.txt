i agree with the statement that product seem much better than they really are . it is the commercial 's job to present good and service a good a possible . advertisment is an essential way to communicate with prospective but also already existing customer . we get information via different way : tv , radio , newspaper and paper-walls along street . marketers distinguish between dormant and already existing wish . af part of their work is locating client and find the best way to give them information about for example a'new generation ' of a certain product . imagine you enter a supermarket and just see food , drink and cleaning aid in neutral package . people memorize and recognize product in an easier way by identifying a certain brand , especially when they are already familiar with a specific one . products are usually advertized either in an abstract environment , i mean just the perfectly photographed product with a bright-coloured background , or by offering it by attractive actor . brands tell story , create a certain life-style . for example : is there a really amazing difference in taste between pepsi-cola and coca-cola ? i do n't really think so . ordering and having a coke provides a certain feeling , independent on the taste . what you see , is always an idealized picture . it is up to your choice whether you want to buy it at least once and try whether the content cover your imagination . but do n't be disappointed if maybe the package tell a different story concerning the packed good . another example : cars are not only buyed due to financial reason , but also because they create an imagination for the driver to be sporty , in a certain way it mean a method of showing status . to summarize i think we all know about the effect of advertisement , it is a comfortable way of getting news , but the elder we become the more concious we are about the effect .
