i agree specialize specialize in one subject is better . introduction : 1. know the subject . 2.opportunities are there . 3.dont waste time . first reason is if a student to take learning on one subject it will be easy to get the score . for example if a student take the course of like computer subject in this it can have different subject are there . if the student to choose the subject java course . the student can concentrate on that subject . so he can get the good score . suppose if job is not get he can teach the subject to other student and he can get the salary . this is other way doing if he ca n't get the job . second reason is to create new project if the student take on one subject if we take above example java course . the student can create new thing like if in the based on the java course he can create web site and quick transaction . if a student going this way he can get better opportunity and the student get the better salary and he can bright future . if the student can create new project he can give the presentation on that thing . if the government to produce in the market and people are used to that project . third reason is dont waste time the student can learn on that subject he can not the waste the time . some student take different course so that student can waste the time . those student no relief and happiness . because at the time of end course if the student can not get grip on those subject it will be very difficulty . if the student on one particular subject he can save the time . that time he can spend with friend or family or other activity . so iagree specialize in one subject is better .
