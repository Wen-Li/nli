the speed of development concerned technique is so fast today , and more and more speculate that what will happen in 20 year . some of them believe that there will be few car in use than there are today . however , i is hesitant to agree with the statement , and the reason are listed below . let u have a look at the increasing wealth brought by the globalization , we will agree peopel will own more fortunate than have ever been . the increasing money will be spent on some good which seemd to be luxury before , including car . take china a an example , more and more family boast car now , which wa a miracle to them before . if we pay some attention on the soar earning of people in africa today , we all agree the conlcusion that they tend to buy more car just a what chinese are doing today . moreover , i also believe that people in developed coutries will not give up using car ; since the vehicle bring u such a lot of convenience . for example , we can easily travel to place for which we are longing by driving them . besides that , they also increase the independence and freedom of people , who wll not be restricted by location and weather . and i am convinced that with more focus on freedom of human being , car will become more popular . admittedly , many people think that the number of car will be reducing , because they cause a great deal of pollution , and people nowdays pay special attention on the enviroment . nevertheless , i deem that the pollution of car can be reduced and finaly varnish , with the development of technique . and we will confirm this idea through statistic provided by un , that a car made by the newest technique pollutes le than ha even been before . in conclusion , though the car face the problem that they pollute a great deal today , i think the number will not be fewer , because more and more people can afford them , and such great comfor and convenience they offer , and , the most importan . the advancet of technique .
