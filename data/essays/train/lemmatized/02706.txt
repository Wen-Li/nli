i agree with the following statement that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . when a person want to learn the fact first he ha to have some idea how he can come to the end point . first of all he ha to make clear about the concept he want to include to reach that destiny . for example , if we want to do some project to submit to a professor we have to have some dead time to finish , then we have to concentrate how we can finish that assignment with in the time . first we have to create some idea like which book we have to refer , how we can present that paper , the order of the paper , we have to show to someone who can give u the some more information that can be included , put the paper in clear format and submit the paper . factual information may be the true information to learn that before we have to understand what are the hidden idea and the concept . when we be in a family everyperson try to reach a fact so easily about others but before going to a conclusion about that person we have to have some idea about his behaviour that is how he talk , how he move , how he behaves with in the house , then we have make a concept about that person then atlast give the fact about that person . i conclude my passage by saying that every person , for example student should create an idea about which graduation he want to complete and what course he is intrested and prepare a concept that what is required for him to complete the graduation . take some suggestion , know how difficult it is and then enter in to fact that he want to end up with that certification of graduation in which he is intrested with joy .
