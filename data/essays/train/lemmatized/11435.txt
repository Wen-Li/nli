i disagree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i think they just enjoy different aspect of it . young people are more adventurous and older people are more wise . when people are young they are still discovering what life is . they have a lot of opportunity and not many responsabilities yet . they seek for new experience . a young person usually enjoys having fun and spend time with his friend . success in school can bring joy to the life of a young student . i personally enjoy the fact that i am creating my own future . i love this season of my life . older people enjoy other thing about life . i think that being a father or a mother brings a lot of joy . i think that the older enjoys more calm entertainment . it a time in their life when people ponder more about what the past .
