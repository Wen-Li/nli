i agree with the statement because one can do everything in his life until he have energy and not but obivious it is more in young generation . '' enegy provides the interest , interest provide the entertainment and entertainment provides the enjoy '' . at the younger age , man is at the the stage of his life where he can contribute more and more for himself and when think about the enjoyement the main duration come from his young life . in young life he first experience the college life which no one can disagree the best day of anyones life . at the young age he earns the money by his own so there is no tension of spending it at the the prelimenery stage until he get responssibilty so at that time also on becoming self sufficient he enjoy his life than old man can enjoy . at the old age the man get dependent because everywhere we can see man work for their child not for their future and at the old age he think to enjoy he can not expect the money from his child or he feel shy in demanding so keeping all aside he gave up enjoyment and work in day to day routine . at the young age only he feel the spirit of life and doe watever he want but at old age he ha to think before taking any risk because he do not have that much power to gain again or work again . at the earlier stage that is young age he feel attraction more towards oopsite sex and so doe so much funny thing to attract them but it doe not happen in later stage of life . so the basic conclusion emits from above that one enjoys more in young age a compared to the old age because freshness is the basic requirement to enjoy the valueabale moment of life and that remains only in young age .
