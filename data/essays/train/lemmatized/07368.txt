as far a i am concerned , the best way to travel is free tour . in other word , i think not planned tour will give u more pleasant experience . you may argue that the group tour led by an adept tour guide can show u more thing to see and feel , but it is just a second-hand experience just given away to our hand by another person . in my case , i am planning new york tour after two week . i 've saved my spare pocket money and earned money from part time job for two year . i prepared sightseeing visa and flight ticket just on my own without any help from tour agency . it gave me a self-confidence that i can do anything for myself . it wa a little bit hard job to prepare document for applying visa and cheapest flight ticket , but i think it reserved thing to do . you can save your time to prepare your travel with agency and skillful guide , but you can not get a experience to do something on your own . moreover , self planned travel can give you a great experience differ from a group tour have to obey time table scheduled by tour agency or gude . the people who went to trip with guide can see famous tourist attraction and get a same memory with others , but tourist without guide will go anywhere want to go even if it wa not a planned thing to do . the plan-less trip can give u real freedom because no plan is our plan . i think many tourist commit oblivion to get freedom . our own intend to travel is feel free and experience exotic culture , but many group tour is not available to feel freedom but just crammed exotic culture . therefore i think travel with no guide will be better for our independence and more experience .
