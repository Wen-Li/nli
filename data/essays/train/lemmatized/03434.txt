i remember an tv-ad about some kind of perfume which , once applied on your body , could bring you all the beautiful girl or boy that you may have dreamed of . i bought it and i can assure you that it doe not work ! maybe i wa abused by the advertising but for sure , but in my view the advertisement tends to overstate the main feature of a product , and i will give the main reason for that . first , the main goal of an advertisement - and it is also the aim of marketing - is to promote a good or a service in order to increase it sale . as a consequence , the presentation of the product could not be fair in a sense . indeed , i am quite certain that if a tv-ad show the weakness of a good or service , in order to be partial , this good or service would be a appealing a the same presented by an ad which show only the good aspect of it . second , advertisement tends to reach the imaginary part of our person to increase the attractiveness of product . by doing so , consumer are dreaming about such product and idolize them . for instance , you may have the strong desire to buy a luxury car because you have seen it on the tv and it wa shown in an ideal place . or you want to book your holiday in a pleasant place because you find the photograph you have seen very beautiful . but in fact the real situation could be , at least , normal . as a conclusion , i do think that the advertisement doe not provide a fair image of the product it support . but it is worthwhile to mention that it depends on our own mind to distinguish between what it is true or not .
