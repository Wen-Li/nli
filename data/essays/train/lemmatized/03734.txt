yes i agree with the statement young people enjoy life more than older people do . i think in all aspect young people enjoy more than older people . i think younger people ha le responebility than older . if any one have some responebility they may not enjoy like responebility le person . i observed some point in my friend . some of my friend are donot have any restriction or responability . they enjoy a lot every day life . it is not possible to older people because mostly they have some response during old age . like their child education on other financial problem . but these young people dont have such type of problem . and some more reason for this is health probelms . young people are very active where a older or not . young people can enjoy with out taking any rest for so many hour . where a olders can not do this . better example for this is every weekend i prefer to go some pub in my city . i can found lot of youngers and olders their . i obseved that youngers dance till the late night . but it is highly dificult to older people . another best example to state this opinion is my life style . am very crazy person . always i want enjoyment in my life . i have lot of friend . am very crazy about making friend . i think making friend also enjoyment for me . because i can roam with my friend in my city . we went movie and restarents . i can found enjoyment with romaing them . i like to travel . i feel it is enjoyment . i make trip frequently . and i enjoyed a lot in that tirps i visiti historical placec in my country . i conclude that young people enjoy life more than older people .
