i completely agree with this statement , because i think adverstisement have been developped to sell product , and consequently it had to impress the mind of the consumer . who creates the advertisement must present the product in the best way he 's able to do , also in order to defeat the challenging industry , that is , the other industry which sell the same object . to obtain this , the creator of the advertisement must present the product in a way that will make the consumer believe he 's going to do the right choice , and for these reason the company tent to present their product much better than they really are . to explain this concept , we could focus the attention on an industry which produce car : if this company is going to launch on the market a new model of car , surely it will spend a lot of money in advertisement . since the aim of the advertisement is making a person buy that new product , the car will be presented a a wonderfull object , full of technology and of service created directly in order to satisfy the consumer ; even if this description wa wrong , the consumer will be influenced in any case . for these reason , advertisement is merely created to influence society , and not to describe the real essence of the product ; talking about this problem , in this year many company and association have been founded to protect the consumer , since people can be easily cheated by the market , and consequently after they buying a product , they rapidly discover that it is very different from the one they had seen on the advertisement . concluding , we have to say that while it 's very common than company present their product much better than they really are , the consumer must reflect well upon the choice they are made , and be sure they are not buying an useless object just because they have been influenced by the advertisement they have seen somewhere .
