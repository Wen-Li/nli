i do not agree the opinion of the statement . i think there is an advantage to a person who ha one specific subject rather than a person who ha broad knowledge . if a person ha broad knowledge , of courese it is better htan limited knowlege . but a parson who only ha broad knowledge seems missing directon of life . this is my feeling from my ecperience . whithout aim of utilizing his knowledge , even if the lnowledge is wide , knowlegde doe not make sense in his life . on the other hand , a person who specializes one specifif subject seems that his vision of sutudy is much more cleare . even if the study is just a fun , consentration on a one topic interested in will have much more oportunity to make brake through of new vision . some people may say , specializing somethins is not flexible , but i think for anybody experience of effort made in the process and feeling of achievement to be specialized are very valuable , universal and applilable to other field . my point is that , specality in academic is like a backborn of study attitude . and to improvement of pepoles life , speciality is more important .
