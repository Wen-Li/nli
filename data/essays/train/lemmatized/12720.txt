the humankind always need to buy supply , meterials or food to live . advertisements are playing a big part in people 's choises of buying food , material or supply . there is lot of argument about the topic which we are discussing about . some people assumed that while advertising something you always have to describe the quality of something . in that case they think that advertisors is always telling the truth . but some of u think that advirtisors are not saying the truth about something they advertise . i agree with the second idea . i have very important reason and example to prove it . these are my following reason . firstly , advirtisors are not telling the truth because they want to eleminate the prize factor . for example , if i were an advertisor and if my product are very expensive , i will describe the quality of the product and i will never talk about the prize . and sometimes i will not tell the truth about my product . so people will think that product is in high quality , it is normal that product is expensive too . in adittion to this , advirtisors want to advertise their company . they show their product much better than they really are , to advertise their company . so people will believe that the company is good enough to product this value of product . in that case people will always choose this companie 's product . the last but not the least , sometimes advertisors lie about the prize too . they are making complicated sale and advantage to sell the product . but usually in this sale and advantage people are buying item or product much more expensive . in this situation , advertisors always mixing our head . all in all , i would like to say that advirtisors are not telling the truth both of eleminating the prize factor , advertising their company a well a to make complicating sale and advantage .
