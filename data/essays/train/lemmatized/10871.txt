in teaching of studends , there is always doubt and discussion about the teaching manner . somebody think that for a student , it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is tor them to learn fact . my personal idea is that both side should be learned by student . firstly , the fact are the base for the idea and concept . ideas and concept should be supported by fact , so that fact have to be learned a well . for example , a teacher should tell the story of euclide in finding euclide theorem to the stuents . by this way , the student can think and imagine the condition of the time that euclide lived , and he can remember euclide 's situation while he is working on a new concept or what did he worked on while finding the theorem . unless knowing these sittuation , it is so har to use euclide theorem in anywhere . thus , telling the story of euclide make the lesson much enjoyable and funny to listen . secondly , fact and idea , concept can not be separated each other by the mean of completition . these three element are completing each other . an airplane designer can not design a new wing concept unless knowing how the factor will be when the plane fly , in a snowy weather or cloudy weather etc . it is very hard to understad a subject without the fact is very hard for student . if you want to teach the result of world war ii , you should tell the situation again . knowing only where did france captured , where did britain captured or which new country are formed are all information to be forgotten . you should tell where did these country fighted , or why they are fighted for that , with fact , could be better to teach . as you can see , there is a lot of connection between idea , concept and fact . facts can not be separated by the other two . teaching is a complete job and fact are supporting for idea , concept .
