there is long point and short point about taking specialized knwoledgement . but i think that it is better to have specizlized subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . today , society is more and more complexed and technology develops more faster than past . thus , every area is more and more specilized . student will compete with other in complexed society , they need superior competiton power than other people . that 's why they must specialize their knowledgement . if there are two group ; one group is consisted of ten generalist , the other group is consisted of ten specialist . if i have to choose one group , i will take specialist . i think that group of specialist can afford more deep information thatn group of generalist because depth of knowledgement of generalist is short . although they know many academic subject , they know little about every subject . that is the limitation of generalist . the person who learn about narrow range of subject can also have a problem . when beginning of learning , person can need broad knowledge . but in elmentary and middle school and high school , student learn broad academic subject . common sense is sufficient to university student and adult because they already have broad academic knowledge in elementary , middle school and high school . after taking special knowledge that is essential to survive in society , you can broaden your knowledge in extra time . that 's not late . society need powerful specialist who can always supply specific knowledge about area of specialist .
