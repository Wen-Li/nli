we can consider the life a a huge playing area where there are so many both dangerous and good thing and where sometimes , we are not able to do everything because we are limited . if we take the case of enjoying life , there is a huge contrast between the way old people enjoy life and the young people do . young people , for instance , a child would be the happiest person ever , if her mother buy her the candy she want yet an old person would be the happiest person ever if she see her child , coming visiting her , calling her or going somewhere peaceful maybe . as all of u know , it is inevitable that young people are not a experienced a old people so that they dare more and they behave more free . the older one get , the le he or she enjoys life . the first reason why i think young people enjoy life more , is they do n't have to think because they are not old enought to consider the reality of life so there is nothing in their mind to distract them to stop them enjoying the beatuies in life . the next reason is , for example , the responsible you are , the le enjoyable life becomes . if we take the case of an unmarried 13year old , girl , she is not working , she doesnt have to earn money , she doesnt have to worry or think about her child , she doesnt have to clean the house , cook everyday , she doesnt have to solve the problem with her husband . onyl thing she might be worried about is her school due to the fact that she doe not have that much responsibility a an old woman in her fifty . the third reason is , when people are young they are more careless and it is more easy them to not to care the event . imagine an old woman sitting in home , and not getting a call for so long by her child . she would be devastated yet imagine a 5 year old kid , who had no idea about the world , he would n't even mind if his dad doe not talk to him for so long . the forth reason is , the older one get , the unhealthier one becomes . without health , nothing in the whole wide word mean anything even if you are the richest or the most beautiful or the most intelligent one . as soon a you start to get older and older , health problem increase , you are affected by everything around you , by your favourite desert or your delicious food which seem not a significant problem a it is but nobody can understand how those health problem afefct your whole life , sychology day by day . as i tried to explain above , in my opinion , a people get old , life becomes more tasteless since experience are not always supposed to be good memory . you can not always do whatever you wish and it is not possible to live a you imagine .
