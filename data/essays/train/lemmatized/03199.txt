this statement doe not offer a definition of `` successful '' - unless success consists solely of doing new thing and taking risk regardless of wether or not one succeeds in these new thing and risk . this is to be doubted . trying to find out if i can fly make me daring , and probably a hopital inmate at the least , but not successful . therefore , i would have to disgree on a formal level . more importantly though , i would like to challenge this statement in regard to it meaning a well . by not offering a definition of what `` success '' mean , the sentence is not only malformed , but furthermore appeal to a kind of common sense universality . immanual kant proved that the only maxim that may be universal imperative or truth must be rationally applicable to any thinking being . if we now try to formulate this statement a a maxim - that is : if you want to be successful , you have to try new thing and take risk - and see if it hold true for any given rational being - let u say immanual kant - we find that it is false : immanual kant lived in the same city his whole life , never changing any of his habit ; he positively did not take any risk regarding his work either : he worked an entire decade on his major book before publishing it , just to be on the safe side . but immanual kant is undoubtedly one , if not the most successful philosopher in history . his speculation on maxim can help u further along in solving the question of success : if a maxim can not be proved universal , it scope need to be smaller . thus , if we enhance the statement by saying that people who try new thing are successful if trying new thing is important to them , we end up with an applicable maxim . as a conclusion , i would like to suggest that a more appropriate statement on successful people would be the following : successful people do what is important to them , rather than doing what they think they are supposed to do .
