a major physic break through wa made when einstein suggest a brand new theory dealing with relativity . this innovative vision wa a success and einstein had strong physic basis . do we need a real ceasure to succeed in one area or do we need to evolve gently to reach a key point ? first , let 's explain how seeking excellence can bring u to a success . for example , the computational fluid dynamic activity need real mathematics and fluid physic knowledge so a person can then think about a revolutionnary concept . by focusing on one point , we can try different method to bypass it . working on something wellknown help thinking about the major issue and not about mathematics ' property . people who keep doing well what they know are gathering knowledge , experience so they are recognized by other people for this and often called , needed to explain , show , develop this subject . finally , a a third point , shall i mention that taking risk is not really allowed when working on a nuclear plant or when driving a war , a human life are at stake . but , many battle were won by using surprising method like the horse made of wood during the greek troyes war . more over , taking space between a concept and our work can lead u to borrow idea from other area , like using mathematics for urban planning optimisation . and this make the concept work . however , an other reason of taking risk is that most people have too much fear about risking anything they already have . so you are distinguishing yourself from others and then appear , when succeeding , a a successfull person . to summarize , acquiring excellency in one particular field is the first step of a successfull story . then , an innovative concept would make the difference between success and daily wotk .
