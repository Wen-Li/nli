although some people said that successful people are creative and more challegeble than others , i disagree with this view point . i believe that successful people do thing what they already know how to do well . first , most successful people do one thing that they can do well . for example , well-known pianist practice so many time that they can carry out well . eventually , they become more skillful and it make them famous and successful in their field . second , when people concentrate one field which they have already known , they can keep thinking about a specific subject or think about new idea , which is challgeble to common belief . for instance , psychology professor , alex sandra , challge to common belief which drug lead to addiction itself . he kept focusing on his research in psychology field . finally , doing one thing can make people to save their time ; therefore , it make a high possibilty to become well-known person in their field . on the other hand , a person who change their field often to do new thing might waste their time . they do not have enough time to study or concentrate their subeject well . in short , doing one thing which they already know how to do well make people sucessful than a person who try to do new thing .
