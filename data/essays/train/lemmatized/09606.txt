yes i agree with this statment . sucessful people always try to do new things . some of the reasons i can give for supporting my openion is generally peole who are successive try for the better recognition in the society . they will not think this is enough for us . they try to crete new things or solve the problems that are much difficule . it can increase their earnings and they can be well recognised by their colleaguesand others in the society . sucess is generally given as their recognition . sucessfulpeople will have ability to sand with wny risks they face in their journey of inventing somewhat new which is useful for society . so here ther are someexamples for supporting my statment . my friend did a project on special light reflection that is use as a cure for cancer . when he is doin that project he has faced many problems but he did not loose his confidence and ability . finally he had suceeded in his project . now all the people who has discouraged him want to pay more money for buying thtt project . now he didnot stop his reseach there . he is now trying to do project on tough one so his main aim is he should be in the top of all other scientists in the world . so i can give another example that is about myself . i didnot do big projects like my friend but i did a project in my software field that i have creted an website though which peole can loon to the website and they can book tickets to any airlines through my website . so it has been suceeded and i have named it as sunairlines . so finally i can conclude that sucessfullpeople can not be stopped by anyone because sucess is legendary .
