with the statement of the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guid , diferenr people have defierent idea depending on their own personality and personal experience . and in my view , i most like to agree with the statement . i know it is irrational to assert an point without anlyzing , so i 'll get a help of my own experience . last summer holiday , some friend with me have a travelling to the beautiful coast city dalian , which locates in the nothereast of china . the reputation of dalian is very good in china , and surely we are all delitly for the chance of travelling to the beautiful city . but thing not always go on a we wished . as the stranger , we are exciting for it fatastic landscape while arriving in dalian . for the sake of saving money , we have n't hire a guide , and we thought a map could handle . the coming thing prove that we are wrong absolutely . soon after the exciting , the sunset s coming , we faced the problem of accomodation . the summer is the best season for touring in dalian , thus all the room are reserved . at last we only ask for help from taxi driver , and eventually he sent u to a hotel in suburan , which locates far from the city center . in the following day , we are all depressed , a a result of withouting a tour guide , we just paid most of our time from one place to another one though the transportation in dalian is not terrible . we just searched our routine all the time . hence , it is really a low quantity travelling . in otherwise , if we have the travelling with a guide , the situation will be better . first of all , we can easy cope with the accomodation and routine . what 's more , once we have a tour a famous place , we just know it is famous but have no sense of why it is so prestige . therefore , if i will travel to another city or place i 'm not familar with , i 'll set up accompany with a guide for certain . travelling is just like the studying , and the guide is like the teacher , when we have problem we well ask help from teacher , and role of the guide is the same in travelling .
