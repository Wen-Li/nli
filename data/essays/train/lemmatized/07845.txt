some people might say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide who ha a lot of knowledge of a place where travers visit . however , i have to say that travel in a group with a tour guide is not the best way . there are two reason to support my oppinion . firstly , if you visit some place for the trip with a tour guide and other traveler , your action may be limited . for example , when i went to las vegas last summer in a group led by a guide , i could not do all thing that i really wanted to do . i choosed las vegas for the trip because i wanted to enjoy casino like poker , black jack and kino ! yet , the tour guide recommended that we in the group should visit lake of las vegas , watch the show , and enjoy the fancy restrant . as a result we did all thing that he recommended . i should have visited there and enjoyed casino again and again . also , i had to wake up early to go to the lake , although i wannted to sleep until noon . secondly , traveling alone is really interisting . for instance , you may have a chance to get some foreign friend where you visit for the trip , if you travel alone . one example of this is that when i went to israel alone to visit dead sea i made many friend of israel . furthermore , i learned history of interaction between israel and my country japan by talking wih them . they taught me that during world war 2 one jananese helped many israeli people from german government , thereby , istraeli people like japanese people . this experience wa really nice . therefore , a i mentioned above , i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group le by a tour guide . i think that traveling alone is more interesting than that in a group with guide .
