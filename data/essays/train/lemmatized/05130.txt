it is a well-known tradition for student to dislike date . therefore , it seems that maybe they do n't like learning fact , which seems harder than `` just '' understanding an idea or concept . indeed , once you have understood the idea of something , theorically , it remains in your mind , whereas fact are easily forgotten . you can then re use the concept you have learned before , only because you understood how it worked , why it wa important , and so on . and , something very important for the student , if they do n't really remember the exact word their teacher used to explain the concept , they can made up something of their own , which may still be accurate . on the contrary , you can not do the same withs fact . facts , a it is implied , are precise , occurred in special situation , and were followed by special consequence . for example , you can explain to someone what is the concept of epicure 's philosophy , even if you do n't really remember all the aspect of it , eventually your explanation may still be valuable for the other person . it is more complicated with fact ; indeed , you can not imagine how henry 8th left the catholic church to create the church of england , unless you know the fact , the date , the consequence , and so on . as far a i am concerned , i think that fact are a important a concept or idea . facts are needed to understand concept , and concept are needed to foresee fact ' consequence , for example . concepts may sometimes be too abstract for student , and the vocabulary generally used to explain a `` concept '' is not really word that we use in everyday 's life , and it may be a problem for some student . here , fact can help the teacher ( or the person explaining ) making the idea clearer for the others . to conclude , i would say that there is a very close relationship between understanding idea and learning fact ; none is more important than the other , and when you are sutdying , you need to do both to succeed .
