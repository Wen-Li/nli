i do agree with the statement ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . by doing so , they also bring about a change in the way of how thing carry go on conventionally . we do have well renowed people in each field say cricket , art or music who have given it a new definition by trying out thing differently . let u consider the example of ` abraham lincoln ' . during those day , when black were discrimated . it wa he who fought against it by taking numerous risk and stood for them and became one of the most famous president who ruled america . we do have several business who have started their career with hardly a few penny in their pocket and did eventually turn out to be of the most successful and richest people . by doing so , they do increase the economic growth of the country by giving new idea but also do stand a a paragon for others to follow their footstep . apart from the business field , we can also consider great personality who have renounced their life for the sake of humanity . for example , let u consider the example of mother theresa . she could have always let her own life in luxury and peace rather than spending her entire life for a different country and leading an austure life . she ha taken various pain in helping out the needful . she ha also contributed so much to the society by building many santoriums and home for the poor and old aged people .
