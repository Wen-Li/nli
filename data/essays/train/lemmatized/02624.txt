this is a very interssting question . the answer to this question is not easy . after my first thought i do not agree to this statement . in these day almost everybody ha his own car . it is very confortable driving in your own car , you do not depend on others or on public transportation . i prefer driving by car , because i can descide spontanious what i would likt to do and where i would like to go . sometimes it is even cheaper driving by car , than taking public transportation , like bus or train . while going on vacation , you can also descide using the bus , train , plain or even your car . mostly it is cheaper driving by car . these are some example why driving car are could be better than using public transportation . we are not allowed to forget : technologie is rising very fast these day . at the moment the automobile industrie ist trying to develop a motor , that doe not spend gas . they are looking for different kind of ressources . the plan is to keep car , but make them work with electric or solar energy for example . so if they spend another 5 year on developping a new motor for car , i do not think they will be able find different source for transportation besides car so fast . reasons for car getting fewer and fewer in the future could be the rising price , not only on car , but also the oil price . driving your own car is already very expensive . first of all you must have enough money to buy the car . that ist not it . you must also plan the cost that are related with buying a car , like tax , insurance and gas . the gas price ha been raised since several year and will probably still rise the next year . this make car driving even more expensive . so if people start thinking about their money in a more serious matter , they will think about really buying a car or saving the money . but maybe there will be some invention in the future that will change all our expectation . maybe we will be able to fly by ourselves in small plane or in some kind of rocket . the imagination is big , the sky is the limit . i could even imagine that nobody will drive car in 20 year , because we will be flying , not driving anymore . so it really depends on how the development of invention for the future are . but if everything stay like it is and we keep using our car a we do now , i do not agree to the statement above . our population is getting bigger and bigger , the street are getting fuller and fuller and the car industrie is making more profit than ever ! there are so many new car build year for year , that i do not think there will be fewer car in twenty year .
