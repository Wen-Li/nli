nowadays , advertisement are one of the most important fact which influence product . i do agree with the statement because of the following resons i will discuse below . honestly speaking , most advertisement aim is to promote the product so people will will get fascinated and attracted which will result in buying the product . sometimes company use this a an advantage where customer get fooled and faked with the beautiful advertisement they saw in television . to give an example , once i wa watching a movie on the television and suddenly an advertisement showed on . my friend love car too much thats why he got interested in the product which wa promoted . it wa a car with a romote control working with petrol . he wa also fascinated on people servuy which they showed . my friend mike told me that it an amazing car . therefore , he decided and i could not debat with him on his decission . however , we went that night to the biggest mall in united arab emirates in dubai . we bought that product and come back home with a complacent and satisfied mood . to make thing clear we tried the product a soon a we reached home and what a depressed feeling mike got !! it wa not the car which wa showed on television . the car we bought wa not highly modified a we have seen it in the advertisement . we understand from this example that alot of product which show on advertisement may not be a real a it appear . on the other hand , advertisement are made better more than they are and this is to attract the customer . as a matter of fact , all business aim to make profit and i think advertisement is one of their policy . in conclusion , i want to say people must take care when buying a particulare product . therefore , we should not take our dicission just because of an advertisement .
