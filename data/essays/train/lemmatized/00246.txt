i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , because one subject is n't enough information . with all the broad knowledge of many academic subject we are studying , it 's been experimented that we only use 1 % of our brain . we should know about everything going on around u , if we specialize on one specific subject it will affect our future , the technology , and we 'd be missing on alot . god gave a a brain for a reason . for example if you choose to concentrate on physics , you ca n't study phyics without taking algebra . you could study many academic subject but concentrate on ur favorite subject more , this way you wont be missing on anything . imagine a world with no doctor , engineer or business . disease 's would spread because their wont be any cure for them . people would live in the street , and there wo n't be any street except a sandy dirty place . people would fight over anything they find because it doe n't belong to anyone , and there 's no grocery store or any shop . therefore alot of people will commite suicide , because there wont be anything to do . studying many academic subject is n't alot , you have 12 year of studying in school that is more than enough . then you graduate and go to university , you will still study there but le hour . you would be majored in any of you 're favoured topic and the rest would only help finishing you 're credit and wasting time so you would n't get bored . me myself i 'm a very lazy person and i would preffer if we do n't study academic subject , but if you think about it for a few second and imagine how you 're life would be you will imaditely change you mind , because there wo n't be anything to complain on and life would be useless .
