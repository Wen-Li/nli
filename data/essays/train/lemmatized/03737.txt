i agree with the idea that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept tahn it is for them to learn fact . is is because that way to studay is more efficient t ostudents in term of three point ; valiety , memory , and interest . first of all , by understanding the idea and concept , they can get valiety skill to solve many problem . in other word , they can use those information or learning in other field or other problem . for in stance , in mathmatiucs some people try to memorize only the main folmulas and skip to the example without understnading the concept . as a result , they might be able to solve problem in one particular field or problem ; instead of that , they can not solve in other part because they just try to think and use from example . secondly , if student understnad the idea and concept , it help them to memolize those for a long time . for , they connect some explanation or additional information with fact . if they do not do that and just memorize only the fact , they will forget easily becasue of no connection map in their brain . for example , a fpr history . if they remember the fact that a war happned during a period . .. how can they keep it in thier memory without haveing any reasoins why it happens or who did it . finally , the best way to learn for student is to enjoy the study . also in this point , the idea work well . actually it 's connected to second paragraph , but not only keeping the information in thiere brain for a loing time , it make the study more fun . the reason is that they have to use their brain a lot to understand idea and concept and connect with each other ; therefore student can learn without getting bored . it is the closest way to make acchievement on their study . in conclusion , bcasue od valiety , memory , and interest , student should undersatnd the concept and idea first
