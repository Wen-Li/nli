in our day , we can find many product to buy . some of those product are very usefull , or make life easier ( like tool , clothes , and so on ) , but other product are not so important . besides , now there are many company that are making the same product , so they need to compete in how they can win the preference of the people . that 's why advertisement need to show the quality of a product , to make feel the buyer that one specific product is the best one that he or she can find . but most of the time , they show the product much better that it is . one example of these is a cleaner product . a company creates a new detergent that , with the power of special `` air-beads '' , can make your clothe to seen whiter . they are going to charge you more money because of these new air-bead , but the true is that the old detergent that is been in the market for so long is doing the same thing , only that they not invented the fancy name of `` air bead '' . so , the power of advertisement can make you buy this new product , because you think is better , but in the end is doing the same think that your old detergent did . another example coud be a sport drink . in a tv commercial they show that the person who drink it fell so much better , with more energy ; now , he can run faster without felling tired . but these new drink is only rehydrateting the body , and is not giving you more energy . the life today is very different than the life that our grandparenths had . the materialism is everywhere and that mean that now you can buy many different prducts . so the company have to show that their product are the best , and the way to do it is with advertisement . maybe the difference between a x-sport drink and the y one is not so important , but a colorful or melodic commercial can make the difference in the moment the buyer decides wich product to buy .
