i personally feel that young people do enjoy more in their life than older people do . according to me the best period of a human being 's life is `` adolescence '' . young people have enough physical strength , mental capability , strong determination and will power to overcome hurdle and move further in their life . some peole may argue that young mind are generally burdened with matter like their future prospect and academic career , but younger generation ha an inner desire ( or we can say some sort of fire ) to succeed and excel in every field of life which extinguishes in older people . young people have very le responsibility a they are generally in safe hand of their parent or guardian . it 's true that no person can forget his school or college day ever . school life memory are always with a person till the end of his life . people who enjoy their life to the maximum are in the age group of 15-25 year . this period witness building and cemnting of friendship and relationship which are everlasting . a young person never hesitates in taking risk and is ready to venture into any new business . he isfree to fly in his dreamland , atleast he can dare to do so which is impossible for older people . adolescent people enjoy medium , entertainment , nature and almost everything the most . while older people are prone to more health disorder and are usually at the mercy of others . they are helpless and have to take help from others in certain matter . thus they are unable to enjoy their life . they always have responsibilites and a tired life .
