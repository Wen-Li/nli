i often watch advertisement on tv commercial or magazine . when i watch these advertisement , i always think that these advertisement are too much performance . the reason that i think such thing is that i have experience that there are big difference between advertisement and real one . therefore i agree with this statement . first of all , i watch advertisement on tv everyday . actually that advertisement are attracted me . and then i have experienced that i boght degital camera on tv shopping program . however when i got this camera , i wa really disappointed it . because the camera wa n't good . on the tv shopping program , i thought that the camera wa good . however , after getting it , i realized that that salesperson on the tv program explaned it too much . the person on the tv said that it is easy to use this camera , in fact i thought that this camera 's operation wa so complicated . in addition , when i worked for a bank , we were selling some stock . and then our bank wa using advertisement on tv . that advertisement said only good aspect . however not only me but also my coworkers thoght that that stock have also risk . i thought that our advertisments should announce about high risk and high return , and i thought that some costomers must be misunderstand about this investment . in fact some customer who watched our advertisement on tv misunderstood . they did n't know risk on this investment . i have bad experience about advertisement , when i wa customer , in addtion , i felt that our bank 's advertisement where i wa working for wa much better than real one . i understand that advertisement are strategy of sale . however i really think that it should n't do too much performance . because many customer might misunderstand . however , in fact there are many too much performance advertisement in the world . therfore i agree with the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
