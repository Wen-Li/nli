some people might say that it is great to have a mastery of a topic . i agree with them but i do n't think that being specialized in one specific subject is better than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject for several reason . first , in my opinion , having broad knowledge of a lot of different subject is very important . somebody can be very proud to have excellent an knowlege of biology , but is it really useful for today 's life ? does he live better than his relative ? i really do n't think so . i think that having a broad knowledge is important to live in a society . indeed , it 's more than recomended to know about math to look after the spending , to know about politics when time is comed to elected a new president or to give an opinion concerning a new law . .. knowing about all these academic topic that pepole use to learn at school is then definitely more useful everydays than having a mastery of one particular topic . another important point is that some academic subject are a guideline for people . for instance , history state the error done in the past , and the person who are aware of them are lickely to avoid them in the future ; generaly speaking , i would say that all the academic subject help to live in a society . moreover , i wonder how can somebody evoluate , grow up with only studying one specific subject . all the topic we study in class enable u to create our personality . without them , it 's impossible to decide what we like , what we dislike . .. for example , learning diferent topic definitely help teenager to know what they want to do in the future . to sum up , to have a broad knowledge in many academic subject is better than specialized in one specific subject for several reason : general knowledge is usefull to live in the world and it help to create the personality .
