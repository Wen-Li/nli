i disagree with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' learning idea and concept are a important a knowing the fact . by knowing about the fact , student becomes more practical , they know what idea and concept are been used in this world , by this he come to know about the real world . having knowledge of only idea and concept make student conservative by knowing fact they becomes outstanding . learning fact make student complete . it increase their knowledge and they become more innovative . this will improve their performance in study . just knowing the idea and concept without fact keep them in the dark . facts enlighten them . by knowing idea and concept they can do good in the exam , but fact make them to do better , when they get job . ideas and concept educates the mind by telling about the subject how it is invented or discovered but fact educates the soul of the student . education , only with idea and concept and no fact is waste . suppose for example we have learnt darwin 's `` survival for existence '' but later we came to know the fact that it wa wrong . so , i agree that kowing fact is a important a idea and concept .
