there are a lot of successful people around where you live . some people can think successful one take risk and other think they do not take risk . in this case i agree successful people inspire to do new thing . to begin with , they usually try to do new thing . they do not want to do the same thing people always do . for example , in growth , people usually go to school when they are young and step to a next stage which is high level school . then they go to college to get a great education to have a exellent job . but succesful people do not go to school if they do think it is un useful . thomas edison is the one who did drop school . in the same way , after growth , some people just go to work and go home . they would not like to change their life in the better way . but other are trying to do get another education to get a better job . to give you an example , there are many people to think successful life is having a professional job like being a doctor , lawyer or politican . they try to get in school . that make them special and successful . in contrast , there are still many people who give up what they want . maybe it is difficult to do in their life because of money , kid and a various kind of problem . that doe not make them unsuccessful . to sum up , we could see succesful people have risk . but it is true everybody can be successful . in realy , there is still question that successful people is the best noe in our world .
