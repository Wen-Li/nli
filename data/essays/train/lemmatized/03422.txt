i disagree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because that people have more self-confident than others . for this statement , there are a easy reason . when you do something successful , you are glad and you know that you can do something well . so you have more self-confident than other people who try to do something well but it doesn ' t want to be a they want . and this must be a reason in my opinoion , why successful people have to search a new challenge . often a new challenge brings some risk with it . but successful people shouldn ' t be worry about that . for them it should be nice to have a risk and to do something new . you can compare it with the word `` no risk , no fun '' ... perhaps for some successful people it could be boring to do the same all the day . in my opinion , they have to test something new . it is too easy to do what they already know how to do well . the problem is that these people can ' t improve their-selfs anymore in this way . this is bad and don ' t help them in their life . and for me , the life is only interesting that when you finish something that you have to find a new challenge in your life . than you have something in front of you what you can reach . i think that is important and not to do only thing , yo already know how to do well . that is too boring , i think . but perhaps , successful people only do something they already know how to do well to not become problem , because they aren ' t so good at the beginning like before . perhaps , these people are afraid of doing something new . but this can ' t be a reason to stop of doing something new . i think , it is too important to look for new challenge that you can ' t never stop it ; never now and never in your whole life .
