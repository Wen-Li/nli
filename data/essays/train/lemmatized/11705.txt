well , in my opinion it is important for the student to learn the fact , rather than understanding the idea and concept . because in my view the fact of any situation or the subject itself is more important . the fact form the real basic of that particular situation or topic . and fact are more understanding and beleiveble than having some kind of an idea or knowing the concept of the topic . for example if the student is working on a project related to the subject he is studing , then it is allways better for him to understand and learn the fact of that particular subject than just getting the idea about it . by learning the fact he could allways produce more information or the real work . if the project is about the topic in science . like the importance of nutrition in a human body . then it is better that the student understand the real fact of the importance of nutrition in human and then he can create some idea while doing some reserch on this topic and finally come to a conclution and understand the concept of the topic itself . furthermore , i would say that if the student ha only some idea about the importance of nutrition in a human body then he would not present a good and complete picture of the topic . thereby giving a superficial idea of the topic . and make it look verry simple . another example is if the student is studing studing in a medical college and attending an anatomy class , then he should realise and know all the fact of the part of the human body , and also the importance of them . if he ha just the idea and understand the concept of how the organ work then it would ` nt help much in getting the entire information and working of the human system . therefore by stating these example i would like to conclude that the fact are more important than idea or concept in a student life of learning or studing
