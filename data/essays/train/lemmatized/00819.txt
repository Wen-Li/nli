i strongly belive success requires to try new thing and take risk in the life . everyday is first day of rest of our life and can be a new refreshing start . a new start / change give more energy to accomplish . as we all know ; all method and way change by the time . even the way we think , we see the world need to be changed a well . the way people travelled , dressed ha been continiously changed over year . the way govermenst admimistrates , company advertises changed a well . even today war strategy changed . keeping same way and insisting in doing thing old fasion way can not be a key for success . we were not burn a a fully experienced educated person . during life or school we continously learn and experience thing . one time thing we thougt wa best to do may not be right to do later . even the the right thing we have been doing may not be best to do an other time . i exprienced these from my own life . i worked a a pizza maker for 3 year in the past . i wa a good professional pizza maker but i wa not happy with may job and never felt i wa successful . i never thought it wa right for my caracther and ability . i wanted do a different job have more action involved . i took risk of changing my job and established a company . now i sell overseas and earn lot of money . i go different part of the world and do different thing every day . i feel more happy and successful . successful is the level of life make you happy . if you dont feel happy with what you have or what you are doing you should take risk and change it .
