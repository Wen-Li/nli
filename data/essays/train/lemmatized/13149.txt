i agree successful people love to try new thing and take risk rether than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are few reason that i support . first , i think to be a successful person whose personality must be interest in anything . they like ti take adventatures and to do a lot of new thing that are general people do n't want to do it . for example . my father is a successful businessman . he wa born in a very small town in taiwan . in his family , there are no body want to go to big city to find a job . everyone is satisified with their life , thay do n't want to change their life style . even thought they know to stay in the country ca n't be rich , but they still love to stay in the country . my father is different with other people . he know if he work hard and know more about information from world , it must be help to his future and career . whatever how hard work , he always want to try and he never afraid of challanges . because he know that may be a good chance to change his life . and now he did it . second , i think if you never try new thing , you wo n't know how will be change in your world . if you want a successful life , you have to try everything . to find every possible successful reason and do n't be afraid of to make mistake . because any mistake can make you find out what 's problem in this situation and improve your ability . i believe to be a successful person need to spend more time to do a lot of thing and it must have a hard time to overcome . but one day when you become a successful person , you will know everything is worth .
