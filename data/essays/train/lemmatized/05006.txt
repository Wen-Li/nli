many company spend a lot of money in advertisment . also , they have special section and skilled people for advertisments . all these to market them product to customer . in my opinion , i totally agree with statment that most advertisments make product seem much better than they really are for three reason . first of all , any product in the world have advantage and disadvantage . the best product is that ha many advantage and few disadvantage . in all advertisments , only the advantage of product is seen but the disadvantage is not . if person see advertisement , the product will seem much better than it really is . second , most company use multimedi - text , sound , picture , vedio - in product advertisments . these combination of technology will put the product in the suitable environment that will effect on the custome . for example , if you would like to buy a television and you see advertiment about two kind of television . first one using multimedi that show the television with high resolution and you best program and best actor on it . second advertisment without using any technology . i think you will select the first one because you think is better even though if the first television an dsecond television are same in feature . finally , many company contract with beautiful men and woman or with famous player or actor to present in advertisments and use product . if you see product with your favorite player or actor , you will buy the product even though it is not good product . inconclusion , i totally think that product have le quality than they are appear in advertisments for three reasos . only advantage are presented on advertisments , company use mutimedi in product advertisments , and company contract with famous people to present in product advertisments . i think , we have to be accurate before buy any product especially if we see it in advertisment .
