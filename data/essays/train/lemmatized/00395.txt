the question being asked is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to rather specialize in one specific subject . in my eye this question brings up a very important issue in time of increasing interdisciplinary work . many company want their emloyees to work trans - or interdisciplinary and i personally think for this it is necessary to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , concerning the fact that human knowledge increase so fast nowadays i think it is almost impossible to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject such a leibnitz did for example . of course , a person can still have a good general education and can be interested in many thing , but when it come to knowing a lot about academic issue there is a limit . second i feel that only people who spezialize in a certain field will be able to find a good job in our society . especially in science it is necessary to have expert who know almost everything about their subject . because only those people will be able to get so deep into the topic that they will eventually find new solution to problem . and for getting so deep into the subject i am sure that it is crucial to focus and to specialize in one specific topic . naturally it is important to work together with people of different academic field , a it is wanted by interdisciplinarity strategy , but that doe not mean that everyone ha to everything . in my eye the best solution for current problem will be found when many expert will come together on one table and exchange idea . so , in conclusion i feel that nowadays it is just not possible to have such a wide range of knowledge and a a matter of fact i think that it is not necessary if people of different subject start working together .
