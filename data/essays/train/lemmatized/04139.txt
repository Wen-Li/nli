i agree with the statement , that successful people try new thing and take risk earlier than other people . in my opinion successful people know what to do for a well doing business . they are more confindet because of there success . i think only the developing of new way and new technology can make you successfull for a long time and that is what the they want to have . success for the rest of their live . they know that when they stay at there level , maybe the others will enforce them and then they fall down at a lower level . so the invention of new thing is also a defense mechanism . i think , if you are successful and you do the same work everyday than you get borred on what you are doing . for good and successful work you have to enjoy it and if it is borring you even can not enjoy it . another reason for taking risk is that the people maybee will not loose there job when they are unsuccessful . that give them the possibility to improve new procedure . propably the fact of beeing restless and of taking risk is the key for beeing successful . and when you are succesful it is easier to try new thing . think about a person how sell newspaper the hole day , if he try new thing for selling more newspaper , it can have a bad end for him . if his plan failed than he might loose his job and even that is the reason for him to not take the risk . all in all , i think the main reason for trying new thing is that the person who take the risk is much more self-convident like the others and self-convidence make winner .
