once i took an oral exam and it wa not going a well a i expected . in the end the professor said to me : `` i can see you have learned the topic but you have not studied it ! '' what did he mean with this sentence ? well , i learned all the fact and example from his lecture but during the exam i couldn ' t transfer them to the system he asked me about - it just wa n't enough . so if someone asks me if it wa more important for student to understand idea and concept than merely learning fact . i would tell him the following : depending in which field you are studying in fact and number change very rapidly over the year , so getting the whole concept might be the better approach . then it is very easy to get certain fact using the world wide web , but getting the right use out of them or find the right application is a thing you have to learn and be trained with . and then , if you understand the idea behind a process rather than learning the dull fact , the knowledge is preserved much better within your brain . most important of all if you get the idea and concept you can derive abstract method that can adopted to new situation and system . therefore they are more valuable than mere fact . but a always it is n't a black and white a it may seem in the first place . allthough i would put the stress on understanding the whole picture more than just the detail , fact and example can help you especially during the learning process . in the end ideas and concept backed with a few number and example give you a round profile and help you being a good student and becoming a competent worker , scientist , engineer or what else you choose to become .
