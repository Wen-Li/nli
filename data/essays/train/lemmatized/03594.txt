life is a very long journey with many different kind of period in it . we are born , than become an infant , a teenager , an adult , an elder and finally come to the end . each period ha good or bad part and enjoyable to live . the most important point in this journey is undoubted that you have just one chance to live each part and can not change the order . in my opinion , the most enjoyable period in this journey is youth . firstly , when you are young , you do not have to face any important disease that the elder body brings . human body is in it healtiest period and also the most good-looking one . young body are attractive , thus , you can do any sport , eat anything you want and these do not damage your health . it becomes a disaster when you can not eat something you want like chocolate or sweet , or else salty refreshment . secondly , older people have problem due to their appearance . they miss the body they own when they are young and each time they look in the mirror , they make another pace to depression . moreover , they lose their fertility according to their age and enter the menapose or andropose section ; these are reaaly hard time to face for people . in addition to that , when you are young , your manner can be accepted by public even they are not ethical , but when you are older you carry the burden of responsibility on your shoulder and you are not easily accepted a youngster by public . consequently , even being young is thought to be more enjoyable than being old , it depends on person living it . this is not an all black or all white situation and a person may have had an unhappy youth may have found happiness later when he is older . whatever the case is , life is beautiful everytime .
