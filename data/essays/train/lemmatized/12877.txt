many people can think that the more you go to school the more you will be able to understand the world . they think that going to university make you become an open-minded person . at the university you learn theory - idea and concept - but what will theory be useful for you if you have n't any practice - fact ? for example , i am a civil engineering student and at school i 'm learning science of structure or how calculate the rate of steel you have to put in concrete to make a good prestressed concrete ? the theory look pretty good . however in fact when you are on a site work all that theory is not helpful . it 's only the experience that will give you the good rate of steel . even if i think that understand the concept of prestressed concrete is very important , only the fact will show you how to be a good civil engineer . to illustrate , i will give my example . last summer i made a training course in a house building company . even if i had studied civil engineering for one year , i wa unable to give order to plumber or electrician or other handworkers because i did n't know in fact , in reality , on the site , how they can execute the plan . i think that concept and fact must be taught together . you have to understand the concept and to know to what they are related to in the real world . it 's important to always be connected to the reality . an idea without it application can be misunderstanding . speaking of aids without speaking of the real danger in all country , without speaking of africa 's problem could make a student think that it ca n't happen to him , that it is a rare disease , that he 's not conerned . that is not acceptable .
