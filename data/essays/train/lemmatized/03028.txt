if one intends to be a tourist , it is logical to form part of a group and hire a tour guide . however , if one want to be a traveler , a path that i have always chosen when visiting country , one must be independent . one must fully experience the culture of a country , go beyond tour guide and give oneself space to explore and savor the aspect of one 's interest . groups and tour guide only confine the experience and more often than not leave the tourist disappointed . a group limit one 's option . for example , if a person is interested in art more than in shopping , he or she might have to be satisfied with the time given to explore an art museum in a group 's schedule . on the other hand , if one is not part of a group , one can spend whatever time one want in an art museum , avoiding what would probably otherwise be a somewhat superficial experience . a group also often ha a budget . if a person is highly interestd in the gastronomic aspect of a culture , he or she might be willing to spend more money on food quality and variety . nevertheless , a group doe not provide this flexibility . getting a tour guide is often a recipe for disillusionment . tour guide have a schedule , and are probably not willing to linger on any specific monument or work of art . more importantly , it is difficult to truly appreciate a culture without reading or investigating about the country being visited . being confident a tour guide will provide all the information may lead traveler to neglect research prior to visiting , often a the result of an overestimation of the tour guide 's knowledge and passion for his or her job . lastly , tour guide often lead visitor to the infamous `` tourist trap '' : location , store or restaurant often exalted by guide and book that are not worth so much praise in reality . without a tour guide , one can avoid such scam and disappointment by doing independent study and choosing which place to visit . while travelling in a group led by a tour guide is often convenient and le expensive than planning the adventure alone , it take away value from the actual trip . i , for one , greatly value independence and enthusiasm when going to a foreign country . thus , my option is always counting my family a my group and being my own tour guide .
