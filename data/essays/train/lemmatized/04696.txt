in the following i will try to discus the statement and show example in addition to my argument . first of all , we got to make sure that advertising product is a very important factor in today economical competition . the advertiser ha to advertise the product , because in the competition of the market there will be a lot of similar product and much more that are alike . the better the product is advertised , the more people will buy it . the advertisement ha to be a funny , a inventive , a surprising , a basic a possible depending on the target group . usually the advertisement try to focus the people 's interest on the product . of course the product is allways presented in the best light and the weakness are hidden , but the people now have the possibility to get information on the product and in today medium there are many way . there are paper on allmost every topic , from car to plant in your garden . the internet provides an amount of product test and mostly the product is just a better form of a former product , that should already known . because of these possibility of informing oneself , i think it is not the fault of the advertisement if someone is disappointed about a product . but sometimes you get the feeling that the producer ha spent more time on the advertisement than on the product itself . only at this point , i think i can agree with the statement . but developing a bad product and only focussing on the advertisement will be discovered soon by the user and affect the sale of the product badly . therefore i think it 's not in the interest of the company to bring bad product on the market and cut there own skin . lastly , it is very important to be aware that advertisment is a necessary part of a product circle and in that context i can not agree with this statement .
