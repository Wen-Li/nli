i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is interesting to observe successful people , they always try to invent new thing , invest in new business , practice different sport , help their child to improve their life by placing them in excellent school , university , making their child to practice sport , learn different language and in that way they are going to continue being successfull and perhaps their child continue with them hand to hand in their journey and by doing these they feel even more successful . for a successfull person there is always a chllenge , a risk that ha to be taken in order to continue his or her legacy , interesting or not that is the way they keep it up in order to gain , win and have success , and feel they are above of everyone . we have to remember that these people already won and that perhaps , they think , that they have nothing to lose by trying new thing , and by taking new risk , that is why they continue being on top of the would by their positive attitude and their challeging idea . we also have to remember that eventhough they are successful they can also make mistake and lose everything they have accomplished throughout their life . . but it is in their attitude , specially positive attitude that make them recover eventhough going against all odds and eventhough they do not recover from one , two event they will take this new challenge again , and risk . we have to think that we are all successful people because we are , we are healthy , we have a job , we know a different language which give u different and more challenging opportunity that at the end are going to help u even more in order to help others to be successful a well .
