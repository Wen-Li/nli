i do not agree that younger people enjoy life more than older people do . altough young people are physically more active and healthier then the older , thus , may have more energy to engage in enjoyable activity , older people have also some advantges of the old age provide them . young poeple are energetic and active , hence , often dominate most of the daily life activity we see around . however , when compared to older people , younger one have more responsibilty , which hinders their opportunity to enjoy life . for example , i and my sister are working in full time job , which make u to spend all day in work . besides that , we are studying for graduate degree and this take most of our free time . however , my granparents who are now enjoying their retirement year , spend their day with shopping , wandering around , travelling and hosting family member in the weekend . another advantage older people have is that they have been cared by other family member more than the younger one have been . in my culture , senior people are highly respected . they have been consulted for experience they have and for the knowledge they acquired throughout their life span . that is , they are often visited by familty member , by relative , which is giving them opportunity to interact socially even sometimes more then young people do . one other point is that having developed a mature taste of preference , older poeple do not spend time trying new thing spend their time in a more quality way . yet , young people generally like trying new thing a if they have not developed permanent life preference . in other word , young people can be thought a they are still in their life cycle , which can be characterized by flcutuations in taste and preference . therefore , i can not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . both age group have their own advantage and disadvantage . while young people may be healthier and more active than old people , older people can enjoy many different aspect of life . the more important thing is that regardless of the age you are in , one should know how to enjoy life .
