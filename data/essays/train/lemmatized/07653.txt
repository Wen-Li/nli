i agree when it is said that successful people try new thing and take risk to reach theire purpose . but i think that this is just one side of success . in fact nobody could ever have success if he is not lucky too , neither `` successful people '' . obviously if you always stay attached to thing that you already know , maybe you could live a normal life , but surely you will never have success and this is why i agree with part of the statement above . successful people always try to reach new goal and try to be involved in different situation . this is a risk , because they leave something known for something but a i previously said , you have to be lucky . even in literature there is a good example of what i am saying . if we analize the `` malavoglia '' , book written by g. verga , we could find exactly the explanation of my thought . when ` ntoni , one of the main character of the story , took the family 's boat `` la provvidenza '' and sail to a new harbor looking for success , the fortune were not with him . in fact he lost everything during a storm , broke the boat and that had been the beginning of a lot of problem for his family . maybe this could be too much strong a example , but i think that it give the idea of what i think about the statement to argue . so , i certainly agree with the statement , but if i could , i would complete it saying that successful people are even lucky people .
