there are some reason to agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . first , tour guide have knowledge for travel place . tour guide can introduce important part of travel place and important object . for example , our family went to new york , in 2004 . that time , we did n't have a tour guide . first time , we feel ok . when we leave that country , we do n't have some knowledge of that country . we feel very bad . but tour guide cover this kind of thing . secondly , tour guide give safety . other country have different people , different society and different place . if we have no tour guide , we can lost the way or dangerous from other people . for example , i see atricle of newspaper . that article 's story is dangerous of sole travel . in that artical there are two student . two student enjoy their travel . but last day , one student go to some place . that student lostes the way . suddenly , gangster kidnaps that student . people ca n't find that student . tow month later , that student 's parent find that student in other city . that student seat some place . that student look like bulge . when parent find student , that student ha no leg and arm . gangster cut them and threat him . this kind of article give very important thing of tour guide . tour guide can cover this kind of action . thirdly , we can meet mane people in group led . we life in common community . and we can make friend or helpful people . when we need some help , we can need some help from guide and group people . consquently , i agree the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide .
