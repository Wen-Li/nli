i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i have three reason for it . first of all , it would not be good , if you have some kind of specific thing that you want to see . because of too many people , you have to come back within a time and you can not spend time what you want to see or experience . i think it is better to travel by yourself or with small number of people , if you do have . therefore , you can spend , experience , a much time a you want . you do not have to care about time or others . it will be your own travel , not for travel for everyone . second , if you travel in a group with a tour guide , it mean that you can not do whatever you want . you sometimes follow order , such a time and going to bathroom . for example , you have to see whats in the tour . you might not in interested in the thing , but you have to walk around and see with group . another example is when everyone go to a bathroom , you should go there , too . otherwise , you might want to go to bathroom later . but it would bother others and kill time for everyone because you travel with others . you always have to think and caqre about others . on the other hand , if you go by yourself , you will be able to skip what you do not want and spend more time what you want to see . i think you can enjoy your trip more without caring others or stress from others . lastly , i think it is good for you to travel by yourself before trip , such a when you make plan and study about the place and culture . because you have to travel by yourself , you might have to research about the place in detail in order to make your travel better one . you also might have to study about the language they use beforehand . then you will get opportunity to use your research and language over there . i think after the travel , you will become more familiar with the place , culture and forth . i am sure you will never forget the travel because you created . ! if you travel with others plan , through the agent , i do not think everything will be perfect or satisfy you throughly . i guess you will complain with something at least once because you do not make it . in conclusion , i think the best way to travel is individual . then i think you can spend a much time a you want , study about whatever you like , whatever you want to do . also you willl be able to make a trip more enjoyable and better one than plan that others make . because of those reason , i would prefer to travel by myself , but not going with a group led by a tour guide .
