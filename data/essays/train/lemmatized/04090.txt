i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . it is very important for young people to help their community , because the society is not made of individual rather a group of people . today , the most of the young people have neglecting attitude towards their community . they dont care what is happening in their community and what is being done is correct or not . there are several reason for such an attitude among young people towards their community . first of all , they are not motivated enough to help their community . their parent and other family member do not tell them about their duty towards their community . they dont encourage them to help their community . this may be because of the several reason like the family dont have enough time to spend time with their child and talk about all these . secondly , now a day young people dont get enough time to help their community . now young people have more responsibilites , more competition to face . the study have become more tougher . students have to take lot of examination to get admission into school and college . so they spend most of time thinking and preparing about their study . this stop them from thinking about their community . for example , a student who is preparing for an entrance to get admission into a graduate school will have limited time to think about his responsibility towards his community . also young people think that it not their duty alone to help their community . they have a wrong notion in their mind that why only they should help their community , and not the others belonging to the same community should come forward and help . so they keep waiting for the others only to take the initiative and finally nobody make a positive move . but the young people should realize that even they are part of the community . they should think that if they help now , they will get the help when they require it . so they should understand their responsibities and try to find some time to helping their community .
