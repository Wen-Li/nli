many peolpe have one or even more car . in today time they have become very important to many people and they can not miss them anymore . i do not agree with the statement : in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in my oppinion ther will not be many disadvanatges of car in the future anymore . there will be other source of energie for car that neither would be so bad for the environment nor would they be so expensive a energie is today . as a result , many people would like to drive their car just because it is fun . because driving a car will be extremly secure in twenty year , there will be other type of car invented that will be used just for fun . even poor people will be able to drive a car just for fun . driving in a car would be much more comfortable than it is today . in addition to that there will be a better system of street ; a a result , there will not be so much traffic anymore . so all in all there will not be many disadvantage left . in twenty year the peolpe will be more bussy than today . therefore they will need the car to move fast from one point to another . it will be very important to have a perfect time-management . the peolpe also will use the car in other way a today . they will use their car for meeting with other people or to have a braek and eat something in the car . in my oppinion the car will play another role in the whole live of the people . all these argument support my oppinion , and show why i do not agree with the statement . the car is very important to many people today and because of the development of the problem , not to have enough time , it will be impossible to miss the car for the most people . as a result , there will be many car in twenty year .
