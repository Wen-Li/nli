i do not agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . personally , i think that people who are 60 or older would enjoy their life much more that younger people , especially people who are between that age of 16 to 50 . i agree the reason for being young is to have fun and enjoy life , but that doe not mean that only young people can have fun , and older people would definitely have boring life . for example , my grandmother who live s in china is 70 year old , but i have never heard her coomplaining about her life is boring . even though she life alone at home , but she still ha her social life like i do . she signed up for a ballroom dancing class at the local learning center , and go there three time a week . since then , she ha made many more friend , and because she is very good at dancing , she feel that is the place that she belngs to . as for me , i have made friend in my school since i moved here , and i constantly hang out with them . another reason i think that older people would enjoy life more than younger people is because most of the people who are 60 or older are retired , they do n't have to work anymore . which mean they do n't have to deal with the all the pressure from work or school , perhaps the relationship between co-worker and boss . i can see that every night when my parent come home from work , they always look exhausted , but they still have to cook , and finish the rest of their work after dinner . they also have to face other problem such a morgages , bill , my college tuition and more . on the other hand , my grandmother , who is already retired , she doe not have to worry about thing like that , she can just relax and enjoy the rest of her life . therefore , i do not agree with the statement and i think that older people can enjoy their life even more .
