many people belive than younger generation are different from the older one and they do n't posse the same moral and manner a the elder have . or they may be le responsible or le cooperative with other member of society . i do n't know from where this idea came from . i belive that every generatin ha a bright side and a dark one . it is not fair to generalize an idea wether is bad or good over large number group of population , becuase simply we not the same . i believe that people are differnet and vary from person to another regardless the age or the time or the place they belong to . each generation ha it own life condition and atmosphere that could have a great impact on people behavior , like weather , finacial status , education , civelization , cultural development , belief and society custom . what work with one generation doe n't mean that it work with another . i do n't see any valuable mean of that statment . there are still mush of goodness in people , people stil tell this time helping each other , providing service to commmunity without asking for reward . there are many feeding poor hunger people on the other side of the world . the are some still have th working volenteerly with human organization to save others and to give hand who really need help . me my self with other school collegues participate in a volenteer job in red crecent organization in palestine . we were working a a medical laboratory technologist in a very poor pemetive laboratory at the hospiatal . we had worked a a team to help poor and severly injured patient in any pssible way we got to help them . we were collecting sample from them try to diagnose their health problem to make them feel soon healthier .
