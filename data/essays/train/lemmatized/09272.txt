when we are student , most teacher teach u idea , concept , and fact . i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . this is because there are several benefit . one is that we can use the idea and concept not only one case . it mean that learning the idea and concept make u intelligent . for example , my teacher who teach middle school always say that it is meaningless to remember the answer . it is more important to think that why it is happen or occure . to understand the idea and concept is going to be not only the memory but also the power of thinking . the other is that the fact is not always true . for example , famous tv show wa stopped in japan last week . this is because the tv show said completely faked thing . if people do n't know the idea and concept , they only beleive the fact even if that is incorrect . we get the knowledge from researching . when we doubt something , we have to check and find the true fact . in order to get the true fact , we should understand the idea and concept . so , teacher want u the flow to lead the answer during the test . concequently , i agree that understanding idea and concept is more efficient for student than learing fact . above those , one is that idea and concept proveide u the power of thinking . the other is that fact is not always true . we need to research something in themselves .
