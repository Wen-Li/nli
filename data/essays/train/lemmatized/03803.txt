in my opinion it is more important for a student to understand idea and concept than it is for him to learn fact . first of all , when a student learn a lesson , it 's more important for him to undertand the meaning of his lesson than just read and repeat what he ha just red . for example in law class , after reading fact the teacher always try to make the student understand the reason why the juge take a decision . first , the juge analyse the fact through the law text , and after that he use the custom , the moral , and the social attitude to understand reason of those fact and to take a decision . secondly , in a passage analyse , a student ha to know `` what '' appened to be abble to understand `` why '' this think appened . for exemple a writer who describe a storie wo n't just give you the fact , because it doe n't make sen whitout the context , so he will give to the reader all the reason why those fact happened to help the reader understand idea that he defend and the concept of his story . this logical process is very important for student because the fact do n't make ghim understand the reason why he learn his lesson . to finish , i think that learn fact and understand idea and concept are bothe important but they must be together for a better comprehension of the student .
