as the saying go `` rolling stone gathers no moss '' . sucess lie in exploration involving risk . from the example of the famous person i infer that risk must be taken to achieve sucess . by keeping in view of the life history of many scientist sucess wa achieved only by experimenting and not by just doing research on thier known one . the electricity which is an essential part of our life wa a fruit of experimenting . it is this experimenting which brings the sucess . we can take the life of few succesfull person such a the world 's richest man mr billgates and many more all of them were popular by trying out new one rather than just doing what they know to do well . we can even cite the example of the famous sport icon saurav ganguly who wa initially a football player but now he is famous for his cricketing capability . it is the experimenting of a new field which made him such a famous and sucessful person . great person have achieved the glimpse of sucess by trying out various field . late dirubai ambani ha a vast empire and ha establised himself a a gaint in many field . he ha a lot of determination too along with experimentation of his thought in various field and attained sucess . if neil armstong did not take the risk of travelling on to moon he might never have been in our page of history , he might have just ben passed away a an ordinary astronomer . one must not get disturbed when he fails in his attempt rather he must shift to another field and try his capability . our life is a short one and it need to prove it worth . so we must acquire a much knowledge a possible in a many field . but before trying out a new one we must learn some basic aspect of the field and know the key to sucess in that field . as we all know failure are the stepping stone for sucess we must try out new thing though there might be failure . so in this present generation sucess can be attained by trying out new thing and taking the required risk .
