it is not easy to say which is the better approach , but i personally do not agree with the statement , because i think that a broad knowledge of many academic subject is not a good a specializing in one specific subject . i say this for two main reason . the first reason is that it is more practical for student . i mean , if you can concentrate on one subject it will be easier for you to learn lot of thing on that subject and you will be able to become prepared . but when i say `` more practical '' i refer also to the fact that studing one subject instead of more than one is good for the student 's path . i mean , once a student ha entered the subject he should know what that subject requires , what the important aspect are and he would be able to organise his study in the best way . maintaining your mind open to a lot of subject is a big effort . it is true that keep your mind open could be a good thing , giving you a wide range of knowledge , but the question is if this knowledge will be useful in your future . this question brings me to expose the second reason that support my opinion . i argue that specialising will be useful for working . companies , or institution , usually do not hire people who have a generalistic approach , that know a lot of thing , but that remain on the surface of them . companies require people to be expert in something and to become an expert you have to get into thing , to discover all the aspect , to prevent all the problem . as for my personal experience i have to say that i 'm in a class with a very generalistic approach and i think it is not good . i 'm glad that i 've got a solid basic culural background , but i am sincerely worried about my future . you could ask me why i am in such a class and the answer would be that i do not know . when i chose my class i thougth it wa more specialistic , but i wa wrong , but i think to be lucky a well because i had the opportunity to attend lot of intersting course and to meet lot of good professor .
