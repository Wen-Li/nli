traveling in a group led by a tour guide have advantage and disadvantage . first , people who travel with group by a tour guide can learn many information from a tour guide . in addition , they can improve their knowledge about place which they visited . second , it is opportunity to make new friend in a group . furthermore it is enjoyable talking and seeing new place with other people . because of different opinion about new place , people can share their idea and enjoy with a group . on the other hand , traveling in a group can be stressful because people must think other people and listen a tour guide . they can not be more independent . i prefer traveling with my family because i feel more comfortable when i see new place and show my opinion . i deem that i can learn information about place with traveling in agroup led by tour guide . on the other hand , my family say about the historical place and it information . we are more dependent and if we are getting the place , we can change our way to other place . in my country , turkey , people usually prefer to travel in a group led because it is le expensive then traveling with their family but it is more stressful and exhausting . furthermore , because of economic situation in turkey , people can not effort to travel other contries or to travel with themselves . in conclusion , i would like to travel with my family and my friend eventhough it is expensive in my country . i have come to america by myself , now i struggle to learn information about america by myself .
