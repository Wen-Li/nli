whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than specialize in one specific subject depends on the range and variety of academic subject . in my opinion , to be a specialist in one subject would prove to be more advantageous than to be competent in various field . the main reason for my view is that to specialize in one subject would mean that the person becomes a pioneer in that field . he would be qualified to make contribution to his chosen field . for example , when a person specializes in civil engineering , he would become a qualified person to speak on the topic and to offer his service to the public . to major in one subject would mean that the person would be empowered to forsee change and paradigm shift , that could be for the better or worse , in the field . if for the worse , he would be in a position to make a positice difference . another reason for my view is that , a fully qualified professional would be able to engage himself in high-end research thereby enabling him to make technological advance . some may say that to be a competent speaker on varied topic would enable a person to have a farther reach and bigger sphere of influence . yet , it ha to be acknowledged that a man who is a specialist in a field will be able to make a stronger influence on those around him . others might cite that to specialize in one field would be to limit a person 's perspective . however , a specialist in a field would not only have a good perspective but also a vision . this vision would enable him to achieve an envisioned goal . specifically , it ha to be stated that to set and achieve goal , a person would have to be a specialist in the field . for instance , only a qualified electronics engineer would be able to improve the satellite communication technique and not a newspaper editor , who would be competent to speak on varied subject . admittedly , if the person wish to enter another field to enhance his knowledge , his oppurtunities would be limited considering his poor prior knowledge . but the upside is that there is rarely a dearth in demand for specialist in a field . to be a pioneer in his chosen field would enable the person to mentor budding people and to guide others and hence contributing back to the people . in conclusion , to specialize in one subject would be more benefical , not only to the person but also to the community . i would agree that having varied interest is beneficial but on balance , this should be supported by a mastery in one subject .
