in my opinion , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . i am of this opinion for different reason : firstly , you need the knowledge of many different academic subjetcts to understand a specific subject totally . for example , you can not understand literature without historical knowledge . knowing what a novel or play is about is just not enough , additionally you must know something about the time in which the literature wa created or the society the author lived in . this knowledge will not be presented in literature class , so you need to deal with history , too . secondly , studying one specific subject is only succesful if you have thought about the subject from all possible perspective . understanding something only from one point of view creates the risc that you do not know enough about critic or different opinion . for example , there are many different opinion about evolution . if you are specialized on biology only , you will never learn some other theory or you will never understand how american theologist can argue against darwin 's evolution theory . additionally , a reason why i think that having a broad knowledge of many subject is the better option , is that some specific subject contain question that can not be answered by this specific subject alone . a very good example is medicine : you can study medicine without ever getting in touch with ethic , but during your career , you will need ethical knowledge to make some important decision . it is impossible to be a good doctor if you are only interested in medicine ; you have to be interested in ethic and the human society in general , too . in conclusion , we can say that the best way is deciding which subject you are the most interested in then and study on it . at the same time you always have to keep in touch with other academic discipline to become not only an expert of one specific subject , but to get a wide general knowledge .
