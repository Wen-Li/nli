i agree with the statement that idea and concept are more important for student than fact . an important purpose of learning is to develop one 's cognitive ability a well a to develop one 's power of understanding and analyzing pattern of event or fact . a number of expert also develop the cognition and the ability to predict event or result in the future by extrapolating information or fact on these theory and pattern . the physical science are based upon testing of hypothesis and development of theory . specific fact are not an important feature in their learning . the social science too are increasingly getting inclined towards developing theory and concept . for example , student of history study past civilisation including their rise and fall across region and time . they come across a lot of detail about each of the event and feature that characterizes the various development through history . however , it is important for them to understand the pattern , idea and the reason of these event rather than the nitty-gritty detail of the event per se . they are taught to identify similarity in pattern of rise and fall of civilisation rather than the exact date for each of the event or specific of historical artefact and culture . similarly , student of economics study various economic system that have existed across country and through various period of time . they seldom memorize detailed economic indicator of each of these system . rather , they study and learn the principle these economy were based upon , the pattern of their growth and the cause of their rise or fall , a the case may be . present day economist use this learning to develop policy that would help society meet it desired objective . thus for the learning to be useful in this case , knowledge of fact is not important , understanding economic idea and concept are .
