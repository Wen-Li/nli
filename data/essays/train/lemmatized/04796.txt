i disagree with the statement that nowadays young people should not participated in community program . becuse nowadays most of the people are educated and they are realized and planning in what way they can help to the people . recently tsunami occured in srilanka , at that time group of engineer from india went to that place and helping for their construction of shelter and arranged the necessary good like food , clothing for them . because `` servicing to the people is servicing to the god '' . moreover , many college are part time college . so , student have enough time to participate in nss ( national social service ) program . since government encourage this program in our country in such a way that every one should participate in cultural program . i have also participated in nss program . when i wa participted i wa always `` cloud nine '' . i gave suggestion to my friend and they are also participated in many activity . for other instance , most of the american people participated in rebuilding of afganisthan , most of them are young , do n't you think ? . in my opinion nowadays people motivate themselves , spend most of their past time for helping to the people . because of formar legislator and politician ha explained how people should respond in critical situation . finally i concluded that nowadays young people undersand the situation and are very well respond in relative situation .
