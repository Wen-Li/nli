i can not really agree with the statement . in my oppinion it is better to be specialized in one specific subject than to have a knowledge of many academic subject . i think in today world company want people to know everything about the area they work in . what should a company do with someone how know from everything a bit but doe not really have fundamental knowledge about a certain area . that is also a reason why i decided to study a specialiced subject . i for examble study international finance which is a small part of the big economical area . i think for myself that this decicon the best wa i ever did . because their are so many people who study economics i mean good they may have a broad knowledge about all area but at the end they would not be able to understand the financial sector a good a i can . as far i know company are looking specially for people from the financial sector which are specialized in that field . which advantage and disadvantage would it have ? on the on side with a broad knowledge you might be more flexible . because those people could work in all economical area they want . on the other side i am not sure if a broad knowledge is enough to fullfil your aim and make the big money . you can work in all economical area but to became at top manager you should know about the fiel you are about to manage . that is a advantage me with only a specialized knowledge . i would know about the area i am about to manage and would know how to handle the problem which might occur . a disadvantage really is that i am really stucked onto the financial sector . if i want work i am not that flexible like i would be with a broad knowledge . but if i add up all those disadvantage and advantage it is still good for me to be only specialized in one subject . i may only have this oppinion because i am very interested in that area i am study . but figure do not lie company at the end prefer specialised employee .
