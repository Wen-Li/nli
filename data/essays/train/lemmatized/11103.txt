if you read the statement for the first time , you probably would agree at once , but after some thinking i disagree with that statement . though reason like `` young people are in good shape to do everything they want '' or `` young people do n't know any sorrow '' come to one 's mind immediately i do n't think these are the deciding fact concerning this question . moreover , i would say that older people have the great advantage to know real friend or even to have partner or a own family with whom they can share their luck . when you are young , people come and go , but older people know better with whom they want to share their whole life . furthermore , older people found out their real passion and can spend their time on them . as a child you maybe try to do a lot of different thing , like playing soccer or tennis , but you do often quit them after a while , because you are not satisfied . in opposite to the older generation , who got to know themselves better over the year and therefore can fill their spear-time with activity they really enjoy . above all , older people are more experienced than the younger are . this is the deciding reason why i disagree with the quotation . there are many beautiful thing happening in the world that you do n't see a a young man or wowan , because you are busy with yourself or occupied with non-important issue . a beautiful landscape , for example , mean a lot to older people but younger people maybe do n't even take notice of that . everyone can see another example when you look into an ordinary parc in a city . in general there are more older people hanging around and i think that fact show that they know better how to fill their life with joy and fun . the conclussion of that essay must n't be scary to anyone . in the end it say that we are all winner . the older generation , because they are probably enjoying the best time of their life but also the younger generation , because they can look forward to it .
