nowadays , many people go traveling to many different country . tourism is getting popular in every country . some people go traveling using well-planned tour with a tour guide . other do n't . i prefer to going traveling alone to going traveling in a group with a tour guide . first , it is difficult to go somewhere that i want if the tour is well-planned by a tour guide . in my case , i would like to stay a long a possible if my feel is good in special place . in contrast , if i feel unconfatable to stay in one place , i would like to leave soon . however , if many people are in the tour , it is difficult to change the plan . those thing make me unconfatable . second , meeting many local people and other traveller is one of favorite thing for me in my trip . if i travel alone , i can meet many people . however , if i belong to the group of the tour , the chance of meeting local people or travellars will decrease . comunication using local language give me more excelent experience . third , getting more exciting and adventuous thing is my favorite part for travelling . even though it is difficult to find my distination , i feel that i am traveling now while finding my direction . actually , i have to dicide everything for the trip . yet i like to prepare everything before i go travelling . moreover , looking for the history by myself before the trip is important to plan the trip interestying . if people use the tour , they tend not to looking for the information about the country that they go . in conclusion , going travel by myself make me more excited than going travel in a group by a well-planned tour . in addition , my maturity will get better through meeting many interesting people who live in different country and deciding everything by myself . as a result , i usually go traveling by myself .
