it is hard to imagine the fact with concept . they are both interrelated . i agree that student should concentrate more on understanding the idea and concept because it is difficult to understand the fact without knowing the concept behind it . it is easy to clear the concept and understand the idea while studying because we have the help at hand and our teacher and mentor are there to correct u . for example if i see a patient with a swelling and without any history and clinical examination i can not tell what swellingit is and how i am going to manage it . to reach the diagnosis i need to clear my concept to take a proper history and to examine this swelling . then i need to know the common sweelings found in the specific area and the pathology . i should know how to investigate this swelling and than i will be able to reach the correct diagnosis and would be able to treat this efficiently . as i am in the learning phase and during my training i have been able to learn these basic concept with the help of my trainer and mentor . therefore before jumping to know the fact we should know the basic concept first a i go through the basic thing befor reaching the diagnosis . another example when a child grows up he speaks only few word initially and doe not start speaking the complete sentence fluently because he try to learn the basic thing before he can speak and perform like adult . in conclusion i would like to say that learning the idea and basic concept first is very important and if we do not follow this principle then we will only know the fact not the concept behind them . if it happens our knowledge and study will have no meaning because the main purpose of the education uisto make u aware of the concept .
