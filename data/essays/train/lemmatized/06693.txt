i agree with the following statement . i feel so because name like mother teresa , nelson mandela who devoted there whole life towards upliftment of the human fraternity , have now become only the character in the history text book . one could find young name engrossed in any kind of eugenic activity in only lilliputian amount . the passion , the zeal towards one 's country , one community or fraternity ha effaced in the annals of history . one of the paramount reason behind this is that world today ha become much more relaxed than it wa before . i particularly feel that `` need '' is the root of all deed . young generation doe not see any `` need '' to practise such activity a the `` mileu '' around them is much more out of sufferrings a it wa a few decade ago . another reason is the lack of appropriate moral teaching being given to them . attitude doe not change overnight , right from childhood one ha to inculcate these feeling in one 's persona . moral teaching are much more pedantic or limited to bookish knowledge , and hence they are not able to feel the suffering around the world . they are not taken to rendevouz with the real world , like the world prevailing in the part of africa . therefore youngster remain in there own blue and hence are not aware of the present scenario . to conclude , i think that medium ha a lot of role to play in arousing the blood in these people to flutter . media can be in any form , may it be television , newspaper or sophisticated internet tool . thinking of our young generation is largely influenced by the monster caled medium , they think what medium think . hence if medium play a vital role in changing the thinking of young people from , rather than being indifferent to their community to feel concern towards their community then it could have an comprehensive effect on the current scenario .
