i agree the statement that , from the past we come across the fact that younger people enjoy their life more compared to the older people . people enjoy their life alot when they are young . younger people ha the stamen and consistency to do the their work which can not possible for the older people . the are several reason that old people can not enjoy more than the young . firstly , because their stamen is not consistent after becoming older . there are several fact , some og them are they can not eat their own food , they can not getup themselves unless a person can help them . secondly their maturity mind will not be same a when they are younger . for example , my grandmother who is 80 year old she can not do her own work by herself desperatly she a need help either from my mom or dad . for instanace one day my grand mother sicked up and she can not move a side from her bed then my mom helped her to take bathroom . these are the some of fact of peole whose age is arround 60 's . we can know from the above statement that older people arround 60 's can not do their own work then how can they enjoy like younger childrens of 10 - 20 year child . once , when i are palying cricket in groung near by side of my house , my grand father came and said he want to play the cricket . he played a single ball he suffered from severe chest pain . the older people ha no consistant and stamen compared to the younger one . older people arround can enjoy their life in different fassion by leaving with their childerns and sparing alot of time with grand childrens . ofcousre what they will expect more than that . their are both advantage and shortcomes for younger and older people enjoyment . younger people enjoy playing with others and palying joke and roaming here and their in bike . most of the time people enjoy while they are in school . the older people enjoy in their fashion buying some toy and neccessity item for the grand childrens and made them happy ofcousre no one can expect much more than that . hence , i conclude that younger people enjoy their life in their own fassion and older people enjoy in differently from youngers which mentioned earlier in the passage . i prefer both palys an important role in their life .
