in general i do not agree with the satetment that most advertisementes make product seem much better than they really are . i say `` in general '' , because there are some exception where the advertisment show you the perfect situation , which in real life is unlikely to happen . from the top of my head i can recall an advertisment that showed two people in a laundry room . destiny or the same brand of cigarette got them together , showing in the end that they lived together happily ever after thanks to that one situation . this is a clear case where they show cigarette and smoking a lot better than it is . another example would be the advert selling service , a bank , supermarket , a public office , etc , are some unfortunate example of how the service shown ha nothing to do with reallity . however , most of the advertisments people are exposed to have no other alternative than to show you the product . so , when you see a car ( for instance ) , you have a realistic and clear idea of what the car is like . evenmoreso , the advert make easier to the buyer the process of the decission at the time of the purchase after having a first visual contact with it through the advert . also they can save time once a person know exactly what is looking for . to conclude , i think that people should always appeal to common scense . think about their need and economical posibilities , and not get carried away by fantasy or advertisments in the few case where the advert show a product much better than it really is .
