i disagree with the following statement because i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject . in my opinion there is a lot of advantage because you can do some job better than other and also you can know all about a specific subject . the first point that i 'd like to make is that if you are specialized in one specific subject , you could work better than other , who ha broad knowledge of a lot of thing . it is important because you could find work easier than other . also you could solve a lot of problem for example in your office or in the factory where you work . another fundamental aspect is that you can know all about it , i think that in this way you can achive high result and you can answer all question about it . on the other hand you do n't have knowledge of all other academic subject , but it doe n't matter because i think i will do only a specific work during my life . i know people who get good grade in only one subject and they know a lot of detail about it , so in my opinion they can do all about it without problem . this is simply fantastic . in fact some artist , for example musician , have skill only in what they do and it allows to achieve success and to improve themself better than other .
