some of the people prefer to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , and some not . i think it is better to get broad knowledge from many academic subject . if my country allow this way , i believe i used to select this method but unfortunately i could n't . one of the adventages of this way is that it is not easy to forecat the ability of the student in the begining of the university . i think in my country most of the university student do not like their subject . because our university selecting system doe not reflect the student ability . all people who graduated from college should attend to an exam . after getting the score from this exam they should fill a form about the section and university and they should sequenced these choice from the highest score of preview year to lower . at the end they start one of them or try to get enough score in the following year . if these student get any chance to select more than one university or section i think it will increase the rate of pleasure of student about their section . the other reason for my choice about after graduation . during university year , student can not imagine their rest of life certainly . because in my country the relation between university and industry is very weak . so student can not get information about their job during lesson . after graduate most of the student could n't make their dream work . this cause unsatisfied people and unhappy family . but if they could get any second subject they can select one of them after start to work and get real information about their bussiness life . i am an engineer and i do not like make engineering . fortunetly after start to job i promoted to management and i find out my dream work . i believe i created by god for management and i like very much to manage the people . finally i can say that to create more happy public ' goverments should change the rule and allow to people have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
