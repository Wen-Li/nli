trying new thing and exploring untouched part are indispensable part of development . in this context , one may argue against the idea of doing what one already know how to do well . despite that one can not make much change and development , one can keep safe from losing something and can be expertise at one subject that the person ha been doing so far . therefore , i disagree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , when one try new stuff , the person must take risk of losing money or time . when doing what one already know about , one can be safe from the loss . for example when people go to a restaurant , most order what they have already tried and what they liked . in this way , they can enjoy the food for sure , but if they tried new meal knowing nothing about the food , they can waste money and time eating it . as the example illustrates , it is better to do what one is sure about to be safe and enjoyable . secondly , by doing one thing over and over even though the person know how to do well , the person can obtain experties to the subject . overwelming of empirical evidence conducted over year confirms that continuous practice can make a person expert . having an experties is very important to succeed , so even when people apply to university or writing resume , it is important to emphasize and show their unique experties that can be contrated to others . in order to get experties , repeating more and more even after knowing about it well is important . by tring new thing , one may experience new field of study or material through some failure , but rather than taking such risk , one can enjoy what one know without worrying of failure and rather than knowing vast range of stuff shallowly , being experties at one subject and showing the unique advancement is better .
