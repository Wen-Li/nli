today you found a lot of product on the market . many firm give you a big variety . on the one hand there are different kind of product . on the other hand , there are difference within one group of product . in the following paragraph , i explain , why i agree with the statement , that is told . an important aspect of a product is the function , that mean , whether the product could work in the way , it is bought for or not . in regarding to that , most advertisement do not underline the function ; they replace the main point with other extra fact . sometimes it is impossible to find out which product is the best or functional . to explaint it in a clear way , let u use an example . a mobil phone is a important part of modern life . if you want to use it only for phoning , than you do not need a camera . but such an additional function can confuse you . but it is important to know , that it could be differed between several country . another main point is that product with advertisment cost sometimes more money , than similar product without the advertisment . you have to find out , if you need the advertisment . sometimes it cost le money to buy the advertisment seperat . if you want to have a personal computer , it cost le money , if you buy for example a painting programm seperate than a a part of the personal computer . as a result of those reason i agree with the statement . i think you have to find out , what you want to have and for what use you need the product . also , a comparison between two product or more but of the same kind of product could help you to find out your personal solution . the product can be from different firm .
