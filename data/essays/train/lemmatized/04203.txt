a question on having knowledge of whether many academic subject or specialize in one specific subject is heavily debated among academic . it is an apparent fact that interdisciplinary course are very popular and a lot of academic institution are offering course in that context . although , i believe having knowlegde of many academic subject are very helpful to reach a good comprehesion in the study , i disaggre with the idea in general since i believe that a good academic research can be carried out with the good background in a specific field . the strongest aspect of specializing in one subject is the power of the deepening in that field . it is quite useful to have a broad knowledge of many subject and it might serve to reach a meaningful synthesis when they are put together . however , if one doe not have a comprehensive knowledge in one field , it is surely very difficult to put the information in a framework that attempt to explain , for instance a case , in an academic way . let u think about a master thesis that we study on . if we choose to conduct a case study , it is mostly comfortable to apply more than one theory . if our master thesis is in social science , it is obvious that the case can be defined and studied in that manner . however , i can put forward that it also creates many misunderstanding and it can end into a huge paper without nothing . because if we achieve to specialize on one aspect , we can draw the line about the case which will help the reader to understand what is trying to be told . a person who concentrate on one theory can depict the case very well under the guidance of main point of the field he or she deepened . to sum up , although having knowledge in many field can sound better than my idea , it is usually better to concentrate on one discipline to reach a better explaination .
