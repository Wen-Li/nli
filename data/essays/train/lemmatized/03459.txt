in the past , knowledge wa not valued and spread a it is nowadays . the people counted on their working capacity to ensure their food and necessity . in our time , it is becoming , more and more , a necessity to be well educated , otherwise your opportunity to get a respectful job are very limited . manytimes , we appreciate those specialized people who can cover all the surounding criterion in a certain subject more then the people who have diversified their knowledge . both broad knowledge and specific subject knowledge are in need in our society and each one is characterized by a different set of benefit . specialization in one specific subject is a must in the research center , in the university and in the research development department of the big company . those person are characterized by a very different and accurate knowledge in some field which can lead to minimize error and could lead to some creativity of new product or research methodology . generally speaking , those people can find job much easily in the developped country like the u.s , canada , france . .. for example , if i will be able to get a phd , most probably i will not return back to my native country since the opportunity to work for such qualified person are very limited . so before deciding if i will apply to this i should accept the next decision , which is to continue my life abroad . although specialization seems to be very good , many job opportunity in the developping and under developped country can not hire such person . for them , such person are considered a overqualified employee and they do not need their additional knowledge that they have gathered through their specialization . they are mostly seeking in person who can do many job in the same time . so at this level , a person who ha a broad knowledge of many academic subject would most probably welcomed since he will be able to work on different and this exactly will satisfy the need of the manager . i give the example when i wa working for the first time after i have my undergraduate study a agricultural enginner : the manager accepted me , but not a master degree student because he is not ready to pay a little bit more for his knowledge ; he did n't need his qualification . later i figured out that the manager hired me not just because i am an agricultural engineer but because i have great computer skill and because i have got some extra course in marketing . so my diversified knowledge permitted to me to get the job , while the other person , who ha a master degree in agriculture wa not accepted . as a conclusion , both of the two concept is valued ; we have always to weigh the benefit of each , clarify our need and goal , and then to choose between specializing in one specific subject or trying to get a much broad knowledge of many academic subject .
