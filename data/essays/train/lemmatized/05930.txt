i may agree with the statement or may desagree . the enjoying in life depends of young people and older , like elderly people . young people would rather to spend time on computer than to read a book if they have had the oppotunity to choice between them . the most f elderly people might choice to read a book , and another younger people may choice any way . young people like child or teenager migth expect life to show many way to make them happy or funny . that is why there are in their mind how come they spend good time and easy life . they have their parent or tutor support their study and even support life style and they are not able to spend these kind of thing . . in the other hand , older people should make end meet to life , if they did colect enough money , or life by their job , depends the case . most of them have on their mind the way to spend life , that is way , they do not expected the life to show an enjoy life . they might think to spend a good life trying to enjoy , however it is too difficult , enjoy and spend good life everytime , than the most of young people are able to get . the psicology of both kind of person are quite different , but in same case older people could get good life and enjoy life . their job and profession get to them a nice way to life .
