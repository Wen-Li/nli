according to me the best way to travel is not in a group led by a tour guide . first of all , the best way to enjoy to travel is to go with an other person , it n't good to go with a group , because it 's difficult to share your feeling and make a plan quickly and efficiently with many people together . for example if you need to shop you have to be worried about of the feeling of your group , but it 's more easy when you travel with a friend or a menber of your family to change the schedule of your journey . secondly , all of your mouvements during the travel are restricted because you are in a group . for instance , if you have plan to enjoy to eat in different restaurant , if you will meet many new people , it 's not possible to do this in a group because during the travel you are always with your group , so you do n't have the time to meet someone and the travel can be borried . finally , if you travel with a guide you are not able to quit the group and to do what you want to do . you have to follow the instruction of the tour guide it 's like a travel information that 's not good . for example if you go to some country in africa like ivory coast , all the tourist like to go to yamoussokro to see the biggest catholic church in the world , the tourist do n't take the time to visit the capital which containts some interesting stuff too . in conclusion the best way to travel is with a partner like a friend or a menber of your family it 's more fun . on the other hand , that depend of what are you planning to do and what 's your purpose . for instance if you want to travel for a history class or whatever . i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in fact you can take all the information who want about the topic of your class .
