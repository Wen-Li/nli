in my point of view i agree that people should have the risk in trying new thing instead to doing thing in life that he/she is used to doing . if people dont try doing thing that they are not used to do they will never learn in life . life change life will never stay the same so you have to go out and see what is going on around the world , dont be shy to ask people thing that you dont know other wise you will never learn , never feel imbarased to ask becasue people also did not have a clue what they are doing before asking and looking up in book , internet or magazine . if there is thing in life that you dont know and you have asked several people about it and they still not know never give up about it , act ast it wa a challange to you , if you do n't fight and work hard and ask people any time you go and look up something else and you ca n't find it beleive me that you will never find out anything in your life . life is tuff but you have to be tuffer .
