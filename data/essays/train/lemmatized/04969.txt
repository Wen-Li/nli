i dont agree with `` jack of all trait and master of none '' i personally feel it better to expertise in a single feild rather than trying to have a broad knowledge in many academic subject since , it will lead u no where . firstly , it would be a difficult task for the student to throw light on every subject they learn a a part of their academic curriculum . instead of this , student can concentarte on a single subject and try to learn more of it . this will help the student to learn a subject with more interest and also give a chance for the student to choose the subject they wish to expertise . but in the case if the student try to have a broad knowledge of all subject one day he will be confused about himself . therefore , it more advisable to master in a particular area of the student interest . to have a clear illustration of this let u consider a real time example . if we consider two student , among which one ha a broad knowledge in all the academic and the other is a specialist in hardware engineering . if these two apply for a particular job say , for the post of a hardware engineer than the former student will have a few chance for accquiring the job since he ha no profound knowledge in that particular area but , he just ha an overview of it . and therefore the other student will be consider for the job . not only in the case of employement but also in real life , the one who ha deep knowledge of his specific subject could survive any where in this competitive market . and by expertising more in a single feild he will get a very good insight about his subject and he will be capable of fetching good reward and fame in his area of study . therefore it is always advisable to master in a particular feild .
