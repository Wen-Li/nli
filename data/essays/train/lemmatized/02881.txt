it is sometimes in people mind that young people are more likely to enjoy the life more than older people . everybody ha already heard a fifty years-old person saying : '' oh , if only i wa twenty , i would do these thing ! '' or '' what can i do to go back when i wa young ! '' . but it is too easy to believe that older people or senior doe n't enjoy their life like young people . morover , it will be easy to show that their life can be even greater than the one of a twenty years-old person . we will give some example and headline the fact that enjoying life is just a question of point of view . for a young person , enjoying life can be simplier because he is often healthier than an older person . so a young one can more easily practising sport , going out lately , etc . .. for a student , life can be very nice , because of all the opportunity he is given to him , to do a lot of different and meet new people . but a he ha only a few experience of life , he ca n't appreciate well enough thing he doe . in contrary , for an older person who have experience the world , people and life im general , it is easier to take more benefit and appreciate even more thing he doe . but young people are just beginning their life , so that willness of saying `` i 'm enjoying life '' could be seen a a way of do n't thinking to the future because he fear it . for a senior who have just finish their working life , it is easier to appreciate now a different way of living , without stress , and enjoying his family . in conclusion , being a young people doe n't automatically imply to enjoy more the life than older people .
