a number of people maintain that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . while the first reaction of some people may be to disagree with this statement , there are conpelling the reason to explore this issue more in depth . form my point of view , i find i agree with this statement for two reason . one reason that i can support is that i can control the time by myself . for example , last year , i came to japan with my friend because we are too crazy on shopping clothers . then we wa lost with our tour guide . however , the last reason why i can agree with this statement is i can do everything i like to do . for instance , my parent want to visit my aunt when they came to la with a tour guide , but they can not go . they need to follow the tour guide 's schudel . all of these reason had influeced me more in depth . of i know there may be some people disagree with me , but
