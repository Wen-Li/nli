i have traveled in many country with my friend , and my answer for this statement is that it is depend on where we travel , and what purpose we travel . almost all of the country that i have traveled is developed europian country , like france , england , germany , and italy . because there are so many traveler there , it is not big deal to travel there without guide . we can find many guide book in bookstore , and we also can find many information about the place we would go on the internet . about communication problem , i only could speak japanese and english , but i did not have big problem traveling there . there are some merit to have tour guide . they must be the specialist of that place , so that all the place they led u to must be something important or great . however , personally i prefer to travel only with my friend because i like to go with flow , in different word , go wherever i want with my feeling . i also like to find nice place where that nobody would come . my main purpose is sightseeing , neither shopping , eating , nor girls-hunting . therefore , for me , it is better not to have guide with me . the problem is when we go to some undeveloped country or dangerous place , like easten europe , middle east , or south east asia . i have seen one horror movie `` hostle '' , which story is like three traveler came to one old easten europe country and kidnapped , got killed by criminal group . i know the movie is fiction , but it escalate my fear of traveling those undeveloped country . when we go to undeveloped country , there is a big problem . we can not get a lot of information about that place . therefore we might step into dangerous area and be harmed without knowing why . also , we might cause problem because of the country 's tradition . in that case , i think it is better to ask someone who know about the place a lot to guide u to avoid dangerous situation .
