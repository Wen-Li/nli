it is true that cat is very usable , and so meny people use it for going to work and shopping , many other thing . but i disagree to this statement , because of the following two reason . firstly , car make a lot of co2 , and this is being a big problem now . i want to believe that people will try not to use car too much , and make the co2 level more lower . secondly , internet is getting common very rapidly . in twenty year , maybe all the people in the developed country wii have their own computer , and they could study and do work , everything at home . even shoppin can be done by internet . this mean people doe not have to go out a much a now . so , the use of car will be le . to place the time used for going to school , work , and shopping , we can go walking and play sport outside . this is much more healthy and comfterble than using car to go everywhere . maybe family and friend can take more good comunication by walking together wathing the view . and more , we doe not have to be catche by the traffic problem . i wish these thing will really happen and the number of car will decrease . ofcourse the co2 problem is too the big reason , but nowadays there are too much sad news caused by car . i think the decreasing of car us will also decrease sad news . now many family have more than two car at home . but we should have the least
