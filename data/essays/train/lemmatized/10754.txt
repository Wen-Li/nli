basically i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . what do you think the meaning of ` enjoy ' ? young people can enjoy more kind of sport than old people do because their physical condition allows more chance to do like snow board , motorcycle , mountain climbing , sky diving which are need more wild action and physical ability . no one can say old people can enjoy these sport too . the sport is one of the most important way of enjoying our life . furthernore old people are much more conservative than young people when they challenge something new in their life . for example , they have to consider their family and company before challenging new thing . however young people feel more free to launching new thing . they are much bravier than old people so that they can experience more about new world eventhough they fail sometimes . that is o.k for young people because they have plenty of time to recover their fail or mistake . therefore , young people can enjoy life more than old people . i did n't mean old people can not enjoy life but they have more restriction than young people .
