it 's often said that travel without a tour guide is a countless benefit living in a state of art society . however , i strongly argue that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because people do n't have enough knowledge about the place they go and it will save to waste of time . to begin with , group travel with a tour guide have positive influence on gathering information . a tour guide is specialized in traveling , so the man know a countless of knowledge about the place which people travel such a popular park , beautiful restorants , and even world famous traditional food in the place . for example , when i wa a freshman in university , i planned to journey to usa . although i searched information about the country , when i wa in usa , i could n't find any place where i really wanted to go . that 's because the information i found wa not up - date one . moreover , the travel help people save traveling time . most of group tour have a well planned schedule . it prevent people waste of time to see the place which people do n't need to go to . for instance , my sister , juny kim , went to canada with a group member in 1999 . even though it wa just a week to travel , she and her group member traveled all around canada 's famous place such a ubc in vancouver , quback and even rocky mountain because of tight schedule of a special guide . in conclusion , without any doubt , i significantly agree with a group travel because of benefit from saving traveling time within tight schedule and gathering information . if you do n't enough imformation where you will go abroad in this winter , i suggest that you have only two decision . one is you should give up the plan and the other option is traveling with a tour guide .
