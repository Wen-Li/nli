in my opinion , is more important for student , to understand idea and concept than learn or memorize concept . when i wa a kid , my sort of education wa in a clasroom with my teacher and everyday memorized and memorized topic in spanish , mathematics and science topic . this kind of education is a traditional method because you go to the school to get knowledge through the experience and to understand why the thing happen ? and not only to memorize 3 or 2 book and date , for example in the history class is too common to memorize all the date that happened in the second world war , and now tell if you remember some of them ? , sincerly i think your response will be : no . this is the problem , if in the school and maybe our parent had taught u , the importance to undertand why the thing happen ? maybe , the young people at this moment would't have a lot of problem and would n't be upset for the school . if we know utopies about the educational system and theory for example for montessori or freinet , we can check that they taugh u that the education of a child ( in this case ) begin in the house and the school is a complement of the education and it is a place where the child development her or his motricity and intelectual form based in understand idea and not only in learn fact . other example is the piaget theory who told u , that the education is based in the experience that you are getting along your life . now a day , the educational system already have change in our country for example the use of internet , in order to make easier to undertand the knowledge and an opportunity for young generation to be succesfully in any area . my conclusion is the following : you have to learn everything that you need but is better to undertand , everything that you want .
