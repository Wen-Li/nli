with technology , advertising product became much easier . you can see advertisement in lot of place such a television , supermarket , radio , and much more . i think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , with the technology available these day , it is very easy to make animation or make picture better . this technology ha been used in making advertisments . it change the way people think about the quality of the product by making it much better than what it actually is . this can be achieved by many way , such a making the product attractive or by comparing it to other good brand . also , advertisement tend to be repeated alot , giving the public an impression that the product is something special to be repeated that much . they will then go to the closest retail store to buy the product just to find that the quality is not what they expected . in addition , many different advertisement of the same product could be made . those advertisement could include famous star such a actor or sport player . this usually is intended for the younger audience , a they are most attracted to it . in the end , advertising product attracts many people these day by making them belive the product are good . i believe that in the future , people will be decieved to an extent that they will believe that the lowest quality product are the best of the line .
