i agree the idea that more important thing for student is to understand idea and concept . the first reason is that if the student can understand and follow the whole idea or concept of one thoery , it make easilier to learn fact . for example , imagine that you have to learn the history of the 1960 . if you learn a lot of fact related to the 1960 . in 1960 , there are enormous event and many detailed thing you have to remember . at first , you can remember the specific thing what you think significant thing , but you forget most of fact you learned the next day . however , if you study the whole structure of the history in 1960 and then add the detailed fact and organize well , you can remember fact easily than just learning fact without understanding concept and even you can understand the flow of the history in 1960 without any extra affort . furthermore , if you understand the entire idea and concept , it help you can solve the question on your midterm or final exam . thus , it give the opportunity to understand another historical fact . most of the fact have connection with each other . for example , you already studied some historical fact in 1960 . there are some fact which have relation with the other historical fact something like some event in 1980 . if you know the entire concept of 1960s history , you can learn additional fact related to another historical time . the last reason , i agree the idea that understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact . is it is the true that you ca n't understand , learn and remember all of the fact what you need . for instance , i have a test tomorrow and the test is for type of art . it mean , i have to memorize lot of type of art including realitism , romanticism . if i did n't know the concept of the romanticism , but i have to memorize the fact of the romanticism . so i start to memorize everything in the art of remanticism including the picture , history , artist . evenif i spend one week to prepare my test , i ca n't remember everything about romanticism . there are a lot of fact in romanticism , and it is impossible to memorize or even understand without understanding the idea and concept . the fact is small thing in one theory . if you want to draw and see the whole picture of one theory , you have to understand idea and concept before you learn the fact . understanding idea and concept is the most important and basic step to learn fact .
