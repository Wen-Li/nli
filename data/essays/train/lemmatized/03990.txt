i whole heartedly disagree with the statement that younger people enjoy more than older people . enjoyment is a feeling which is felt by people in all age group . there are certain time when each age group enjoys more than the other , all depending upon the problem faced by the age group which are different in magnitude and time of occurence . both younger a well a older people have problem to face in life . each age group 's enjoyment is curbed because of these problem , but the enjoyment is never far away . lets take the example of a young boy . he doe not enjoy when he ha to give exam , study , or go to school . however , he enjoys when he go to play , or when he watch television . in the same way an adult ( middle aged ) doe not enjoy going to work , or working around his or her hosehold . but they do enjoy when they come back from work , when they are on a holiday , or when they go to a party . in case of old people a well , they enjoy a they do not have much work to do and live comfortably on their pension fund . but they face problem regarding their health . so this way every age group ha it own share of enjoyment and problem . we can not draw a fine line comparing who enjoys more or le a there are various factor such a time and society which decide that . along with this there is also the fact that one 's enjoyment can be another 's problem . in case of child , they enjoy playing more and studying le . the adult ( parent ) have problem with that , which curb their enjoyment to see their child study . when the child is forcefully made of study , then the parent enjoyment becomes the child 's problem . in case of old people , their enjoyment is that they do not need to work . but this is a problem for the adult ( middle aged ) a they become a burden on them . due to this the old people are sent to shelter home where it is a problem for them , but enjoyment for the adult . this way everyone 's enjoyment is interlinked , because of which we can not state who constantly enjoys more and who constantly enjoys le . therefore , using these two reason , i support my stand that it is a false statement that young people enjoy more than old people .
