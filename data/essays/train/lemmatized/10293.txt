to a certain extent i agree with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . in order to equip oneself with the basic information on life , science and people , the knowledge about all the area is mandatory . i also belive that after gaining breadth of all the subject , one should persue some area of her interest in order to gain specialization . it is highly important to have broad knowledge of many subject a most of the subject are inter-related . the knowledge about one subject is needed to understand the other subject . for example : science , in order to understand the concept of science the basic knowledge of mathametics is mandatory and this knowledge of mathematics give a better perspective and vision of science . also , knowledge about many subject help to understand other area of education . a student specializing in mathematics would remain unaware of his histotrical background or would remain unaware about the law of nature if the basic education of history and science is not imparted to him . the broad knowledge of many academic subject also give an individual an opportunity to identify her area of interest . lack of knowledge on a subject would never expose a potential student to that subject and he would remain unaware . when the broad knowledge of many subject are important , it is also important to specialize in one area of interest to sustain in today 's competitive world . in today 's era , people are highly competitive and just the basic broad knowledge of subject would not earn a respected living . it is required to specialize in one area and at the same time having the breadth of information about other subject .
