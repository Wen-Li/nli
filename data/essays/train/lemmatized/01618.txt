there ha been an arguement regarding the issue that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . for my perspective , i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because learning broad knowledge of lot of academic subject give benefit that student develope social ability and it make student have human emotion . first of all , learning broad knowlege of many academicas subject give benefit that student develope social ability . if srudents have broad knowledge from academic subject , they learn way to face to many difficult situation and through relationship of student in same class , they also can learn sociality . in the future these give lot of help to student . they can develop their social ability . but if student specialize in one specific subject , they could not have varied experience and they could not have chance that they develop their social ability . second , learning boroad knowledge of lot of academic subject make student have human emotion . there wa time that many people thought that they specialized in one site are succed . so at that time they thought that human emotion is not important . but thesedays importance about human emotion appear countinuously . according economy magazine , it described that ceos who is succeded in one site have great human emotion .
