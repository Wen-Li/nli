a lecture may be a useful , but boring way to teach a person about a country or a city . travelling , on the other hand , is a very unique way to learn because people gain the knowledge while having fun . not only doe it teach about a historical aspect or a specific condition in the country or city , but it also give the people the opportunity to live within what they are learning , and to actually be able to see , feel and even touch what they are learning about . a person , however , can not learn just by seeing or being in the place ; the best way to get the most out of the travel is to travel in a group led by a tour guide . a tour guide is an expert who will give all the interesting historical , technological and even social fact and beauty of the place a person visit . it is more fun if you listen to a person talking than just reading a book or asking people . a tour guide will show you place you may not be able to reach or know about by yourself . also , if you have any question about anything in a trip , the tour guide is a person who is already there to help you . travelling with a tour guide and a group is much safer than travelling alone , especially if it is a place not familiar or is not being visited before by the traveller . there is a lesser chance for a person to get lost in a new place if the person wa with a group led by a tour guide . the place may also be dangerous , such a theft or kidnapping . when you are with a group and a tour guide , it is le likely for you to be kidnapped or rubbed . and so , travelling alone may be fun , but the consequence of it can be dangerous or le useful for the individual . however , travelling with a group and a tour guide is both a fun mean and an affective way of gaining knowledge .
