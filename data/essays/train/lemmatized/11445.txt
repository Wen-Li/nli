in my opinion , the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk is true . my believe is that success and new thing are closely related . i do think so because in my experience i always considered something a a personal success if i wa able to overcome old barrier and to reach target that seemed unlikely to be reached before . i feel especially satisfied , if by reaching new target i have to face risk . on the other hand if something is well known to me , i do not feel great satisfaction in achieving it . so for me it is part of personal success to try in new thing and overcome risk . also in a material way i think that it is true that success go along with trying new thing and taking risk . there are many example of great personality who are regareded successful because they were the first to do certain thing . for example lance armstrong who wa the first man on the moon is definetly considered to be a successful man . another example would be a business-man who managed to built up a company that provides unique and new product or service . if his company offer usefull stuff and is the first to do so , the chance of being successful are quite high . of course , there is also another side of success . if someone ha certain target that are not necessarily new or ground-breaking , you can also be successful by reaching these target . you could for example try to play soccer a good a some famous soccer player . if you manage to do so , you might be a successful person without achieving a new thing . but in my opinion it is more likely to become sucessful by doing something new rather than just to do like others did before . in conclusion , even though it is not a necessarity to try new thing in order to become successful , i do believe that by doing so you will have a greater chance to become successful in the way you feel about yourself and in the way other people see you .
