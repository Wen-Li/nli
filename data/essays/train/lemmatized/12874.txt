throughout history , successful people tried or invented new thing and took risk to accomplish their goal . if they only followed the way that they knew how to do well , they would not be successful . therefore , by doing so , a person can become a successful person . when a person try to make new thing or think differently with others , he or she will have a better chance to accomplish the goal , which mean they are successful people . steve jobs , a c.e.o of apple company , led their company to invent a mp3 called `` ipod . '' when other mp3 industry were trying to reduce the size of their product and the capacity of memory card , steve jobs wa working on making new type of mp3 . ipod could hold many number of song and it wa really successful . nowadays , almost everyone owns ipod or want to have one . therefore , he wa a successful person because he tried new thing and invented a new thing . in addition , successful people try new thing by making adjustment or change . my soccer coach wa a really famous guy and his name wa well-known in boston area . when he first became our coach , he made a lot of change for the team at the first practice . some player on the team used to say the formation he suggested doe not fit on the team but the coach pushed his idea by taking risk . we ended the season with fourteen win , two tie , and 2 loss and we became champion on our league . furthermore , it also go well with the historical event when jefforson purchased louisiana . jefferson sent his men to buy only small amout of land near the mississippi river but they ended up getting the whole land of louisiana with fifteen million dollar fom napoleon . since jefferson wa strict about spending national money , he wa concerned about this . fianlly , he decided to but the whole land of louisiana by taking risk . the louisiana purchase became very helpful to the united states because it dobled the size of the nation and increased the commerce . throughout current event , my personal experience , and historical event of the united states , it prof that successful people try new thing and take risk instead of just doing what they already know how to do well . taking risk and doing something new are the only way the became a better person in our life .
