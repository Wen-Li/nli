knowledge is something that people have to have in order to have any academic career . whether or not it is for one subject , knowledge is vital in order to make people aware and ready to make any career development . in my oppinion , i think that specialising in one certain area , would mean that people can focus on one subject only , and that would provide more time for people to spend improving that subject and therfore make him an expert . however , it can be a dangerous way to head to , because there are some issue that need to be thought of . for example , in the future people may think that the career path that they have chosen is not what they want to contniue doing , that would mean that they will have to start over again , and study everything from the start . this can be very frustrating and overwhelming because it would mean that they would have to put a ` pause ' in their life for the moment to try focus on other subject . having a variety of academic subject give a person a wider range of job and even a better qualification because it mean that a person ha studied more than one subject and is capable of handling responsibility . in the end , every one should think of their life and if studying more than one subject will mean that they will not be capable of handling many thing at once then they should focus on one subject without regret , but if i wa to make a choice , i would prefer to have more than one academic subject to study because it would open more door in the future and would make me feel proud of what i have achieved and i would have many job offer to chose from and i would also benifit from that because i would choose the carrer that most suite me .
