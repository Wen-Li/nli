i do not agree with the statement `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' . firstly , because i do not think that anyone could pretend order travel either alone or in a group . traveling is one of the pleasure that is generally at your own discretion . if people doe not feel comfortable to travel in a group , it doe not mean that they are not going to enjoy their trip . for them , traveling in a group could be the best way to waste your money and time . one are not going to be able to do everything one want . secondly , for people who like traveling in a group , they could like to travel with people they know . so they would have somewhat the same interest , and will be most likely able to do the same thing . in that case , they could want to prepare their trip by researching all the information they need before leaving . for example , they would looking about the hotel , where to eat , what are the attraction , and so on . thus , they will avoid the need of a tour guide . they will end with the satisfaction of planning their trip , and seing only what they wanted to . finally , travel in a group led by a tour guide could be expensive . a tour guide usually also ha his `` own path '' . it is a generic pathway made for everyone . it usually have a lack of flexibility . for instance , with a tour guide people have usually a tight schedule . the tour guide try to show everything in a very short amount of time . therefore , one ha to be in good health condition in order to accomplish what could be viewed sometimes a painful path . in conclusion , i personnally believe that the best way to travel depends on individual . one could be a solitar , and enjoy the pleasure of traveling alone . other people enjoy just the fact of researching , planning to travel with friend . and finally , the fact that a tour guide is not personal and only show what it want to show , are the three main reason what i do not agree with the statement .
