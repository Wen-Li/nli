this question ha two answer for me , because i agree and disagree at the same time . i will first tell you why i think it is better to be specialized on one subject , and then i will explain to you why for me you gain more by having a broad knowledge of many academic subject . first of all i have to say that if you know a lot about a great deal of subject you can not be a specialist in one subject . you can talk about a lot of think , but you will keep on talking about the basic of those think . you would not be able to go deep into a conversation . however on the other hand i think it is more interesting to learn about different topic . i do not think your brain is limited to a number of knowledge , so for me it is always good to learn new thing . the more you know about thing , the more you are open minded . i personaly think it is very important to be open minded , because then you become more tolerant , and you accept more , and learn more again . if you know a large range of thing , you are also able to talk about more thing , so you are not left over on certain conversation . in my opinion it is very important to be curious , to discover and to experiment a lot of thing . the more you do , the more you learn , and life become more interesting . however it is also necessary to be specialised in one subject . when you are specialised you become more precise , and you can go deeper into the subject , it become more interesting than to stay on the basic of one subject . like everything in life it is a question of balance .
