the issue in hand is what the best way to travel in group is , with a guide tour or by their own . i agree that the best way of traveling is having a tour guide , especially when it is a group trip . there are many reason why i think this is a better approach , but here i am going to mention three that i consider the most important one . you can save time , money , and have the chance to visit more place . now , let me tell you more about why i mentioned these three reason . the first reason for which i agree that uaing the servicce of a tourist guide is a smart thing to do is because having a guide would saved the group some time . because the chance of getting lost in a new place are really high , but if you do n't need to worry about finding direction , then you would be able to visit more place in the same period of time . second , having a guided tour would save you and the group some money . for example , you would save money in gasoline since you wo n't have to drive around trying to find the place you want to visit during your trip , also the car rental fee would be chepaer because the whole gruop could ride in only one car . finally , i agree that traveling with guidance is more effective because you be able to see more place , this for sure . a tourist 's guide is usually a local person , therefore he or she know pretty well the area , and what is most important to me when i visit a new place , to learn about it history behind . so , in conclusion i agree with the idea that traveling with a guide is the best way to do it .
