nowadays , advertisement is a world-wide phenomenon that tends to pry even in our privacy . in my opinion , it seems obvious that most advertisement try to make product appear better than they really are . to begin with , we must not forget that business is business . then , no matter how despicable the mean are , the sole purpose is to make money . that is why ad always bludgeon the would-be customer into buying something . to do so , ad are expected to attract people 's attention at all cost . moreover , advertisement often convey the picture of an ideal and perfect world . for instance , a far a the clothing industry is concerned , we all have seen ad showing sculptural body wearing marvellous garment ! unfortunately , the average citizen doe not look like the model so he or she feel quite frustrated . giving a product a better appearance than it real one turn out to be an unwholesome way to convince the customer to buy something . to a certain extent , this phenomenon is linked to the kind of brainwashing people experience under totalitarian regime , namely it try to put everyone ine the same single mold without taking care of individual . you have to be careful if you do not want to be influenced and this requires a great amount of self-control . one solution could lie in education : we should teach child how to have their own opinion in spite of what is shown to them . this could probably prevent such dangerous drift ( if this kind of advertising wa not so efficient it would have certainly been abandoned ! ) . thus , we may affirm that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . by no mean must we forget that the main purpose is to make profit so we would rather try not to be influenced . i think that it could be much better if enough safety net were established but you know : every law ha a loophole !
