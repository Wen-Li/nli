new advertisment is focused on appearance and not on quality i believe that most advertisement is focused on create a cool image about a certain product . therefore , all these product are useless and will not satisfy consumer preference . first , company are more interested to waste money on advertisement rather than on research and development ( r & d ) . consumers will prefer to have a more functional item rather than an item that is useless and expensive . for example , few week ago i bought an ipod and i wa not sure to buy it because mac ha invested a huge amount of money and i heard some complaint about ipod 's functionality . anyway , i bought an ipod on friday and just after two day from this day i accidentally drop it and my ipod became useless . second , advertisement is always deep empty and it is aimed to show off a certain product . most of the people get surprised by a nice looking item and it advertisement , but i do not . i take into account a a consumer the focus group that a certain item is aimed to . and if i do not feel close to the idea of the advertisement , i will not consider to buy it . third , advertisement is aimed to hide quality characteristic in order to cheat consumer . i believe that a good quality product doe not need any advertisement . as an example , my oldest brother ha bought a bang & olufsen stereo and i have not heard of that brand of stereo before . i did some research by internet about this brand and i got surprised because it is known that bang & olufsen is the best world wide brand for stereo . once again , advertisement always told me that sony wa the best brand world wide , but it is not if a consumer is looking for quality . in conclusion , advertisement maybe guarantee a cooler product by it general consent , but not an effective one . advertisement is for not intelligent people and it always try to hide deficiency on product .
