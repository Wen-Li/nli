the question about broad oder specialized education is rather difficult to solve . in my opinion there is no clear answer or solution to this problem . i think that a broad knowledge of many subject is essential to succeed in work . for example in economics , is is very important to have certain knowledge of law , mathematics or information system to only mention a few connected field of study . without background knowledge in these field you will not be able to get a good degree in your study . also it is important to have knowledge of culture and society , especially when you want to work and live in other country . here it is extremely neccessary that you learn something about the culture of the foreign country , so that you can live there a a part of the community . also everybody should have a basic knowledge about the history of his country or geographical circumstance of the region he life in . this knowledge can be seen of a basis that every person succeeding university should achieve . but beneath this broad knowledge it also is quite useful to have a highly specialised knowledge in one certain field . in this specialized subject , you then can enjoy being a expert . this can not only be good for your personal career . if nobody wanted a highly specialized training , there would be no progress in science . here we have good example in natural science , for example physic . every student of physic need a basic education that also includes mathematics and chemistry . but to research in problem , that matter at present time , you need to highly specialize , because there is so much information , that a single human being would never be able to gain it all . therefore i would say that you both need a broad knowledge of many subject that are connected , but also must specialize in one field of study . a reasonable combination of this two aspect of training can give you an education , that will open you all door for a future career .
