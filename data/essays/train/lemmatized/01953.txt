i disagree with the idea that young people enjoy life more than older people because i think that young people do not have neither the experience nor the knowladge to appreciate the gift of the live in it complete dimension . by the other hand , older people have the experience and knowladge that allow them to enjoy the most important thing in the life . in first place , i believe that we have to learn what is life and what is it purpouse , in order to learn how to enjoy it . for example , i can notice that my two year old son enjoy to play with the piano but he doe not know how to play the piano . in that order of idea , life is like a piano , you need to learn how to live to appreciate it in all his dimenssions instead of only merely living because you have born . for example , older people frecuently have the wisdom to appreciate their family which they consider the mo important in their life , but young people try to live appart of his family a soon a possible in second place , each fase of the life ha it own time , if young people could understand what is really important in life they could work to achieve those goal , like to study to get a good job that allow them to rear a family , instead of only trying to pas the life a if it where a big and eternal party , and when the get older they realize that have lost his opportunity to be really happy . in third place , some young people go to fast in life that they cut their opportunity to enjoy his life in it own pace . nowadays they want to grew older to experience new emotion , like drinking alcohol , smoking , having sex or using drug , somtimes influenced by the medium or by their mate , they do not have the capability to say no to some dangerous practice . but older people know better what is good or bad for enjoing the life and how avoid dangerous practice . in conclussion , to learn how to enjoy life is the reason because we have teacher or master . young people need to learn to live and to be prepared for the chalenges that living in nowadays have . in other word , young peole need to appreciate and enjoy life in all it dimenssions , and older people are called to teach their wisdom to the new generation to enjoy life .
