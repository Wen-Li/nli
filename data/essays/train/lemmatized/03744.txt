there are more automobile on the face of the planet today than any time in the history . and the number is increasing at an alarming rate . the growing economy of the asian giant , china & india , are increasing with an average rate of 8 % per annum . there are more white collar and blue collar job in these country than ever . this is bringing more money than ever to the people of the continent , and a car is not an exclusive luxury , not a exclusive a it used to be anyway . in india , since the almost full disposal of the red-tape , over 20 major car-manufacturors have set up producing plant all over the country . in the past 13 year only , the number of car in the country ha rose by over 400 % to about 29 million . according to certain research , by 2025 , over 270 million indians and 390 million chinese would be able to afford to have a car . in the developed world , there are alternate mode of transport , both public and private , that whilst being energy efficient are also enviornment friendly . in the third world country though such mode of transport are not readily available . also there is the lack of a viable transport infrastructure in these country . maybe in a few decade , a the infrastructure improves , people will take to using public transport . but on the other hand , it 's also possible that with the improving economy they 'd be able to afford a personal car too . the rising price of oil and natural gas is driving the world towards finding and developing alternative fuel resource , but it is n't still discouraging people to give up the comfort of personal car . corporations and business in america for instance advice their employee to ` carpool ' . although this mean that there are fewer number of car on the road during rush-hours , it doe n't in anyway imply that those people donot have a car parked in their garage . i strongly believe that in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today .
