i am agree to young people enjoy life more than older peple do . young peple have a lot of power and enagy . if they do n't use those for enjoying life , i think that is very wasting way . they should use those in young age . now i am young . i am a high school student . i think i enjoy my life more than older peple . to go somewher with my friend , to go shopping with my family , to chat with unknow people on the enternet , to drow picture , to finght with frends , amd more whatever . some of there are needed to young power . some older people can do these . but when i become older person , i think i ca n't do these all . because i will lose power . i might be tired early . i know i will become like my thinking . so i have to enjoy my life now . however , older peple enjoy their life by using money . they go to big trip , to get house , and to eat rich food etc . this enjoyment is defferent to young 's enjoyment . they want to relax . they wo n't to use such a enagy . i think our feeling of enjoying and their feeling is defferent . they are enjoy ther life , and we are enjoying our life same a the others . if we are enjoying by defferent feeling , i can not say which is nice , or bad . all peple enjoy their life . i think that 's very nice . anyway , i hope to enjoy my older life in the feauture . and i would enjoy now too . i should play more . when i become an adult , i will think `` i had to do someting more in the high school ! why now my life is so busy ? '' . i do n't want to say so . so , now i am trying to search more fun thing ! i want to enjoy more my life .
