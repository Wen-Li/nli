today the most challenging area in the business sector is ` marketing` , which is how to advertise your product so that it will flourish among the competitive product and then be sold , as the challenge increase , the main actor in the sector try to come up with innovative idea in order to survive in this cruel world of business . these main actor are advertiser , who actually present the product to the comment of the buyer , through a considerable amount of time , enery and money spent on the analysis of the sector eventually ha begined to create it ` own ' marketing strategy , the most tricky and throuhly successful strategy is to introduce an advertisement that make product seem much better than they really are , this method of ` diguise ' brings one of the hottest issue in the sector : violation of the ethical consideration , some advertiser and the company who hire them think that there can not be any rule for this game , they claim that they do not insist on the customer to buy the product that is advertised with having told that it ha the best feauters compared to similar product , so it is up to the customer whether to choose buying the product or not , on the other hand , some company emphasize the importance of the some set of ethical value that set the sector in a balance so that it will last , among these two different perspective , i think the exclusion of ethical consideration would not harm the sector or the so-called balanced , now , it would be beneficial to grasp an example and see how the two different approach handle the case . soap is an important product in the fcgm ( food and consuption goods market ) and probably we are encountering dozen of advertisement on how well ` their ' soap are , before going any further , it is incredibally crucial to state the goal of each company regardless of it scale , sector , private or public status : to make profit ; make more money , remembering this goal , it would be easily concluded that any department in the company seek to contribute to this profit in a way that department performs , for the marketing department , the way is to advertise the product best so that it will be sold and company will get a profit in return , if you target to make more money , back to example , you have no choise other than selling your soap brand , and if you lack of some quality or price specification , the only choice to follow is waiting for you : to lie to the buyer ; or in a more kindly way , to exaggregate the feature of the product , any marketing department and advertiser have not the luxury of betraying the ultimate goal of the company . so it is extremely logical to exaggregate the feature of the product in order to make your product seem much better than they really are when you can not meet some crucial specification such a quality which is one of the trait of the prducts customer are seeking to buy , on the other hand , the ethical dimension of the issue is still a big question mark for those who see the ethical and moral value much more prior and important to making profit , in conclusion , it depends on your conscience to lie to your customer or not , i agree that most advertisement make prodcuts seem mcuh better than they really are ; however , due to the reason i stated above , this kind of a marketing strategy just serf to what it is supposed to , if i would be an advertiser and meet a case like this one , i totally go with ` lying to the customer and doing the best for my company` , besides , i would not be offended a a mere customer and not feel betrayed by the company i trust .
