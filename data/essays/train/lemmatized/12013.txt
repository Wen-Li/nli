nowadays , car is very important and useful buy the humanity . its an invention who take animal place and alows u to move anywhere we want in a limited time . but in the future , car will be used fewer by the humanity . to prove that u \ we rare going to based in specfics reason and example . in twenty year they will be le and le people who will use car . scientificaly , the technologie is improving these day so we are supposing to create new engine more useful , more safety and more confortable . for example , a we know there were no car available to move on the water but with the improving of the new technologie they already created car moving on the water but it not for sale . secondly , since long time many governements are trying to reduce risk of pollution to protect the environment . so one day petrol will be replace by a new invw \ ention more safety and secure for the environment and all human being in this planet . finally , a we know soon they will be no petrol in the world so we have to found other solution to replace this strong materiel . in fact we have some car working with gaz , but the problem that the gaz is putted in the back of the car and it not safe . so when petrol will finished , car will not be used and also before the patrol gone , it will be very expenssive and only some rish people will buy petrol for their car . in coclusion , we can say that in the nerly twenty year coming , car user will reduce slowly and a we proved it technicaly and scientificaly by the world .
