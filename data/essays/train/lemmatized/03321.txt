in my opinion having more broad knowledge of many acadmic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is much better and comfortable . having more knowledge subject can make people more intrested to talk about differnt subject in his life . a peson who is specialized in one specific subject is stuck in many thing in his life . while the person with many knowledged acadmic subject xan access many different job and aplication and will have experience than than the person with one specfice subject . having more broad knowledged academic subject make apersons life much easier . in my opnion i agree that having many knowledged academic subject is more better than having one specific subject . a person with a little specified subject will find it very hard to find job and it will be very hard for him to mange his life and to do many thing in his life . but having more than one spefied academic subject make your life much easier and it make you experince your life better and also he can find more than job and application to work in not only that but large company are going to send him an invitation to in the company itself . and one of the achivment a prson with abroadr knwoledge academic subects can achive is being experienced in many thing . so for people who ha alittle amount of specifed subject i advice them to take more academic subject than the subject he ha . he will be able to help people in many thing and he can do many goood thing .
