i agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are more challenging , more active , and more socialized . young people lived shorter time of life than older people . that mean , young people have not learned a many a lesson or experinced more . from not knowing what consequence are going to come , young people challenge more than older people . by challenging new thing young people can enjoy more and experience . and from experiencing and learning they become older people . having a younger body can help enjoy life . young people have more physical strenght than older people . as you get older people get le active . especially when you get old , many part of body doe not work a before . on the otherhand , youn people ha enough energy . they can go sky diving , run all day , or even dance all night . to do lot of thing people need strength . physical strength can be a big part if enjoying the life . young people are very socialized . young people go out at public than older people . they meet more people and like to be outdoors . by meeting diversity of people they learn and get to enjoy people and life . young people experience more and enjoy life than older people . young people have a lot of energy and desire to do more thing to enjoy life . but older people have enjoyed life when they were the young people . everyone start young and get old . so everyone enjoys life .
