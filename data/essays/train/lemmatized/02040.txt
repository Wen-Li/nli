i agree with the statement that young people will enjoy alot in their life more than the old people a the young people begin their life with no responsibility and so they do n't have to think about others a this cause the young peole to enjoy alot then the old people enjoyment . the other thing is young people will be having a lot of time in their life a they do n't have to earn alot a the old peole , a for the old people their will be a reponsibility to set their llife and also for young one in a better beneficial way so their is chance that they ca n't enjoy in their life a their enjoyment may be le than the young people . as the young people who will be going to college ha to look their college time and college schedule only so their may be a chance that they have a lot of time in their life to enjoy . as in same way the old people who are going to office for their income ha to spare a lot of time in the working in the office than the other people so in this way young people will get a lot of time in their enjoyment rather than the old people . their will be differenses in the experience that got from the life a it is different for young and old people and the experience and their problem and their work , what they do result in stress to old poeple a then to the young people a the young people will do n't have any stress like the old people in their real life so this a reason why young people will enjoy alot in thier life compated to the old people enjoyment .
