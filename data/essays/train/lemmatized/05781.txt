everybody enjoys life . it is not necessary to be young to enjoy life . yes it is true that people enjoy life in different manner and different style . everybody ha different way of enjoying life . there are people who are young physically and there are people people who are young by heart . in my opinion young people enjoy life more than older people do . firstly , young people have the physical a well a mental strength to enjoy life more than older people . the adrelinine in younger people keep them going . in today fast moving world no one ha time to wait for the right occasion and for the right time . young people are more energetic and lively . young people have the physical attribute to enjoy that bit more than older people . secondly , the opportunites , the occasion for young people to enjoy are much more than older people . for enjoyment they can go to party , clubbing , lounge etc . they can aslo enjoy on any occasion because they have the time and energy to keep going . todays world caters to more hangout place , joint where young people can enjoy themselves . there are more entertainment place opening for young where they can enjoy themselves to the fullest than there are for older people . young people can also find enjoyment at their work place or college . lastly , young people have more option than older people . young people tend to have more friend collegues etc . young people can adapt to place and adjust to place faster which make it easier for them to enjoy . however older people also enjoy to an extent . older people try to find enjoyment in more subtle thing . they enjoy in a different manner . for them enjoyment is more quite and calm . they try to find enjoyment in small thing . yet according to me younger people enjoy life more than older people since they are full of energy and adrelinine .
