the industry of car ha developed rapidly in recent year in china . the percentage of family which owns at least one car is growing fast . there 's an opinion that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . however , the development of car will not end and the number of car will not decrease in the future . first , traveling by car is a convenient and necessary way of transportation in our daily life . we need car all the time , when we go to school or work in the morning , when we return home in the evening , when we go on a trip to the grassland or the mountain , even when we go to a supermarket for shopping . cars are used so wildly and often that we can not imagine a kind of life in which there are no car or fewer car . second , though there are some problem traveling by car , they can be solved in the future . cars can pollute the air , but research to reduce the pollution of car are on the progress . there are already car using electric power which do not harm the environment . for another example , the road may be too crowded for car to go fast , but newly-built highway and freeway are solving the problem . third , if we use fewer car in twenty year , which mean of transportation should we use ? by airplane , by helicopter , by subway , by bike , or just on foot ? in the modern society , the speed required for transportation is faster and faster . therefore , traveling by bike or on foot is too slow . traveling by subway seems fast and convenient , but what about people living far from subway station ? finally , airplane and helicopter are too expensive for common people and too dangerous . in conclusion , although car have some disadvantage , the necessity of using them is still strong . more convenient type of car will be developed in the future . therefore , there will never be fewer car in use than there are today .
