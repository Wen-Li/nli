i want to go to many place which i do not know yet because the travel is fun for me . however i sometimes have bad experience and time by a group tour and a guide . therefore i disagree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for these reason a follows . firstly , the group tour do not fit for me . everything such a shightseeing place or food is already decied in a group tour . then there are another ploblems . for example , i have been to germany in a group tour led by a tour guide . however it wa the worst trip for me . when i went there , i wa only ten year old , but all member of my group were over sixty year old . therefore i could not speak anyone . also the guide wa an english woman , so i did not understand her talking because i am japanese . i could not know any english word . i knew that i could not do freely . secondly , i want to research some pleces that i visit to by myself . in a group tuor , the guid tell me much information such a the name of city or building . however i want to looking for these thing because i love history in the world and the city , tokyo which i live in . if i travel alone and reaserch many thing , i enjoy it very much . also i believe that i have the best experience . all in all , the trip which is in a group led by a tour guide is not the best . if i travel with pnly personal people such a my best friend , parent or sister , it fit for me because i can do everything freely . also i can enjoy to know a great number of informationabout tha city which i go to because my hobby . for these reason , i disagree that the group tour led by a tour guid is the best to travel .
