a community need the help of every member to be a nice and pleasant place to live in . young people have to participate like any other member , have to give the same time like anyone else . i think that they do that but maybe they do not do the same thing a an adult and maybe adult do not see what they do . young people do thing they like to do . that can be a problem because , a young people , they accept le easily thing to do than an adult who now that he doe it for the well being of the community . youg people like to do thing they like . the problem is that adult often think that what young people are doing is le important than what they are doing . so for example , when there is a party to oragnise in the community , young people will be happy to organise it , but a it it le serious than something than adult can do , it is not considered like it ha to be considered . young people have not the same vision of a community like adult . times are changing and adult-s idea of a community is not the same a a young people-s idea of a community . young people can show their love for their community by writing a song about it , or bye painting grafitiy on wall about it , so that is is pratical help like adult do , but in the mind of zoung people it is a kind of engagment for this community . so i think that youg people do thing and give enough time for their community but in a different way than adult , but i do not think that what the adult do are more important than what young people do .
