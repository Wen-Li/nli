schools are the first learning place for student about the difficulty of life . the symptom of ` how challenging a life can be ' are investigated during the schooltime . being grown by an educational system of my country which depends on the understanding idea and concept , i believe and it is more important that to understand idea and concept instead of learning fact . first , a student ha to define and digest the thing that he/she is learning . instead of memorizing , one can and ha to reason the subject that he/she is learning . by doing that , she/he overcomes the situation of forgetting the important issue . for example , if an experiment is done , the student should understand why and for which reason the experiment is done instead of memorizing the step of the experiment so that the student will not forget that experiment and will not fail in the exam . second , one can not infer and make comment about a fact . facts are sharp thing that one can not make some brainstorming to understand the situation . the people should make some exercise on what they are dealing with . for example if a phenomenon is happened . the student should ask why is this happened and for what reason instead of ` ok ' this is happened and let it go . to conclude , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept . one should examine , digest and come to a level of making some comment on that subject . this is essential for the education system .
