the issue of knowing many academic subject or to be specialized in a specific one is difficult to deal with . on the one hand we have young student who are not always sure of what they want to do later and who tend to learn a many subject a they can and on the other hand , firm that are looking to hire student that are specific on one subject . taking all aspect into account , i strongly feel that it is more valuable to be specialized in a particular topic . to begin with , the scholar system ha to deal with student that are going to secondary school or to college without knowing what they really want to do later . then , we find them being graduated and being looking for a job with a determination that would be so much stronger if they knew the type of job or the sector they want to work in . that 's why , my firm belief is that a young student who know what he want to do after graduating will have something more than the other student , who will become opponent when it will be the time to get a job . another way to justify my point of view is to say that knowing young what we want to do after school is a good way to have a good knowledge on the topic and why not having a profesional experience by doing internship . however , it is important for a student not to precipitate himself in a way , a specific subject , or an option with being to young to decide that this should be what he will do or learn for his all life . and having a knowledge of many academic subject could be a good way to make the good decision . taking all aspect into account , my firm belief is that there are so many student that have a knowledge of many academic subject , and when you have one who know what he want to do and that he ha a specific knowledge on one specific subject , he ha such a good card to play to get a job and to make the difference with other student . and is n't that what firm are really looking for ?
