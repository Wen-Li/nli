i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . our world is chaging very fast . there are so many amazing stuff in the world . and i think that young people have more chance to use these stuff such a electornic stuff . and i would like to give some specific reason why i think like that . first , older people usually do not know some new technology product well . even they do not understand what these product is and how to use these new technology stuff . the world is changing very fast so if you do not know these new tech product , you can not enjoy your life more than young generation . for example , when i went to a mall , my mother said to me `` what is this ? '' that wa mp3 player . nowadays , all most of the music are made by mp3 plie . so if you do not know mp3 player , you may lose your chance to listen music which you want to listen . second , our world is making something new constantly . everyday , new thing are generated because many people want something supprise . and , usually , young people recieve something new stuff better than older people do . young people usually can understand how to use these new thing . for example , when i traveled to japan with my parent , we went to a japanese restaurant . at that time , i had to order everything for my parent because i tried to everything to order . i did not feel shy because i wa young . so i used english , my arm , and my face to order . why i wa able to do like this because young people ha spirit of try .
