i agree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in first place i considerate that this is a safer way to travel , specially when you do not know very well the place that you are visiting . in second place , i think this the better way to know all the historic place and the most important detail about an specific city or country . when you travel to a place for the first time it is almost necessary that a tour guide could aid you with the organisation of a tour that result in the best knowledge of the place you choose to travel . moreover when your visit is led by a tour guide you will not waste time visting place that are no highly important , or that will not give you any idea about essential aspect of the history of the city or the country that you are going to visit . within second place , travel in group is safer than travel alone . when you do not know the security condition of an specific place , you will be able to feel more comfortable if you voyage with person that are close to you , specially if your family go with you . in this aspect a tour guide also could help by telling the best and safest pleces to visit . as a conclusion it is important to considerate that the most important aspect to travel in a group led by a tour guide are : the facility to know the place , the security that a group can offer and the good memory you will able to keep
