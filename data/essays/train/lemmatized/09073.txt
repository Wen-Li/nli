many people dedicated a lot of time on knowing and investigating diferent topic , but when you ask them about something specific they do not know what to say . while other people spend their time focused in one subject and you are sure that whatever you ask him , he will be able to answer to it . i totally disagree with the statement because i think that when you try to know more about everything you just ca n't because is too much information from diferent topic and your brain ca n't support a many information a you want . for example when i wa a little girl for about four moth i tried to memorize all the math operation even if a could n't make them there wa always a calculator but after that i got confused with everything because i could n't recognize the operation anymore . i 'm not sure if it wa becuase i forgot or i did n't practice but i wa n't able to make them , not even with calculator . after that i started with my normal class some thing were familiar but all my effort of doing all those math problem and graph and everything did n't have any result . whatsmore i realized that in my ambition of knowing everything i lost a whole vacation full with fun and distraction . therefore i never tried again to learned everything from one step . i go step by step instead of jumping . and now that i 'm just to start a new part of my life i know that everything come at it ' moment and that knowing to many thing can distract you from what you really want for your life . i 'm not saying that you have to be an ignorant or like a pony that is not able to see the side and just look the road , what i mean is that you have to be focused on what you are doing and on what you want so when it come the time to show your knowlege you are sure and you do n't hesitate .
