some idea and concept there is no fact but lot of idea and concept proved a a fact . facts are little important for student to understand idea and concept for that he just have an understanding power . for example , if we take a physic class that most of the physic subject is any imaginary part of the science . they first get the idea and after that they try to prove that idea into concept after that prove into fact . if we take newton under the apple tree . when he sat under the apple tree one apple fall down then he got an idea `` why this apple fallen down ? why it is not gon up ? '' with this idea he found gravitation . with this extent there is no use of the fact to under stand the idea or concept . one more example , if we take a math therams , student do not understand the idea and concept just explains that therams , similarly any problem in the mathamatics have some fact to understand the idea or concept . if we take a formula ( a+b ) ^ 2 there is some proof is there that is the fact . another example , one lecturer say that mahathma gandhi is a freedom fighter there the concept is clear but if the student ask 's the lecturer is it write lecturer , then the he give some to fact about he did in the freedom fighting . fact are not important in some place . but if we have to show that it is true then it is important to explain the fact . the-end
