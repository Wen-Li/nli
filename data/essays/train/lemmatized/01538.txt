it is well known that education is a tricky issue . it raise a lot of question and everybody doe not agree on it . indeed , educational difference between country is a telling example of those question . specialization is prefered in some country and others adopt a general educational pattern . from my point of view , a general broad knowledge is better than to spezialize in only one subject . i support the idea that with a real general knowledge you develop your ability to have a general view of the world . a case of point to highlight is that , yet among ancient greek philosopher a general knowledge wa the condition of the achievement of the truth . that is a general statement in which i believe . second , this ancient belief of general knowledge ha gone across century . i am convinced that it is still true . for instance , in my school , i am studying sunstainable development . although some good action are done without this general view , it is not enough . you have to consider all the part of an issue before acting . if you try to develop fair trade , be sure that transport will not be to harmfull for the environment . finally , from my point of view you can specialize after having received a general education . it is the french educational policy . children must go at school and learn various subject before specialize at college . in my opinion it make child more likely to become good citizen , they have some knowledge in many subject . for instance to vote , they are more aware of main issue . by way of conclusion , i would say that even though specialization is important and allows people to reach an accurate knowledge in one subject , a general view provided by a general knowledge is the way to avoid some big slide .
