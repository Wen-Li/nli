the concept is the base of life . indeed , our world and our way of thinking are built on idea or concept . we often associate school a a place where pupil have to learn fact by heart . but where should we place the limit between a wisdom acquierd by learning the fact and a knowledge based on concept ? a history class would be the best example to answer this question . indeed , while pupil are studying a certain period of history , the most important for them is to understand the way of thinking of the people living at that time , their idea , the circumpstances , what happened before , the consequence i.e. , the whole context . however , i think that it is also very important for them to be able to structure every thing . therefore student should have to learn precise date and event in order to illustrate by concreat example their idea . the concept is the first thing that we should learn , because it is what we keep in mind after a lesson . but if this concept is not associated to a date or illustrated by a fact , the concept doe not worth anything anylonger . on top of that , how could we explain a concept without giving any example ? it 's just impossible . phylosophy , which is the science of concept is based on example and thus on fact . this lead me to say that it is really important for a student to have a good memory and that is why child have to learn poem by heart . as far a i am concerned , idea and fact are deeply linked . we could even go further by saying that very often we start by learning the fact and then we understand the idea which is behind this fact . in mathematics for example we learn the formules of the sinus and the cosinus before even knowing what they represent . it follows then that even if idea are more important when we take a step back , we do not understand them right away without any fact or date . to sum up i would say that after having learnt and understood something , the idea is more important , but while learing this particular thing , we can not separate the idea and the fact .
