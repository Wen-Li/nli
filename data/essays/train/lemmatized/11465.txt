i agree at it is more important for student to understand idea and cocepts than it is for them to learn fact . first , when stundents understand the idea and concept , i think they then learn the fact easily . the undersatnd idea and the concept help student learn information about the many subject and acccept good education form information the have . second . i think understand ieads and concept make the student are opened mind to acccept new ieads or researshs may come in the future . and i thin also the important to student to understnad idea and concept to encourage them to look for more information n the future . third , understand idea and the concept let student accept and disscus any issue may they would face them and dealing with any new idea by carefull and responsibility also understand idea and concept make the eager for make their idea and their concept forth , i think the understand idea and concept give confident for student for themselves because they have a lot of idea and concept about various thins and the maybe help them to going in the life and make their own working .
