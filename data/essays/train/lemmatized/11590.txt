humanbeings are created with many ability in order to live more confident in the world even if there are difficulty for them . one of the essential period of human is when a person becomes a student . although it is believed that understanding idea and concept such a theoratical speaking and generalizing common subject are more important than learning the fact for student , i do not share the same idea becuse it is not the idea that student really live with in all aspect of their life . firstly , idea and concept of a certain subject emphazises student that they have to know of a manner only in the knowledge base . however , knowing a subject in the view of theoratical issue doe not provide a student enough succession in his/her entire life . ideas and concept are useful for background education . since it is difficult to change or disobey the rule that are gained by idea and concept , it force student look in a narrow view to the knowlege . in contradiction , the idea and concept can be gained by learning the fact . for example , if a student work on a project which is about an experiment of chemistry , student can learn much easier by practically doing the experiment rather than reading the idea and the concept of the experiment from the book . reading only give a background for the experiment and predicts what happens in that experiment theoratically . hence , learning the fact are superior than gaining idea and concept . in conlusion , since gaining idaeas and the concept for the student can be only theoratical and not predictive , learning the fact directly are much important for a student in his / her education .
