it is controversial discussion tp define a positive cause of success in human life . some people believe succesesful people are only from their knowledge that wa acquired in previous their life while others do believe that successful people are made up from an effort of trying new thing and taking risk . answer for this question varied from what he or her experienced and learned in his or her life , and for me , it is important that to define what is successful life by various aspect . in my case . i tried new thing with risk a well a use my knowledge that i already had . when i wa twenty year old , i skied at mountenious area in my home country . before going ski , i learned and practiced what is ski , and the practicable way for improvement my skill of skiing . i read some book of skiing , watching video , consulted with my senior friend who is good at skiing . after arrival of mountain , i realised that the knowledge that acquired before come to skiing is useful . a book stated that mannar in the communication of skier , and i communicated with that approriate mannar so that other player warmly welcomed me for a part of whole skier . however , stayed area several day , i felt to needy of more practice of skiing , and there were no one could teach me how to improve . i already finished studying that i practiced before skiing . i finally decided to imitate an action of other matured player . that decision is a trial for me because i never practiced before at that way . my decision eventually well worked my skill of skiing . i wa satisfied from both knowledge and trying new thing . it seems both way are equally valued , though in fact it is not same value for me . while turned out reaults from both experience are same , the method and the time that brings a result is not same . trial depended method for reaching success doe not care about how long that the process consume a time , even sometimes trial method requires a longer time . i beleive the time ha ultimate value in my life . if boths way can give me a primises of successful life , i choose the success is based on time saved method . therefore , i prefer to knowledge since knowledge save a time than the trying and taking risk action do .
