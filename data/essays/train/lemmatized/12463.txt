i disagree with the statement . i believe that youngster nowadays spend enough time ( and more ) to help their community . let u define what a community is . for most people , a community is a group where the member interact , are interdependant , and where they live in harmony . the young people of the world realise that they are part and parcel of this community and that the development of themselves is dependant on the development of the community and vice versa . the younger generation is more aware of community welfare , helping people in need , the environment , and it development . one area which the youngster have identified is charity work . not only do they visit charity organisation and donate to them , they also organise free medical camp for poor child , corrective surgery for people who cant afford it , and in general spread the word . campaigns where people can donate or pledge their future contribution are organised by these youngster . they are conciously allocating time for community welfare activites . proactively thinking about how much more improvement is possible is the trend . also , people nowadays , especially youngster , are more aware of the danger to the environment from deforestation , the ozone layer depletion , etc . these concept have been imbibed in them from a very small age , because of which they are very aware of the situation . hence , they make sure they dont cause more damage than they can help . some of them have pledged to not use plastic after they have understood the harmful nature of it . another aspect of ` community ' could be the work environment . having a pleasant work environment is every employee 's dream . this can be acieved only by the cooperation of all the people involved . realising this , the youngster make sure they have a nice place to work . it is very easy to mould young mind and they will be more than willing to help the community and in turn help themselves . this way , they realise , they are giving back to the community that they got from .
