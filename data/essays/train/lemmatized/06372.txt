i haven ' t a specific position on this argument , because i think that is important in an equal measure how student understand idea and how they learn fact . i can make an example to support my answer . everyday we watch on television or read on newspaper that in some part of the world someone ha been submitted because he or she wasn ' t beautiful , smart , free , cristian or not , and what we do to stop it ? nothing or at least we do a committee in front of some important department of justice ! words only word . using the right word at the right moment , it sometimes can be very useful and permit u to obtain what we want at the beginning . but we usually don ' t make anything . we rest to observe in silence the world around u . to preserve and to protect our society , it ' s important , for a student , understand the origin of fact studying for example the history of his country - learn fact - , and at the same time , it ' s important to know idea and concept to understand the background of that fact .
