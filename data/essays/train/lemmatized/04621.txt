if someone asks me if i prefer to expect from the university a broad knwledge or a specialized one i will answer that i prefer a broad knowledge . obviously in five year is not possible to study all the existing subject . the knowledge should be devided in scientific knowledge and humanistic knowledge , so university should offer in a study course a wide knowledge in one of that category . these will make everithing more intersting : studing the same subject for a long time could be boring . another fact that make a broad knowledge better than a specialized one is that a wide knowledge is necessary to face work problem better . specialised knowledge will be improved during the rest of one person 's working life . university will never know which particular subject a company need so it can only offer a generic knowledge , therefore the factory/society that will employ that particular person will teach him the specific knowledge necessary for his future task . general knowledge provides more flexibility to everyone . flexibility is necessary to find the right solution to every kind of problem . infact if someone ha broad knowledge could solve a problem choosing a solution that ha already been used to solve a completly different problem : brainstorming requires a broad knowledge , this let to present a most wide range of solution . another aspect that must me said is that in a more fexible work market people cuold change several time their work , { in america this fact is well kown } so a specific knowledge will not support this sort of evolution . everyone ha to be ready to adapt to several kind of job !!!! thats all . . w
