a true learning is one where the student are clear with basic idea and concept of the problem . this the way by which they can solve many problem without complexity involved in it . though , fact about the perticular topic is important to know and it form an important element , without which learning is incomplete but understanding the idea and concept are equally required . for example , a child want to learn about how to solve a mathematical problem like addition or substraction . then it is very important that he know the concept of the problem . it is important for him to identify where he ha to add up and where he ha to substract . this will help him out to solve similar kind of problem in future , only becuase the idea and the concept are clear to him . further , we can learn the fact only by making inference and drawing conclusion which involves the complete understanding of idea . only then it will be possible to reach to a conclusion and eventually to learn about the fact . for example this is the fact that earth is the only planet where life exists . the main idea and reason behind it are becuase of the favourable atmosphere , presence of oxygen , earth distance from the sun etc.these thing help u to make a conclusion about existence of life on earth . which is the fact . in other word , the concept of a model which wa suggested by a scientist with sun at the centre in the planet system , one can give reason and explain the fact that earth is locatedat a perticular distance . so , what is more important is , to first have a basic idea about a concept and then learn the fact which is associated to it . this is the way any problem can be solved with better understanding and improved learning ability .
