i disagree with the statement and i believe that the number of car would have increased manifold in the next twenty year . this conclusion stem from the belief that our ever increasing population various technological improvement will contribute greatly in accelarating the demand for newer and more efficient car over the year to come . the next twenty year will see a tremendous growth in technology thus providing the necessary stimulus for various innovation that will benefit the automotive industry . these will spurt an unrestrained growth in the number of car thus leading to a far greater number than what is in existence nowadays . alternative fuelled car such a hydrogen fuelled car will become popular and will be sold extensively with the added benefit of being environment friendly and safe to drive . these measure will only attract customer which would otherwise be dissuaged from buying car due the the global oil shortage and environmental concern . the growth in population ha no limit . in the coming twenty year , i see a tremendous growth in population thus contributing to a larger workforce . this would have a two fold effect . firstly , the increased workforce will require a convenient mean of transport and secondly , they would have the power to purchase due to the ever increasing salary . aall this would obviously lead to people indulging in the purchase of car . this scenario will be prevalent in a country such a india in which people consider a vehicle to be a status symbol . so in the near future i not only see a car for every home in inda but also a car for every family member in most home . in view of the above reason , i 'm convinced that the number of car in the next twenty year wont be declining but increasing at such a rapid pace that i can imagine the decision to buy a car at that time being taken with the same amount of seriousness a the decision to buy a music system nowadays .
