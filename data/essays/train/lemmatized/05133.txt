if people are asked , in an survey for example , who enjoys life more , younger or older people , one is likely to answer spontaneously in favour for the younger one . this tendency might have it root in the wide-spread oberservation which can be made in the today 's society . but is this assumption right ? do younger people really enjoy life more than the older generation doe ? it is true there are a lot of offer especially for younger people to create their free time . there are club and bar in every city where an older person would not really fit in . besides there are also a lot of new sport activity which are especially developed and introduced for the generation under 50 . you can hardly imagine a senior standing on waterskis or making a bungee jump , can you ? but can therefore be concluded that the younger people enjoy their life more ? personally i do not think so . there is also a great number of leisure offer for older people that are really not le amusing at all than these for the younger one . for example you can find dancing event for senior nearly everywhere . as the health system ha improved extremely the last decade the older people are more healthy and fit than in former time . thus they are able to exercise a lot of sport despite their age . and they really do . the number of older member in sport club or gym ha increased enormously . older people also have other great advantage compared to the younger one . normally they have more money and more time . most of them earned money during their lifetime which they now want to spend for their fun . young people , on the opposite , often still study or earn not really a lot of money at the beginning of their job . that 's the reason why they often can not benefit from the rich offer . furthermore a lot of older people have already retired and now enjoy their new freedom and `` endless '' time . finally i think the mentality of older people ha changed . they are not longer thinking that only hard work can make them happy . they also want to enjoy the `` evening '' of their life . as a conclusion i want to point out that in my opinion older people enjoy their life toexactly the same extent a younger one do .
