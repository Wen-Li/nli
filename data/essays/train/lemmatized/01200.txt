do you agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community ? for my personality and fondness , i agree that yonug people spend too le time on concerning their communicaties . in addition , i will argue over the belife in the following reason . first of all , i think that young people spend too much time on their studing and playing . for example , most of student go to library for researching information after calss . in addition , many student go to play baseball and suffer the internet in their free time . moreover , some young people prefer do other execise to help their communication . furthermore , young people think that it is waste time for helping communicaties . in a word , few young people willing to helping their communicatiies . secondly , young people think that it is not necessary to help their communicatuies . for example , many young people spend many on buying their toy instead of helping others . in addition , most of young people think that communicaties is not their best friend or relates , so they do not willing help them . moreover , the soical structure ha a great change nowdays , few young people ha also change thier concept about how to help others . furthermore , young people ha misleading concept that they do have responbilities to help others . in short , many young people do not give enough time on thier communication . in summary , i think that young people do not give enough time to helping their communicaties because they do not realize that helping other is an essential vituer and value for human . in the end , i will conclude my argument by emphasizing that young people do not understand that the enjoyness and happiness from helping our community .
