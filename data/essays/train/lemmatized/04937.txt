i disagree that in 20 year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i really think that the way of energy for car and other characteristic will be different but still there will be car . following some explanation : nowawdays , the petrolum is becoming more and more expensive . the way to obtain petrolum are more costly and sophisticated to reach certain area in the deep of the ocean or earth . in additon , petrolum can be found in ocean that are lead by extremist country , which is a cause of conflict or even war in extreme situation . the gas for the car is becoming unaffordable to many people that us the car a a mean of tranport . the research of alternative way of energy to substitute the gast is a real need . this research ha been already started in many country and by many company , therefore car that use solar energy or other type of energy already exist . today , the cost of these innovative car is higher than current car . on the other hand , i belive that the sooner the gas is not any more available or only available to very small part of the population , the demand of these new innovative car will be increased and price will be down making the innovative car affordable . people that ha a car today is used to have one . they use it for real need like going to work , shopping , transportat or moving from one city to another if there is no other mean of transport . some people is so dependent to the car that they use a car for ocasions where it could be more effective to walk , take the train or the bus . in 20 year time the need will still be there and the car way of energy could be different . i think that the appearance of the car would be also different according to the new time : shape , size , material , safety complement inside the car .
