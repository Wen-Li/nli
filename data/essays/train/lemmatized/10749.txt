over the past decade , atmosphere pollution ha become a major issue for the international community , a the signing of the kyoto protocol , ment to reduce toxic gas production , in 1992 showed it . cars contribute to such a pollution , and therefore it is essential for the future of men to stop using them . but yet , it doe n't seem to me that neither politician nor people are ready to get rid of car in a period of time of twenty year . first and foremost , it is clear that in developped country , where most of the car are used nowadays , politician are not willing to implement policy that would force citizen to get rid of their car . in the most powerful of these country , the usa , the current administration doe n't even consider atmospher pollution to be a problem to tackle . it will therefore certainly take more than twenty year before something is done about this . in other country , if politician acknowledge car contribute to pollute the air , they prefer protecting the car industry whether than taking measure to restrict their use . only london and stockholm have restricted the access to car in their historical centre . and a infrastructure that could replace the use of car are missing , people are n't ready to get rid of them besides , the emerging country ' will to benefit of car ha to be taken into account . for the good of their economy , they can not restrict the developpement of the car industry , and they also want to benefit from the best way of life . they will therefore certainly not forbid people to use car . all in all , considering the economic context , the current policy implemented at all level to reduce the use of car and the people 's will to do so , there is no doubt that there will not be fewer car than there are today . i 'm affraid there will even be more of them .
