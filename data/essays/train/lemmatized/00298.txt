i agree . of course , old people can enjoy life well , however , they do not have enogh power and energy for enjoy . therefore , even they have time and money , sometimes they can not enjoy life . becouse it is difficult that they move and first , young people ha more power and energy than old people . for example ,, if people do not have enogh energe when they go to travel , they can not go long distance . young people sometimes enjoy life through travel . they try to get information and expierience , and then while they enjoy life , they use them . for example , if you want to be artist , you can goanywhere you want , like italy or new york . they can enjoy not only italian life , but also enjoy new york life . however , the old people can not go anywhere , even they want to go . becouse when they go to other country , it take long time . it is difficult for old people . next , young people do not have los of experience about life . thus everyting can ba curiouse for young people . so when they see something , it can be powerful and it can give them fun . but for in conclusion , people can enjoy their life even they are old . however if people want to enjoy more energetic life , they should enjoy when they are young . becouse they have more power than old people and more inocent than old people .
