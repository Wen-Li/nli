there is an old saying which state - `` jack of all trade and master of none '' i personally believe that being jack of all trade and master of none would never do any good to anyone . this lead to my disagreement with the given statement which state it is better to have broad knowledge of many field than to specialize in one specific subject . i do not deny the fact that it is important for one to have a broad knowledge of various academic subject , but in no way is it better than to specialize in one specific subject . academics is all about gaining knowledge . ever since our childhood , we are taught various subject . initially a child is taught the basic and then gradually the intricacy of the subject would be taught . on one hand , where it is good to know the basic of a subject , on the other hand it also becomes very important to attain specialization in one particular area of one 's interest . it is said ` half knowldege is a dangerous thing ' . when you know something of every thing and nothing of one particular thing , it might result in serious disaster . for example , if a medical student who ha not pursued his master in nuerology is made to give a treatment to a patient with nervous breakdown , then , with his limited knowledge of whatever nuerology wa taught to the him in his initial year of pursuing medicine , the student might end up in taking the patient 's life altogether . what patient need is not a person with varied knowledge in different stream , but a nuero surgeon who is a specialist . another reason why it becomes important to attain specialization is the fact that every body is blessed with one or the other skill . and so , a complete justice must be made to whatever skill one is blessed with . now this can only be achieved if the person show perseverance and dedication towards his potential in the skill and attains expertise in it . for instance , a work which is done by a carpentar could never be done with the same finnese by a plumber , how ever talented the plumber might be . each one of u have our own talent and skill and so we must pursue them further till the skill reach pinnacle of finnese and perfection . primarily , if only a broad knowledge of many academic subject is given to a student and the student decides not to go for perfection , he would not only end up messing his own life , but also of many others surrounding him . the whole world would then be filled up with many people who know many thing , tit and bit of every thing but the indepth knowledge would be misisng . this would mean , there would be no doctor , no lawers , no engineer and no research . where a , the specialization would enhance one 's capability , one talent and potential and make this whole world a lot better place to live in . conclusion : it is important for a student or an individiual to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject but what is more important is to gain specialization in one of the field which interest or appeal the most to the student . this would not only place the entire education system in an order but would also result in a highly talented pool of individual who would be of some worth to the society and inturn would become it priced asset . an indepth knoweldge is always better than having half acquired knowledge . where on one hand the latter could destoy the civilization , the former would develop the whole civilzation and would make this whole world a much better place to live in .
