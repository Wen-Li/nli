i do agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . to learn fact is a tempory solution to a problem while if you understand the idea and concept of the problem you can rember it for a life time . students who have command over the idea and concept of a particular subject perform well in the exam that student with mere information of fact . by learning fact you can just have one method of solution to a particular problem while if you understand the idea and concept you can apply your own knowledge to the situation and may come out with an different way of solution . not only this but also if you are through with the idea and concept of one situation you can even try to apply them to a different situation . text book also support that understanding idea and concept is mor e important for student . books give example to various law , theory and other statement . of these example most af them relate to day to day life so that it is easier for the student to make his own experimentation with what he ha understood . the importance of understanding and conceptualization can be explained by , for example , learn to drive a car . you go to a driving school and you learn to drive a car . you can drive the car now but you would do it much better if you have proper understanding of how a car work . if you learn the basic or very simple concept of car mechnics you can do your driving much better . it can also help you when you have breakdown though understanding and conceptualizing is time taking it is worth spending time on such long lasting method whose impact is much stronger on student learning .
