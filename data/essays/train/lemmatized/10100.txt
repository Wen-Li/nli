the car industry ha long been a central issue for most western country ' economy , and constitutes even some of the most powerful and influent firm such a general motors . the case being such , the future twenty-year tendancy , apart for being of a critical importance for such firm , should be a good clue for the industry and economy evolution . some long term tendancies support the increase thesis . the car are becoming cheaper everyday ; and driving is becoming easier : thanks to technology car are more safe et easier to drive , and the motorway web is developing and improving almost everywhere . cars have became unspareable nowadays , even apart from the deep countryside prejudice showing that poor lost farmer who can not have his daughter 's medicine delivered in time without a car . for the company car and truck is the fastest and most flexible way to make employee and material move , and being the best way to do it , it a became unspareable . but some other tendancies lead to the opposite . today is the first time in 30 year that the car production is decreasing . moreover , in some of the major city car have been forbidden or submitted to a tax in the city center , such a in london . in most of the major western city , such a paris , car have become much more slower than public transportation . and the increasing of public transportation is another heavy tendancy . of course the dramatically increasing oil price would probably enhance these tendancies . however , and concidering these antagonist point , car would certainly not disapear , but probably decrease in number . these consideration were mainly theoric and concerning western country . from a more technical point of view of just basically counting the car and giving interpretation , there are two fact : in western country we have reached a peak and then should be decreasing from now ; in china and in india the car number will simply explode before twenty year . and two billion people buying a car have more effect that 300 million american not buying a third car . even if several complex tendancies will compete in western country , and probably end up a a decrease , these evolution will be nothing compared to the thirld world car ' consumption which is very likely to explode in the next few year .
