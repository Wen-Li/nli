in this issue that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , i largely agree with the issue , in other word , i mainly consider that having broad knowledge is much better than just focusing on one specific subject . there are some reason why i support this assertion . first of all , in this morden and mechanical age , i do not think that a person just know only one specific subject . because the human being in a new technological world , such a internet , medium , and mobile phone , we are exposed in the explosion of information surroundings . every person , if he or she want , can try to gain information , like math or chemic , from everywhere ; moreover , everyone could be not completely far from every new information . beside , almost the mordorn worker or schoolars must know many aspect of knowledge to use them better in one way , because many company and reaserch organization need this kind of people . second , for sake of survive in the morden world , people at least have to know new information for living . people could not live too comfortable if they do not know how to use computer . for exemple , student have to log in the web of the school to know what program it ha and might register the final exam by personal . if some student is unable to use internet , he or she must go to office of school or ask the proffesor about this problem . in the nutshell , although we still need some specific schoolar to reaserch much detail in one subject , most of people can not be just limited by this statement because not everyone could be the great scientist or artist . consequantly , i mainly agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject .
