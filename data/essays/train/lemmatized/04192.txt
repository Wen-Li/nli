there is a series of factor or consideration to take into account concerning this issue . it is a commonplace that the risk is a foundamental and effective part of our everday life , despite this some people tend to avoid the risk in order to maintain a sort of stability . the obvious question which arises is : `` why some people are more inclined to risk than other people ? '' . in my opinion successful people are more well disposed to risk than others , because of various reason . in the first place people who are already successful could risk in order to improve their own condition of life or of work or , in some case , in order to be richer and richer . however the tendency to risk is not only caused by something of material but also mental factor could , in part , contribute to this behaviour : who is successful is more sure of his own ability and capacity than a dustman ( for instance ) , for this reason he belief that the risk could not affect him , or at least , it could affect him in minimal part ( naturally it is not true , but it could be his belief ) . certainly risk call risk but successful men know well this theory : this is proved by the fact that often successful men are owner of big financial company , and the financial world rapresents the most significative `` habitat '' of risk : for economist accepting what they presently have , even if it is for instance a remunerative thing , mean being in a state of lack of opportunity , for them not risking is a dangerous a risking . there is no point in considering the attitude to risk a an extremely subjective way of thinking but for men who have an important role in the society it is , i think , a kind of drug , without risk they are empty , they are always pushed by the possibility to improve their life or the life of their company . taking everything into account i believe that successful people tend to risk for their `` nature '' , but it can not be forgotten the the risk is something of acquiscent and unforeseable . and we need to pay attention at it .
