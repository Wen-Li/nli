here the topic is about , is it more important to the student to understand idea and conceots than it is for them to learn the fact . i strongly agree with the point of understanding the idea and concept . every student should have the concept and understand the idea rather than learning the fact about that . by lerning the concept the student can understand the subject very well and can be easy with that subject . if we understand the idea of the subject the student can proceed with the subject very well , and go deeper into the subject of which he is understanding . for example if we take the mathematics we need to have concept in the math than the fact regarding that , the idea are more important in mathematics than the fact . if we have the fact knowing about the mathematics then the real concept is not concentrated . because in mathematics practice is more important than knowing the fact . the student who is concerned about the fact it is of no use , because if he concentrated on fact he can not be in the competitive world , a the oter student are going fast by knowing the concept and idea . if you take a class room in which a student is intrested in knowing the fact rather than the concept and the idea then he will certainly loosing something which other student are gaining , being a conceptual and knowing the idea is the encoureged way then knowing the fact . at last i state that be a conceptual person and understand the idea rather than to be knowing the fact . understanding the idea will not featch a lot in the student life
