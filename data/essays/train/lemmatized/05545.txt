this statement seems like a biblical rivelation , but can be true if we considere only our europe . if i see the past , really , i see that in the last thirty year we have had at first a rapid , after more costant , growth of the number of car in general . really , the growth of car can be interpretated by the development of our europen society . of course , this growth ha token with it other problem , like the pollution , or the growth of the price of oil . so , in europen and american city , i think that there will be a slow decline of the use of car , caused by new law against car - use and it pollution , or by the encrease of price of the fuel , or by the oblish ( i hope !!! ) of the use of pubblic trasport in the centre of our city . for this reason , in europe , i think that the statement will be true . altough , if we see the world , it is sure that the total number of car will grow : some nation , like china , or india , or brazil , are becoming modern nation , and people of these area , will want to have a car like u . in fact , a good part of this people , that is migrating to the city , will have a better input of money and will be able to take a car . so , this fact will cause new pollution for these country , and until the government will not make new law , it will have a growth . so , in conclusion , with a global vision . i am disagreed with the statement , and i think that the situation can only become more negative . we must catch a solution not for car , but for pollution , and with the reserch to create a car with hydrogen like fuel , we will live better with more car .
