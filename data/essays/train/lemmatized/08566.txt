the issue at hand is whether broad knowledge on many subject is bettar than specialization in one specific subject . the issue is important because specialization on a specific subject is a major aspect for student during thier graduation and higher study . in my opinion to specialize on a particular subject is much better than to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . firstly , if the student specializes on a specific subject , he will be focussed and concentrated in his field of study . trying to have knowledge of all academic study might overburden the student and it might leave him in disarray and in a choatic condition . sometimes it may lead to serious consequence of getting very low grade . furthermore a subject will have lot of topic related to it . so a specializtion on such a topic will give an entire knowledge of that subject to the student . he is definetely going to master the entire subject . specialization on a particular topic will lead to research , a many thing are yet to be unravelled in this world . if the student pay specific attention to the specialization subject in case of higher study like post graduation , he may face new problem in that subject and result in research related activity which is very good . take for example if no one try to pay particuler attention on a specific field , there might have been no invention and discovery by the scientist . if einstein had not paid specific attention to his specialization subject of physic , there would have been no development because all human creation of this date are based on his many thoeries like three law of motion , theory of relativity , quantum physic etc . finally i want to conclude by supporting that specialization ona specific sunject is much better than having knowledge of many academic subject . as the saying go `` jack of all trade master of none '' ; a student focussed on specific subject will be called a master of specific subject . so student should be advised right from their secondary schooling to pay particular attention on subject they are intrested in and go for higher study .
