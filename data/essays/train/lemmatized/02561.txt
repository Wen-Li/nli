when youth of the past decade are compared with the current young people , a dramatic result appears , which is that young people do not give enough time to helping their community nowadays . in order make this comparison , we have to examine how it wa in the past , and how it is now . most of the nation have young hero in their history . to give an example from turkey , consider ataturk . he wa very young , when he joined the army . he wa about 20 year old , when he decided to do something in order to increase the overall living standard of his own community . ataturk is only a single example from the thousand of the young people of that time , who fight to death or thought about solution to the problem , which their community are facing . it is very clear from the historical event that youth of that time had serious concens about their community . when we examine the young people of today , we come up with a whole different picture . again to give an example from turkey , i can say that there only a few young people who are concerned with the current problem in their community . we see that , our young people can kill someone else because of a soccer team , or a girl . other than that dating with someone is more important than the hunger of the community for most of the young people of the current time . it is very frustrating to admit that we are rather living in our own world , a individual , rather than living in the real world a community . eventually , it is very easy to say that the young people are not giving enough time to helping their community . they are not concerned with the problem of the society and they do not tend to do anything even the community face a serious threat .
