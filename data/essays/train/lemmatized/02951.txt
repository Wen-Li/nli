definitly , people who is successful take their life in continuo challenge . sometimes , someone ask why he / or she can get everything that he/or she want and i ca n't . in my opinion , the answer is very simple . it is neccessary work very hard for get my goal . people successful have three esential characteristic that the frustrated people not . the first is take risk all the time , second they are confident in themself and the last they are positive . first , people successful said yes for almost everything to do ! . for example , i wa working in a project in the laboratory of pathology , but a partner to my field inviting to work in a different project . i worked with him without though in the inconvenients to result . when i accepted , i meant to studied harder and long hour to compensate my deficiency in something new . however , i did and we finished the project and published it . secondly , usually these people are confident in themself . they do n't feel scare to begin something . in fact , they always are in continuing challenge and never think in fail . they know very well their limit and capability . in addition , these charachteristic let them to work in best advantage than the rest of people . for instance , i followed the trayectory to famous basketball player . he knew his capability and deffects better than anyone , so he worked specifically in his deffects until he improved . as result , he wa the best basketball player to the year . this point is relevant for being successful , if i know my limitation . i need to work harder all the time with it . third , being positive is giving to me an excellent capacity to learning useful thing for my goal . in other word , i can get fails , but i take it , such experience for try again . in short , i agree with the statement people successful have to be confident , positive and be anger to take risk always .
