in twenty year , i think there will be more car in use than there are today due to the development of technology in automobile industry and to the general trend of the statistic versus year . most of the people living on earth have always been impressed by the charm of automobile throughout the history and they have always been open to renovation and modification about them . people easily adapt to technological change in car and show the ambition to drive every new model and version that ha been produced . therefore , there is a great interest in car among the public than in any other technological product . besides , car are often called the toy of men and a a result of this attutude ' men like to spend more time with their car . another factor that will increase the number of car in traffic would be it obligation a a transport medium . in our day , it is far beyond being accepted a a sign of luxury and wealth and almost everyone who hold a driving licence drive car while going to work , meeting , park and etc . in addition , although the reverse is correct in some country , the purchasing power of the people tend to rise in year and a a consequence of this fact , people prefer to drive car individually although it may cause some problem like weather pollution because of exhaustion gas , traffic jam and parking problem due to it abundancy . the final reason why the number of car will be more in the next twenty year would be the decline in the sale price of car . the car price seem to have fallen in the recent year and bank offer better campaign condition for those who want to buy either brand-new or used car . it is apparent that despite such problem it would cause in our daily life , the number of car are likely to increase in the forthcoming two decade .
