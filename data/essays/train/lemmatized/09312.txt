i disagree with the statement and i believe that people should specialize in one specific area of study . i will give some reason below . firstly , because the trend of study is transfering from generalist to specialist . certainly , there are historical figure who achieved a lot in different subject , but these figure rarely exisit these day . and a the resarch on each subecuts ha accumulated through century , now it is impossible to cope with the whole subject . these day , we are rather required to focus on one field . from my experience in the university 's master course and in the government , i i believe that this trend is common in academic and proffesional field . secondly , because we have so many information thanks to the develpoment of technology ; especially internet , and it is hard to catch up with a new trend in one subject already . thus , even if one try to acquire knowledge in many academic subject , the great possbilities are that he end up understanding every subject insufficiently . thirdly , because there is more possibility to contribute to the human being if we specialize in certain subject . i believe that having knowledge in different subject can enrich your life , because it help you to understand the world more . however , from the perspective of contibuting to the human being through your study , it is much helpful to others if you study really in depth in a certain subject and make an discovery or improvement in that field . there are plenty of example , especailly in scientific field . for example , we have doctor noguchi , who discoverd a vaccination and saved a lot of people . from these reason , i believe that we should concentrate on only one subject and this focus can make u more successful .
