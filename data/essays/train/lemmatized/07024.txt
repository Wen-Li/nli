i disagree with people who think that , nowadays , young people do not give enough time helping their community . first of all , i think it is very difficult to compare a society at different time . it is often heard that that young people were more respectuous and more polite in the past , but which past ? during the last century , the society in developped counries changed radically , hence it is very difficult to compare young people now and in the begining of twentyth cenury . for example , in the middle-age , there were a lot of war and young people had to help their community fighting against people . but now , it is doe not exist really . so the evolution of our socities make the comparison impossible . then , i think we can see every day young people who try to help other people of the community . we can see very often young people leaving their seat in a bus to a old person or a pregnant woman . that is , obviously , something very basic , but this kind of daily behaviour is very important because it make people feeling well and in safety . moreover , i think young people today have to study longer than in the past . they have many class , every day , except for the week end of course , and consequently they are more and more busy . our society , and consequenlty our communties say to young people to do some sport , to go to the cinema or to the nightclub , for example . it cause that young people have le and le time to do something . i also think that there is a kind of new definition of community for young people : for them this word represents people around them directly , and , for example , many student prefer to have activity in the different association of their university rather than to do something for the council for example . but it doe not mean they do not give time to helping their community as a conclusion , it is obvious that , for me , young people spend a lot of time to help the community , even though this time is not this one expected
