i agree to the opinion of having broad knowledge of many academic subject than restricing yourself of having knowledge of a specific field of interest and area . i believe that one should be well informed and aware of whats happening outside his domain and specialisation . its primarily because of three reason : - a ) competitiveness : - the society we live in is a very competitive society . . so when you are not well informed about whats happening outside your field of interest ; then you are seriously in trouble and indeed are lacking behind people who have a competitive edge over you . ex : - being a software engineer ; if you dont have the knowledge of whats happening in the hardware industry or for that matter in the electronics industry in general ; then you might not be able to keep up with the information on latest gizmo and technology . moreover others would have a competitive edge over you . b ) uncertainity : - the second reason is uncertainity of the current field you are specializing to sustain itself ; say 15 year down the line . if you are talking about a technolgy which is being used now ; there is no guarantee that it would be there after few more year . ex : - everyone is behind java and some other programming language . . now no one is sure that java is going to be there in the future ; say five year down the line . so it better to have a backup plan ready for now wherein you are constantly updating yourself with other subject . c ) organisational need or industry requirement : - now-a-days large organisation do offer interdepartmental transfer by cross-training on different product thus giving a chance for the employess to move on to a different vertical altogether . . if you are just informed about a specific field and are resistant against the inter-departmental transfer . it can really hamper your chance of moving up the ladder in the corporate field . thus i believe that you need to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than just a mere specialisation . .
