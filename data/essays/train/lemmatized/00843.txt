helping in community helping in community is very important four young people because it make them more reponsible . it also can help them to find their sense in life and to feel useful . on the other hand , i agree with the statement that young people today do not give enough time to help their community . they have not enough time to do so , they do not identify with their community and the work is not sait to be fun . firstly , there is very much pressure put on young people to be sucessful in school . in our society , it is often more appreciated to have good mark than to help other people . mostly , college do not care about the privat and social life of student but about their mark in school . therefore , it seem to be more important to student to work for school than to help other people . due to this , there is not much time left to spend on helping other people . secondly , young people often do not have a very close relationship to their community . on reason for this is that people change the town thez are living in quite often . for example , if parent find an other jod in an other town , they will take thier child with them and the whole familiy will move away . if this happens often , the child can not devellop a close relationship to their community . for this reason young people do not give enough time to helping their community . thirdly , young people want to have fun in their free-time . if you ask a young boy whether he preferes spending his time playing football or to go out with frinds or to help an old woman , he will surely answer that he like to play rather than to help . we live in a sociaty that supply having fun . i believe that this is an other reason why young people do not give enough time to help their community . due to these reason , i believe that young people do not spend enough time on helping in their community . i hope that this fact will change in future .
