in my opinion you can not generalize the statement that younger people enjoy life more than older people do . you have to differ on what their pleasure is based on . indeed there are certain activity , like sport for example , that receive more intention by the youth rather than the older generation since they are very likely not being able to participate in these particular activity anymore due to their current health condition . but we should not forget that every older person once ha been young too and enjoyed the same . with the process of growing up , we change and develop into another being that find new way of enjoying life . we might rather even more have to question the definition on the actual enjoying process . if joy lead u to happiness , we can also conclude that an older person might enjoy being old , because he ha pretty much achieved everything he ever wanted and now feel responsible to lead the youth through the same process he ha been going through . regarding the fact that there have always been people that were n't necessarily able to enjoy life , talking about certain disability or circumstance , one can conclude that we might have to offer these person a chance to enjoy life on a different base . i can imagine that enjoying life also ha a lot to do with healthy relationship that we take and depend on our entire life . in brief , this statement ha only a significant value , if we compare the actual enjoying process between young and old on a particular activity , like sport , reading , etc. , but can not be generalized at all since every person can find it own pleasure of joy throughout every period of life we are facing even under the most terrifying circumstance , which exists for certain people but should be tried to taken by a community a much a possible .
