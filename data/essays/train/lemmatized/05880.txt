since the invention of the first car , their amount ha always increased causing a lot of damage to the environment . nevertheless , i believe that in twenty year , this worrying tendancy will be decrease . first at all , it will be very harmfull to the environment if the amount of car tend to increase more and more . that is why , in the next year , the government will have to take strict measure to prevent people from using their car every day . there already are some measure such a when the pollution is too high , only certain kind of car are allowed to circulate . but , a far a i am concerned , the governement should do more and strenghten the law . they can develop public transport and make me them cheaper . moreover , the price of the fuel ha strongly increased , and it cost and will cost more money to move by car , even if other energy are developed . much of people can not afford to pay more and will find more benefit not using their car , but rather public transport . an other reason make me believe that the amount of car will decrease . indeed , technological progress are more and more developed and performed quickly . in few year , cars will be replaced by some innovation who enable people to move cheaper , faster and easier . to conclude , even if automobile firm intent to create cheaper and more ecologic car , i think that news innovation will be created at the expanse of the car . and in twenty year , the supply of car will have been collapsed , and then the amount of car will have been strongly decreased .
