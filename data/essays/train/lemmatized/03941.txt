as far a i am concerned , i totally agree with the statement stating that having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . the reason that why i think like this , are the following : general academic knowledge within a broad range is a required item for the increasing interdependency between certain academic field and provides the ability for the people in order to adopt the common language in the academic environment . firstly , nowadays , academic field begin to be very correlated with each other . for instance , i am an undergraduate student in a bioinformatic major and i am taking course from computer science , biology , electronics and statistic . since there begin to be believe that integrative approach may be more successfrul from pure biological , computational and statistical approach , lot of academician from different field come together , share their idea and effort to provide a productive effort . in my internship , i witnessed this working environment very closely in stanford university , because we are colloborating with the medical school a the statistics department . in order to understand these common approach , i had to gain a knowledge about both medicine and statistic . apart from this increasing connection between certain field , there is a common language in the academician . for the people aiming to be a academician in the future , it is a must to have a general knowledge . since they have a lot of friend of academician from various area , they have to interact their colleague in the academic environment . they must perceive even a little about what their friend are talking in their field . they must express their idea about various field in an academic talk . they can obtain this ability by trying to learn about different field . because of the above mentioned reason , i would prefer to have a general knowledge than specializing in a specific field .
