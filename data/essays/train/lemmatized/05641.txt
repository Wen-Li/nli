i strongly opine with the statement that it is best to travel in a group led by a tour guide . if you visit a new place , it is always better to consult a guide since we will be ignorant about the historical information . there are lot of benefit when you have a travel guide around . the guide will have vast amount of information regarding the place . for example , they could give you historical significance of the place or any other important reason for the fame of a particular place . it would be of no point in visiting place when you are completely unaware of it significance . and also , the guide will have vast knowledge about the place around so that we will not miss any of them and repent later . it is also convinient to interact with people when guide are around . there could be huge linguistic difference and also cultural difference . also , there are all possibility of getting cheated by people when you are a foreigner . usuaully , the guide are multilingual and hence there are no chance of getting cheated . in india , a south asian country , there are many historical place famous for it magnificient architecture . there are story depicting their significane . it would be of no point if we look at the work without any knowledge about it . it would merely be a piece of work . but instead if we know the story behind it significance , we will be in a position to appreciate the work . i could give a good example to support this point . one of my friend had been to a historical place in india . when she returned , she told me her experience and the work she saw . she did not feel anything special about it . i then , explained the significance of the place . it wa then she really appreciated it and felt that she should have known it then . she then appreciated the culture and did further research on the topic and the culture . hence , i feel that it is always better to have sufficient knowledge while visiting any place .
