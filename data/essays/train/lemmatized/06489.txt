i disagree with the statement because taking risk is very dangerous and often became very unsuccessful over many year . there are hundred of company i never heard of that were founded by a person took risk to make some money . even though it may sound easy , but it is very complicated : dealing with employment , monthly or yearly payment , government tax , etc . as the result , only a few company or even no company will survive . the result make many people become moneyless or deptors . taking risk is not a good idea . trying is not a bad thing , but risking is not a good thing . there are only a few people who succeeded by risking , while there are million who unsucceeded by risking . that 's why people who only doe what they already know how to do well succeeds more often than those who take risk . for example , early pioneer tried to make flying possible for human . of course , the inventor succeeded , but the others lost money , wasted time , or even died . but now billion of people fly each year in an airliner or private airplane . how did that happen ? the manufacturing company invented better airplane , based on the early inventor ' design . in other word , they invented what they already knew how to do well . then the manufacturing company succeeded , selling thousand of the same model , for the same price , and ending what it 's like today . there are many successful people who tried new thing and took risk . but there are more people who succeeded by not taking risk and only doing what they already know how to do well . like i mentioned earlier , taking risk could change people 's life in a bad way by making them lose money , or even killing them . but only doing what you already know how to do well is an easier and safer way to succeed .
