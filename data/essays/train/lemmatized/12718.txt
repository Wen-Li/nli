i would agree with the given statement , but only to a certain extend . i consider it true that in order to have success , one ha to try thing that are new and innovative in at least one aspect . but , on the other hand , one ha to apply such skill a he posse in order to get the best outcome possible out of his action . there are example of people trying new thing , not achieving anything . vincent van gogh is one of these . he did something highly innovative , according to standard and taste of his time , without having any success in his life . on the other hand , there are example of people merely copying an idea or a product who are enjoying immediate success . `` studivz '' , the german version of american `` facebooks '' , an internet domain where student and other young people create an internet profile of themselves and share friend , is a perfect example : the inventor of `` studivz '' copied the whole idea of facebooks . the only new , innovative thing they accomplished wa transferring it to germany , where it had immediate success . of course , there is a new aspect added to the original idea in transferring the concept to a different country , but it is by no mean a genuine idea . to my eye , these two example show that the given statement is rather general and superficial , implying that successful people are innovative whereas the unsuccessful one are not . success is certainly dependent on a variety of factor besides the idea being new , such a fashion , skill , funding , etc . i doubt there is a formula , a certain way to success . nonetheless , the given statement 's truth lie in stressing the importance of new idea for being succesful . in my opinion , the key to success is to be innovative , but not necessarily by trying a completely new thing or do something that surpasses one 's own skill . rather , one should carefully consider option , wait for the best moment to come forth with a new idea and think of the best way of issueing this new idea to the market .
