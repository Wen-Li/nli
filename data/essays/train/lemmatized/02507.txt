when a wa a child my parent tell me about the importance to help other people . i think that is very important on the education of a person . young people nowdays do n't give enough time to helping their community . i think that it is a big problem for our comunity because it creates a sense of indifference for other people . if each person give some time to helping his comunities we can live in a better world . i give some of my time to help other people because i think it 's very important . a possible solution at this problem is that the school give some time for a civic education .
