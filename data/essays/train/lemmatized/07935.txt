i agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more that older people do '' because the young people will be more active , fast thinking , no tension about the family and the future and emerging of new culture and technology . firstly , young people will be more active and fast thinker than old people because they will believe that `` time is precious '' i.e .. , once the time and age is gone they cant get bact it to enjoy and correct the thing according to them . but the old people will be very slow in taking decision and theey will very superstitious . secondly , younger people will not have any tension about the future and family problem because they will think that there will be lot of time to think about the family . but old people will think about the problem of the family member and they will take it a a responsilibity to solve the problem and giving good future to their family member . for example , if there is any financial problem then young people depends upon the old people to solve that financial problem and they will concentrate on other thing which give free from tension . hence younger people get more time to enjoy the life than older people . lastly , younger generation experience different type of enertaining culture and tecnological event to adapt to it and gaining pleasure and happiness from it . as the older people belongs to older generation they cant adapt the new culture and they continue to live in the old manner . for example , younger people go to the different type of movie , function and other entertainment technicques to make them enjoying the life and fell happy but older people cant show much interest on that event . so i conclude that younger people will enjoy the life than the older people do because of the interest shown by the older people , emerging of new culture and using new technology to lessen the burden , fast thinking and no tension about the family problem . they also avoids problem by knowing the experience of the older to people .
