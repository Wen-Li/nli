the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in my opinion , that 's not true . traveling by a group which is led by a tour guide will might be a good trip . you do n't have to reserve a hotel or restraunt , and you do n't have to plan almost everything . but , i think thatthere is a mistake on here . choosing hotel , restsaunt , country , where you going to go . .. everything is fun and called `` trip '' . also we have to remember is , guide company could maybe make mistake . so your tour could be destroyed by guide company . these are the reason why i disagree with this question .
