some people choose to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , while others prefer to be specialized in one specific subject . as for me , i would rather choose to be specialized in a specific subject only . though there are a variety of subject in a university for you to follow with . but a single man 's energy and time are so limited that you ca n't afford wasting too much time on subject that ha nothing to do with your future career . imagine a freshman majoring physics with a selection of english literature in hand all day around , will he succeed in his field someday ? hardly . furthermore , we call these `` academic subject '' because they are nothing alike with subject such a math or geography learned in high school . they are far more complex and complicated . you ca n't expect to manage it within a semester or two . it need a whole 4-year systematic learning process to get to a professional level of certain field . some people can easily fall in love with a subject just because an affection on the spur of the moment , a soon a he realizes that he wo n't be able to catch up with the course whatsoever , he will just simply drop halfway . finally , having a determination in specializing a single subject is a crucial step on your way of self-realization . anybody who want to be successful and legendary in his field must have perseverance and expertise . michael jordan may be a good example . as soon a he decided to become a professional basketball player , he devoted all himself to the basketball court , without thinking other alternative . he set his goal and went for it ! in conclusion , specializing in a single subject rather than pursuing many academic subject will be a wise choice . focusing your energy and time into the subject , accumulating knowledge from that field and set your future goal firmly without doubt , it will lead you to the road of glory !
