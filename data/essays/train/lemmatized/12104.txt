i believe that young people enjoy life more than old people for several reason . young people have more energy to spend becase thay are in good shape and they do n't have any physical problem . they can practice any tipe of sport and spend hour outdoor playing with their friend . they have a lot of free time due to the fact that they do n't work and that they do n't have to look after any kid . during this free time they can go aut to bar , pub or disco and meet new friend . in addition to this they can also meet a girlfriend or a boyfriend and having romantic dinner . young people do n't have problem with money because they can always ask to their parent if they need them . using the parent 's money they can buy a sail boat for the summer in order to enjoy the sea during the summer or they can buy a pair of ski for the winter time . during the summer school vacation they can also travel around the world using airplains or boat . they can , for example , organize a tour of all the main town of europe . in every town they can try different restaurant , go to see concert and drink all night long . when they are at home they can use internet to buy several item , meet new people and create their personal website . unfortunatelly they do n't spend part of their energy to help old people even if they know that in fourty year they are going to be old too .
