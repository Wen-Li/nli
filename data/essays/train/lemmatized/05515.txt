almost all people have some experience of trip , and there experience will become great memory of their mind . there are alot of style of trip . some people go to trip with a tour guide ; hoewver , i think that going to trip with guide is not best way because people can create own plan , and they have enough time to trip first of all , people can manage the trip plan . it is very imprtant thiing for them because they can create original plan . moreover , thinking about trip plan become funtastic memory for people . i have a experiene about this situation . when i wa a college student , i went to canada to trip with my friend . it wa terrific becuase we could create own trip plan . moreover , we struggled english , but it wa very necessary memory for them . if we had gone to canada with a tour guide , we could not have taken such a imprtant experience . secondly , people can go to the everywhere they want because some guide strict . moreover , most tour which present a tour guide are not free , and people cannnot have enough time to look everywhere . traveling without a guide are free , and people do not have to concern about time . when i went to canada with my friend , we could go to everywhere we wanted . therefore , traveling with a tour guide is not best way for me because there have alot of benefit . people can think about plan which is suite for them , and they can spend enough time to spend only their time . moreover , the experience become good memory for them .
