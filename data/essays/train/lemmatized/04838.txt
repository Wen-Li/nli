`` young lpeople enjoy life more than older people do . '' this statement might sound true because it is commomly known that a joyfulsoul and a young heart exist in a young body . but i have personally an objection about both statement : a young heart can still exist in old body if one know how to enjoy his life and make himself happy . an old person should convince herself that she is not a teenager anymore and that she can not do the think she used to do when she wa young . this way this old person would adapt to her situation and try to accomodate the thing she is able to do to the ongoing life . many activity can fullfill the life of an old person and steel away the feeling of gettin board . few exemples may support my disagreement with the stated subject : by reading , practicing sport if possible , helping people , a person may still find herself useful to the society . this feeling break away sadness and unhappy momemts . by working a a volonteer if possible , someone may feel that he is really helping instead of spending the day wondering what to do . grandkids , most of the time love to stay with their grandparent and listen to story from the past . dedicating time to grandkids strengthens the relationship between parent and grandchild which will bring joy to the life of a grandparent . many other thing also help old people to integrate in the society , like participating into religious and social activity , working in a natural context ( agriculture .. ) , travelling . .. still the problem persists with sick old people who are physically unable to reach anywhere or are not enough educated to fullfill their time with intellectual activity . .. these people still can be happy if they really have a young heart , if they love other people and especially their surrounding relative . when one know how to love , he will be loved and will have a joyful life .
