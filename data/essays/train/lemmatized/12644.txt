it is a controversal issue that which is more important for student to understand idea and concept or to learn fact . some people say that student learn fact because it 's easy to memorize about something . but in my opinion , student have to learn idea and concept about something because of two reason . first of all , learning idea and concept are a basic way to understand everything . if they just memorise fact about something , for example , maybe at that time they think they know everything . but after that if they met some problem that are simmiller with something that they just learned , they will not be able solve the proble because they just learned not basic idea and concept but the fact about something . which mean they do n't know how to solve the problem and how to think to find the way . second , if student learn idea and concept about something , it make student can more creative than that they just learn fact . for instance , if student learn about a car and understant idea or concept about how to move the car , after then they can expect that how to move a truck or bus . also , they will think about other transportation like a train or subway and think about their work . maybe these thinking way make student more creatively . in conclusion , because of reaons that i above mentioned , student have to understand idea and concept when they learn about something . it is a best way to understand and also it help student think about everyting creatively .
