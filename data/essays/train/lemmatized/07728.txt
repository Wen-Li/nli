i think that it is correct to say that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are more energitic and dynamic than the old people . young people enjoy in different way by engaging in different activity . for example they enjoy by playing basket ball , soccer , rugby and so on but the old people who are not that much energitic can not get engaged in the sport a much a the young . also the young people have no resposibilities a they are mostly dependant on their parent for the money so they enjoy a they wish . the older people will be mostly retired from the work and they need to save the for their future purpose . example for health care need , food , shelter and so on . the old people are more prone to disease than the younger people a they tend to have lesser immunity than the young . so they will be spending more time in the hospital than outside . for example you take a old man who is suffering from pain of the joint due to osteoarthritis he will not get cured during his life span but it can be suppressed by using medicine . the disease like carcinoma , gout , arthritis occur more comonly in older people a their immune system ha degraded with age . the old people also may have their wife or husband who is not a working partner may increase the rensponsibility of the other person . the old people also have lot of thought in their brain might be family problem or the bussiness tension but such thing are not there for young . they can enjoy to the maximum a no opposing force like money might not be a real problem . i conclude by saying that old people are the people who have many responsibility and mutilated by so many factor but on the other hand young people donot have so many tension and problem . so there is more chance for the young people to enjoy than the older one .
