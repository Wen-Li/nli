i totally agree with the statement that sucessful people are willing to try new thing and take risk rather than just doing what they know and do thing which they do well . i will elaborate & exemplify my reason for doing so . people who are willing to try new thing show that they have a sucess attitiude . this is the most important factor for any one to succeed . afterall it show the desire & willingness to try new thing which have not been tried before . recently i read a story about a buisnessman who went on a holiday to indonesia , where he got an opportunity to learn about the working of a steel mill . just by his new way of doing thing he bought that steel plant & today owns more than 25 % of total steel production in the world sucess attitude come to those who have the knowledge about why should they try new thing . if someone doe not have the knowledge he will not be able to try new thing . taking the same example , why wa the buisnessman i mentioned above , could take over the indonesian mill . this is for the simple reason , that he had the knowledge from back home , about waht work & what doe n't a his father had a small steel plant . lastly peope who are willing to take the risk , by trying out new thing exhibit leadership . it is only this leadership quality which generates that desire to know more , to do more & to achieve more . today the buisnessman i mentioned above is respected a the world leader in steel industry , because he took initiative . on the other hand people who only do thing which they know to do well are are indirectly indicating , they are happy in what they are doing . in my opinion it is a attitude which may not lead to sucess in the long run . hence i believe that the world belongs to those who are willing to try & willing to do new thing . this is my philosphy of sucess .
