i think young people do n't give so much time for community a age ago , but they still give enough time to helping their community . nowadays the community have lost a lot of their importance . years ago , community were much more important , because a person spent the whole or nearly the whole life in the same community . today , in a globalized world , one life for some year in one community and for some year in another community . people change much more their place of living and they are not so dependent on community a in earlier age . for this reason people , especially young people , do n't identify themselves so much with one community and because of that they are also not interested in spending a lot of time for a community . another reason is , that young people do n't have so much time a in earlier age . especially school and university became much harder . because of that , young people have to spend much more time studying and do n't have a lot of time for their community . also at work , young people are more and more under pressure and have to work more . they also have to improve their skill and therefore have to go to an evening school or something similar . nevertheless , it 's not the case that people do n't spend time to helping their community . in my opinion they do it in a more indirect way . they support organisation a `` wwf '' or `` amnesty international '' which do n't work in a particular community ; they work global . but their work contributes to the whole world and also to the community . it 's important that somebody care about the environement and happening in the world , which in fact influence all of u , also the local community . because of the above mentioned point i think that young people give enough time to their community , even if it is in an indirect way .
