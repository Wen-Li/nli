for me is important to say that most of the person start from the same level . i mean same money and culture . so when somebody is joung he have to decide what to do in his life , so he ha to decide . the problem is that almost anybody know what he will do in his future . that 's the reason becouse a lot of people do a lot of different job at the beginning hopying to find the right one . the purpose of the man is to find the best way to live , at least for himself . when he finally find the job that he think is good enough for his aim , he will not do anithyng else , he will not find another job to replace it , maybe he will try to improve his job or find a secondary job . that 's why this situation give him stability and he will feel safety . that 's could be the reason becouse even successful people try new thing rather than ordinary people . in fact is very difficult that some business man risk to improve his , already good , situation . but even the ordinary people think the same : they wo n't risk to lose what they have , even if could be just a bit for a big business man . i thing that somebody will not risk anymore when he find the harmony between his request and his possibility . besides very often even if somedody do n't know how to do well one thing , the important is that it 's linked with his aim .
