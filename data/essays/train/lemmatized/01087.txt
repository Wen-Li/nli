the question of whether young people or older people enjoy life more than the others do requires important consideration . to my mind there are two main reason explaining why this question is difficult to answer . first what doe ` enjoying life ' mean ? secondly , do you think that enjoying life is an issue of age ? all these question considered , personally i tend to think that young people enjoy life and benefit from life pleasure more than older people do . firstly , it advisable to explain my way of thinking about ` enjoying life ' : during the seventy , all around the world , many young people were expressing their fancy for liberty and pleasure . at this time young people craved for enjoying life . that wa the first time in the history that the pleasure took a very important place in everyone life . in my opinion , enjoying life deal with enjoying every pleasure , every good moment of our life . enjoying life should express hope , whishes and dream , in other world , every day of my young life , i try to think and dream of a better future , when all my dream will be possible . with this way of thinking , it esay to understand why when you are young , it seems to be more easy to enjoy life , much more easy than you get older . because adulthood deserves more seriousness , more patience , more reflection . older people often have child to take care , and child become their priority far before their own pleasure . professional word requires also seriousness and reflection , it could be difficul for older people to give up all their obligation for taking time to enjoy life . secondly , enjoying life could depond on the age , but not really your civil age but your mental one . i mean , if you think a a young people , you can act a a young people . thus , you can give up your activity if you feel boring , with the condition you are free , you do not have personal , familial obligation . even if enjoying life could be affordable for everyone , it ' s much easier when you are young always being young is not a wishfull thinking , do not forget the better is coming . you will agree to live fast , anddie young
