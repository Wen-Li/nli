it is important for the student to understand the idea and cocepts and also to learn the fact about those idea . this is because only knowing the idea doe n't help them to understand the theory accurately . the fact help them to get the live idea of the theory they study . for example if we consider the lightening and the sound which will occur during the time of rain give them the idea that the sound is heard before that the light appears . this is the idea that every student know . but the fact behind it is that the sound travel faster than the light so it happens a such . so it is important for the student to know both the idea and fact of any theory . just knowing the idea without the fact make it waste a they could n't apply any where . as experience is the best teacher , the fact they come across in their day to day life even help them to understand some new idea that they learn in their class . if the student just understands the concept of the way of arranging all the part of an automobile in the mechanic class and if he or she do n't know the fact based on that that is how to do it practically , it is not possible for them to arrange it in the real life time . in all the way it is necessary for a student to know the idea and concept a well a to know the fact . as i am a student doing a project now and a i see my friend who know only the idea but not fact suffering because of their lack of knowledge based on it and i myself doing the project and answering the question related to my project without any difficulty a i know the fact of the subject on which my project is based on . so i can say that if the student know both the idea and fact then only he or she will come out with flying colour in their real life .
