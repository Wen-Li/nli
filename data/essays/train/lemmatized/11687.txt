nowadays , pre-scholars to ph . d candidate are confornted with ever more challenging learning requirement . therefore we should take the need of knowing fact into consideration . i strongly feel that it is more essential that scholar learn how to comprehend idea and concept than to merely know fact and data , because student have to apply them and knowledge ha lost it importance due to widely reachable information ressources . firts , student recieve a better , more adequate preparion for college or employment , when they learn about theory , idea or concept . the reason for this is that during study or post-university work they have to apply what they have learned earlier . in the engeneering industry , for example , worker apply the concept developed by researcher . it would be unthinkable that it is possible to build something complex like a space shuttle , or a more trivial , without konwing the theory of expanding matter in heat . furthermore , in our internet-depending community most information ha become easily accessible . thus , the key qulification of an employee ha changed from konwing fact to understanding and applying them , in other word being familiar with concept . imagine you have two decide between two different applicant with various qualification . surely , you would prefer the applicant , whose knowledge about concept and abilitu to actually apply them is more effective , over the one who is just familiar with data and fact , but find abstract method abstrusve and fails to apply them , when you in turn can look up most of the infromation yourself . though being convenient with idea and able to use this knowledge brings more opportunity than just knowing detail , learning fact is , nevertheless , still impotant to support the understanding of abstarct method by exemplifying them . thus , child should be teached the fact in order to comprehend them via interprataion .
