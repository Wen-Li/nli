young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , i disagree with this statement for the following reason : every age differs from the one before it and everyone should know that every age ha it own unique way in thinking , learning and solving problem so what we did and doing to our communitiy now is different than our olders did to there at there age so they will think that we a a young people are giving nothing to our communitiy because it is different than what they did when they were at our age . new technology is spreading all over the world in a super fast way that is helping the community to improve and to facilitate life and with the help of young people these technology will be spreading and improving even faster with there new idea cause a usual new idea and revoloution idea get created from a young person , just like when an owner of an old factory refuse to use the computrized inventory system and stick to the old one that is maybe effictive but not a efficiant a the new system is . no one can forget the great thing our older people did and achived to make our life more easy . but younger people will help in their communitiy because it is a must and life will stop if they didnt , and a usual when young peolpe grow up they will repeat the same statement that younger people are not helping their community because thats the circle of life .
