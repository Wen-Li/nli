sucess is a famous word used in our everyday life . why sucess is so important ? for me is something we have to figure it out . you ca n't said for being sucessful you need to be like this or like that , because it depend of our goal or the goal of our society . i 'm agree when is stablished that `` sucessful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . i 'm agree with this statement because our life is compound by layer of goal , certainly a person without goal is a person without purpose in life . people who we describe a sucess is people who take chance , people who is prepare to take their life in their hand and make thing possible . people who we admire is people that tried something new thing and got sucess in it . how we are going to be call sucessfull is always is doing the same thing , and do n't try anything new to applied the characteristic of sucesful , for being sucesfull you need an action before the adjetive . how could we describe something that doe n't happen yet . it is impossible . it is like our college live you have to take new class everytime , but before taking a new class , you need to sucesfully pas the that class that you are taking in the actual moment . when you pas that class , you can go to the next level , why ? because you wa succesful in the last want . the term of succesfulness is a term for step in our life , but for keeping being sucessful we have to try new thing in a new level to can be call succesfull again . i you do the same thing that you already know how to do well , you can be describe a you was succesful when you succed and learn how to did that well , but that wa in the past , to be sucessful in a present tense you need to do something in which you could succeed .
