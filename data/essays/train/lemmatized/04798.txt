nowadays , most of the young people have a job , a family or live only in a relationship with a girl/boy . so they have n't much spare time , but in the following text , i will mention my opinion and how it could work . on the one hand , if you live at home with your parent and go only to school , you should support your parent in the household , because you live there and get everything from then , so the parent can ecxept some help . you should n't do anything but you can share the work , which ha to be done . for example you can make a plan for a week or longer about who have to do the dish or to clean , so everybody make some work in the house . the work should be fairly shared . on the other hand , if you go to work to work all day from morning until the evening , it is very difficult to find a fair solution for everybody . after the work you are tired and if you should do then some work in the household is very hard . for this problem , the solution could be , you can arrange with your parent to do some work at the weekend . ok , you are young and would like to make party in the evening , but i guess you live at home and your parent care for you , so you should give something back to them and they will see that you know what they do for you . they get something back for there care or worry about you . i ca n't understand the young people , whose think that their parent have to do all the work in the household . when the parent cook for me , it is absolutly okay and my job to make the dish . moreover it is my job to clean my clothes and to iron them . finally , i think there are not many young people who do like me . most of them , it is sad but true , think , their parent have to do all the work at home , so they can go out and meet friend . i absolutly agree with the statement that a lot of young people don , t give enough time to their community .
