helping our community . i think it 's true that young people nowadays are n't willing to help their relative and friend a much a they did decade ago . but i also think that this is a phenomenon appearing strongest in the ` developed western civilisation ' . for u time change rapidly , everything grows faster , move faster , people travel a lot and the world itself becomes ` smaller ' . i mean you have the chance to study in europe , work in china and buy a holiday cottage in mexico so i think our way of living tends to go into a more ` selfish ' way . family and community is a strong background that everyone need but i think it 's not the first thing you think about in our time if you start living on your own . you live on your own so you care about yourself first that 's our way of living i think . years or decade ago people settled down and founded a family , helped their parent keeping the business and tradition alive and so the connection to the people surrounding them wa more evident . but a mentioned , in my opinion , i think this is more a cultural thing , people , especially younger people in a third world country for example still have that close connection to their relative and communites a it 's necessary . they are more or le their parent ' life insurance that you pay here from your own money , so i think that 's one more reason that people nowadays are more focused on themselves . all in all even me a one of those young person nowadays still feel that there 's enough time to help my community . maybe it 's based on different reason than year ago but i try to help my people whenever it is necessary in all aspect of life and i also like to receive support from my community myself .
