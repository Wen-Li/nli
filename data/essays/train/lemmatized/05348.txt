i did not agree with this statement . actually , i give more value to fact . i think without knowing fact , one can not analyze idea or concept . then you will only memory , not understand . if you really want to learn the idea and concept about sth , first you should learn all the fact about it . then you can be ready to understand and discus both the given idea and concept . however , i understand the reason behind this . as everybody , the student want get good mark without studying hard . that why we choose to learn only the thing that will be asked to u . if they ask to write the idea and concept instead of let 's say argue this concept or state whether you approve or disapprove this and that idea , naturally a student pay no attention to learn the fact . obviously , he or she will prefer to memory the idea and concept about a subject and then he or she will get a good mark . that 's what i have faced many time when i wa at high school . this wa the first reason actually . the second reason is that many resource do not cover enough fact , mostly they embrace the result or the consequence . there is not a chance to cover all of the fact . the student choose learn idea and concept due to the education system . they teach u how to memory not to discus .
