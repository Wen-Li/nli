the issue at our hand is wheather it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i think it is better to be specialized in one specific subject . if one chooses a single subject in which the student want to be specialized , he will be more focused towards that specific subject and it implimentations and he will become a professional in that subject . where a if he ha broad knowledge of many academic subject he will be half focused towards all the subject and he would not be able to handle any subject perfectly . because of this reason i think it is better to be specialized in one specific subject . and also he can spend much more time on that perticular subject and he can concentrate more on that subject with which he can improve his knowledge in that subject by presenting several paper on it and doing several project for the implimentation of the subject . where a having the broad knowledge of many subject may make the student purplexed . lastly consider an example of a person who can play chess , basket ball and cricket . if he try to play all the game and if he practice all the game for equal duration he will not be able to better utlize the skill he is having . where a if he concentrate more on a specific game he will be a champion of that game a he is more focused towards that game . finally a the being specialized in specific subject he will be more focused towards that specialization and he can better utilize his knowledge and skill for the implementation of the subject , he learned . because of these reason i think it is better to be specialized in specific subject .
