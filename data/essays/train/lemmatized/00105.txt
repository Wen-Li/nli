car is the most common transportation mean for million of people : a passion for some , a necessity for most . although today it doe n't seem possible to eliminate the use of car , many reason would lead to think that in the future this situation will change . as the world population grows , a the city get bigger and industrialization reach the underdeveloped country , the number of car increase constantly bringing the pollution rate , which is already unbearable in many area , to grow even more . for it 's being shown how pollution is related to mortal illness , serious action must be undertaken to bound this problem , and finding the way to reduce the number of car , at least a we know them , is a primary objective . of course major infrastructural and scientific improvement have to be pursued by governments , spending more money and effort into public transportation system and logistic research . moreover , the worldwide oil crisis ca n't be taken into account . oil availibility is shortening every year , and in 50 year oil extraction will cost too much to be considered a the most spread fuel source . as of today , something is moving in the energy research field , and hydrogen fueled car are on the agenda of many corporation . though i believe that conversion from oil to hydrogen is a really long task , since the lack of facility and infrastructure needed to complete such a big transformation . for the reason expressed above , it is really difficult to predict the future of modern transportation , but one thing seems clear : long term , tcars a we know them , will disappear and it 's not unlikely that this process will take place in the next decade .
