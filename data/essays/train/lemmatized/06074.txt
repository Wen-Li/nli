travel indeed play an important part in people live . by traveling , one can enjoy the peaceful nature or to experience the life of people in different country . some people would like to travel along or with friend while other perfer to have a tour . as far my concern , i think to have the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide , for it ha many advantage compared with no guide . first , if you are going to a place which ha some protential dangerous during the visit , you will definitatly need some help . for instance , mountain claimbing , it can be very dangerous when you walk on a unknown high mountain and without a people who fimilar with this area . a guide can certain garantee a safe and happy trip . also , a guide can provide you more detail about the place you visit which map ca n't tell you . i wa once visting a small town in sichuan , china . after walking pas all location on map , the guide told u there is an beautiful lake at the end of the road . when we finnally arrived there , every people including me were shocked by the unbelievable beautiful view there . i 'm sure that i 'll regret if we did n't ask for a guide at the trip . finnally , if you are going to visit a new country and want to experience the local culture by yourself , a tour guide in that place is inevitiblly needed . by his or her introduction , you can easily talk and even live with local people . addmitidly , travel with no guide can give you more free choice . but from that ha been discus above we can safely come to the conclution that to have a tour guide when you travel can provides a better tirp . because it is safe and can give you more happiness .
