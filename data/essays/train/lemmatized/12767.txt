i do n't agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there can be various type of travel . i think the best way to travel is to go around alone and to operate the travel schedule for oneself . first , we should choose travel whether to go alone or to e in group by it purpose of travel . when we research a policy , visit official agency and participate international exchange program or conference , to travel in a group is more effective . but , when we travel for refreshment and leisure , we had better travel alone . second , traveling in group by a tour guide prohibits from choosing the time and place to go . people in a group have a different preference to the time and place to visit and knowledge about history and background about the tour course . though a tour guide make schedule , it dose n't reflect everyone 's need and want . for example , when i have been to great britain in a group by a tour guide , i had very few time to visit british museum and much time to go about many park . though i want to have some more time in musium , i just could 2 part of the musium . finally , traveling in a group by a tour guide never can give the meaning of travel itself . i want to travel not only for visiting new place , but also for meeting myself and people living in other people . when traveling in a group , i have liitle time to see and meet myself and other people and have to follow fast my group and time schedule . so when i had a research trip in a group to japan , i asked to have free time for 3 hour and visited the university campus where my passed grandfather had graduated . it gave a chance to meet japanese people and myfamily and myself . travel alone give
