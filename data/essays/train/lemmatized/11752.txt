to answer a question a multi-facetted a the one given above , it is absolutely necessary to review and evalute pro a well a con argument ! one can say that a person who aquires a broad knowledge in many different field of academic subject is better able to understand certain development . why is that ? first , many development concern more than only one subject ! as an example only think about the process of globalization : this phenomeneon concern economics , industrial engineering , transportation a well a education , or politics . someone who focused only on one of the field could hardly manage to bring certain fact together and draw qualified conclusion . second , many field of study have stron interdependency meaning that one determant is influenced by different factor out of different academic branch . thirdly , the generalist ( a one can call the expert in many field ) is able to access a wider branch of tool out of different subject which enable him or her to be a more efficient problem solver . nevertheless there are obvious advantage of a specific knowledge a well : it is easier to totally understand a certain facet of a problem a one is able to focuse on that subject for a long time . this enables you to draw back to a variety of experience . picking up the example of the globalization process it is easier to explain only the economic aspect when you are an expert on that and have been able to collect deep experience in that field of study ! if you want to focus on the effect of globalization on poverty in third world country it is not necessary to be an expert on the development of transportation cost . .. having the pro and con argument presented in the above section in mind , i would say that it is more important to specialize in one subject than being a generalist . especially today in a world with a lot of research done it is necessary to specialize on a detailed field of study to bring up new knowledge . experts can deliver more detailed problem solving plan . in my opinion it is nevertheless possible not to loose the overview and to know the root your are coming from . the best alternative to do research on a multi-facetted problem is a team made up of member having their origin in different field . doing this it is possible to draw from both advantage a everybody ha his of her specific knowledge and contribute to a team uniting different quality . thank you for your attention !!
