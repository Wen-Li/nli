it is debatable whether young people these day do not give enough time to helping their community . some people think that young people nowadays do not have enough time to helping their community because they are usually considered to be selfish and not caring . however , i disagree with the idea that young people in the recent time do not sacrifice enough time for their community . first of all , young people these day are not actually a selfish a they are thought to be . they do care about their community and know exactly what they can do for them . for example , a one person of young people nowadays i have been participated to the charity . from the experience , i wa amased that lot of young people actully sacrfice their lot of time for community . they had been working for the poor and any people who need help at least once a week . secondly , we can see many article and issue around u everyday life about the young people giving their time to helping their community . according to the research on the korean chosun newpaper , it is more young people than others who sacrifice themselves in sudden accidental situation by 30 % . in summary , young people nowadays are willing to help their community in diverse way . they sometimes take long and regular time to help others , and sometimes give great sensibility to save people in danger . as there is also a saying that `` sound body , sound mind , '' it is natural for young people with sound body to have sound mind somehow more than other people .
