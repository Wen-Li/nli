it is predicted nowadays that in the next twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i do n't know if i would agree with this new saying , but i think there are some possible reason for this taking place . the major reason behind using fewer car is the amount of fuel that will vanish decrease bit by bit from the earth , a all the world ha so long struggled with . it is the main resource for the car to be working . the battery of the car might be replaced by another technological advancement that might be more complicated for people to use the car . in addition to car , there might be other mean of transportation easier to drive on the road or simply the structure and new model of car could be changed into very complex material . the component of the car will change starting from the engine , motor and everything inside the car , such a the seat and the hand brake . there could be the possibility of the appearance of car with wing that can fly and old people will face a problem because of the height that scare them a they move higher into the sky . this reason is not so possible , but it might happen . instead of fuel , scientist could explore other resource that are designated to work a car . however , this will surely bring difficult financial problem for people who are incapable of paying . the discovery of new resource might be very rare
