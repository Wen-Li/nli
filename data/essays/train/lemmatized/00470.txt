in general , a person with normal mental ability ca n't know a lot of subject with a deep knowledge of each one . it implies that a person must choice between a broad or a specific knowledge of the academic subject . in my point of view it 's better to have a huge knowledge of academic subject . infact the advantage followed by it 's are much more numerous than the disadvantage . in particoular : first of all a wide knowledge of the scholastic matter can help a person in all the aspect of the life that can include social relationship , political choiches , religious belief . if a knowledge is complete in his widely it become an useful istruments for doing right choiches in these critical event that occur to everyone along all the lifespan . the second reason is more pratical then the first and is about the opportunity that a huge knowledge can bring to a person in the research of an employee . infact an people who are in posse of vast notion have much more alternative for finding a job then people who have a specific knoledge . on the other side there are some disadvantage in having a broad knowledge . in particoular they are : it 's a common opinion that people who learned a vast number of generic notion `` know everything and know nothing at the same time '' . in other word the lack of specific notion can be seen a a total unknowledge . the second is that the future of a person with a broad knowledge is uncertain for several year .
