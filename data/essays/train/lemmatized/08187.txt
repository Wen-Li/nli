in today 's world , more and more people find success during their life , however , several cause could make the success of this person . it might be the abundance of money , the personal instincs or also , the fact that are constantly creating and trying new thing . because i am the kind of person who take a lot of risk , i strongly agree with the statement which said that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , in my opinion , success is depend on the capacity of inventing and creating new thing either material or immaterials thing . sometimes it is a brand new idea , another time it is a brand new item , and the other time , it is just a way to act . but in all this case , the thing that is created ha never ever been before . although it is not the only reason that lead people to success , it is one of the main point . in addition to the creativity of the person , several factor could entered in count . one other mean to sucess is the fact to taking much more risk than a common person . in fact , the person who want to try new thing and to improve the way he life ha a lot more chance to succeed than the person who just doe what she know exactly . a an example of that , i could speak about the difference between a machine and a human being that are doing the same movement all day long . the machine always doe the same act , and doe not try to figure out ohow it is possible to do it better , whereas the human being try to increase his ability to do this act . in this way , he try new thing and take risk to improve his way to act . he is more successful than the machine . for me , those characteristic are the main one that make me do agree with the statement written in the introduction . for instance , my godfather is one of the person who reflects completely the fact that success should be in accord to the risk and trying new thing . since at least a quarter of century , he work for an engineering company . he is in the creativitypool . he started a a common computer engineer , and now he his the head manager of a team of 45 people . he started just with his willingness , and among a lot more other quality , he started with his own idea . during his work , he talked about that with his collegue . those latter made him increase his level inside the society because the majority of his own idea were right , and efficient for the firm . that is why , they all agreed with him . now , he is on the way for the retirement , but , however , he is the proof that successful people had better to count on there own creativity instead of counting on the out factor , and also , doing all the time , the thing that they know how to do perfectly . no imajination is equal to boringness . creativity seems to say modernity , improvment , originallity . .. success despite the fact that there is a lot of cause to explain a successful person , a far a i am concerned , i strongly think that a person who is taking risk and trying new thing is more able to find sucess during his whole life than a person who jsut act a he is supposed to . finally , otherwise , success required taking risk .
