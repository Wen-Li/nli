i agree with this statement based on my experience of traveling . first of all if you contract a guide you can be sure that you are hiring an expert in what you are a complete ignorant and therefore he will do it , for sure , twice a good a you . to begin with a very good reason of choosing a guide we can say that it will be cheaper because he know the place and cost of the attraction and in case you want to see a show that is held in two different establishment at the same time he could recommend you the cheaper , furthermore the decrease in other expense like lodging , food , etc. will surely yield that the money you are wasting in your tourist guide will be le than the money you are saving . other important reason is that you wo n't get lost , for example , once when i visited barcelona i did n't want to get a guide because we only had a few hour to stay in the town , my surprise wa when we almost lost half of the time looking for a monument instead of taking advantage of the amazing harbor or other event there . the last advantage of having this person in a tourist group is that he know the city and he will warn you of certain dangerous zone of the city or disabled road , a personal reference of this reason ha happen to me a year ago when my family and i went for vacation in seattle , we were walking in downtown without a guide and admiring the amazing skyscraper of the city when suddenly we realized that it wa getting dark , and of course we did n't know that that zone inthe night is a little creepy ( of course , no map warns you about that ) and when we decided to go back to the car we were in the middle of hundred of welfare people begging for money , fortunately no disaster happened to u but it wa a lesson that i will never forget . my conclusion would be that a guide is best investment you can make in a tour
