time is a big problem nowadays . not only concerning the time we have to spend working every day to make our living but also the time we have to spend to serve social demand . what young people are taught in an average family today is much different from what they were taught fifty year ago and it doe definitely not lead to a person who is actively participating in social area such a community without being pushed by parent or career . spending time for social benefit instead of for personal interest is something that is very rarely seen . i think that it is right that young people of our time do spend very little time helping their community but i am of the opinion that one should not only blame the youth for their lack of interest but in fact look at the cause which are basic for this change . if you want to be respected and liked in our society you have to work hard for a good education in order to work in a profession which allows you to earn a lot of money . there is not much time left besides this . it is a question of moral standard that changed our attitude towards community work . when our parent were young there wa no question that the family went to church every sunday and that the mother and child helped at community feast and celebration . those parent showed their child that this community work is part of their daily life . nowadays however this is not the case in most of the family anymore . how are the child supposed to gain access to their community ? how are they supposed to value the benefit they get from such work if the parent do not show them anymore ? i found that the friend i made within my community are the one which remained over a long period of time , not all of them but still a noticable lot . i spend a lot of afternoon in the community ' room for kid when i wa about fourteen and i must say that i truly enjoyed helping to organize our yearly community feast . finally there are always exception to be made when it come to generalizing an opinion about a group of people - or even a whole generation - a in the discussed statement . not all young people are interested in helping their community but still there are some who are more than interested . therefore i find it difficult to agree to such a general statement eventhough there is definitely truth in blaming our generation for not being intersted in helping others without directely earning benefit fo oneself .
