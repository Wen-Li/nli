in my opinion , young people already do spend enough time helping their community . there are at least two kind of community they currently can be involved in , one is the parental community , consisting of the family member and the closer friend of the family , sometimes up to the whole village some people live in . the other community is the one where the family usually is not involved in , this can be the colleague from work , but also community found on the internet or by creating or simply appraising work of art . some young people nowadays tend to spend more time in the latter , thus leaving the first community behind with a kind of ungrateful feeling . this feeling is a remnant of former day , where people where forced to live together in order to survive and support themselves . nowadays these task that used to be distributed among all generation in a family can be transferred to public organ or private institution . this relief other part of the family off their burden , giving them more time to do and produce what they really like . even more , our modern society practically force people to leave home . people are required to be able to travel for work , or to move to different city in order to obtain a proper education . the possibility and the need to leave the community in which people grew up in of course weakens this link back home . these young people pay back their former duty to their family or community by different mean . some of them are tax , which in turn - at least in most of the european country - are put back into community project , or specific dwelling for retired people . another , equally important way , is to pay back their duty by creating work of art which can support the whole society . i think by giving the people a choice of what to do with their time is having the biggest impact on the society , and also community . the community profit indirectly from this freedom . i think the impact is a good one , the people who are criticizing this simply have to accomodate to the fact that the way of feedback are changing .
