i agree the best way to travel is in agroup led by a tour guide . last summer i went to itlay with a group and a tour guide , i liked my trip becuse i meet new people form diffrent place and shier same information . if i did not with the guide i would miss many place in italy . in the same time , i did not konw the history for the place i had visit . two year ago , i went to japan with my friend , most of the time we were lost because , we did not speake thier language and did not know thier transportion system . travel with the group and the tour guide is cheper than trave alone and you cane see more place in limited time . in addation , some trave agent have many tour so , you can select what you like . however , they have program during the trip to make the travel enjoy they trip . there is bad thing when travel with group , some pepol do not respect the others and make the traveler do not like the trip . but in genral i prefe travel with group and a tour guide .
