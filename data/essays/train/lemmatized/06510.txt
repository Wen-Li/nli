a company ha the possibility to make it product known through advertisement . commercials have proven to be efficient , even though we know that the different product available for the customer do n't have the same efficiency . but it is still a right to use advertisement . through this process you have to give a touch of your product in the best w possible way , and make the watcher beleive that it is the best product he or she could find . that 's why most advertisement make product seem much better than they reall are . however , over time the best product persist . therefore the company offering the best product will make better profit , and then have enough money to advertise and to perfectionate their product . though , even if a comercial will make the product seem better , we know for a fact that this company work well and so that the product are one of the best . in another hand , the need of the customer are not the same . so brand and product are subjectives . the one product that would be efficient for my personal opinion and request will not be a good for you . finally , the process of unreal advertisement is part of the economy system . if we would know before buying any product that the x product is the best for u , we would only buy one . but we spent a lot of money to find the great one . the advertisement system is also an economical question . advertisement company make a lot of money . in both way the economy work better . in conlusion , most comercials make product seem much better than they really are , but using advertisement is a right . the product in the advertisement may meet your need and criterion , but not mine . on top of that , the overall process is good for the economy of the world .
