in the past , the car had developed from a luxury skill to a usual material . now , there are a lot of car getting more modern . also , there are many car company and factory which build more car . now , there is a statement claiming that in twenty year there will be a fewer car in use than there are today . but i disagree with that . the car developed in more than a hundred year to an usual thing , from 1886 to now . and it 's still developing in this time ! many factory build more car to get more money , because everyone ha a car or more than one . for some people car are like friend and they them need them for a show-off . when people want to go to another place , they use their comfortable car to get there . so , the factory can not stop building more car in the next twenty year , because they want more money . because of the polluted enviroment more modern car are build which need liquid gas what doe n't pollute the air . so , this is another reason for the factory who can not stop building new car , because they have to design new one , too . i think , to have fewer car in use on the street we need more than twenty year , because in this time people still need their car either for a show-off or for comfortable moving . also , it took more than a hundred year to develope and when it will go back , it can not go faster , in my opinion . if the statement claim that in sixty or seventy year fewer car will be in use than today , not in twenty year , then i would agree to it .
