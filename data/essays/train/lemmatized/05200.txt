i completely disagree with the statement that state : `` successful poeple try new thing and take risk rathen then only doing what they already know how to do well '' , because the criterion to be successful person doesnt depend only in doing new thing that no one did before . in opinion , that doing ordinary thing is better for many reason . firstly it more safety , for example , trying to fix electrical equipment even if it very simple , will be dangaer if there no enough information how to fix it . second reason is saving money , for instance if you trying to take risk of something not ordinary such a throw yourself from high building to small swimming pool , may lead to break some of your bone and get ingured , if the risk did'nt be seccesful , so you will spend the money in vesiting hospital and doctor . other reason for holding is opinion , that is waste of time , so trying to do something thet you know it very well will reduce the time to trying do something no one did before . although some poeple argued that doing some thing new is criterial of successful person , for example , discovery of useful and good invention is successful , such a invention of light by adison . however , nobel invent the bomb , but i can not consider him a successful person because he invent awful thing in sum , in my view the successful person who do successful work , even if the work is well known .
