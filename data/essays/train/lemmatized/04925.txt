our parent used to tell u not to stick to only onething and try to experience and face everything in our life . at school studentd were taught different kind of language in order to try to communicate easily and diffrently . i agree that a person can be better at one knowledge rather than not succeding on alot of knowledge but on the other hand having broad knowledge mean communication , experience and opening to other culture being specialized in one specific subject ; will lead the person to a one way direction , lesser oppurtunities , narrow minded and it will really be difficult to communicate with other culture and different tradition . people and especially profetionals can tell easily wether a person is well acadimwkly or not which ofcourse give a huge honor for the person first , sometimes it becomes really hard at your country and you dont find the job that suit you . so if you are a person who studied more than subject you will defenitly understand how other bussiness run around the world . you will be able to find a job abroad second , each subject depending on where doe it come from ha it 's own way of thinking and aquires different tradition so it 's not only about a language it 's about turning your mind with many issue . you will be able to undeestand , communicate , realize the reason beyond each and every culture way of thinking and cause for there thinking that way . the person will eventually learn to comprimize and understand as a conclusion , sucsses come from experience which come from kknowledge . so a person must be aware of all issue around and build his mind by feeding in many subject
