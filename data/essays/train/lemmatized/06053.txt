the world ha changed drastically since the invention of car . they have made life a lot easier than it used to be . and even though their usage ha raised certain environmental concern , it is my belief that the number of car used by people will actually increase over the next twenty year . first of all , it is an established fact that the world population is increasing . more and more people are populating the earth , and many of those people will need to buy a car at a certain point in their life . for example , parent who have just had a new baby might in twenty year , or even sooner , make the decision to buy their son or daughter a car if they can afford it . in addition to that , the price of car are no longer a high a they used to be ; one can find car that fit almost anyone 's budget . payment facilitation also play an important role , so that you can buy a car now and pay for it in monthly installment at competitive interest rate . and let u not ignore the fact that there are people in the world that have a lot of money to spare and like to follow the latest trend . so they tend to buy the latest mercedes or bmw model , or even both ! to sum up , there are many factor that might lead to an increase in the number of car available for use by people . whether they are social factor having to do with the increasing number of people inhabiting this earth , or financial factor that have made it easier for midlle class citizen to buy their own car . but the question remains , what effect will that have on our environment ? that should be our main concern .
