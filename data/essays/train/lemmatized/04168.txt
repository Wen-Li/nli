aquiring knowledge is a continuous process in the human life , so it impartent for every body have knowledge through learning , i disagree with the author assertion that `` it is good to have a broad knowledge of many subject than to have special knowledge in a perticular subject '' , whybecause improving knowldge in the perticular area enable the indivisual to aquire complete grip on the subject and eventually make him to invent somthing in that specialization , there are two resons to support my opinion , one with out specizlist there is no kind of new discovery possible other the specialist have wide knowledge about the thier field so that they can solve many problem that occur in thier field . firstly , specialization is impartent to build a good society , student should choose specific subject of thier intrests , rather improving the knowledge in the vast field , this enable them to aquire a full grip on the field and they can invent new thing in that area , and form new theory which were impossible for a generalist to do . there are so many specialist become scientist , take for example einstine he is a civil student but his extreem intrest in the physic made him a great scientist of 20th century and to form theory of relativity , so improving the knowledge in a perticular area will help the person to achive greater height . secondly , if a problem come in perticular field , say in a factory which is manufacturing the wine and encounter a serious problem that wine taste ha got changed , the employes over there are generalist not specialist to solve the problem , at this time the requirement of specialist arises , he ha complete knowledge of the chemial component that are used to make wine and the amount of proportion to mix to get a perticular taste . he can solve the problem by giving a better solution otherwise it is bit difficult task for the generalist ( employee ) to solve it . finelly i can say that the people should aquire the knowledge in a perticular area , which help them and the society to have a better future with the invention and solution to the problem , eventhough generalist serve the purpous of integrating the task of specialist , however with out specialist generalist are like rat in a hole without having the knowledge how to to come out , so improving knowledge in perticular field is impartent rather than learning unneccessary subject that have no relation with the specialization .
