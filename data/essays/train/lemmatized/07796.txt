many people say that young people these day do n't give enough time to helping their community . i agree with this statement because modern society is a fast-paced world , capitalism 's basis is individualism , and that many people do n't live in one place for a long time . the first reason why i agree with the statement is because the world we live in today go really fast . every day is a busy one , with not many leisure time . young people are busy getting their education , and adult are busy working and earning money . this gradually lead to le noticing the community we live in , which decrease the help given by people . also , almost every country in the world is run by capitalism , and the basis for capitalism is individualism . individualim mean that each person care only about oneself , especially thing that are benefitial to him . helping the community may be benefitial in the future , but it is not an immediate one , so people tend to not care . the final reason is that people nowadays do n't stay in one place for a long time , so they do n't feel interested in the place they live in . in the past , when transportation wa n't very developed , a majority of people lived where they were born for most of their life time , so they love the society thay live in . they will be happy to help the community that they have known for so long . in contrast , it is very easy to move around in modern society , so people do n't feel the love for the community . there are many more reason that back up the fact that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community , but in my opinion , i think that these three are the main reason . if a community gave advantage to people who help the community more , everyone would be happy to make the community they live in a better place .
