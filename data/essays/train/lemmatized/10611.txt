there are certain consideration which everyone take into account to answer this issue . people may think about how useful is a car for themself , doe it make my life easier and if he or she can imagie to live without a car . the most of the people would more or le think that the value above are important to them . when someone asks his \ herserf the question : `` do you think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today ? '' the answer depends on a lot of factor such a his own experience he had with car in the past . after stating that everyones opinion can differ about this , i am confirmed that the amount of car which will be used in 20 year will increase . i guess it is a broad accepted agreement that car make life easier . they can take you to far away laying place in a pretty luxurey way . and the way of traveling must be convenient for the human . futhermore , you konw , it is a fact that the amount of car still become bigger . a lot of people ca n't imagine a life without a car , i ass that they depend on the existence of car . for exaple , today i came from stuttgart to heidelberg to take part at the toefl . and if i had n't taken the car , i would have spend lwice the time in a bus or on the train . ok i agree that this is a question of luxury . but do n't want to miss it . as an engineer i think that we are able to find a new method to get the car not a harmful a they still are , for nature and for our nature . you know i mean the smoke which is caused if you take a car . and if the gazoline or oil becomes le , i ge , we will find a solution . the last thing which came up into my mind is , that germany ha a great automotive comanies which are interested in selling car .
