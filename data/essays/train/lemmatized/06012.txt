i agree with the given statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . the possible reason for this kind of behaviour could be lack of concern for their community . young people are more enthusiastic and are more busy with their daily life . most of the time , a they argue , they do not have time for such activites . but this assumption is appears to be false . they can definitely devote time for this cause . it entirely depends on their disposition . by devoting even an hour for the improvement of the community they can help the community a lot . the younger generation think that the community is meant for adult and they are the one who should work for it . but they are mistaken . they do not know that how their help may be beneficial to others . the younger generation considers playing game , hanging out with friend and going to party more important than their participation in the activity of the community . they consider the community activity monotonous and mundane . they prefer , say , going to a movie or playing basketball over serving to community . they believe that they can have a lot more fun rather than being stuck up in working for the community . they do not realize how important it is to help their neighbour and all they people associated with the community . perhaps , a possible reason for their reluctance may be lack of knowledge of pro and con of having a community . adults , on the other hand , have more concern for their community . they know it importance more than the young people do . they are the one who can inspire the young people by telling them the importance of these community , their advantage and disadvantage . if every youngster devotes even an hour to serving the community , they can help a lot .
