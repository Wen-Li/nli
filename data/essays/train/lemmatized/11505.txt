while it is widely assumed that younger people enjoy life more than older people , i do not completly agree with this generic statement . my stand is based on following premise . it is true that young people have more energy and enthusiasm to enjoy life . the most common mean of enjoyment for most young people are partying , movie , adventure sport , etc . however , older people have experienced different aspect of life , and clearly understand what give them maximum satisfaction and enjoyment . with limited energy they usually tend to engage in those activity that excite them the most . the definition of enjoyment change with experience . while youngster may feel that older people can not go out for for sport or party and therefore are not enjoying , it is possible that older people enjoy the company of their family member than going out for party . also , many a time , what youngster define a enjoyment is usually what all people do for fun , and not what they themselves would like to do . therefore , in effect , they do what society classifies a fun , and not what make them happy a an individual . whereas , there are not many set avenue of enjoyment for old people , and hence they do what they themselves enjoy doing the most . while people are young , there is lot of uncertainity in their mind about their future . some youngster may have the resource to enjoy but they are constantly busy in working toward their ambitious goal . on the other hand , older people have their future clear in front of them . there are not many uncertainities in life , and hence they can spend their free time in enjoying life to the fullest . overall , i feel that people who have the maturity to understand what give them maximum enjoyment , have the required resource for enjoyment and most importantly know how to enjoy , are the one who enjoy life the most .
