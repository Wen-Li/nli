some people claim young people live a more valuable and interesting life than the older people do . the other people , however take the opposite point of view . in my opinion , i believe older people can enjoy life more than young people do . i shall set forth two major reason in support of this . firstly , older people normally know the meaning of life better than the youth . they have richer life experience and from which they have learnt what kind of thing are worth doing . in this way they are more likely to spend their time on the pursuit more valuable . by pursuing these precious goal , their life are full of meaning and have more fun than some young `` couch potato '' who do not know where they should go . for an instance , i used to live with an old lady for a while . she wa eighty year old , but she kept making baby clothes everyday for the child in orphanage . she considered it a considerably valuable , and thus she greatly enjoyed the way she lived her life . so older people gain more life experience through year and generally know deeper about the meaning of life , which brighten their life . secondly , young people are more likely to enjoy their life in more superficial way . it is easy to see that a lot of teenager indulge in video game and tv program which keep them from sophiscated thinking . they are easily attracted by superficial pleasure and the life they enjoy is le valuable than the life with deliberate consideration and long-term plan which older people normally make . in brief , older people can live a more meaningful life and thus enjoy life with higher quality than some young people do . therefore , from my point of view , older people can live a more joyful life than young people do .
