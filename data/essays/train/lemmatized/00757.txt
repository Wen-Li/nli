i do agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . its every person dream to become successful in life by doing some thing great for the society and mainting the same standard for long span of time . one had to risk his everything to create some thing new , which ha value and which is useful for the people in general . new thing would never discovered or come in to existence if the person like edison , ghram bell and nicolas tesla would have risk there all possesion for there new invention . thomas edison and nicolas tesla were already famous for there discovery in thier respective field like electric bulb , electrical printing press and a.c current generation and transportation of electrical current over the long distance . these thing have become essential for the human society and play great role in day to day life . but , never did edison or tesla left these thing there but worked over it to make it more successful . due to these great people thinking and risk we have new way of a.c current generation and transportation , the inducation motor which ha great impact at that time of era . due to there new discovery they are more sucessful then the fellow scientist of their time because they never gave up thing what they thought . though it take long time for people to understand the new technology and utilize it to it full potential but that doe n't mean that people should stop trying new thing and stop risking lot for new discovery . in today world technology development are at it higest level but there is yet new discovery had to be done , successful person like l.n.mittal who never gave up or stop risking his fortune for accuring new company . it wa his dream to become the single largest steel producer or the world he did it via risking it . i think that people should never stop risking thing to become more successful .
