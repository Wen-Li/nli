i am agree about most advertising try to show a the benefical and useful that it is , in some case the product is not useful but with a good advertising can change the produc and tranfor these in a necesary product . now the advitising ha the power to show to the customer whatever that the public want , know the most important is sell product , this is the priority , in some case you can see product and special in televison that you can said , what is that ? , is it useful ? somebody will be buy that ! , that is the advertising magic , this example coming to my mind , a cola drink for example , everybody enjoy of a cold cola drink , this kind of cola company had the best advertising in the market , it product 's the best , but with the same product can will be used like detergent , because the cola is so strong than can clean washroom , and then can be use like open a nut when is really hard to open . the advertisement only looking try to sell their product without import their product show that really are . anothe example about this topic is organic food , the organic food is more benefical than the normal food , i guess , the company made the same kind of food , but only the difference is the packet , for example in the natural organic food the price is almost the double than the regular natural food , but thaks to the advertising the same banana ha different taste , if you try a organic banana will be have the same taste than the regular banana . in conclusion , the advertisement only put their product more better only to influence in the price of the product or when the product doe n't have the enough especification
