in twenty year from now the world would have changed greatly a new technology is created everyday . as for car it is a difficult question to answer a it can be argued both way . so will car increase or decrease in number after twenyt year ? over the year more people are coming into this world and so the demand for car is becoming greater . more money is being made by everyone and poeple are getting richer each day and so i believe for these reason that car will increase in number but the energy used to operate car will be changed a natural resource are decreasing and will soon run out . as for the other side of the argument , yes the number of car will decrease a natural resource are running out so sooner or later the goverment must put a limit to the amount of car used . another problem is the amount of enviromental damage that is effecting our world greatly . cars pollute our world a lot and they are the main cause of temperature change . if the use of car continues in this amount we will soon start having more sickness and that is why car will soon be decreased in number . to conserve natural resource new source of energy will start being used soon a a new technology and these new resource will diffenetly be expensive and not all people will be able to afford them and that is why not all people will have a car in twenty year and that is why the number of car will decrease to a certain extent . in conclusion the reason for car to decrease in number are more than the reason for them to increase and so i believe that yes car will decrease in number in twenty year .
