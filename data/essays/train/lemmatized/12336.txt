over the last 2 to 3 decade , the number of car in all over the world ha been increasing rapidly due to development in it technology . howwever , in my opinion use of car would be decrease in twenty year , becauase of a probable shortage of petrol , introduce of tough provision for global warming and the possibility of invention of anothee type of behicles . the following essay explain to support my perspective in more detail . to begin with , the amount of gas and exhaustion emitted by car are crutial when it come to addressing reduction of global warming and air pollution . many government nowadays promote poeples use of pubic transportation for commuting . in near future , it is likely that several nation make policy and procedure for that promotion , the aim of which much be to decease people & s use of car . futhermore , petrol price ha been becoming higher and higher because of the shortage in the near future . therefore , it seems that people will have to begin thinking about another type of behicles , which do not use petrol . at the moment , several car canpanies have tried to create electric car , but still it is too pricy to target ordinaly people . remarkably , some of the company already started improving the technique to creat other type of reasonable behicles . in conclusion , i belive the technique and environmental concern about global wraming will be promoted by 2026 . use of car might shift to newly produced behicles . hence , this is predictable that the ues of car would decrease than we use at present .
