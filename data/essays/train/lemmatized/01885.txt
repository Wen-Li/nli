today , many technological advance are being made to reduce the pollution emitted by car . the gas from the muffler tip of automobile have caused a serious amount of air pollution , but nonetheless , i believe that car will maintain their number after 20 year . to start , techonology ha made car much more `` green '' , that is to say they are le harmful to the environment . green car will evetually replace the modern gasoline or diesel powered automobile , which will lead to cleaner air . as more and more efficient techonologies make their appearance under the hood of our car , we will all be driving a car that doe little or no harm . but , we are not going to get rid of our car . for example , in the u.s. it is pretty much impossible to live without a car . why ? it 's because due to the large amount of land , everything is spaced out nicely enough , but in unwalkable distance . next , when 2026 roll along , the advent of flying autombiles , jet-packs , etc will make it to the door of some people . in other word , those who can afford those high-tech gadget . jetpacks and flying car might reduce the number or car , but how many people will own such ? very little . the lucky few might fly around town , but the majority of u will be driving on route 95 on our new all-hybrid civic . so , technology will bring about a slight decline to the number of car , but still not enough for u to notice the difference during our everyday commute . however , this is n't to say that the number of car will stay the same or decline just a little . if technology keep on advancing at a rapid pace , i believe that we will have invented a new form of transportation that is far more efficient than the autombiles we drive today or the one we drive in 20 year . if this is the case , then the decline in the number of car is a thing that we all can look forward to . in summary , i would say that a lot of factor will contribute to the decline or incline in the number of car . the real situation that we will incounter is something we wo n't find out until it is at our doorstep . regardless of techonological improvement rate , i am sure that there will be at least a small decline in the number of automobile . if there is no decline , at least we are going to be able to live without worrying that the exhaust from our car is going to create a hole in the ozone layer .
