since student start learning thing in the school , they have the responsbeality to learn everything they should know ; therefore , student are suppose to understand idea and concept more than just knowing the facy . there are some reason why i think student should know idea and concept but not just the fact . first of all , student that understanding idea and concept can learn better and easily get interesting in that subject . for example , once studnets understand the idea of how math work , they can do the math easier and faster than others who do n't understand the idea . also , if student know what the concept is in a history event , they can easily get interested in it and even want to know more about it . they can actually learn much better than student who do not know what the concept is . secondly , i do n't believe student would learn well if they just learn the fact . for instance , many subject like history , geoeraphey and even science need student to understand their idea and concept . if student do not learn the idea and concept they will not be able to good mark on the subject . further more , if student do not learn the subjexts well , they can easily fail the course and lost their interest to them either in the history , math , science , and even english calsses . based on the two reason that i mentioned above , i suggest that understanding idea and concept doe lot more important than only know the fact and it doe not matter in any of the subject .
