from the beginning of industrial revolution , producer always wanted to sell their product more and a the time passed they saw that one of the best way of doing this is advertising their product . although , the goal of advertising should be demostrating the feature a particular product , seller use advertisement to increase their sale by exaggerating it and make people want that particular product . therefore , i strongly believe that advertisement make product or service seem better than they really are . making people desire a product is a complicated issue but what advertiser realised about this is that the customer do not have to know what the product exactly is . many people may be wrong about what they are buying because of advertisement or they may have a very little idea about what they liked to buy because of advertisement . as an example of this , the advertisement of big company can be given . in that type of advertisement , vey little information about the product is given whereas , the focus of the advertisement is mainly the trademark itself . although , people do not understand anything about what the product is or for what purpose they can use it , because of the effectiveness of the advertisement , the customer may chose to buy the product . another point to note is that the advertisement of certain product such a tobacco , alcohol or , say , fast food make these product seem not only a little better than what they really are . it is a well-known and proved fact that all these product may be tremendeausly harmful for human ( in excessive use ) in long term however by the help of advertisement , these product succeed to seem well to customer . the use of famous character in advertisement is also another way of producer to make their product seem well to the customer . this way is also a short-cut for producer because it help them to convience people about the goodness of their product . as to prove my idea , consider the advertisement in which the character are well remembered and the message is forgotten . this is only a small trick that advertiser use to persuade people about a non-existing state-of-the-art product . consequently , i am a strong fan of supervision on advertisement . this should not be understood a sensorship on free speech but the advertisement should be prepared in a way that people are not misleaded about the goodness of the product . by this supervision , i will be able to change my idea about advertisement because right know i believe that advertisement channel people toward product in unfair way .
