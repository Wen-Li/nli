for the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , in the question i strongly agree the statement . i agree this because of some many reason . firstly a success can not be done with out taking risk and there is a proverb `` no pains no gains '' . i agree , successful people try new thing and take risk , because there is no communication between the people who were far if graham bell not invented the telephone . the reason is basically graham bell is a engineer in electrical and have some knowledge of electromagnetic wave . graham bell worked a lot and took risk for inventing this telephone apart from is electrical knowledge . the second reason i agree this statement is because computer is invented my charles babbage who is succesful person . for inventing this computer charles took so many risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . charles babbage firstly invented a big computer called super computer . it occupies very large area and requires a lot of electrical power . but after working hard and taking so many risk he invented a small computer called personal computer , which we are using daily . this computer occupies le area and requires le amout of electrical power . this show that always a successful person work for new thing taking risk . finally agree , this statement from own experience . when i wa in tenth standard my mathematics teacher given me a problem which is easy to solve and i solved it . in the next hour he given me a difficult problem which is based on previous problem . he asked me do on the board and i solved it . but when teacher asked my classmate to do same problem on the board . he is not able to do on the board because he copied first problem from me . in conclusion , considering above example i strongly state that succesful people try new thing and take risk
