no , i will not agree with this statement that , `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . because , if we observefrom last twenty year the car usage ha been increased rapidly . why it ha been increased iwill explain in the below paragraph . if a person who is working a an software engineer he ca n't wait at bus-stops for bus and railway-stations for train . because he ha to spend much more time on that . so if he ha a car he can save much more time . this is the main reason for increse of car . the usage of car lead to more advantage than disadvantage . while the `` call center '' people have to travel from home to office at late mid night . so if a car is there it will be well safe than a bike or any other vehicle . in the coming year also the usage of car will double or may be triple the time what we have now . because this is the fast moving world . to lead a better life in this fast moving world a good car is needed to move whereever we want to go . we all know that if the usage of car have been increased it seems that their country or state is developing . i say that car user will increase in country where there are few car now . but the growth will decrese in some developed country like newyork , london , australia etc . .. there they will use chartad flight which are now very fewer there . the advantage while using car are that we save much more time while by spending for train and bus . we can save tht time and spend that with family , friend or in the office . it lead to lot of convinience by using car . i will conclude that by the above reason the car user will increase by the next twenty year in this fast moving world .
