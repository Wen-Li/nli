in my opinion successful people try new thing and take risk rather than simply doing work on thing that they already known . in my opinion a successful person is a one who never stop working and who ha a eager to discover new thing not just by stoping after some successful work because he know the importants of success . a person is successful when he set the goal and work for them to achieve . once if he set the goal , he get organised . by talking about his gaol with some other people whom he know he may get help like suggestion and assurance from them . in this way he achievs his goal by puting a lot of hard work in it . after achiving a goal he automaticaly shift to new thing in order to continue his success . i mean they are ready to take risk on there further work . by doing like this they can get grip on there goal or subject on which they are working . this also make him to get prestage in socity , he might become popular on his work . he might get money in the form of reward and award . successful people never forgets the step they were followed . this make them to stragule in new thing and make them to risk . if they work on what they already known instead of taking risk and trying for new thing , they become unpopular and they forget about goal and hard work , this make them lazy . because of this fear they always work and take risk .
