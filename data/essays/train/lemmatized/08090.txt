i agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide for several reason such a , to discover new place , to feel safe and get good price . first , in any where or place need to be with someone who know the place where you want to go because he can take you to place a you wish . for exaple , last summer i went to japan by myself . so , at that ti me there wa a friend who know me . after ward , he took me to many beautiful place in tokyo . so if i wa alone i would n't feel enjoy . that person wa really a good tour guide . second , in any country even in usa which is one of the safest country around the world , you will feel unsafe if there is no person can tell me which place should i go or not , which time should you go outside or not to go . meanwhile when you have a tour guide , that mean you are safer especially if he from the area which you will go that will be better . a a result , he is going to be your securty because the people will know that you have a citizen who work a a guide . last point , is getting good price and that is true . for instance , in africa specifically in egypt , if you have a taxi 's friend , that mean you are strong person . morever , nobody will sell you by high price or take much money from you without doudt . other way if you are alone there almost all the theifs and seller will take money from you without anyright . in conclusion , if you do n't want to think a lot and you want have fun , to feel safety and to be smart by the dealing with the people , just travel with a tour guide .
