that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well is a quite intersing question , in fact it is related to intrinsic human attitude . all the human want to be successful people , but really it is always necessary to innovate thing of to risk the life or something to have success in life ? why i can not be simple myself doing the thing that i know to do , ever in the same way , and become a successful people a well ? probably some example could help u in aswering to this question . in human history there are many example of people who become successful only because they tried new thing and took risk . think about cristoforo colombo , he wa the first sailor to have the idea to go to india by the sea insted that by land . he decided to try a new thing and he become very successful , in fact he discovered america . naturally he take a lot of risk for his own life in doing that . in the very recent history we have the example of bill gates who become a successful people , the richest man of the world , doing something that no man have never do before . he invents computer and he invested all his life and all the money that he had at that time in founding his company , microsoft . so he decided to take the economical risk . however we have also to consider that not alla the people who try new thing and take risk are successful people , in fact in choosing this way it is common to fail . for example many people died in the tentative of beeing the first man who fly from america to europe . in my opinion , a the above exemples show , you can not be a successful people just doing what you already know how to do well , without taking any risk . in this way you probably can become a respectable worker or perhaps an affidable person , by i think this is not the definition of `` successful people '' in which most people are interest .
