i agree with that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . many company need to sell their product a many a they could . this is the main goal for each of the company . in order to be successed , they need to make people to know about the product . one of the way to let peple find out about product is the advertisments . some time , people do not like the advertisments because they make product seem way much better than they really are . and i think , it is true that many of company make the advertisment a little bit different than the real product . the company need to catch people 's attention toward their product , so they have to make the advertisement of thier product really good . if people try a new product becasue of excellent advertisement and the product is really good a the advertisement that they saw ; it is good for both of them . however , the producer should not make the low quality of product and spread non-sensed of the advertisement to just make people get interested and buy the product . also the reason why the company are making the advertisement that make product seem much better than they really are is because they have confidence and pride of their product . the company are really willing to people to buy thier product . moreover , it is kind of the competetion between company and another . usually people are noticed about new product by the advertisement , so the company which make better advertisement , the chance of selling more product is higher than others . to conclude , some time many of company make unrealistic advertisement , but it is the right way to run a bussiness . in order to survive in the tough society , they can only make the advertisement extremely good .
