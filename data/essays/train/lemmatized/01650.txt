most of people like travel all over the word and every one have his personatly which different from othres . they have to think how they will sped time and make plan for that . i disagree to travel in a group led by a tour guide because maybe he ha different intersting and ther is no time for rest . first , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not always good because i have my oppinone about which place i prefer to visit our to spend long time in one place . for example , five yea ago i went with group tour from germany to franc but i did not find any time to visit my feavoert place because i have to follow the leader in addition we have big different in age . so i will not did travel with a group leader . second , there is a spicfice time for u to visit many place and i have to follow the guider and lisson to him so you can not rest if you like this or that place because he ha plane for the trip . while travel in a group led by a tour guide good to see many thing in short time and with a person who ha knowldge but it nice to do what you want with out any bother . in conclusion , evey preson ha a different intersing thing to spend and have a good time when he travel . i disagree with travel in a group led one guide because , i have my intersting and i travel to spend a lot of my time in rest and relax not for follow a guide maybe he is deffrent form me .
