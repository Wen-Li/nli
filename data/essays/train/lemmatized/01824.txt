yes , i agree from the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . there is a saying that `` practise make man perfect '' . practise is donbe mainly by understanding the idea and the concept . by learning fact we will just know about the fact . but by clearly undersatnding the main idea and the concept of that fact we will remember it for a longer time so that whenever we will come upon the fact we can clearly answer that question . but by listening the fact we may foreget the fact . students are the people who will make the world . '' todays student are tomorrow future '' . in simple language we can clearly explain it by theory and practical . by theory we just get the information about a fact or about some information . but by doing the practical we get a clear view of that information . by doing reseach on that fact or by getting information on that fact by different source we can clearly grab the information into our mind . by clearly undersatnding the idea about the concept we get the full knowledge about that fact and we can easily explain that information top othe people also . by practising or by doing any research on that fact give u a lot of information on that fact . by doing that research we not only gain information not only on that fact but we will gain knowledge about some of the interesting thing related to that fact . understanding the idea will remain in the mind . it 's not that learning will not be in the mind but understanding the idea give both practical and theoratical knowledge . thus understanding the idea and concept is more important for the student rather than learning .
