because i have only been young so far , i am convinced that young people seem to enjoy life in more depth that the adult or the grandparent do . i believe that when we are child or even teenager , we have the chance to discover all the pleasure of the life and not have enough distance or experience to find reason to not enjoy every minute of our life . first of all , learning by discovering brings u so much pleasure that it is hard not to be excited about . for instance , when i think about my youth or the image i have from young people , i always see smile and imagine laugh on childrens face . secondly , when i look and hear about older people experience , i rarely observe so much good mood and pride to live . i more often see some sadness . this situation may be due because of today society that tend to make thing become more and more complex . in this kind of chaos , older people often go too far to get some pleasure . older people tend to think too much rather than just living the moment and finding a way to enjoy . furthermore , when we compare an adult who always find something to complain about his work , his family or his social status , to some younger people who are not aware of those problematics , even if it by ignorance that they seem to enjoy more , they still show it . moreover , and in order to fulfill part of my conception of enjoying , i strongly believe that young people , because they want to learn , take more risk that their older generation . taking a risk is in one a way , the proof that we are enjoying the situation and that we do not try to find difficulty or reason not to enjoy where they do not even exist . globally , even if child enjoy differently their life since they can not have the ability to fully think about what enjoying really mean , they just enjoy by making life a easy a it just is .
