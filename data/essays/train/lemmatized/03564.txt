opting for general academic knowledge instead of a more specific one is a defining choice . it will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the student 's future professional career . while broad knowledge is often prefered , i personally think that focusing on specific topic is more relevant . indeed , i am convinced that it is essential in order to become competent in a field . moreover , a freshly graduate student with very specific skill is more likely to match an employer expectation . nevertheless , in the particular case of management , broader knowledge is still preferable . first and foremost , going deep into a subject allows student to master perfectly a field , while surfacing it result in the end in useless skill . by tackling everything , we finally stop working on a subject when it is getting interesting . for instance , in high school , we discover many thing : just enough to have a vague understanding of how thing work . i would have loved to go further on biology , physic . .. but we lacked time . in order to go further on a subject , making a choice is needed . then , i think that a student who is specialized will better fit a company need than if he had general background academic knowledge . indeed , in the modern industry , what is needed is very focused people , working on tiny task . the gathering of those tiny task , with each of them perfectly performed , make the final result great . for instance , a friend of mine wa specialized in micro frequence wave length , or close . he had no difficulty to be hired for a top level position in a military company because his profile wa very rare . finally , i would underline the fact that there is one field where broad competence are better : management . as a matter of fact , what a manager is asked for is not doing thing well . he is expected to be able to make his team deliver a great job . so he should understand the task of each of his teammate in order to manage them properly . the higher his position , the broader his skill . for instance it would be a non sense to ask a ceo in a pharmaceutical company to having very deep knowledge of drug composition . to conclude , i would say that having a specific approach is a winning solution for any student . then , if he is to reach managerial position , he will have the opportunity to get an mba in order to learn broader thing for instance . | more competent : surfacing topic v having an in6deep knozledge . zith broad learning : stop zhen it start getting interesting . specialized : today co ; panies , research specific knowledge for efficiency the exception : management . need to be able to anyone and understand
