some people may think specializing in one specific subject is better . however , personally , i believe it is better to have borad knowledge of many academic subject . there are two reason for this . the primary reason is that the new area of academic subject have been created often by combining some subject . for example , portfolio magement theory which won novel prize wa created by combination of mathmatics/statistics and economics . if the resercher who won the prize wa engaged only in traditional economics , it wa impossible for him to develope this epochmaking theory . in general , the evolution of the area of finance theory ha been depending on the combination of math , statistic , economics , phycology , and a lot of other subject . this is quite good thing . another reason is that it is good for the future convenient of both student and proffessors to have broad knowledge . in other word , broad knowledge increase the probability that they can turn their academic area into good direction . for instance , one of my proffessors in university who ha been an expert of computer science deveoped his career in new area , the law of patent . while he ha studied computer science , he ha become aware that the new technology can not alway be money . the obstacle for him wa the law of patent . after being an expert of the law of patent , he is respected a an expert who can understand technology and the law related to patent . considering with all of the above factor , i would like to claim that we should aquire borad knowledge of many academic subject rather than specialize in just one specific subject . by aquiring broad knowledge of many academic subject , we can increase the probability to create new academic area and to develope our career flexibly .
