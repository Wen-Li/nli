today we all live in a world full of advertisement . it is enough to walk in a street of a big city to see how many advetisements are hanged on the wall . i agree with people who say that most advertisement make product appear much better than they raelly are for some reason . first it happen very often to buy a product only because you have read it advertisement and notice that the product 's quality shown in the advertisement do not really match with the quality that the product actually ha . i think that it is an experience common to everyone . in addiction it is well known to everyone that the true aim of an adevertisement is to persuade the custumer to buy the probuct . the batter way to pursue this aim is to convice the custumer that if he or she will buy the product he or she will certainly enjoy the extraordinary feature that the product ha . the point of the question is that it doe not metter if the product actually ha these feature or not . as a consequence of this tendency we can see that a bussines is grown around the ability of producing convincing and persuadign advetisement . in fact today there are a lot a company that employ a consistent number of workes and pay these worker to develop advertisement . according to these company a good adverisement is able to convice a custumer to buy a specific product even if the product itsefl doen not worth to be bought . i think that it is a strong suppurting topic for people like me beliving that advertisement make product seem better then they actually are . in conclusion i belive that this way of behave concernig product advertisement is not a honest behaviour but , on the other hand , i really convinced that this beahviour is the normal result of our society , a society based more on the apparences then on the truth .
