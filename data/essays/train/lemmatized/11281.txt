the question i want to discus about is whether young people enjoy life more than older people . this question play a not unimportant role , since the average age of especially western community chang dramatically and today 's young people are more and more drawn into the corner of a fun - generation . but what is meant by enjoying live ? people of different age group have different definition of enyoing life . young people are constantly facing more problem about their personal future especially concerning money . since a lot of young people ca n't be no longer sure to have a secure working place , many young people try to push this problem aside , by covering the left spot with activity that might distract their view off the actual problem they have . so they often lose the focus on how to solve their problem by positioning themselves in a world , where everything is about fun and joy . at first , this might work , until the person realizes , that fun and joy can not happen without money . at this point young people can go in two different direction . the first group may focus back and concentrate how to get back on track while the other group might be trapped in a vicious cyrcle of wanting to enjoy one 's life , but having no money to do so and also not beeing able to get any money the legal way . older people on the other hand are more experienced and since almost everybody of them , especially here in germany , is affected by world war ii , they value the thing they pose more than a person who ha not gone through anything comparable . but if an older person can enjoy life or not , depends on his or her possibility to do so . illness or death of one 's partner might easyly avoid to enjoy life . but even if you are healthy and have a working partnership , you still need money to fulfill your dream and to enjoy life for instance by travelling different place in the world , buy your favourite tv , etc . .. and that is the point where the argument about young people and old people come together . i think , that you ca n't finally say that young people enjoy life more than older people . to enjoy life you need to create a basis which allows you do develop your personality and your self-actualization and this doe not depend on whether you are old or young .
