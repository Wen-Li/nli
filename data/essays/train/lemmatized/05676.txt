why is it a problem ? . there will be fewer car in use in twenty year and i think that it would be a great advantage . this fact woul be fantastic for the world environment . the lack of car implies that the pollution decrease . and it will suppose the appearing of new vehicle and people will have to get the public transport or another way of moving . riding would be a good sustitute in order to this situation . the problem is that new transport will appear too and not all people will be able to buy it because of it price . only the people who have money will get the ` future transport ' or may be that the really ` future transport ' will be the bycicle . .. nobody know this yet . on the one hand , we have all these point but on the other hand it implies that many people who work in fact making car or people who sell them , people that deal with car will have problem . may be they lose their job or something like that and it would be a really great problem . if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today people will walk more and make more sport which help their body to be fine . as advantage we wo n't see so many traffic problem in the future , i hope , and the accident will decrease too . in conclusion , i think that it will suppose a lot of change in our life . it
