i fully agree with the following statement : ' young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping theor communites . ' it is hard to fing a youth who enjoys and is willing to help other people . i , a a teenager , admit that helping others is not my priority . one of the main reason why i believe young people do not spend much time helping other is the lack of free time . as an student of the international baccalaurite ( ib ) program i spend a great amount of time studying and preparing for the exam in may . according to the school , we should do atleast 3 hour of homework every night . i come back from school at four thirty , then go to the gym for around one hour and then do my homework . by the time i finish it , it is already 8 or 9 o'clock . this doe n't leave me much time to do activity to help my community . furthermore , the little time i have free i want to spend it on thing i enjoy doing the most such a meeting my friend . another reason why i think youth do not give much time to helping their community is because of the increasing competition in the world . out parent want the best for u i.e they want u to be successful . this desire of wanting to be better than our peer ha made u more selfish and therefore reduce our willingness of helping others . for example , for a professional sportsman to become the best one in world , he need to practice a lot . these training setions take time ; therefore he will have le time to help the community . in addition , psychologically , he will only be focusing on him getting better and dismissing other thing such u helping the others . competition also lead to another reason for my opinion ; the lack of even getting involved in program for helping the community . because some of u are sometimes brought up in way that everything involves around competition we do n't even try to help others ; we do n't know what it is about . the ib requires the student to complete 150 hour of what is known a cas ( creativity , action and service . ) this part of the programme encouraged me to get involved in acitivities such a collecting clothes and food for refugee , helping teacher plan activity and organise family day . i have to admit that i really enjoyed them and the feeling of satisfaction after helping other is amazing . so , because of the lack of experience , i assumed that helping others would be borring and not worth ; however , i realized it wa the opposite . in conclusion , i believe that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because they do n't want to or sometimes is n't even their fault . programs such a the ib ha noticed this weakness in the current teenager and is trying to recover their interest in helping others . i think that parent and teacher should also emphazise the importance of these and the benefit we get for doing it .
