in my opinion successful people try new thing and take risk also . in the whole world every one want to try new thing and some people only take risk . so in that risk some one will succeced and some one will not succeced . some people will try for new thing . in that case the people who had already done research in that one some people take that one and also study in that also . why mean they want to try for the new thing . some people have the idea to try some thing and they will do also but they do n't know how to keep that in a well manner . in our world many scientist discover many thing . for example `` charles babbage '' invented computer . so this computer is playing an important role in every human life . so the whole world is using this computer . many scients invented many thing like lights , printing machine and etc . . , . so the scientist are the successful people . why because they had tried for new thing . so in my opinion every one ha to try for new thing . so that we can gain more knowledge . but every one ca n't efford for the new thing . why mean for new thing to discover lot of money must be needed . so all will not have so much money . for this reason the student or who ever want to try for new thing can come forward and they should ask the government to provide some thing . the government should come forward and they must encourage the student . so if they tried for good thing the country will get a good reputation . finally those who are talented they must come forward and they have to use the resource what they had . so that he wil be in a good position . i agree with this statement . successful people must try for new thing and they must also take risk . in thse day with out risk nothing can be done .
