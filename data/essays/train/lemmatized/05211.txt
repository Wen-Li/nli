i think that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . actually people are studying broad knowledge of many academic subject . however , if people study many thing in a same time , there can be many problem after all in a future . first , if people study broad knowledge , they can not know about their subject in detail . since there are so much amount of knowledge that people have to study , they can confuse the content of the subject . for example , when they get some question from some student or the other people , they can make a mistake by teaching something wrong because of the confusion about it . second , the meaning of expert can disappear . if most people know wide knowledge of many field , they are not an expert in a certain field . since they do not specialize in just one thing . so , i can imagine one situation that if someone ha a question about biology , the person can have a problem because there is no biology expert , he or she can not decide where he or she should go , and can not know who is the person that is specialize in a biology . . third , the meaning of major in university or college can disappear . major is a subject that people choose to specialize in , by the way if people study broad knowledge , it is easy to disappear the meaning of major to student an even the other people . so , in the future , if company want to hire some employee , they can be in a panic or confusion to search the person who is just good at their company . therefore , i think that people should concentrate on just one subject , so i want them to become great people who affect to the specific field and make wonderful output from their study .
