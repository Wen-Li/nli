not only korean tourist but also other asian tourist are notorious for very noisy group tour . in fact , many friend of mine have their summer trip in a group led by a tour guide . however , i think the real value of tour can be achieved by individual tour planning . first of all , a tour with personal planning give a lot of lesson . i think a single trip is similar to a path of one 's life . when i wa a college student , i used to make a plan by myself . of course , it wa very tough for beginning . however , a time went by , i got more used to get useful information and well-designed planning . during survey of tour , i met many adviser from various field . it also helped me to enhance my interpersonal skill . i still keep in touch with some of those people . as the old saying go , people live and learn . secondly , individual trip can be more flexible . sometimes i see people who suffered from their tour with a tour guide . that is because they had to follow the group 's schedule rather than their own preference . on the contrary , in my own trip , i could explore more various site freely whenever i feel i need to spend more time in a specific place . when i had a two week backpack tour in europe , i stayed rome for a week . considering the overall trip period , it wa significantly long period . if i had to follow a group tour 's rule , it would n't be possible . in conclusion , i do n't think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . i think it ha more shortcoming than gain . for me , i prefer a individual tour with own planning to a boring group tour with typical routine .
