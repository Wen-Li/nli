consdering how rapidly the technology is advancing , i believe that the use of car will be greatly reduced twenty year from now . at every passing moment , scientist are coming up with new idea to make people 's life easier . currently , one of the challenge that await them is the ease of transportation . for longer distance , the plane are highly efficient mean of transportation , but for shorter distance , we are bound to use car or similar vehicle like bus . there are already step taken towards this issue . the `` ginger '' , also known a segway , wa invented for people to travel short distance quicker and without hassle . i am confident that better variation of it will be created in twenty year ' time . these may include flying vehicle , which can be easily navigated even through street . at first , they may not be appealing either due to their price or due to non-familiarity , but after a period of adaptation , they would be more commonly used and eventually they would replace car . this is exactly what happened to horse-ridden vehicle when the first car wa introduced at the beginning of the twentieth century . moreover , there is an increasing concern for air pollution generated by the excessive use of car . people are getting more inclined to use alternative method of transportation like bicycle . it is true that some people are not aware the impact of the pollution generated by car . however , they are , too , getting reluctant to drive a car since the oil price are increasing rapidly , whereas the oil source are depleting rapidly . the traditional car will be of no use when there will be no fuel left to run it from twenty to thirty year from now . there will be vehicle running with alternative energy source , but i believe that they will not be considered a car in the traditional sense . when all of these different factor are brought together , i can say that people will willingly give up using car one way or the other , reducing the number of car that are in use in twenty year ' time .
