i disagree with this statement because without learning the fact it can get you nowhere . ofcourse , some people think that without fact it wo n't take too long to find out , but what if they did n't know if they were right . to put it this way , say that you want to learn something in biology in plant , animal , fish , reptile , insect and mammels . to know how to learn thing the way they were taught in the book , you can read through the main fact and detail that wa given to you . if you want to know something or investigate you need the fact about each topic that you were given in your biology book . if you know it and got the idea then that would be no problem . also , another way of getting fact is by finding out what happened , example who killed someone or who is the one responsible for commiting a crime . to find out , you need to ask yourselves : `` how did he or she died and who killed them ? '' the question will be answered if you gave in every information you have gathered when you want to prepare if this person did or did not kill these people . either if this person is guilty or not guilty . life is not easy on how it sound when it is important for student understanding idea and concept but a faculty is the way that show what can be featured and how can you explain it . given through what the topic is about , to me , i think it 's a good way to have fact better than to ignore them . it help me learn alot when they were given to me and preparing to answer that i choose this because it is best to find out more than hesitating to answer it .
