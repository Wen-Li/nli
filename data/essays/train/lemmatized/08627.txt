now i want to discus the theory that young people enjoy their life more than older people do . first of all i want to define the expression `` enjoying one 's life '' . all people have got different interest and hobby . all people have other need to be happy . so it differs from person to person , whether he or she is happy with a certain situation or not . i want to give an example . jimmy and kelly are on a lonely island and there is nothing else than a football . jimmy might enjoy his life because he would have nothing else to do than to improve his soccer skill . but kelly on the other hand would be bored and wished to get home a soon a possible . so one and the same situation doe n't create the same mood within different people . once a boy 's need are fulfilled it doe n't mean that a girl would be happy a well . it depends on what each person like to do . of course younger people have the opportunity to go swimming or to go to disco on weekend . but maybe - when they are old - they do n't want to go to disco anymore . they might be satisfied by just lying on the couch and watching tv . this might sound a little bit ridiculous , but i think older people have been working for so many year that they are glad if they are able to relax and just lay down for a while . in contrast to that any young person would say that this kind of life is boring . there we see the difference between the need a pupil ha and the need a grandmother ha . so we ca n't say that young people enjoy life more than older people do in general . everyone ha to decide on his or her own what he or she would like to do and in addition to that ha to take into consideration that he or she might not be able to do so . so enjoying one 's life doe n't only depend on one 's age but also on one 's circumstance .
