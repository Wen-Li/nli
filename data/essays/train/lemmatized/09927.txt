times change quickly . .. very quickly indeed . a few year ago , the computer were reserved for the army , internet wa unknown . one may ask , ` what is the point of having a broad knowledge if it will soon become outdated and useless ? is n't it better to specialize in one subject and try to keep in touch with it evolution ?
