in the last hundred year the world community are changing a lot . the behavior of the younger people is caused by these changings and i think there are helping much more than the most elder people belief . first of all we think about the value the younger people are judged with beeing le usefull than other generation . the most importent argument for a wide range of people is the behavior in face of the family . families changed a lot , especialy in the western part of the world . in past time every generation of the family wa living at one place , for poorer people could be not even a place maybe it wa a room . there were not any social system to help them . there for the family member cared for each other much more than the state could do . nowertimes the question of caring for each other is conected with the society a stongly a it is conected to family . the number of the family member dimishes strongly . there are today le young people and more old people than in earlier time , because of medical invention . in germany for example the pension system is working between generation . the working people are paying the pension for the older people . the problem of pension in future is based on the demogafic relation of young and old part of the society . the younger people mabe do not care for there parent themselfs , mayne they pay other people , who care for them . but acctually they pay a lot for the pension of people they not even know . additionally young people in germany are helping their community much more than another generation ha ever done , becaus they are paying a system that will not benefit themself , so they have to care for their own future a well . finally youngre people are le secure in the development of the society a the older generation are and that for there have to care for themself and other people too . maybe that is the reason , why some people think nowerdays young people are not helping their community , but they do it a much a they can .
