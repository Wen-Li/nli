the starting statement tell about the possibility that in the future could be le car then today . this point is very difficult to explain because i think that everything depends to the technology developement of today . since ten year ago a lot of university department have tried to create a new type of car that us a different king of oil . the reason is that in this moment the amount of oil is critical and there is the possibility that on the next year it will be impossible to supply the oil quantity that customer will need . but until now it is not appeared a different kind of car that us alternative fuel . only a strange electric car that us electric battery to start motor . for this reason , i think that if the company which product car or the university department of technology resource do n't look for other solution , it will be possible that in twenty year there will be fewer car than today .
