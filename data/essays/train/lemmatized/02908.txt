young people enjoy life more than older people do . based on my personal experience i would have to agree with this statement . eventhough i am not that old , i am old enough to agree with the statement mentioned in the former paragraph . for instance , when i wa younger i use to worry le about everything . as people get older , they get more responsabilities . they get to know more people , in most case they get their own family when they get merry , and with family usually come a lot of resposabilities and worryness . the younger the person is , the more the person enjoys life . for example , let 's talk about a baby . a baby doe not have to worry almost about anything , he or she just have to worry about meal ang get change ; other than that a baby is just eating and sleeping . a baby doe not even have the maturity to know is something is wrong on his surroundings . now , let talk about a 6 to 10 year old person . people on this age , in most case only have to worry about homework . teenagers , will have to worry about homework and maybe look good for the opposite sex . a college student would have to worry not only about homework , but about getting good grade in order to graduate . as soon a a person graduate from college he or she will have to get a job . after that , must start thinking about getting stablished by getting merried , buying a car , buying a house , etc . all of the previous example are most likely what a thypical person will experiment troughout their life under `` normal '' circumstance . all of these lead me to the conclusion that the younger a person is , the more the person will enjoy life , and i think this is basically because the younger a person is , the least a person worry .
