according to my life experience , i agree with the statment the young do not pay enough attention to their community . in my opinion , there are countless factor for this phonemone . i will explain some of them in the following paragraph . first of all , nowadays the job market is more and more competitive . as a result , the performance in the school become more and more improtant . however the experience of helping community will not record in their grade . meanwhile , parents expect their child should focus on their study . student are not encourage to help others . children spend lot of time in learning english , painting and music . furthermore , people are becoming more isolated with each other . in the past , the neiborhood are familiar with each other . they may organize a small group to clean the street . as long a the adoults do it , the young will be affected . in the end they will helping the community automatically . in the capitalism society , people expect there will some return when their do something to the society . taking all into account , we can have a conclusion that young people are more and more selfish and unwilling to help their community .
