nowadays young people are confronting to increasing pressure from working and studying , and they are rushing into a rapid life everyday . although it is true , i still persist that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is a generally considered that almost all product of new technology are accepted , mastered and being used by young people first , so do the one to provied convience and enjoy . young student , for example , have used to communicate with cell-phones while their grand parent still use old and big normal telephone . although airplane ha been common in china for ten of year , some older people still refuse to travel by airplane , for they think it is dangerous and a waster of money . old people refuse to or do n't know how to use many new product and can hardly receive benifits from modern society than young people . besides , it is obviously that young people are the natural leader of the new fashion , and it is also a common sense that entainment , which is highly development in modern city , are always first accepted by young people . for instance , while i went to bar with my friend in my free time , my mother merely stayed in home with doing nearly nothing even she had enough free time . only when she wa invited to a bar by her younger friend , she found it really a good place to get released . another fact is that a recent social study indicates that le than 70 percent of people who live in big city of china receive benifits from new technology , and few of them are old people whose age is above 55 . moreover , enjoying life doe not only shown on using the new product and enjoying entainments , but also the activity in society . the social concept of older people are not open enough even though the freedom and democrate of the society is progressing rapidly , especially in china . several research have evdiently pointed out that the people who is older than 48 are hard to accept the new concept of the society , and by this they can hardly enjoy the real freedom and democrate , which play a important role in young people 's daily life . from social activites i can release myself and win admire from others , which is essential to keep me feeling well . unfortunatly , my grand parent can not enjoy all of these . above , i think it is nature that young people enjoy life more than older people do , for their different in characties and the attitude to the new thing . while it is a fact that young people are facing to heavier pressure , i think it is worth to face , for we really enjoy a lot .
