the new generation of people are more self involve . if we get to understand them then we can see their evolution towards egocentrism . the world ha opened it frontier since airplane , train and bosts are accessible and le expensive then used to be . people get to travel more , their nomad live bring them to dicover new place , new civilisation but not to get involve in a community . they basicaly lock themselves up and do n't even see what is out there . so helping the community they live in is not a priority . there are a lot of political issue that are involved in the negligance or even distruction of community , like povrety , immigration , tax , unimployment , ... all of these factor contribute in the young people ' action . to help our entourage , we first have to like it and feel appart of it . and in most city the most of the time people do n't like where they live , they ca n't afford better so they just do n't even care . if we compare it to the last generation which lived all their life in the same house , with the same neibours , they were more involved in the well being of their community . they were helping people and loving one . but they felt they belonged there , they just got over a war and were just happy with what they had . but a for today , wealth is a priority in life , education leeds u there . we get an education to be buy thing we do n't need but want . and for that we tends to want more , an addiction like the saying say `` time is money '' . and greed come with carelessness . being appart of the young people , i get to be confronted every day with person whom could'nt care le about people and community . but knowing that this kind of toughts are just selfish and worthless , i try to get out of this stereotypic generation and tend to be le self involved in what ever i do and where ever i go .
