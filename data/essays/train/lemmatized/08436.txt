nowadays , people try to be successful in every way . for example big business company always try to open a new company . i think this lower the quality because you ca n't be concentrated on a specific product , and you can use your whole effort on that subject . first , being concentrated on a specific topic is very important for a successful life . this specific topic could be everything in our live . it could be in business life , in academic life . for example , you will become a bos of the biggest company on your country with mechanical product for long vehicle . also you want show yourself to the other country . you start to sell the farm product for gain more money but you could become unsuccessful because you do not know anything about a farm product you do not have any experinces abot farm product so how you could be successful without these important fact . if you concentrated on your major job maybe you could be the biggest in the world with your experinces . we could say also in academic world also you ca n't be a mechanical engineering teacher and a english literature teacher in same time . after these specific example , we can make a result that you should focus on a specific subject . second , your effort is very important in successful . you always make one job in a day than two job in a day for a defined success . for instance , i never make good two thing in a day but i make a wonderful one thing in that day because i use my all effort on one specific job . at the end , in my opinion , for being successful in life you should be concentrated on a specific subject and use your whole effort on that subject . there is a turkish speech like that : be an apple but best apple .
