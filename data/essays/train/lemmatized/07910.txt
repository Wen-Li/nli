nowadays every thing ha advertisement , even people startted to have advertisement in the internet . they make their own profile with their hoobies , different ability and their favorable personality to have friend or to entertain themselves . it doe n't matter if you say teh truth or not . i do agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , when you look at something while you are walking on the street you see lot of different advertisement about different thing . they can be food , clothets or everything you can imagine of . all of them are well advertised with new technology . they put more efects , sound or color to have your attention . secondly , with the new technology around the world there are no house with out television or radio . so , that mean everybody hears or see the advertisement of product thousand time of a day . due to that people who produce advertisement make them more unforgetable and more enjoyable . for example , yesterday i have seen an advertisement of a coffee on the television with a really funny music in it . i dreamed about that coffee all the day and at the same time i sung that music over and over in my head . finanlly , i had a chance to try that popular coffee . unfortunately , it wa n't what i waited to taste like . there wa n't any smell or any good taste of that dreamed coffee . it wa n't even a coffee . .. and i wa angry . what is more , like before i mentioned advertisement of people in the internet . most people advertise themselves like they are all perfect and impossible to find on the earth . i do n't understand why people try to show themselves differently than they usually are ? i strongly believe in most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . that is why i do n't believe in their extraordinary perfectness , if i do n't try , use or meet them . most importantly i believe in honesty in everything .
