i globally agree with the quotation above even if i think that some precision should be add up to complete it and make it more realistic . first , the purpose of studying is to gain a rational mind so that you can apply it to resolve and analyse various issue . therefore , it is compulsory to be able to quickly understand concept and idea so that you can discus them and give an opinion without necessary having any related knowledge . in addition , fact are often the aftermath or the physical consequence of idea or concept . in other word , fact convey idea and concept , that is why they are inevitably of a superior value . for example , the castro revolution in cuba is a fact while the marxism ideology is the logic behind it . second , a reason that can explained why fact are sometimes seen a important or even more important than idea is that fact are extremely efficient to convey an idea . people are generally more receptive twhe they can link an idea to relevant fact and great speaker often us fact and example to support their saying . therefore , one could wrongly think that the message is more interesting when conveyed through fact whereas it is the combination of idea and fact that make it so appealing . to conclude , there is no doubt about the superiority of idea and concept over fact . however for a student to be successful in life , he or she need to be able to link idea to fact and point out the existing interaction between them . i therefore think that the sentence should have been written like this : '' it is important for student to understand idea an concept first and then look for example of the aftermath of these idea throughout the history '' .
