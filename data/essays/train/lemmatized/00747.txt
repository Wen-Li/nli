i agree the most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . there are lot of product that people can see or buy in the market . but the advertisement want to make money , so they just make the product seem much better to make people wo n't know it good or bad inside . for example , the little boy in the cady shop , he would like to have a big colorful cady but not the no color one . because the colorful one seem better then another one . it doesnt mean that the colorful one test better then the other . but the little boy chose the colorful one so the coloeful one win anyways . i believe that 's why advertisement make product look good then people would buy it and they can make money . and usually the thing which look good outside it cost more expenciner then the thing which look ugly , but the expencive one may not really useful then the cheaper one . another example , i think that people always choose the thing that look good but they dont really care what is really inside of the product so thats why the advertisement keep making thing like only have outside . so when people chose the thing we shoule read the manul carefully before we buy it . there are the example of why i think most advertisement make product seem much better then they really are . i think now day is impossible to chose the thing that not only look good but also useful .
