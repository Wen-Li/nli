i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are usually healthier than old people and are full of zest and energy . good health open a lot of avenue for enjoyment to the youth . they can go bungee jumping or sky diving if they please so . frail health limit the aged . they have to think twice before performing even routine activity of life . a lot of fun involves medium to high risk . at a young age , people are able to take a lot of risk in life . there is very le at stake for them . and that is also how they learn . however at an advanced age , it becomes very difficult to take even medium risk and the aged prefer to shun such activity which would involve risk . how many time would anyone have seen grandma riding a motorbike ? the young are more curious than the aged . hence experiencing new thing is a source of joy and fun for the youth . however the `` worldly wise '' aged ha seen it all in life and there is rarely a thing which can excite them the way it excites the youth . while young , people have a better ability to change . the young are tuned into the time . the elderly usually find it difficult to adapt to the change of the current time . for example , there are not many elderly who are comfortable with the latest technology and gizmo like the computer and the ipod . lastly the world is geared to cater to the need of the young . besides medical care and certain specialized product for the aged , the tv is full of advertisement targetting the youth and child . a visit to the mall , restuarants , pub , entertainment park and movie reiterates the same focus on the youth . the entire economy churn out billion of dollar catering to the whim and fancy of the youth . hence young people definitely have more fun than the elderly .
