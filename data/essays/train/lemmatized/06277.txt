everybody ha different opinion and thought about the upcoming generation . some people doe n't think that young people give enough time to helping their community . as a young person i agree with this statement and i think that young people can do more to help their community . every country is raising the childrens with different culture , thats why i just can give opinion about my country . nowadays , we see that most of the criminal are young people . i ca n't really say that it is all the young people fault . i do n't think the community is helping young people with their problem also , which make u come to this point . if the community is not giving enough attention to the young people , they ca n't expect young people to help their community also . i know that young people are the survivor of their country . they have alot of responsibilties for the community . most people expect them to do better stuff than they are doing now . there is a big generation gap between our parent and u . they do everything to help their community and we have to take them a a role model for u , but because of this generation gap young people just do n't think it is very interesting . i know that young people doe n't help the community but we have to think this statement from a different point of view also . they are young people and they have their own problem which make them think that it is more important then the world . i am sure that no matter which country they are from it is all same with young people . that is not fair to put the responsibilty of the community to their shoulder . i am sure that nowadays young people are going to be good adult which help their community and going to have alot of responsibilty .
