in our western society , where the individual play a center role , the community appears to be le and le important , although it is there is a very common image that come to mind when thinking of youth and it place and role in society nowadays . that of a group of idle and lazy people , who play video game and watch talk show on television . this sound like a cliche , but in fact is what a great majority of people tend to believe . this common idea is reinforced by the image conveyed by the medias which are supposed to reflect young people ' s expectation and value . for instance , if we try to analyze the program offered by a very famous tv channel which is mtv we see a disabused youth , who doe n't have any ideal and doe n't give enough time to helping their community . this widespread view need to be confronted to reality and fact . i believe that we shouldn ' t a a society underestimate our youth. a lot of teenager play an active part in their community . some help younger child with their homework , while others help older people with everyday task that they can not accomplished anymore . indeed a lot of association exist . young people have got a real potential and i totally disagree with the idea that they do not give enough time to helping their community . external factor explain that . one of them is education . when raising their child , a lot of parent forget to teach them compassion . in this case child lack the very essential tool that are necessary to help others . they are self absorb and selfish , thinking about their own confort . it is also the government ' s role to educate young people . it would be interesting to set up special program in high school so a to create an interest . stressing out the importance of the community and our belonging to it is crucial .
