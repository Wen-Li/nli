in my point of view the statement is correct . there are simple reason , why i support this statement . i would like to explain that this is understandable by describing the situation out of different perspective . when you sell a product , for example your old car , you want to make profit out of it . so you clean it up to get the best picture of if and you think of all the feature and advantage this car owns . when you sell it on the internet or in the newspaper you mention only these good side . the reason is simple : you just want to get the maximum amount of money you cat get for it . most time seller do not even tell the buyer that the car had an accident until he particularly asks . if you now compare this behavier with the average advertisement there is almost no difference . both you and everyone else who advertises just want to earn money . another example is my experience in my job . we offer computer service for enterprise customer . when we make an offer , we tell what we already did , make examles of already finished project and tell them how good our specialist are . sometimes i am happy to be at our side of the discussion , because i know the reality . you can not really say that we are lying , but we are using the right word to describe it nicely . it again performed like an average advertising you can see on tv or on the internet , they do it the same way . so from the seller point of view it is of course understandable . beeing the consumer you have to be aware of all of these strategy of selling a product . i personally always try to minimize the advertations to their provable fact , so that i can compare different product with each other objectively .
