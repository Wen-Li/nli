i absolutely agree with the statement that , successful people try new thinghs and take risk . i think that the most important characteristic of a successful person is the want to better oneself , and this is made by the want to learn new thing . the best way to learn new thing is working whit other people . of these two kind of working , either working alone or working whit other people , i prefer working in group for the reason that i 've just mentioned above . working whit other people give u competition , and i think it 's very important to increase our knowledge . on the other hand , when i work alone , i can decide when start and finish my work . i have more freedom than when i work in group , but ther is much work to do . i also think that , the word success mean risk ! in fact , if you do the same thing all day , nothing will be change ! in conclusion , the best way to try new thing is to increase one 's knowledge , so , working whit other people even if you do n't like them . -
