i agree with the statement mentioned . beyond every success there is a risk associated with it . if we consider our renowed scientist and researcher , behind their every success there is a risk . they keep on doing risk in finding out new invention and new discovery . successful people probably will not wish to do the thing which are well known to them because they think in a different way , aiming high to achieve something which is new . in these aspect they do greater risk to find out new thing . they are very much dare enough to do any sort of risk in achieving a positive result . for example i consider madam curie to be the most risk taking and a most successful scientist . as she laid path in the discovery of `` radium '' , a radio active material she took a greater risk in the discovery of radium . she had done a lot of experiment in finding the radio active material . her experiment involved many risk taking factor in which they are very dangerous . at last she found out the radium after a series of experiment and reasearch . the discovery of radium thus involved many risk factor and atlast she ha tasted the success . if she would not had taken the risk mean the radium would not have been found till now . in the same way a mentioned above , successful people always try for new thing rather than doing the thing which are already very well known to them . successful people always try new thing and new task . its incorporated in them to try for a new one . in this process many scientist have laid path to many invention such a marconie invented a radio , grahambell invented a telephone and so on . so i conclude the essay by stating that risk must be taken by every individual in achieving success and try out for a new thing rather than doing the thing which is known to u .
