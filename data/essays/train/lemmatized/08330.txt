nowadays , there is so much information that it is tempting to get interested in many subject . although it is very easy in our society to gather information from a wide range of subject , i prefer to specialize myself in one specific subject because it permit me to build a solid knowledge and eventually to be able to broaden it . first , when somebody specializes himself in one particular topic , he ha the opportunity to understand issue in-depth . these issue are often complex , and that is why it make this type of knowledge very valuable . as a result , it is possible to take position on debated issue . for instance , i have studied psychology for many year and in my country , different type of psychology are debated now . having this deep knowledge in this particular field , i can easily understand the different point of view and make my own opinion . also i can stand a position very strongly if i debate with someone about this issue . in addition , i think that if i know very well one subject , it will then allow me to broaden my knowledge to other subject . as everything is related , it seems obvious that an issue can be discussed in many way . and i believe that having a strong knowledge in one field permit to approach better very complex issue . for example , early this year , the governement of my country wanted to rule a law involving change in the social system . since i had experience in this field , it wa easy for me to consider the bill from a social worker point of view , but i also enjoyed getting very interested in other point of view a legal or economic point of view . i wa all the more interested by the subject that i feel very involved . from this , you can understand why i prefer to build for myself a sizeable knowledge on one specific subject . owing to this , i can take position to complex issue , and consequently i get very interested in some subject . this strong interest permit me to open my mind to new topic with a lot of curiosity .
