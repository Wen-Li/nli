i think there will not be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year . there is two reason like below . at first , the present population in the world is six billion , and it never stop to increase , and it is said the world population is growing with much more high speed . so it is certain that the demand of car also increase with the increase of the population . second , i think it is difficult that we invent a brand new vehicle that is more convinient than car in twenty year . we have already had another transportation system like plane , ship , bicycle , but they are used with different need , and they are not useful a a alternative of car .
