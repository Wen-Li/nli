it 's very much interesting topic to write on . yes i agree with the phrase that the successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . the people who are successeded know the formula to achieve different goal in life than the unsuccessful person . when the people get success in doing thing they get more confidence and try to do different thing to get more money and fame . at present the successful person are taking huge risk to attain more money and name , this is because they have the strength in manys way like money , confidence , faith in the other people also . the person who is not successful can not do any risk because he is not having enhalf money , confidence , strength in mind , and also faith in the other people . just see now , we have many example in this world of successful and unsucessful person . just take a month back tata company chairman ratan tata buyed the stake of steel company for much high price in the world . he is having the confidence and he is the first person in india to buy the stake for such a high price . he know the way to grow the bussiness , and an unsuccessful can he buy the stake for such a high price . take another example if once a person take a picture which is a variety one and get succeded and another take a regular film which be flop , who again take the risk of the talking another variety film , definetly the successful one . so i agree that the successful person take risk rather than only doing what they already know . i hope most the person agree with topic because every one know the value of success in life .
