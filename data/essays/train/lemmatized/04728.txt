i agree with this statement which say `` must advertisement make product seem better than really are . '' for example when i are go to a sopermarct store i usully look at a known brids . it seem better but when i start to use it i reallize that the old one is much better . here in the usa every day you can see a new advertisement . like `` gigou '' the enshorance company . i have an experince with this company in my last accident . i told them i want to get cash instade of fixing me my car but they rifuse . than after tow monthes the took about same stution in thier ad . i did n't keep my mouth shout . when i have return they told me no we ca n't give the money to you . frome that time i hated to see ad in tv . second reasone i thik it 's the ad job to make product seem better so the consumer change his idea and use this product . after that they made more and more money . that explan why i gree with that statment .
