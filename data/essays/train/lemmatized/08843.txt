i agree to the statement that most of the advertisement make product look better than they really are . first and the important thing we should know is that the advertisement which is being made on a product highlight only the advantage not the disadvnatages . so most of them go for the product by seeing the attractive ad and then feel bad about it later . while buying a product first we should read the review of the product and gor for it or ask a colleague or a friend who bought it . we should make sure about the product before you buy . i like to discus one example which i faced . i saw an ad in my telivision about the face toning cream . i got attracted to it by the way they presented in the ad and result given by some user . then i ordered the product for $ 50 after some day by watching the ad daily . then when i recieved i saw a small tube which is my little finger size . i got shocked to see it . then i called the customer service and they said the bigger tube cost $ 75 . so i ended up making a note in my mind that no more ordering by seeing ad . one more example i like to discus is about my friend daughter . the cute little girl saw in the cartoonnetwork an ad and started asking her mother about the toy . that toy can be puchsed only through online ar by phone . so my friend orderd the toy . when they received it the girl started cry that it not the toy she saw . later they found from other family that the same thing happened to them also . so i like to say that there should be a law to make sure that the info in the ad before advertising a product is everything true and aslo they should make sure that they advertise the disadvantage also .
