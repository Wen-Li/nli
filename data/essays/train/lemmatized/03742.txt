i think that will depend mainly on the stage of the student . for primary school student , i think it is much better for them to learn fact simply because student at this stage will not be able to understand idea or concept . secondary school student are able to understand idea and concept simply because they have already background about fact from the primary school . the situation for the student in the college stage is different a well . i think it is much better for undergraduate student to learn fact by taking many course of different subject area . that will give them the opportunity to broad their knowledge about various topic . so after graduation , during their graduate study , they may take course in only their subject area . by this way , they will able to work in detail on their major area of study and of course learn idea and concept in depth . this definitely what is happening in the us universities and faculty where student in the undergraduate stage are offered to take some required course and many elective course . so during their graduate study , they may take many course thats related to their major for one year or so . unfortunately , in my country we only learning fact all the time . i think thats the main cause of jobless in my country . i hope one day , i can change the way of learning in my country . as a conclusion , both policy of learning are required depending on the stage of the student .
