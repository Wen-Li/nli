i disagree wit the statement . i do not think there will be fewer car than now at least in twenty year . i would say that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in fifty year . now the earth is getting warm , which doe not effect in good way for neither creature including human being nor plant , for instance , forest . this thing called gloval warming are considered that it will melt graciers around polar region . it cause the increasing of the surface of the sea . many people would have to move to somewhere higher altitude . also the warming would cause skin cancer . because of really strong x-lay . some people even these day have possibility to get skin cancer , but if it get much hotter and stronger x-lay more people would get it . one of the method to solve the problem or alleviate the matter , we should decrease the emittion of carbon dioxide from gas of car . people are actually trying to do that , but it is really hard to make it in a couple of decade . first of all , people in all of the world need to pay attention and focus on doing that . i do not think everyone would pay attention about it till it becomes obvious that the earth face to real danger . moerover , not all people , but also all country , government need to work on it with citizen . then they need to work on it together . there is another reason that i disagree with the statement . many more kind of car are invented and made recently such a car with new function . if producters keep creating car , the number of car would not be changed . i think it would rather increase the number of car . more new technology such a car we have , more problem we have in the future . decreasing number of car is pretty hard so that i do not agree with the statement .
