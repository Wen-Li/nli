people who succeed always try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well and always doing . the following are the three reason that claim the statement . first , people need long time to success , the reason that they succeed is that they learn from all their failed and successful experience . they had try all thing . if they met difficulty , they would find another method , in that case , they know what to do when they met the same problem and prevent from doing the same thing again . so they both gain in their meaningful experience . however , for the people who just doing what they know , for example , nowadays , computer are used in many industry , in the person only know how to drop down the thing by writing , they will not be succeed in finding a job or being promoted to the higher position . second , successful people can find new market and always have new idea in their mind , for example , in a business market , the one who have many new and attractable idea will conquered most of the customer ' favour , and a a result , their profit will be higher the the one who always doing the same ordinary thing , that is only thinking in one direction . last , the successful people will always take a great step forward than the one who doing the same thing because they learn more than others and a a result , they will have greater improvement and they also attemp to use new thing and idea , because not many people will have the courage to take risk , and if one take the risk , he win and become a successful person . compare to the one who always pay safe and do secured thing , they are hardly to success . there are not many successful people in the world because the one who pay safe do not have the attemps to take the risk , to try their very best and bring their greatest effor to the job .
