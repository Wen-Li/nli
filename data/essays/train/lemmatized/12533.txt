i think who said that young people do not give enough time to helping their community is completely wrong . if that right , then who will build the community ? . me and you can not forget what the older people do for u and for the community . yes we are still learning from them but we are the power . we , the young people , who can build , work hard and develope our community . we always try to consume our time beneficially a studying hard to give at last what we can . may be what we will give is small thing but it will grow with a with all our wishis to be accpted from the community . young people try most of the time to detect the mistake that were done by the older people and keep trying to change it and to improve it . they also always keep thinking how to be creactive and finished with a developed community . may be that take alot of time and make them busy little bit but that not mean they do not have time to their community because at last every thing will done for it .
