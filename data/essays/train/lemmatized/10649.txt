knowledge is one of the necesseties of life . as far a i observed , most of the people want to learn knew thing and the people who have knowledge about many thing are to be respected by others . therefore , i agree with the idea that to have broader knowledge of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one subject . first of all , the world is changing every time especially thanks to the development of the technology . the need and want of the people change a time go by and the field which is approved by everyone one day , can not be copnsidered a a good field the next day . therefore , people should always improve their knowledge and skill to continue their living . secondly , concentrate on in one specific subject make nonsense , in such a world where everything is related to eachother . for example , a a student studying economics , i do not understand why a macroeconomic professor ha no idea on game theory . at first sight , there seems to be no relation between them , however , if we think deeply we can see how the finding of game theory , ha important effect on decision making process which affect the decision of fiscal and monetary policy , and thus will reflect on macroeconomic stability of a country . thirdly , if we consider the social interaction between the people , generally , people do not like to talk with person who always concentrate on the same subject . for example , a man can be a very good doctor , howver if he doe not have other interest , he will not have any social life since people do not always want to hear the same subject again and again . as a conclusion , to capture the need of human being and technology and response in accordance with them people should concentrate on different subject rather than only one . this will also be helpful on maintaining an effective social life .
