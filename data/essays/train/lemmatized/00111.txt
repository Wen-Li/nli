successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . as far a i am concerned , i 'm agree with this statement for three main reason : firstly , i think that a person is successful because he or she take risk . in fact in the business world if you do something you would obtain a good result to be a successful person . so you can obtain a good result only if you take one or some risk . for example in a company you are an important manager and your work is always perfect . but you want to take a promotion and so you take a risk : you change your type of work and so your result become different . if your leader appreciate your new work you will take a promotion but if your work is n't good you wo n't take a promotion . secondly , risk are beautiful because a static work is not a nice a a very active work with a lot of risk and change . in fact i think that you will become a successful person only if you do a very active work . for example bill gates is a very successful person but he is successful only because year ago he took a big risk : in fact he created a computer company and he spent a lot of money in this work . so he took a risk and now he is a very successful and rich person . finally i think that the succesfful people are people who manage our world while the other people wait and see . in fact our world is so beautiful because some successful people have created a lot of thing for our life . for example some successful people have created car and airplane to make our life more confortable . in conclusion my opinion is that try new thing and take risk are very important because if you do this you will become a very successful person . otherwise you are a normal , static person .
