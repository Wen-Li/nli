people may regrad traveling a a mean of relexing a other may think it is a chance to widen our point of view . no metter , what the reason would be , there is only two way to travel , that is with or without a guild . someone may think the best way to travel , which i totally argee with , is in a group led by a tour guide . to begin with , travel with a guide in a group can ensure the safety of the tour . many rule of the local that we may not know may occurs , and if we offended the local the result would be destructive . like in china , western may not know that chinese is extremely susceptible to thing that may bring bad luck . for an example , walking under a ledder , breaking the mirror or even using the wrong foot to enter a building . moreover , the guide which know the place well may tell you is that place safe or not . for instant , he may advice you to keep an eye on your wallet in some certain market due to the pickpocketer . secondly , every thing included air ticket , hotal room and food may casue cheaper . some people may think that fee would be inflated dramically in the hand of a guide . this is not totally true because although some extra fee may include , some certain expence may apportion among the group . finially , travelling in a group may have more fun . while traveling in a group , we could surely make friend in the tour ! there will be more fine to have frineds to travel along . if you were travelling alone , it would be obviously boring . in short , regard to the aloneliness , i would say travelling alone would be rather pathic . if we travel within a group , we could share our happiness with them instantly . in short , undoubtablely the best way to travel is to be in a group . safety of the tour and oneself could be maintain becuase the guide could thell you what we should aware of . price of the ticket could be decrased . last , if provide a chance for you could meemore new friend !
