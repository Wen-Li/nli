in my point of view , i disagree the following statement for several good reason . before mentioning my reason for disagreing this statement , let u think about what the world would be like in 20 year time . would you think that the world 's population would increase or decrease ? the answer of this question would make the difference of the number of car in the next 20 year from today . first of all , i would like to answer my own question , and i actually think that indeed the population all around the world would increase . for a start , let u discus this related to my place of living/country . if the number of people increased , then the number of people who need living would increase , therefore the number of people who need money will increase and nearly everybody need transport . either to work , home , office or any other place around the country . so that would increase the number of car needed for transportation . secondly , these day the technology is getting better and better . nearly every month a new car is gettig published or produced in market . which mean many people would like to get a new 2006 car , but actually maybe 50 % of the car 's production get sold , im not trying to be accurate with my number but im just giving an example . last but not least , the car company these day are everywhere , i mean exactly everywhere . where ever you go there are these adverstisements about this new 2006 car , or your city bank give you discount if you want to get this type of car . so many factor may help you in getting a new car . lastly , i would like to say that why could n't we combine technology with saftey together ? i mean large number of car mean high pollution , which mean environmental damage , so i wish that one day i could use a car that work on h2o ( water ) instead of petrol !
