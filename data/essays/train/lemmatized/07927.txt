i agree this satement . people always try to do the thing they alredy know how to do well . but that can not make people more creative or be more successful . if people do not try the new thing how can they know their `` true '' ability . we can see lot of successful people talk about their experiment . if they always do the the thing they know they can be the present them . just a an actor , he can not always preform the same style of movie . therefore he can be styled by the auddience . the auddience will know that `` that is the limitation of his prefromance . if the person always do the same thing that he already can do well , he wo n't get any growth of himself . because he wo n't know what 's wrong or where he shall change . or what can make himself better . sometimes , i would limited by this thought . i just want to do what i can do well . i have no confident to do the other thing that i do not famliar with . by that way , i can not learn other knowledge that i do not know . i think japanese is the good example for the successful people or the race always try new thing . they make lot of new product that can connect with life . and the company like `` 3m '' , the company make the product like `` post-it '' . they try new thing that the common people wo n't even think about . they make money by they can take risk . before make the product , they wo n't know if everyone can adapt those product . but they want to try about it . they want to make new thing that everybody do not see or hear before . that is way i agree about that successful people always try new thing and take risk . just because they can see the profit or commercial in it . if people not try new thing , they will be limited by themselves . they can not know where is their extreme .
