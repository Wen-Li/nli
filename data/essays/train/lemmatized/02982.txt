in next twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today is certainly true . although today car are the first choice of personal transport , it will be not in same in future . the time is changing the city are becoming bigger and world is becoming smaller . now is the time people dont live in their own big house they live in big building were every one share the same ground . the people dont work in there separate field they work in tiny place called office . the pressure on city is growing and the density of population is increasing . the estimate percentage of people living in city and in village will be 50 % by the year 2050 . all this bring huge amount of pressure to the transportion system , whcih the city like tokyo and newyork is seeing currently . the city transport system can not expand itself to accomodate space of each car for each individual . the future of transportation is mass transportation . the city need to bulld their transportation structure around the metro train and mono rail . there might be possibilty of private plane or some new kind of transport . today they say that new york and tokyo run a much a above the ground and underneath it . the crisis of fuel and the poulation issue may be handled by new invention but the problem of space will remain same in future also . the people travelling for day to day business will search for a cheaper and safer mode of travelling . the answer will be mass transport only . the car surely wont go out of market but will become a mode of leisure or fun . it will be a kind of thing which people will use in there weekend , just like bike and hourse now .
