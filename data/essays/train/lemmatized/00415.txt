i totally agree the statment'young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ' . i will evaluate with the following paragraph . before i tell you my reason , i state that what is mean by ` helping community ' . for me it is working in society in your own time by free which mean volunteer . first of all nowadays young people have a lot of thing to do in school . for example a small test everyday , big exam onece a month and leaving certificate for end of the school which is really important for the colleage . what i mean is the young people must study for them and which take enough a lot of time . hence it is difficult to have time for comminties . the second reason is there is so many way to having fun at the weekend . in the past there were no prikura machinne ( taking picture of yourself and freinds. ) , shopping , game center and disco . they are very popular for young people . hence they are much prefer to do them instead of helping comunties . also in my opinion young people have an imagie for community which is too hard . they care more about their fashion , the point in school , celeblities , gosships and all . they never interested in the real society . as you can see the society and people ha been cahnged . in other word young people have thing to do for themselves . although i know that they are selfish and ridiculous opinion but that is why i beleive young people nowdays do not give enough yimr y
