yes , i agree with the following statement . it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . well , i am a student , i study architecture and for me is very important to understand that i study . infact if i do not understand i do not know how many important thing . when my professor talk about a famous architecture i like to listen him and i like dream about this thing . if a student do not understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . .. well , he or she do not learn anything . i think that if you can learn more thing about you study or not , your mind can learn much more . well ! i think also that if a student do not have a good theacher he or she do not like understand that he or she study . however , there is must a good collaboration about a professor and a student . i do not talk about complicity , but i talk about a good abient where theacher and student could be to learn . if a student do not understand that he or she study i think that he or she do not have more thing about tell . in conclution , i think that if a student have a good teacher , he or she can understand everything he or she want . infact , i understand more that i study because i love that i study . i love architecture and i like see , touch , and talk about it .
