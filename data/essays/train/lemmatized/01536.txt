i do n't think youg people enjoy their life more than older one , although most of them think so . i like to give short example why young people think in this direction and than show it from the opposite side of the elder : most of the young people think they are enjoying their live more than older one because there are so many new experience they are making when they are young , for example finding a girlfriend . they are talking all the time about how happy they are . but after a while they search for a new girlfriend maybe because the `` old one '' wa n't exactly what they expected of the `` true love '' . older people instead of this already have the experience what they want or what they are searching for in life , so , when they finally find the right partner they stick together and stay together happier and longer then young people , because they know , that they wo n't have their whole life again to cherrish it with the person they love . and they do n't talk about how happy they are all the time , they just enjoy it more silently . secondly young people say , that they could n't imagine a life without a computer or the television . for them , these thing make live more enjoyable . they do n't understand how old person could be happy without using these thing . but older person grew up without knowing thing like that , so they never made the experience of tv or cumputers . they had other thing to pas their freetime with . they played outside or read a book . and because they did n't know these thing they were not unhappy by not having these thing . so , i think it is definetly not true that younger person have more fun in life or that they enjoy it more than older one . both of them enjoy their life but in different way . but , i , for myself have got to say , that i definetly do n't want to live in another century or that i want to change my age .
