in my opinion it is better to have specialized knowledge in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academec subject . a person having a broad and superficial knowledge of many academic subject is like a jack of all trade but master of none . such a person can not do justice to any of the academic subject . like for example no patient will like his brain to be operated upon by a general physician rather than by a neuro-surgeon . similarly a teacher teaching a variety of subject can not do justice to student of a specific stream . he might be aware of all the subject he is teaching but he might not be well equipped to satisfy the query of a student regarding the specification of a topic . it is advised to have an overall knowledge of various subject and be aware of all the thing which is why we a a student study a variety of subject at school level . but then it is even more important to give a direction to the course of our study by pursuing further education in a field of our interest so that we do proper justice to our study . a student might not be a interested in studying literature a he might be in engineering science or vice-versa . so it is kind of unfair to make him study subject that do not interest him which ultimately lead to his securing poor grade in those subject . one may very well argue that a student may be interested in more than one subject and may want to pursue his further study in both . in that case , now-a-days there are many combination of subject available which help u in understanding the inter relationship of different subject with each other . for instance , the application of engineering science in medical stream is one of the most studied combination . by the time a student completes his schooling he is in a condition to make up his mind and decide his area of interest . so giving him a choice then to choose his preferred stream will help him perform well and hence will lead to his motivation and satisfaction . moreover , there are numerous field which require exhaustive research and study for their proper understanding and appreciation . a student whose faculty are being used in a variety of subject will not be able to find enough time and resource to utilise in all the field . hence he might not be able to appreciate the nuance of a subject a well a he could have when studying that subject in detail . in view of the above argument i believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject .
