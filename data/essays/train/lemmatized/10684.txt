i agree that the advertisement that are widely used to promote product present them a much better than they are , in that they exaggerate the quality of the product and the effect that it will have on it consumer . advertisements present product in a superlative light . i will not venture to say that they decieve a to the quality but rather than they exaggerate it . well-to-do company that can afford to advertise well are likely to have good quality product , but they are not necessarily a perfect a their advertisement show . for example , brand name cereal are presented in advertisement a the culmination of culinary excellence . at the same time , unadvertised product may have almost identical ingredient but le name-recognition . the consumer naturally assumes that the famous brand is higher in quality compared to the unknown brand but if he or she would try both they would find them similar if not identical in taste . also , advertisement only concentrate on the positive trait of the product , but never the negative trait . tobacco advertisement somewhatexculded , they will always make the product seem perfect and convenient and useful and safe , even though it may not be . toys and appliance , among other product , are commanly advertised in this way . the advertisement will show how fun and exciting the trampoline is . but if a customer were to try it out , he or she would find that it is very fragile , for example . this is another common way of presenting advertisement a better than they are . moreover the effect of the product on the consumer a it is presented in the advertisement is deceiving . advertisements typically reach their audience by showing vision of glamour , popularity , pleasure , and increased appeal to the opposite sex a the effect of buying their specific product . it is these hidden image that permeate advertisement and it is these that attract customer , however subconsciously . the truth is of course that these message are flase and unreasonable . just because the axe commercial show that whoever us axe is irresistable to woman , it doe not mean that actual user of the product will share the same fate . advertisements are an effective tool in marketing a product . this is because they show it quality not it shortcoming , they exaggerrate it excellence and uniqueness , and send false image about the effect they will have on the customer that use them .
