i totally agree with this point . . that more succesful the person will be more risk or more new achievments will be given a thought . as it is saying . success is not journey like life it is destination and every body ha to accept it . becuase nobody is perfect in this world and everybody do have a learning curve . so , to achieve all these with success . one ha to take risk to try something new or to achieve some thing new . doing the same thing will not yeild profit and fame for a long time . being improvised in new thing is also a important factor . it can be stated with such an example . our scientists were successful in making rockets . but to prove it to society and science that they work the way it should . it should be shown practically and for showing it practically they have to take risk by sending them into space with humans . it wa a big risk . but they took the chance and also got success . if they had thought that , using rocket will be dangerous . they could have stopped making them and even not using them in future . it is completely like this saying . winners and successful people do n't do the same thing repeatidly . they do thing differently . and for doing it differently . risk ha to come . the knowledge that is engraved in people can be crafted in more suitable manner , by taking chance and imparting that previous knowledge in inventing some thing new by introducing some new idea , fact , thinking and risk . because no body know will it work for the very first time . it may not . so ending the part here only . i strongly support and agree to the point . that successful people try new thing by taking risk . not believing on fact that the knowledge they have is more than enough because again no one is perfect and everybody have a leraning curve .
