experts of the bussiness world determine our era a the era of advertisement . it is something we are not much aware of . however , the firm are aware of that . probably , we all have experienced buying something that we do not need but we bought just because it wa very attactive . however , there is a fact much worse than this ; they fool u by these advertisement . because they mainly make the product seem much better than they are . advertisement make the product seem much better in two way ; by false impression and by creating brand . first problem is the false impression created by these advertisement . to start with we may talk about the main idea emphasized in advertisement . according to the type of the product advertisement emphasize feature like quality , attaractiveness , functionality etc . however , most of the time it is only the impression they want to give u . in reality you will face a bad quality , ineffective , nonsense product just after you bought it . forexample , last year i bought a tracking boat . the advertisement wa saying that it is water resistant and you can not damage it for long year . it absorbed water and the plastic part of the shoe were damaged just in the first use in tracking . secondly , the advertisement create brand which also make product seem much better than they are . it is clear that being a brand in your field is very important in our age . however , it seems that solely advertisement can create brand . even a newly established firm can give the feeling that their brand symbolises confidence , quality etc. by mean of some advertisement . let me illustrate again with my shoe . i had bought them believing that their brand wa very confidential . however , they were disturbed shortly and when i tried to find someone to tell my dissappointment i could not find anyone . actually , i have learned that it wa a mal-functioning firm with no reliability . i am really angry for being fooled by advertisement which make product seem much better than they are . both giving false impression and by creating brand they make u to do bad decision .
