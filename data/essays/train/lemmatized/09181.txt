successful people try new thing because a successful person always try to be more successful by inventing or discovering some thing new . successfull people try thing by taking risk . generally people get confidence , clout and motivation and professionalism when they take risk to find new thing . firstly , people who get encouragement will try to work more hard because it is human tendency generally we find this tendency in childern . but this also a hidden character of adult . it also work to my tendency . i even experienced this personly in my computer lab . once i acheived success in finding a program for project and i still try to find something new . . so this also increased my level of confidence towards the subject . secondly , scientist are the great example because though they are successful in their career they alway pore their time to invent or dicover new thing . usually scientist know how to do well but they take risk to find some thing new . here sientists are increasing their profeesionalism at the same time taking risk for finding new thing . generally people get clout when they are trying new thing . many people will valuable appreciation from others for their work . people generally dont appreciate all the for some people who dont take risk and who always do the thing what already know how to do well . as there is nothing greate in doing the thing what they already know how to to well most successful people dont prefer to do only flasy people will try to do to show there unreal adeptness . in conclusion , i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well because success always independs on hardwork .
