whether people are better to have broad knowledge of various academic topic or to focus on a specific subject is a controversial issue . on the one hand , gaining specific knowledge mean that i might be able to discus only this subject , but can argue deeply . on the other hand , obtaining broad knowledge mean that i can disscuss a variey of topic with different people . however , in the final analysis , i agree with the former statement for the following reason . for one thing , concentrating one subject can deepen my knowledge , thereby i am able to become a specialist of this subject . compared to a generalist , a specialist is much more demand in the job-hunting-world . one example illustrates my point is that , when i undertook a job hunting , i had a bitter experience on it due to my major , social science . however , one of my friend , marketing major , had many offer from variety company . based on my experience , focusing on a specific subject lead a successful businessperson today . additionally , obtaining one special knowledge can be unique strength which others are unlikely to have . in our society , it is better that each person ha each strengh . if people have same statement about many topic , it is goint to be boring . therefore , considering all of the above factor , gaining specific knowledge is much more effective than learning broad subject .
