i agree with the statement that it is better for a person to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject rather than to specialize in one specific subject . specialization can be a good thing in life , it help a person to be good at what he doe and be effecient in his work . however , sometimes if a person chooses to take many academic subject , it get interesting . lets say for example , a person take biology , history and phsycology . all this knowledge is a great advantage ! it lead the person to be more knowledgable , more aware of lot of thing and also give a sense of fun . your mind expands and get different and interesting information each day from different topic . knowledge is a bunch of fact that you accquire from experience and everyday routine . knowledge on one thing make life boring especially for a person who is always curious and want to learn new thing . knowledge is unlimited , you have access to it anytime and anywhere . i could choose to know everything about one certain topic but that limit my knowledge to that one topic . but how about knowing information about different topic ? this make you even more social with different type of people . a doctor who know history get people astonished . they begin to understand the fact that he is good at what he doe but also ha interest for many other thing . in high school , i 've always chosen different elective like music , french and also computer lesson . i wanted to know more about each or even be good at them like in my major subject . it made me feel wise and able to talk to people about alot of subject . i could argue and talk in different area with different type of people , it give a good impression and also make my life interesting to learn new stuff and fact everyday . that explains why actor now are persuing career in singing or being leader of charity act or organization . they want to try more . it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . to learn different fact everyday give color to the mind . life is short a they say , so make use of it .
