portrayed by enormus poet and artiests , life and the joy of life are so attracting a well a noble to everyone . lives of young people are appriciated a being vigorous and vivid , while older people are admired for having wiser speculation and richer experience in life . but who , after all , enjoy life better ? in my point of view , young people tend to enjoy life more . first and foremost , curiosity is a rather important factor in the enjoyment of life . young people , just like other young animal , posse enough curiosity to urge them exploring this world with discovering eye and open heart , which in turn reward young people of an endless advanture of new archievements . another reason , perhaps equally crucial , is the fact that young people always have more physical capability than older people do . far too often can we see young people mastering all kind of exciting sport and engage themselves with thrill . by contrast , what we can frequently hear from the older people is simply the complaint like , `` if only i wa 20 year younger. '' or `` god bless my heart . '' . of course , older people do have their own advantage in enjoying life . the aboundant experience accumulated along with life span enable them to taste life in a slower , yet maybe wiser pace . but also undeniable is the pitiful truth that they often do n't have adequate energy and passion to keep up with the fast tempo of time . they will more probably take a rest from time to time and doze over where young people enjoy their precious youth with no reversion . `` old people have a glorious past after them , while young people have a brilliant future before them . '' this quote ha addressed the problem in a neat and sentimental way . with far more planty time and novel future ahead , young people will almost definitely enjoy life better .
