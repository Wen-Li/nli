since the invention of the modern car , based on the explosion engine , the manufacturing of car ha increased continuosly making possible that any family in the occidental country could have one . this is one important succes that the modern society ha achieve , making possible a lot of fact than traditionally were n't able to all those family . cars make our life really easier . since every family could own a car the distance between city and town have been reduced and it 's really easier to visit place , go to job faster , carry thing , etc . it 's unimaginable a world without car . but in the other hand we have to think how those machine ha contributed to the global warming . the use of petroleum and poluted gas increase the toxic air and afects our world enviroment . we also have to think about all the war and global problem that this need of petroleum ha created . today there are too many car in the street . the life on the city is turning very dificult because is so common to use a car that there is no space in the city to allow them . the air is turning difficult to breath and every day more people are going to live outside the city because of these polution . the public transport is n't answering the people 's need . they are overcrawded and many time arrives late wherever you go . i 'm a triatlon sportsman and for me ha become really dificult to do any sport in the city . it 's too dangerous . i think it would be great that in the future there will be fewer car . we all need to be conscient of the importance to maintain a clean enviroment , where the city become a safe zone where everyone could live , enjoy and do some sport .
