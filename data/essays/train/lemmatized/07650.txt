i agree with the statement that now the world is full of car , and probably in the future we will have more . so i agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be more car in use than today . i agree with this statement for two fondamental reason . the first is that the tecnology today is growing up very quickly , and so it is more easy to built car faster and better than yesterday . in addiction to this fact the fabric of car spend le money to do them , and so they produce a huge number of them . probably in the future , by the fact that is so easy and so economic to buy a car , every people will have one . secondly i think that people really like to drive and to have car , and this is an other reason why the commerce of them will be increase in the future . today , in our society , the car represent one of the status simbol of the person who own that object . that is a very big problem becose it could generate differenses and gelosies between people . in conclusion i think that in the future people will buy more car than today , and so in twenty year a person could have more than one car than today .
