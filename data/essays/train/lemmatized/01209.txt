must people try new thing and take riks in order to get success ? in my opinion the answer to this question in a world that is changing all day is `` yes '' , for the next reason . first , this is a learning world . i mean , a lot of knownlege and information is produced everyday , so the people who want to sucess they have to be avialable learn new thing every day . some reachers are found that the people must chance thier major aor carrer unleast one time in thier life . second , in business are a lot of story where the people that do n't take a risk and chance , lost a lot of money . besides , the people who innovate ha success . examples of that are the transistor in the electronics business and the digital watch , that brings to japan to the first world after the second world war . other contries with more avantage than japon did not want to take the risk . japan did it and now it is the one of the most important economic in the world . also , it is easy to find a lot of personal story of succes around new tecnologies and internet . yahoo , google and you tube based theirs success in a strange idea , work with out direct pay . so they offer a lot of service like mail , search information and host web page and video without a recive any pay for that . they people who create the web portal take the risk and everybady know the story they made a los of millons of dollar . in the other hand , for each one of the people that take risk and become a successful people a lot of people fail . so take a risk it is n't a warranty to success . but what i can say is that every successful people had take a risk and try new thing .
