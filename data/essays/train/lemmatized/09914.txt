will there be fewer car in use in twenty year than there is today ? this is an important question to which many people would like to answer . we will see that some argument support this idea and other doe not . the price of gas ha increadibly raised during the last few year . this made the fact of having a car not affordable to many people . if the price continues to increase gas will become a very luxuous product and it is not the car that will be expensive , but the gas you use to make it work ! then there will be fewer car in use . this tendancy is already there , because some people have a car but do not use them a often a they did because they can not buy the gas . a big problem that we have nowadays is pollution . because of that many decision have to be taken in order to prevent the planet from dying . one source of pollution is the gas that get out of the car . some city already took mesures in order to protect their area and their environment , such a london . now you have to pay to get into the city . then many people let their car outside of the city and take the bus , which pollutes le because more people use it at once . another example is what you can find in the united states . on the motorway some line are only for car with at least two people inside . and most of the time these line are the fastest ! it then encourage people to share their car . then we can see that having le car in use will probably become necessary if we want our planet to survive . on the other hand people need to use their car more and more . the main explanation is that nowadays you change job very often and people travel more . if someone ha a job , buy a house and a car , what should he do if he change job ? should he buy a new house each time ? it is not a realistic solution . he will have to use his car to go to work . there is not only for the job that you need your car . people like to do many cultural activity or they like to travel . for all of that most of the time you need a car . for all this reason of freedom and independance , it is not sure that there will be fewer car in the next twenty year . i think that it is possible that there will be fewer car in twenty year because of the price of the gas and the pollution problem . it will become a necessity for the planet . on the other hand a people really need their car , nothing will change unless some measure are taken such a better public transportation , but not only in one city but within them , without forgetting land and very small town .
