the future of the country lie on the shoulder of youth . it is the responsibility of the present generation to lead the country to the path of the prosperity . i disagree with the statement that youth do not spend enough time in community service . many successful community program in the city where i live are associated with the active participation of youth . take the example of the cleanliness drive that wa undertaken in my city to get rid of the rubbish accumulated on the beach . students and young working professional showed up in large number and worked eagerly in the activity . not only that some people even went to the extent of putting up sign board to educate the people about the hazard of polluting the beach . it can not be said that youth do not participate in the community program due to lack of time . one of the reason could be lack of proper advertising of program . last year the local program in my city to protect the turtle during the breeding recieved minimal response a hardly anyone knew about it , including me . however , this the local corporation officals gave widespread publicity about the program and a large number of people signed up for it ( it included me ) . the response wa tremendous and there were actually more number of people than required . youth also need notset apart a specific period of time for community activites . they can incorporate them in their daily activity , like dropping the neighbour child at school on their way to college , bring the neighbour grocery while they do their own shopping or take out their garbage along with their own or in a number of other way that can be done parallely along with their own activity . so , the notion that young people today donot allot enough time for community activity can be ruled out .
