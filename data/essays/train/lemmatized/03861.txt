i disagree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in fact i think it is much more better to be specialized in one subject , in order to plan a better carreer and be really good at it . first of all , when a student applies to an university , he should have already thought carefully on which is the subject he like most . at the high school he had time to study several subject and evaluate which is the right one to choose at the university . consequently , in my opinion an accademic student would not need to spend more time on studying many subject and focus on a specific one . the second reason why it is better to focus on one subject is that in this way the student will not get confused among a lot of different data to remember : if you study just one subject , it is easier to collect and organize all the notion you get and like that you will know better and deeply the subject . last , but not least , i think that if you know exactly which carreer you want to try and put all yourself in this purpose , you will not get distracted by anything else and you will reach your goal , the degree , much more faster . your passion for that specific subject will lead you to the success if you are really concentrated in what you are studying . in conclusion , i support the idea that it better tho choose one academic subject than to study many of them , because an academic student ha to be sure about what he want to be in the future . if he focus himself on just one subject , he can study it better and faster and become a better member of the society .
