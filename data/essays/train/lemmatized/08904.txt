i disagree with this statement beacuse i can not imagine a world without car . how will the people move to everywhere ? . every year the technology is getting better and the car are maken much better . now there are highbrid car and there are car that do n't use petrol but the light of the sun . this mean that the car are becoming good for the enviorment . they do n't make so much diox of carbon like before . this is a big success . many people are using a lot of behiculs like a car to go to many place . we can go from door to door easily in short time than walking . actually , the average of using car is growing up every day . so i think it will be very difficult for the people to leave their car and start to walk or run for going somewhere . i think that in twenty year there will be more car than now . in twenty year , the technics of making car and the technology will be better , so there will be better car than now . maybe in twenty year the car could be flying on the air . or maybe all the car will only use the brigth of the sun and do n't use any petrol more . i can not imagine a world without car . how will the people move to everywhere ?
