i agree with it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because , when a student can understand the idea or main concept of the topic the student can generalise by himself . when a student had understand certain concept student can develop more idea by himself . by understanding it the student will able to answer any type of the question on that topic . for example let u consider that a student is studying on motor . the student need to understand the main idea and what are the concept that are related to that topic . and how the motor work and many more thing about the motor . but , le importance should be given to learn fact . let u consider another example , let u consider one of the topic from the student subject . the student must know the what is the main idea and the concept of that particular topic rather than learn fact on that particular topic . when the student is focused to understand the idea and concept on a particular topic . when we arise any doubets on that topic they will be able to answer that doubt . now a day the generation is developing day by day . to sustain in this compition world we must have to be more familer about the topic which are very much important . to know such thing we have to understand the main idea of the subject or topic so , that we can face the present world . so i prefer it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than fact .
