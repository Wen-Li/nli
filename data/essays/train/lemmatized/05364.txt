`` new thing '' make you excited and `` take risk '' doe not scare you at all . there many successful people around the world , what is common between them is that they tried new thing and took risk . i strongly agree with that statement with following reason : new thing doe not need to be compared and bothered by competitor . looking through invention around the wourld . nothing existed before it had invented . so you would not imagen and think what it look like or how it work before someone announce a new thing . inventor is always using their imagination to make new product . it come not only their mind but also people 's demand . although they feel worry until thier investment is achieved form people , they feel excite to make new thing . once it ha appeared in public , there is no comparable thing in the market . so that it is easy to get great reputation from public . i had worked at coordination company in japan , this company wa found for coordinate japanese tv and commercial company or production to film in africa . when we established this company , people said `` nobody want to go to africa and public are not interested in africa at all '' . during the first year wa hard time for u . but from the second year , we gradually got customer who go to africa . more and more take tv people to africa , more and more public are interested in africa . as a result , we had a big african festival in tokyo collaborate with many african embassy and japanese key tv station . since our company is the only one in japan , we can constantly get a work and never bother about competetors . although we had to make difficult dicision and take risk to try new thing . it produce benefit of uncomparerable and no competitor .
