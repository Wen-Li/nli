as a senior in high school is sitting in a roon , he is trying to figure out what he want to become in the future . how doe a person decide ? school ha given student the opportunity to learn many academic subject . whether it is math , or chemistry the broad knowledge that it is atteined serf a a help to discover the inner talent and creativity that a person might pose . during senior year , one of the hardest decision is to pick the major or career one want to do in college . would it have help is a student only study one specific subject ? is that really the student truly interest ? i am senior in high school . at first all i though i like wa math , and all i wanted to do wa math . however , the school required some other regular class and elective . my junior year in high school , i decided to take computer programming and i felt in love with it . then this year i currently have physic and it is like my favorite class in the world . when it came down to make a decision of what i wanted to do with my life , i took all the different class i took into consideration . since , i had such a broad knowledge of many subject like math , physic , and computer , i narrow it down to electrical and computer engineering . i am very glad that the school provides such a verity of class . however , this doe n't only apply to education if not to everyday life a well . a person may know how to count and mix chemical together , but can he or she write a letter ? life doe n't rely on one subject , if not on many . it would be very useful to have a least a little bit of knowledge on different type of subject . with this on mind a person doe n't always need to rely on others for help . a chemist can write correct report . a writer can keep organize his finance . in the end , to go through life it is better to have a broad mind . in conclusion , the study of many subject give the choice to experiment different activity , and help to discover one interest in life and goal . it is useful on making decision and surviving life . a broad knowledge is the key to one inner talent and creation .
