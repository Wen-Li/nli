today , the method of teaching is mainly discussing in all around world . i think understanding idea and concept are more important than learning fact because of two reason ; effectiveness to another proplem , and make a considerated person . first , if we understand idea that on the book , or the profeesor explained we can easily get a solution from similar situation or problem . for example , we have learned ` 1 + 1 = 2 ' . we know not only this answer but also it sequence to solve . unless we underatand the method . ` 1 + 1 = 2 ' is just fact . not mine . secondly , we can be more considerating person . by accessing solution , we could face various kind of obstacle . then , we take a time to review about waht wa wrong and are there any otherway to solve the problem in conclusion , there is a saying that `` teach him ` how to get fish ' , do n't teach him ` how to eat fish ' '' . this show what i exactly mean . ignore all of the sequence is caused unhumanty soceity and unconsiderating society . therefore i think to understand idea and concept are more important than to learn fact .
