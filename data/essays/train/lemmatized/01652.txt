in my opinion one must rather specialize in a specific topic , rather then have broad knowledge on various field . it is also a lot easier to gain knowledge on a variety of topic superficially . while this may give u a lot of information , it will not be helpful in getting answer . in the past , it wa perhaps more beneficail to have a wider range of information . however , a we continue to advance in all walk of life , it is going to become increasingly difficult to obtain new information unless we dig deeper and deeper in the topic at hand . this will require a u to specialize in specific area of study . we will have to tackle problem at even more minute level . we can consider the exapmle of biotechnology . this field traditionally included the subject of molecular and cell biology , and the basic of biochemistry and physiology . today however , biotechnology span area such a particle physic , high speed computing and even biomechanical engineering . it would be virtually impossible to have information about all these branch . moreover , the only way to excel at these topic would be to specialize in them . the need of the hour is collaboration between individual in specialized field . with a high level of specialized knowledge . on a more personal front , i feel than a person self worth is perhaps elevated when he/she master their field of interest . it seems rather easy to gain broad basic knowledge a it is so readily available . with tool such a the mass medium and specially the internet , it will be even simpler to do so . however , specialized knowledge will push u to think in newer direction . collaborative effort between specialist in different field will help u decipher several vexing problem which currently have no answer . overall , it will give rise to newer and beneficial technology . an only through specialized study can we be a part of this revolution .
