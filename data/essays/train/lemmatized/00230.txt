a graet man said before in a long time ago `` the small one are the once who rise the city up or take it down '' . his word were right because that wa the truth . nowadays kid refuse to help others and they wo n't give enough time and effort to help thier community . i think that this is a great big fact . so , i agree with the statment for two resones . first , nowaday teenager do n't do what they are supposed to do and they do n't carry the responsibility of thier behavior . they always act sush a baby and never care about any thing exept if they will have something a an effort if they took care about that thing . that 's a bad acting and wo n't help them even when they grow up because that effect thier community . in this way , thier child will act the same way and there wo n't be any exampels of cooporation . another thing is that the young people are more active and have more potinsules , so they can effored more than the older one and they truly can rise their community by helping it and taking with it hand . and so , every one can live in a nice , loving and cooporatoinal sosiaty . in the end , i would refear that young poeple should do thier job and help their community to rise and be better .
