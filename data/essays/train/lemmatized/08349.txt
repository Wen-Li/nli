the way of success the answer to this question depends on your own experience and the succesful people that you know . for me , if a person want to become more successful , he or she obviously take some risk and try new thing . risks are the way of the succes . firstly , by taking risk , you can make your position higher or earn much more money . people can learn new lesson and way , gain a lot of experience by only taking risk , making mistake and trying new thing . for example , my father who is a really successful manager in a big company had a lower position , an engineer who earns really le money for working a lot , when he first started to work . then , he made a big decision for changing his destiny . he and my family moved to a foreign city without any information and experience . i did not know this place and also i had never heard anything about it like my family . it wa a big change for me and my father . however , this important risk affected my father carreer in a successful way . if he did not decide to do it , maybe he would not become a manager a he is now . it is really important to make right direction in situation . secondly , nobody can become better if he doe not take risk and try new thing . this is a strict rule of life . succesful commander , general , president always take some risk and try nwe thing . for illustrating it , ataturk , the saviour of my country , is an extraordinary example . he took some critical risk to be success in first world war . our army wa weaker and smaller than our enemy . however , ataturk and the army attacked some really important time . it wa a huge risk but by taking those risk , my country is a free one . in conclusion , we should take some risk and try new way in some moment of our life because human life span is relatively short . it is the way of success .
