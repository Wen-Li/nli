can you imagine your city with fewer car ? i think that i can imagine madrid , where i live , in that way but i think that it is going to be a hard and a long task . the enviromental problem , the price of the gas and the parking space , the traffic jump and the cheap and fast alternative instead of the car will push towards the direction of fewer car . one of the many reason why i think that will be fewer car in twenty year is that the pollution in the big city it is a big problem and many people have , and will have , disease due to this . the alternative are car friendly with the enviroment such a the new car designed by the japanese brand . other reason why i think that will be fewer car is that the price of the gas is very expensive due to the war and due to that the people are not using their car . the other big problem in the big city is that there are not enough parking space in the street and the price of the existing one are very high , and can cost a much a one luxury car . the main reason why i think that the number of car will be reduced in the future is that in the main city there are cheap and fast alternative to the car such a the tube or the bus , that can take you to every part of the city in no time without being stopped in one traffic jump for hour . definetely , i think that in the future will be fewer car but still a lot of car . we can try to reduce the number of car , but i believe that we can not live without it . we should take the bus or the subway if we can and use the car a the last alternative .
