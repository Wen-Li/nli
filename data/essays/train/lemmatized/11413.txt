for me success mean profiting from my doing . for example when i take a final exam in a university class i want to succeed . i normally choose course refering to my interest and also to my ability . of course i want to be challenged by the topic , i want to learn new thing in class but i also do n't want to be overchallenged . finally i choose a `` medium path '' . some risk in combination with some fact that make me feel safe . i can choose the medium path with taking in account two factor : the special situation and my well-being . to the first facor i think that the situation should decide whether i go for a risk or not because it tell me how much i can profit from a doing and how much the doing will be challenging . for example when i get the chance to talk in front of an audiance about a for me very unknown topic and i could win a sholarship with the talk , i would rather take the risk then stay at home . the talk then doe not only mean a risk for me - it also mean a challenge in that situation . the second and very important factor is my personal character and my trait profile . am i an axious person ? how do i feel in unknown situation ? do i like risky and dangerous situation ? and how are my exoeriences with risk ? if i only have had good experience with risk i will be more self confident and will succeed with a higher probability . but if i am forced to take a risk i won ' t feel good and the success wo n't be reachable that easily . in summarize i think success and risk depends on an interaction of situation , personality and experience . some successful people may have often tried out risky thing . others probably took a le risky way and succeeded .
