this question ha been raise for a long time now , to answer this question another question must be raise : how do u define enjoy life ? is it the activity you do ? is it your state of emotion ? young people enjoy life a much a old people but in a very differnt way , that often appear to be stronger . as a young person most of the time you try to spend your free time at full speed , most of the activity asociated with enjoyment are spend in outdoors at tha age . i remeber a a young child i spend most of my free time riding bycicles , riding skateborad . .. and so on . a good day for me wa a day where i could tied , exausted . that what most peolpe think when they see kid play around all day . for older people the sence of enjoyment is more define with reflection , taking the time to relax . as i can see myself today by getting older , my point on view on situation change , i spend more time now on intellectual refection ( sush a book , phylosophy . . ) and get more pleasure from little thing , such a kindness form others . .. older people enjoy life with le physical activity . the emjoyment of life for older people is le noticable then young people because they do not have the same point of attraction . so for outsider young people will always enjoy life more than older .
