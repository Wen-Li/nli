i agree with the idea that there will be fewer car in future than today becouse everything is changing about transportation and there are two reason why the statement is true . first thing i like to say is about the price of the car and the price of the other way of transportation . car price are getting more and more expensive day by day . it is not only the price of the car but also price of the car insurance . i know very much people who intended to buy a car than chanced his mind becouse of the expensive price for example . now , these people are using the other way of transportation which are more cheaper like ; tram , bus , metro . .. secondly , a the technology is improving , govenment make metro and tram which will close the rodes of car and make so much traffic jam than it will make the people use the metro and tram . if we look at the rate of the using of transportation we can see that even now it ha some decreasing of using car . in conlusion , there will surely be decrease on the number of the car in twenty year becouse of the tecnology and expensive price of the car and it need . and in my opinion it ha already started to decrease maybe we wont see any car after twnty or thirty year .
