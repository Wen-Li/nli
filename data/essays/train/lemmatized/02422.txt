any other expression would not be more important than this topic . petroleum , what for many of the country fight with each other , is decreasing in quantity . in my opinion , in twenty year there will be fewer car than today , and i am sure that there will be an another way of transportation different from the car . there are several reason why i believe that , fewer car will be used in the future . in my opinion , the main problem is the enegy problem ; world is growing every day , the requirement of the new energy source are in need more than ever . today main enegy source for transportation is petroleum ; however it is clear that the deposit of it are decreasing in quantity . the other enegy source , such a solar enegy , wind power , fuel cells-which are operated from hydrogen - , geothermal source are not sufficent to overcome the energy problem of the transportation sector . for instance , the most ultimately designed solar car , which can reach up to a speed of 90km/h , can only carry 2 people , and is 3 meter long , due to the need of large solar panel . in addition , car , which oparates with fuel cell are not suitable to use in the highway ; maybe they can be used at low speed in the city . another important aspect is traffic problem , i think . big city are growing everyday , and more and more car are sold in these city . however , the road stay same . i believe , traffic is not just waste of time ; in addition , it is waste of energy . for instance , from school to home normally-with traffic-it take 1 hour and 30 minute ; but , when the road are empty it take nearly 1 hour . it mean that everyday i spend 1 hour on road . i think , this can be solved by building more underground or by setting more bus route : these all mean fewer car . as a conclusion , i strongly believe that there will be fewer car in the future . not only the energy aspect , but also the traffic problem force peole to make car fewer .
