i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . nowadays many advanced technology are invented . and specially the advertisement or attract people or describe how it is useful , etc . in this world nobody ha time to go every time for each item and find out which is best with the quality wise and money wise . sometimes is helpful that it descibes in the better way . in most of the area we dont know that how many company are involved for which specific product and from the advertisement we would able to know that product belongs to which company , how much rate , it is cheaper or not , etc . sometime we dont know that how to use `` roti maker '' , so from the advertisement we would able to know that how it use effectively . we would able to know that for the fun , which movie or which album are created and by whom . becaues for the movie and just for album we dont have time to go everytime to cinema and find out . most of the product are useful and human need in the advertisement . it is true that sometimes advertisement describes that product are not really . for example that we would like to go for the great and fun tour . and the advertisement is coming that describe cheap and good package for the tour and cheapest rate a well . so we will just pick this oppurtunity and enjoy . so here some other example advertisement describe the location for the new development . so we can able to use this opportunity . from the advertisement we can judge need and judge that how to fulfill the need . sometimes in the advertisement some location are described for the food , rent room . so from that we can easily find out need . but if advertisement not help u then we have to go every place for fullfill the need . and after choosing some specific place we have to find out that which one is the best . but from the advertisement we will find easily . so advertisement help u in the saving time and fullfil the need effectively . but in the case of cosmetic and some type of food , just attract people . some cosmetic are not good for the skin then also some good character advertise it then it good . so finally it useful in some area
