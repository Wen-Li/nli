there are people in the world that prefer doing what they have already know how to do well . fortunately , there are also people that prefer trying new thing and taking risk . this second type of people is , in my opinion , the example of who is a succesfull person . a person , that base his work only on doing what he ha already know how to do welll , ha few probability to emerge in his field . this kind of person , without personal idea to improve better his work or his like , ha no possibility to be a succesfull person . for istance , a worker that ha n't idea to improve his situation , ha no possibility to become an executive . on the other hand , if an employe ha innovative idea for doing better his work , it is possible that he will became an executive os chief worker . so to became a succesfull person is necessary to have new idea and try new thing , but is not at all . there is an other thing to condider , the luck ! try new thing lead to take risk . the luck is in important component of the risk . in general , if a person ha innovative idea and take risk , he or she ha very good probability to become a succesful person . if a person ha innovative idea and take risk , but doe n't become an executive or a chief worker , i presume he is very unlucky !!! in my opinion , this person , however , is better than a man who doesn ' take any risk in his life , a man that doe n't live fully .
