nowadays , it is common that young people are always away from , responsibility , self management , self motivation and beeing a caretaker . some people believe that it is a phase for them and after it they will recognize what is the right thing . i believe that young people are not helping to thier community because of many reason . first , they are not well grown up by their family , it is the perents problem , there wa no touch between perents and their childeren , in another word we can say careless problem . the previous situatuation will deffinetly lead to unsatisfied person who will not care of any thing other than him self . second , bad friend , it is serious problem , and i experienced this situation , believe me it is a natural thing that young people are always want to know , try and see new thing . it is the nature of the human , but this intrest need to be directed in the right way but unfortunetlly the same can be directed by some people whom not civilized . third , the free time , fullfilling the time with useful and benificial thing like sports , studying and working job are important to young people , it build their feeling of responsibility , enhanse their feeling of ownership and improve their personality . in conclusion , if the young people are well raised up , good friend selected for them and spending free in useful and productive work , i'am sure that they will be really helpful to their community , but so far every body see that the above are not happenning .
