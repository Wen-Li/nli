there is a belief that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i am not quite agree with this opinion . i think older people enjoy life more . there are may reason behind these . firstly , older people have more money to spend . usually people save money while they are younger in order live in prosperity when they get older and retire . but the youngers have to spend money to buy a house , to get their child educated well and thing like that which older people have already taken care . this is why i stated at the beginning of the paragraph that older people have more money to spend . secondly , older people do n't have responsibility a much a youngers have . they have finalized all of their responsibility like raising kid and working hard for a good career . less responsibility not only mean more time to spent for enjoyment but also it mean le stress . i think everyone will agree that a person with le stress could enjoy life more . finally , and most importantly in my opinion older people know the value of every minute they spent and tend to look life in a more positive perspective . i want to give my grandfather a an example of that . he always advise me not to worry about the bad thing , he say instead think thing which are positive . there is also a proverb in turkey about this , which is always think about the full part of the glass while you take a glass half filled . in conclusion i think older people benefit from the enjoyment in life much more than the younger people like me do and they deserve it .
