the given thesis is highly controversial , especially when we take into consideration that the german academic program were recently reformed towards that direction . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject go hand in hand with an extraordinary wide spread education which is useful in various different way in everyday life . knowledge in term of biology , for example , can be easily applied to everyday experience during a walk in the near forest . questions posed by child may be answered appropriately and correctly in an enormous amount of field . on the other hand , today 's economic and societal development of our society result in an increasing differentiation concerning work task and work skill . it is required to adapt to these new circumstance in a world which is on it way to become a global village . in order to cope with this high-speed development , it is important to specify on a very small aspect of an academic discipline . in order to bring my point across , i would like to give a short example : small knowledge of economics in general is le asked for in today 's globalized world than knowledge concerning the solar energy market in china . from this it follows , that i do not agree with the given thesis . at least not with the way it is formulated . from my point of view , a good general education and knowledge is the basis for more differentiated and specified knowledge in a certain field . whereas the first help in the private sector of an individual ( for example when it come to his social status or social prestige ) , the latter is necessary in the public sector , namely the field in which the individual is working . it is absolutely essential , to be an expert in that particular field . otherwise , a high-quality performance is not provided . to sum it up , a broad knowledge and a very specialized knowledge concerning a certain topic should go hand in hand and lead into a compromise .
