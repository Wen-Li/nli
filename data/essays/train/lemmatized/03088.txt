nowadays , people are having busy time for doing their stuff and they merely go for looking in front of them . even though some people are volunteering for the social community . however , i think lot of people doe n't care about the people who live with u . so , i agree with the statement that young generation doe not have much time to help their community . those are following reason why i am consider like that . first of all , the technological environment ha been developed and it cause people to think themselves than society . abundant of technology are invented in modern day such a television , computer , and telephone , etc . it developed the culture in the country where we live in now , and people can have more fun with bunch of machine . therefore , we do n't have to think that having fun with comunicating with other group . so , it make young people to do not care about helping problem in society . also , young generation are more excited about constructing their own life . they are more satisfied with achiving their goal for making their life successful . for example , some young adult are really interested about getting job for future . however , they are not care about helping the old people or disabled people . it happened frequently in the public transportation . the young people just ignore the old people who could n't find the space for sitting down . the young generation are only think where they will arrive . finally , it cause the isolation of old generation . they been found the place to take a rest , but it is not easy . to sum up , for advancing the field of technology presessed young adult and it make people who just persuing the goal without considerating other people . in conclusion , i proclaim that young people should start to concern about other people who life in dark side in this world .
