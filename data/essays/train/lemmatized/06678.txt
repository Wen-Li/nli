i 'm absolutely agree with that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . travel in a group can solve the problem of boring because you can talk to people who share the commom interest a you are . furthermore , travel in a group will be more secure rather than travel alone especilly to those chaotic area in the destination . and travel in a group led by a tour guide will reduce the rate of missing famous place and worth seeing scenery . because guide is a person know the place well and he know at which sesason , at what time , where is beautiful and he also can lead tourist to visit avoid the peak time which is very convient for tourist . then , travel in a group can make a lot friend during the vacation and can enhance the relationship . our human being are not isolated one , we need to communicate . and in the modern society , whatever organization or bussiness company oe even university all require people have the ability to work or study a a group . i had an experience which wa impressive . when i wa a junior high school student , my teacher asked u to draw a pitcure which we though is the most beautiful one . so we began to draw seperately without disscusion . after a while , each student showed their pitcures which all presented very pale in meaning except one which combine the work of two student and which showed a more meaningful and more various color in it . yes , the teacher wanted u to know sometimes work with our partner and shared both valuable thing would attribute a amzing result which maybe could not predict . if travel in a group , we can exercise the ability to be more cooperative and willing to help each other which will make our society more colouful and more competitive in the long run . i highly recommend to travel in a gruop led by a tour guide .
