i strongly agree with that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community , i have 2 reason to surport my argument which are `` parent are busy '' and `` only forcus on study '' firstly , the nowadays ecolomy increase , parent are usually need to work , some parent could be work over 10 hour per day 5 more day per week , the reason for this , they do n't really have enough time to talk or communicate with their child . in my opinion the young people 's community sill mainly come from their parent , they do n't talk with their parent , shell they talk with another people automaticly ? i do n't think so . secondly , most people from nowadays forcus on study , they study at school more over than 8 hour , some student probably spend more hour study after school , 24 hour mine 8 hour to sleep and mine more than 10 hour to study ? how can they learn community ? everyone believe study is most importand because is helpful for the future , but they forget the human is sort of group working class , can you suriver only yourself ? finally , i believe that nowadays young people do n't have much time to learn their community and it will become very shy not a lievily a before . so my comment for this is i think parent have to spend some time to talk with their child to improve their community skill instead send them to school or only study at home , and also we need to teach them not only study is main but also to communicate with another people is also important .
