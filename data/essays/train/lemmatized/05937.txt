youmg people are said to enjoy life more than old people do . i personaly understand this statement . the fact is that young people start in life with a lot of energy to spend . for most of them , they do not have any family duty yet , and can plan a lot of life project . at twenty , you imagine you just have the limit you want to give you . you feel you are free . but i personaly prefer another quote : twenty is the age of energy , thirty is the age of serenity , and fourty the age of fulfilment . the fact is that presently , and maybe especially in france , it is not easy to be a twenty year-person . unemployment is a largely shared fear . the first step in an independent life are not the easiest one . for most people , twenty can be considered a the age of doubt . in a famous quote , the french philosopher cioran said that he would never let someone say that twenty is the best age in life . at 30 , generally speaking , you have started in life : you have a job , and some money to achieve the project you planned at 20 . as for me , 30 is the age of achievement . travels are one example . for many year , i wanted to travel abroad , and especially in the us , which is a country i am deeply attracted to . i never could do such a travel before last year . and i have other holiday project planned in this country for last summer . this kind of thing make me enjoy my life more now than ever . i am 30 . i think that i will have a lot of other project at 40 and 50 . and i hope i will have the mean to achieve them all ! to conclude , i think that at every stage of life , the key success factor is to make plan achievable , and to make everything possible to make it happen . and i do not think that young people , presently , have a lot of opportunity .
