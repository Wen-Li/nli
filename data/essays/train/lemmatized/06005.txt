i disagree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . herefore there are several argument , which i would like to present a following . at first we have to keep in mind , that technology is a rapid process . every day there are new invention and new possibility , which are offered to the consumer . the consumer see these new invention and come to the conclusion , that he must have this product . the automobile sector is a every day growing sector which offer these new invention in form of faster car or intelligent navigation system for the driver . there is nowadays even the possibility to watch tv , while using the car . these new invention lead to the impression , that a car is not only good for transportation . in the contrary , it is used a a status symbol . as a result more people want to posse such technological advanced car for represanting their status to their environment . another reason might be , that people want to be independent while they are voyaging or driving to work . when using bus , train or plane delay occur , which cause an insatisfaction and lead to the impression , that public transport possibility are not a good a the own car . with the own car people can decide when they want to start the voyage , without being dependent on bus schedule or route . of course , the decrease of using car , ha and will have a big disadvantage . the pollution of the environment . the more car are used , the more it is effecting on the enviroment . trees , animal and plant will not have their special environment any longer , which they need for a perfect growth . the air is polluted and the life expectancy of the people decline a more car are on the street . nevertheless car will never disappear from our life .
