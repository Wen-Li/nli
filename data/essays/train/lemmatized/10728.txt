famous researcher , important people or successful star have a common point : they all look further afield , wanting to meet other people and to broaden their horizon . for all that , i think you can be successful only if you take risk , if you test and try new thing ; so you can be successful only if you want or search something you do n't have yet . famous and successful people are very often ambitous and courageous people . when we take a closer look at christophe colomb , bill gates or john ford , we can see that they all had something in their personality that encourage them to test , to search , to try something unknow and rather risky . how can you have sucess if you only do what other people have already done ? how can you have success if there is no originality in your prospect and objective ? i will now tell you about a personal experience to show you have sometimes to take risk to succeed . because most of the time , the opportunity do n't come to you . but you have to create these opportunity . here is my personnal experince : towards my final year at the secondary school , i had to combine a lot of thing : i had to study for my `` baccalaureat '' , i had to take final exam in flute and piano , to obtain a certificate in music theroy at the conservatoire in besancon , and to gain my drinving license . a lot of people said i had to give up music . but i wa determined and i took the risk to continue my music and all my undertakens . this wa risky . i could have failed . but i succedeed . and therefore i wa able to find a very interessing placement in a big international company . to conclude , taking risk and trying new thing is a very important and unavoidable condition to succeed . you have to be courageous , to experiment and to look further afield to success .
