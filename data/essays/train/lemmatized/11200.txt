i absolutely agree with this statement , i think that everybody that want to be a successful person at work but also in his private life need to try always something new and take some risk . i also think that to reach some success in life somebody ha to take his responsibility , for what he think or doe , and must have the very difficult ability to learn from other people and from himself . trying new thing , mean for me a need of changing , a sensation that what 's surrounding is not big enough , but i also think that the first step for trying new thing start from the inside of everybody , such a trying new feeling . taking the risk is also very important because if anybody arrives to the success without any risk or stop it 's success doe n't mean anything . the responsibility are one of the most important part of the success , because when you take some decision for your future you must be able to face the problem that this decision will cause you , and if you can manage well your decision and your responsibility you can also fail but with a smile on your face . to reach the success i think it 's important also the ability to learn , and i do n't mean only from other people but also to learn from ourselves and from our mistake , and not to think that we already know what to do and nobody else doe because there will always be someone else that that already committed the same mistake and that can teach u something to find our solution . if we only do what we can do well we 'll never be able to follow our path but we 'll only walk around in circle .
