i disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . in my opinion , traveling alone or in an autonomous small group offer more depth and freedom to a trip . however , traveling with a group and guide also ha certain aspect that may appeal to people with different taste . traveling alone or in a small group often mean a le rigid and more flexible travel plan . you are only limited by when the plane/boat/bus arrives or leaf . everything else , from where to stay , where to dine , or what site to visit , can be arranged on the fly or changed on a whim . for example , a trip to europe originally meant to see the great castle of the middle age can easily be changed to an exciting adventure focusing on the modern night club of paris . in most tour group , the whole trip is planned out in advance , the hotel booked , the tour arranged . in my opinion , this lack of freedom mean that you are n't able to pursue what interest you most about the place you are traveling in , and instead must conform to what the tour guide chooses a `` worth seeing '' or `` interesting '' . another benefit of independent traveling is the possibility of more depth to the whole experience . as mentioned before , most tour group have to follow a rigid schedule . take the europe trip for example again ; if you were to come across a beautiful , intricate little chapel in the castle you are visiting , you could stay there for the rest of the day if you wished to , taking in the beauty of the place at leisure . on the other hand , if you were in a tour group , the only way to appreciate that beautiful chapel would probably be to sacrifice a restroom break in the hope of snapping a few extra picture . another example would be visiting a museum , if you are going with a guide and group , the experience will be limited to what the guide can show you , often no more than a rushed glance of the most famous work , and then it 's off to the next piece . however , visiting a museum alone mean that you are able to appreciate all the artwork that interest you , without the pressure to leave in time for dinner . however , it must also be acknowledged that traveling in a group with a guide can have several advantage a well . most importantly is that the tour guide is often someone familiar with the local language and custom , which can make arrangement of dining and lodging easier . most tour group agency also have deal with the local hotel and retaurants , which in turn mean cheaper deal or better quality accomodations . for someone who travel to relax , eat good food , and stay at five star hotel , it would be better to go with a group . in conclusion , i think the best way to travel is not in a group led by a guide , but rather alone or with a small group . this is because that i treasure freedom and the potential for a deeper experience more than the convenience of traveling with a group .
