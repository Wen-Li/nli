studying is a quite difficult and time-consuming task . for this reason , it is very important for student to know where is more efficient to put all their energy . one option is spend most of the time trying to memorize fact , such a number , formula or date . another aproach is trying to understend the concept which actually explain those fact . i agree with the idea that it is more relevant for studens to have a complete comprehention of the concept than just memorazing fact . also , i think that an aproach of learning based on understanding concept is more effective than an aprocah of learnig based on memorized fact . there are two main reason which support my point of view . first off all , learning concept is more enjoylable than memorizing fact . i remember when i wa studing at the university and i used to hate all kind of list . in that time , i had to take a lot of history course and it wa quite common for proffesors to give long list of date of different event . because of my study , i have memorized a lot of lit and i can say that this is not fan at all . secondly , i think that when we understand concept related with some field , we can also use this concept to understand differents area of knowlege . this is the reason whay i bealive that understanding concept is more effective than memorized fact . for example , at the same time that we are understanding concept related with the biology of the human body , we can also be understanding idea that make u able to have a comprehention of the others mammal 's biology . all in all , i can say that i am sure that conceps should be considered more relevant than fact by student . basically because there are more enjoylable to learn and represent a more effective way to get knowlege .
