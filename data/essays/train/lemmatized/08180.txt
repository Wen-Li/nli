every once in a while , we take a vacation and go travelling to different country . we want to see and experience other culture other than our own during these travel . there are two different way to do this , either through the leadership of a tour guide or to explore by yourself . i believe that traveling by yourself without a tour guide is the best way to travel . first of all , the beauty of exploring is the fact that you do not know what you will find . if you have a tour guide to tell you all the fun secret and place , then where is all the fun in that ? and often , the tour guide and the group will express their own opinion upon the place and object that you come across . which isnt all that good because it limit our insight on the culture we choose to explore . secondly , the best way the fully experience a culture , is to roam the street yourself and find out what interesting object you see or what happens on the street . if you let yourself roam the street and become part of the society , you will be able to discover and learn many thing that you will not be able to learn if you are walking with a tour guide . in addition to that , learning through experience is a lot better and more satisfying than someone telling you about it . when you get a vacation to travel , you want to get away from all the stress and authority at work . if you do not travel with a tour guide , you will be able to acheive that goal more effectively , because if you travel with a tour guide , you will still feel that someone is in charge of your life . the next time you travel , i highly suggest that you do not hire a tour guide . a tour guide really limit your travel experience to mere sightseeing . traveling alone and experienceing the culture while becoming one with it is in my opinion , the best way to travel .
