with the development of the human society , the amount of knowledge exploses . knowledge is power , but i do n't think one single person could handle too much of the power . i think that one should specialize in one specific subject , rather than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . it is not necessary to have broad knowledge . in the lifetime , it will be very very lucky do have one great contribution to a specific subject . many people are remembered by u just because they did a very good job in their specific subject . for example , nash , who major in mathematic . he master nothing but to calculate in paper and thinking about his math problem . even worse , he got nearly mad for 20 year of his life during which he could not work a a normal person . but he is well-known and remembered by u just for his contribution to the math . beside , human 's energy and time is limited . one can not spend his or her time on too many field , especially when he or she life at today the time the amount of knowledge exploses . in contrary , if somebody try to study extreamly well in many field , he will feel exausted but still can not handle them . moreover , to study in many subject may lead to a very bad result that he can not study well in any of the subject . however , i must confess that it is good the have broad knowledge if you could . knowledge in one field sometimes affect that in another field . there are indeed some people succeeded in many academic subject . the question is they are the minority and it is not realistic to expect many people could be like them . so i think it is better , and what 's more , more realistic to specialize in one subject .
