i agree with that student should understand idea more than fact . with the development of technology , more and more people pay their attention on learning knowleged . but which is a correct and effective way to learn knowledge ? some people may think that learn the fact is much better than learn from book , but actually they are totally wrong . since if you want to understand a thing , the only way is to understand the concept and idea . first of all , learning idea is a system and logical study . it is going to help people learn a thing very logically and effeciency . for example , when you face a big problem , the first thing you should do is to find out what is wrong with it and then get to know how to solve it . these process are all based on the understand of idea . to imagine that you do not even know what is the idea , how can you solve it ? obviously , the idea are more important than the face . secondly , the idea and concept can help student to see deep part of a thing . when you know the fact , you may think it is right or wrong from your point of view , but actually that 's may not true . at this time , you need to know the idea , the idea can help you to analysis the thing , and make you really understand what is that mean or how thing work , that 's really very important . a really understand is not mean you know the fact , acutally is the concept . thirdly , learning of the idea is very essential and useful . actually the idea is the main part of learning a thing , only if you understand what is the idea of it , then you can study it . for instance , when i read a book , first of all i need to know the concept of it and then i will read it and know the entire book spontaneously . so it is easy to see that an idea is very important even in our daily life . to sum of , the most improtant thing for a student to learn is the idea and concept . it will help you to understand a thing very logic and deep , more than just know the fact .
