it is definitely beneficial to have broad knowlegde of many acadamic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . there are many reason and examplpes to support this , from history of past century to the day today . having broad knowledge about many subject lead to a broader scope of developement both for the individual and for the society . it help to solve certain problem which involve complexity and interrelation of two or more subject . from the past history we can relate many person who have been successful in their work because of having a broader knowlege about other subject . for example , leonardo da vinci wa an artist , a philosopher , a scientist , an inventor and a sculptor . many of the historian believe that his painting and his sculpture had a great resemblense with the true human . and they state that this special resemblense came because of his interest in anatomy of the human body . it may be noted that science and art are two different subject . also there wa a misconception in the earlier day of development of science that few subject or propeties were independent , like mathematics and physic ; electricity and magnetism . but they were proved to be wrong . mathematics wa invented for counting and developed for it application in science . surely one would not desire to use integration , differenciation and geometry for counting . even today , the technology is being changed rapidly and many subject are becoming interrelated . for example , computing and electronics . thus it is often good to have much knowledge about many academic subject , rather than to specialize in one specific subject .
