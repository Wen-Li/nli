i completely agree with the statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' because the fact that people like to enjoy more comfort and the improment thing is that the technology is increasing enoromously in the day to day life which can make more nu . i support the statement because of the following consideration which i have taken into consideration . the first consideration is that man want to enjoy comfort and is one of my mojor consideration . it is because the bike can not support the driver in all the case , that is in the rainny seacon , winter season . and the driver want a him which could help him to take him in any atmoshperic condition . this is the first a person want to have a car . and the second reason is that it would be more safer than bike because he can keep the temperature of his car according to his will and his comfort while the person riding a bike can not do . and the other reason i would to support my statement is that the cost of the car . the cost of the car have been decrease now a day because of the growth in the technology . now a day the car maker are improving their technology so that the car would of least expenditure , so that there would be more people to by their car . if we compare the number of the car present 20 year ago and the car present now we can see that the number of car have deen increased , wide variety of car are now pr4esent in the market and also the feature the the car should have is also improved a lot . also the lowest cost of the car in these 20 year have been decreased to a major extent . so i totally support the above statement and i can say conformly that the rising technology will give the future a better car and also for the cheaper rate so that more people can enjoy the comfort .
