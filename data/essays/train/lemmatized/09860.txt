i argee with the point that young people nowadays do not give enough to helping their community . with the development of technology , more and more funny product are coming into exsitence and entering people ' daily life . so it is not surprising to find that young people would spend hour on pc game alone , instead of taking care of or talking to some old people in hospital . take computer a an example . a survey show that global computer selling is contuniously growing , and so with the demand . and some teenager do claim that computer is their best friend . with computer , they are able to chat with oversea friend , watching latest hot movie , or surfing on the internet . since the time in a day is 24 hour , which is eaqul to every one , they of course do not have more time left to help their community . by contrast , teenager in the old day did not have such kind of entertainment . therefore , it wa common for them to visit and help others ' family in their community . moreover , freedom resolution started in california of united states in the 1960s showed a wrong example to young people . instead of having a steady belief in god in mind , more and more people choose to believe nothing , which ha already proved by a report on european citizen . it is indeed correct that the nature of human being is to help each other , but having some belief will enhance your feeling to giving a hand . so lacking belief ha surely a negative impact of those young people nowadays . to sum up , i argue that too many kind of entertainment and lack of belief lead to the fact the young people are not giving enough time to helping their community . but i not saying that they are more selfish than before , rendering that there are just more aspect of life to pay attention to . in order to make some change to this situation , i would advise parent to spend more time on their child and show them some positive example .
