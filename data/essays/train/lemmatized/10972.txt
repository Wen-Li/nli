there is a saying in my language that go like : ` if only the young could know and the old could do ' . this explains an important lesson , but one ha to attain a certain degree of wisdom to understand it . in my opinion being young is more enjoyable , being older may make somebody more experienced but it would not make his life le boring . while you 're young your mind is fresh , open for idea and future is full of possibilties . excitement is more preferable than the regret which inevitably come with the old age and even feeling of fullfillment ca n't beat the hapiness you feel when you 're upon a new discovery . just remember your greatest triumph . would you feel the same after ten year passed ? nobody can deny that having an energetic , heathy body is better than being frail , dependant on medicine or on someone . you ca n't try parachute jumping if you 're past 60 . doctors would n't allow it . even the eating would n't be the same with lot of constraint . it 's always easier to meet and get on well with new people a a young person . people accept and trust each other easily . it 's simple to find common ground when you 're young . older people tend to be more rigid in their view . traits and idea begin to turn to stone . after a certain age it becomes impossible to change them . let 's face it ; people do n't get wiser when they get old . they only get old , both in mind and the body . it 's becomes harder and harder to deal with them so unfortunatly some family even consider to send them away .
