as far a different concept for education in school are concerned it 's still a great issue if learning fact or understanding idea should have the main priority . the given statement say that to understand idea is more important than to learn fact . i personally agree with this statement . these are my main point : at first fact can be read in book , thus also be looked up . in our age , when information is so easy accessible ( one could mention the internet here ) , i think the importance of remembering fact is much lower then it perhaps once wa . on the other hand it is very difficult to read idea in book because it is part of the essence of idea that one must have understood them once if he want to remember them an use them later . that lead me to my second point : facts can only hardly be remembered . i personally often had to learn a large amount of fact ; and i forgot them only a few day later . concerning idea , that is not the problem . once unterstood , ( this is truly necessary , a already mentioned ) certain idea can be remembered a long time after one had learned them . but there is another important point that ha to be mentioned . learning idea help to create own idea . once the structure of a certain idea or argumentation is understood , the student might be able to adapt those structure in his own way of thinking . in the end this is definitely one condition for maturation and responsibility . just learning fact wo n't help you to think on your own , perhaps not even to use those fact in a new situation . to put it in a nutshell , i definitey agree with the statement . thougt there are certain case in which knowing fact is quite essential , e.g. a history a a subject is concerned . i think it 's not possible to dicuss this issue argueing just for one of the mentioned concept . but refering to the thesis , just saying that it is more important to understand idea , i can agree .
