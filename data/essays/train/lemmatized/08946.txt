yes , i agree with that because that 's really happen , they try to make u buy their product by their advertisement on tv , radio , telephon and newspaper . the company are competing now who can get more customer . most of them are not true just to keep people buy their stuff , and there are many example about that when you watch tv they made a good advertisement to keep you buy their product . actually that stuff are not a good a they say , i believe that if i have a company i am not going to do an advertisement because the good product do not need an advertisement and i believe that many people think a i think . the advertisement play an important rule and it ha an influence on people and big affictes a well . you can see that when you go to mall or a big store there are many product some of then have an advertisement and they have no popular . in the other hand , many product have no advertisement but they have a good popular . as for me , i do not care about the advertisement in order to that no difference between them and sometimes i prefer to buy some product which do not have advertisement . finally , i believe that when you see the product are better in the advertisement that they really are , are cheating because they do not say the truth . however , they lie and cheat people , and i hope that they can change their way to sell the product and stop cheating people .
