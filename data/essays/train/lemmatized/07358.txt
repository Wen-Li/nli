the issue stated by the topic is whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to be specialize in one specific subject . i belive that rather than having broad knowledge about many of our academic subject it is more better to have more knowledge about the one we specialize in . i would prefer this because having a little knowledge on many academic subject doesnt lead to success in our life . so it is better to specialize in one major subject . i will prefer to specialize in one subject rather than having broad knowledge of many academic because of the following reason . the reason will be that now - a - day most of the company offering the job to the student who are more specailzed according to the requirement of the company ie. , company are more intrested in the student who are `` specializer '' . another reason which dragged me to prefer to be specialized in one specific subject is that when we are trying to have broad knowledge about all the academic subject we cant able to learn the basic in detail ie. , we are not able get the overall inforamtion about the all the subject which turn to be useless of learing all those . a famous english professor made a quote related to the above topic which say that `` we should n't be jack of all and master of none '' . this quote conveys that we are used to learn all the subject in our academic year but master of none of these subject . many famous scientist like newton , thomas alve edison doesnt had a much broader knowledge but in fact they are specialized in thier own subject which made them famous through out this world . ultimately , i feel that it would be better to be specialized in one subject rather than having knowledge about all the academic subject .
