travelling is must commun in our century . the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . travelling in a group is important for people who are visiting a new place or country for their first time . for example , when you take a vacation and decide to visit a country for your first time , it will be better to travel in a group . morever , a you you to visit many place , it will be fine in a group led by a tour guide . for instance , in los angeles , there are many people who came to visit in a group some time led by a tour guide . however , some people do not thing that the best way to travel is a group led by a tour guide . in my country ( cameroon ) , usually in our culture , people do not like to travel in a group and they do not want to be help by a guide . for example , last year , my parent decided for their vacation to travel to cap verde in south africa . there were group trip but they did not want to travel whit them because they think it 's better to find a place by yourself . thus , in my opinion , i deem that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide . because in that way you get a free guide and a chance to visit many place easily
