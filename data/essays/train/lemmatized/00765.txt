i disagree with this statement because it 's true that is necessary for student to understand better the concept and the idea showed from the theory but i think if student do n't learn fact and do n't learn the way in wich all fact are produced and could be solved , they are not well preparated for the daily life and for taking the work they are studying for . now i 'm going two show two example about my life in order to support my theory . i 'm studying business at politecnico of milan . all course that i have done during my bachelor degree and also course that i 'm making in my master of science , spend so much time for showing idea and concept and not for presenting fact . in one bachelor course called ect ( economic and technological changes ) i have studyed a lot of theory , for instance the theory of monopolio , porter 's theory about the four force that are important in the regulation of enterprice 's business , but our professor spent le time on the case , on the reality . the result of this course wa that all of the student were n't able to solve a case study and were n't able to solve a real problem . i had got the same problem also in my mos , because all the subject that we have to sustain in order to take ours master degree provide only for a teoric preparation based on concept , idea but there is a great gap related to the understanding of the fact . for instance , three day ago i have done an exam called econometrics that is statistic applyed to economics . but there were only model to write but nothing related to fact . i think that for student , learning concept and idea is very important , in fact if they do n't have a great theorical base they ca n't give brilliant solution to solve any problem . but also is important that they learn fact , the way these fact are produced and the best way to solve them .
