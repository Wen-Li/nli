communities , nowadays , need for help more than any time before , especialy from their youngmen . i think that young should prepare enough time to build up their society , otherwise , they will not go ahead . there are no doubt that young should grab their community hand to move ahead , or they will collapse infront of their eye . when you switch the page of the history , you will see many example of great nation that plunged because of the egnoreness of their young people . the greek , for example , reached at one time to a high place that no one else reached before , but it collapsed suddenly , why ??? because their young do not give their nation enough time to build and to help . young people , recently , are completely different from the young from the previous time . maybe they are differ on way of thinking or on way of acting against situation . i am not saying that they are better than them but i am pointing that the more resposible the young are , the more powerful their nation will get . once a wiseman said `` the society is for the person and the person is for the society '' ,,, what did that mean ?? it meant that when a person is fully resposible to his community and he is ready to give his soul to her , his community will be ready to him and she will rise and rise . the more powerful the country are , the more powerfull their nation are . finally , i think that what young people is saying about not having enough time to give for their nation is nonsense , because the time is always here but the will and care are not here .
