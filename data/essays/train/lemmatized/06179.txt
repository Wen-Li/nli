when you are plannig a trip you can think that it is not big deal , you can even make reservation and buy the gear necessary for your vacation , but maybe your trip will not end a well a you first tought . the hotel wa not a beuatyful a it wa in the photo you saw on the internet , the plane wa not in a really good shape , and the service wa just not worth what you paid for . publicity can be deceaving , and you can end up being a victim of it . so , why is it better to join a group to go on a trip ? first of all , everybody can share previous travel experience , discuse about the destination you are going to visit and agree to spend your free week in a safer , kinder , cheaper place . but the bad side of group traveling could show up when member of the group have very diferent opinion of what a good trip is , so argument will be right around the corner . you may have an idea of the kind of vacatios you want , and you have calculated the money you are going to spend , but they will provide you with all the service you need , and the final cost of your trip could be lower than going by yourself . a tour guide is specialized in organizing trip , is their job , they are professional in that field , and they make their living that way . a good tour guide will consider your taste to send you to the correct place , so you will be happy with the service and you will return to hire them . if we talk about security , definitly you will be safer in a tour guided travel , because they have everything planned , so you wo n't have to look for your own transportation risking your security . you wo n't have to be anxious trying to understand the road map , or trying to figure out the schedule of the train station . .. and most important , you wo n't get lost in a city that have ever been before . and if you are traveling in a group leded by a tour guide you will get the beneffits of both , wish is a more secure trip , a better service and better price , all translated in more fun and great memory .
