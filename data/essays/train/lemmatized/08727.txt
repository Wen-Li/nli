many people think the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and many do n't . both type of travelling have their advantage and their disadvantage . when you are travelling in a group , you have the advantage , that you do n't need to plan your trip exactly . you can just follow the tour guide and let him think about which place you are going to visit . like this you can see many beautiful place , which you have n't known before . the only problem you can have is , if you like to visit an other place , which the tour guide did n't plan before , you can not always do it , because you have to follow the guide 's instruction . also , when you travel with a guide , you can get information about place and building you are visiting very easily . you do n't have to read in a book and look for the intresting information . a tour guide can give you information very fast and know the intresting detail . travelling in a group , you can also meet new people , make friend and spend time together on your trip . so , you are never travelling alone . but when you travel without a guide , you can also have fun . first you should organize your trip . for some people this can already be very excited . they buy book about place where they like to go . they can choose by their own , which church , which other building and tourist attraction they want to see . and when they arrive there , they already know something about the place they are visiting . when you are travelling by your own , you can also change your plan . if you like a place you are visiting and you want to stay there for a longer time that you have planned , you can do that and you do n't need to follow the group you are travelling with . i personally prefer to travel without a tour guide . i like to plan my trip by my own and i do n't like to follow the whole time the guide and a group i possibly do n't like .
