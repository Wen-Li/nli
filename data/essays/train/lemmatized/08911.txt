advertisement ha become one of the most important business in today 's society . media are always keen on giving detail about the budget this or that company ha spent on ad , wether in the newspaper , on television , on radio . now , the question is : are most advertisement making product seem much better than they really are ? in other word , are most advertisement misleading up to the point that we , a consumer , are fooled about the actual quality of the product ? this question can not be answered in a rationnal , or scientifical manner , for the simple reason that all product would need to be tested by a panel in order to evaluate the discrepency between the conception of the product brought by the advertisement and the perceived quality . nonetheless , we can try to point out some idea based on example . the purpose of an advertisement is to make people buy the product . this trivial statement implies another triviality : the message used in the advertisement ha to be emphatic , it ha to praize the quality of the product and highlight the characteristic that make it different from it concurrents . most washing powder have no choice but to state they can wash the nastiest kind of stain you could ever find on your shirt . this is a classical example of misleading advertisement , and we all have experienced the stain that is not removed by the magic powder we saw on televison . most advertisement praizing an technical breakthrough should be considered precauciously . now with the development of new technology , and with the dramatic change the world ha witnessed in the past century , there are two main point to be made in order to nuance this too affirmative statement . considerable progress ha been made in the field of advertising . now , some ad do not even show the product they are selling . some others use humour . by using different mean of delivering the message , these ad are more likely to touch their target , and they could not even be accused of being misleading , because you were not shown the product , or not in it normal usage . it would be an advertisement for a car which is shown 2 second at the end . for example . finally , the sensibility of the consumer can not be excluded from the evaluation of the advertisement . what can seem to be emphatic to some , can look boring to others . show a group of monkey to sell a washing powder , the consumer 's response might vary to great extent . this is an actual add . advertisement will remain , one should evaluate it with it one feeling .
