it is commonly said that , even if you get old remain young at heart . this is because young enjoys every bit of life , when they are working , playing , partying or even when they are wasting their time . youth represents eneregy , flow , ability to work hard and party harder . therefore , i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . at young age , people have dream , aim , hope and ability to fulfill their dream . this encourage them continously to work hard and acheive their goal . at young age , they enjoy this hard work . while older people do it for it sake . for them , it is routine and nothing inspiring is left in doing those thing . they are just cutting the time . at the time of party , youth enjoys it even harder , a it is the outcome of their hard work . they tend to flirt , dance , drive , eat and drink . this give them an complete experience , which the old can never enjoy . being old , you can not flirt or dance , and limitation come on eating and drinking due to health problem . also , they are in continous tension , for variety of reason . this make their life boring . at young age , you have friend of various interest . this help you to take part in each and every game . you can go for rock climbing , sea diving , underwater swimming , formula racing and even to various other sporting event . but a you grow old , your stamen decrease , you are sorrounded by various illness , energy level ha decreased a lot . all this factor lead you to keep out of such sporting event . in my country , people are always thinking of other 's view and opinion . this inhibits their desire to break all the rule and become young once again . wheras young do n't give a penny to such thing . they enjoy life in full stretch . they do not care for other 's opinion and do a they want , which is also a prerequisite of enjoyment . there is also othet part of coin . young people want to live life happily , without a break . so , if something unwanted happen , they get depressed very easily . at this stage , youth require experience of older people to fight this depression . if the young learn to avoid depression and understands thats up and down are part of life they can easily come over any situation and enjoy life non stop . thus , it can be easily concluded that , if you want to enjoy life you have to become young again . it is not that older people do n't enjoy but when they enjoy we seldom say that they had return to their young age . this is enough to say that young people enjoy a lot .
