according to a recent survey conducted in the college of india , maximum number of student have mother teresa , who believed `` service to man kind is service to god '' a their role model . this very clearly show what the present day youth feel about their responsibility in helping others . the fact that student are organising public marathon like the great mumbai marathon for social cause , relief fund can serve a clear evidence to refute that statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to help their community '' . youth , infact are being creative and finding out new way of solving the problem of the community . for example , the idea of selling wrist band , which have become a style statement , worth rupee ten for twenty five and using the profit for the rehabilitaion of aids affected show the innovation and also the response with which the youth ha accepted the idea . the exposure to international culture , more awareness of the existing problem are driving the youth to think and work towards the solution . the craving for a better and enriched life for everyone is the logo of many youth union today . although , the present day requires to be more competitive at work place , study or any field in general , youth have their priority clear and they do have the schedule planned in which they have fixed time for their social work . for example , i am an undergraduate student but i have my weekend to work for the organisation cry , which is an organisation working to abolish child labour in the country . though i can not call this two day work for my society enough , but i believe this definitely is no lesser than what previous generation used to do . the present day youth is infact taking one step ahead . there are a good number of student who have taken up social activity a their full time work , a a profession not to make money but only to serve the needy . i , can strongly say that we , youth are giving our share of work for the society and will continue to do it so in future .
