it is important for the student to learn idea and concept than the fact . student should understand about idea and concept in order to develope a way of thinking . if you try to learn the fact alone you would probably miss the main point . for example , if you are a student and study on an invation of constantinopolis you should study on idea and concept in that era . if you try to learn about the detail and fact about the invation you will probably dont understand the event and the idea of invation . idea is to have an important city not to kill the people . another example is qeographical topic . if you just memorize some important information about a country without understanding people custom in that country . you will probably forget what you memorize before . if you just memorize how many square china is you will miss the most importnat part like how china became an important counrty economicly . even in health class , it is important to learn what is the reqirements an healty place for elder people . you should evaluate all the requrements with someone elder who you closely know . you shold maybe discus about one topic with her to understand he feeling about the topic . if you just list the requirement you would probably forget soon . i beleive that if you understand something deeply you should understand the idea and the message first . students should avoid to memorize the fact to have knowlage about what they are studing . otherwise they would just read the text book and understand nothing usefull for their life in future .
