today , advertisement are everywhere . we are bombed by them in almost every part of our day : while we are reading newspaper or magazine , watching at tv , listening to radio , or just walking in city , that are sometimes completely covered by them . they are so spread that we often difficulty notice them , cause we consider them a a normal part of a page , or just a pause in a tv program . so , to catch our attention , today advertisement tend to be really exagerated , sometimes even shoking . infact a society must to send u a message that is fondamental for it life : that his product or service is good , or however really better in comparison with the one made by the concurrency , and that we need absolutely it . there is no need to mention that it 's not true : mostly the product available on the market are actually on the same level , not so better or worst respect the others . therefore what we need in reality is just a really little part of what we think we need , even if , today , people have usually no awerness of that , and have the tendence to consider everything necessary : it is exactly the aim of the society who sold them all that product . thus , if a society must convince u in every way to spend our money for what they are selling to survive and develop , they wo n't consider immoral to hide some characteristic we should now , or even to state something really wrong about the product . a customer need not to trust advertisement almost ever , and to go beyond what we listen to or see to understand the really quality of the good or service . and we should alway wonder if we really need a new kind of pen , if what we are using it 's perfect for itself .
