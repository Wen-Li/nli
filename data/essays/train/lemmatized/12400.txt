i agree this statement which is more importaint for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . because if you understand idea and concept , you can use the different way ahving your knowlege more than fact . for example , right now i am taking math class . usually , every question already have the answer . you can check answer from the answerseet . however , when i wa solving some question , i could not get the answer . you might think you can check the answer from the book . even i check the answer and see the fact , i feel that i want to know the idea which how to get the answer . fact can not use different way , a i mention only know the answer which is fact is not able to use anotherway . another example is language . i am also taking chinese class . every character ha different meaning . some character ha so cunfusing line and sometimes tree for four character is mix together and becomes one word . the word chinese character of domitory ha roof , people , and hundred meaning of character . the reason why is that people live together under the oneyou just remember the word a fact , you might not care about reason . if you want to understand idea of each word , you can guess the meaning . you can guess what is character mean using your relative good or life . if you just know the fact , you can not gusee anymore .
