ecologists would say there has to be fewer car in the future , in order to protect the environment . by the way , when the peak oil will be behind u ( and that may happen quite soon ) , we will not be able to use fuel-using car any more . scientist are currently working on new car , but they may be le productive . at any rate , we would have to change every car . maybe that would be a great opportunity to think our urban transport differently . actually , with the urbanisation ( which will never stop , a the population rise ) , other way of travelling are developped , like train , underground . .. there are more and more train , that go faster and faster . because of the urbanisation , it becomes also very difficult to drive in the city : between paris and it very near suburb , you need more than one hour to go to work morning and to come back home night . people do not accept this situation any more . to let them prefer bus , the government decided to restrict some road to bus only . at the end of the day , the bus is quicker than the car in many situation . nowadays , the basic customer still prefers his car to train or bus , a he like his autonomy and freedom . but we can seriously think that he will change his mind . nevertheless , the car industry stay an important economic and research domain . countries like china , japan and india will certainly try to exploit this domain , since it is still essentially developped by western country . thus , it is highly possible that , in the next twenty year , there will be quite more car made up by these upcoming country . furthermore , we may have to consider the probem differently in the various region of the world : in america there are still some space . in developing country like african one , the problem of traffic doe not exist neither . conversely , the implantation of more car would assist the developpment of the country . to conclude , the diminution of the number of car seems to be an evidence in western country , mainly in big suburb . the reason are environmental and practical . nevertheless , some other region may still see in car a possibility of economic and basical developpment .
