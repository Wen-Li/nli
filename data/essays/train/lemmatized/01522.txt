this is quite an interesting topic to discus since i really enjoy travelling . concerning about this particular topic , i would like to say first is that different people would have different choice to make and really have fun through it , so i may not judge whether to travel in a group led by a tour guide or not is a better way or not . but to state my own experience , i would prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide . for there wa one time , my family decided to go to thailand for summer holiday , we joined a group which are people from different area of the country , we were led by a tour guide and to tell you what , that wa the most fantastic travelling experience i have ever had before , the first advantage come with guiding by the tour guide is that you do n't have to worry about the language problem , i mean , it may be fine while you are in your own country travelling , but out to another country which people speak a different language ? ahha , then you need a tour guide who can speak bilingual , you will taste the good part of it when purchasing some local souveniors , you want to buggle for a better price and find out that you could not speak even a single word . speaking about the second advantage that a tour guide provide , i should say first that my personality is that i sometimes do n't wish to concern a lot of thing when it come to travelling , i simply want to go and see the local custom , eat the local food and wander on the local street and enjoy myself . resteraunt reservation , hotel renting , car renting , contacting with the spot 's manager such kind of staff , i just think in personal are what a tour guide 's major duty , if he can handle these perfectly , then he is a good guide . last , i think this reason is obvious and undoubtedly because a tour guide know better than any of we traveller who travel there for the first time , he could show you where to eat the famous local sea food , he could tell you : `` hey , you really should take a picture here for it wa just the place some famous guy ate his breakfast .
