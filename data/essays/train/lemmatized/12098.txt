to know and how much to know , that is the question i always define my generation a based on the lyric of a brazilian pop song of the 80 which said , `` i know a little about almost everything , and almost everything i know badly '' . on my day and age , a popular teenager would have to know about a vast array of topic , ranging from boy george to the cure , not leaving aside shakespeare . of course , these are not exactly academic subject , so an academic knowledge of boy george would not be necessary , but we would have to at least have heard of him . shakespeare , however , is not only part of the academy , but also of a canon . would it be better , then , to know everything about the bard and all of his forty play , or to know a few vital fact about him and still have time to study orwell , huxley , nabokov , salinger , woolf , twain and steinbeck , not to mention le canonical author ? it 's hard to say , since there are advantage and disadvantage to each approach . one obvious con to having a broad knowledge of several subject is that this knowlegde will eventually become superficial . lack of time will make it impossible to dedicate too much attention to one subject , and it treatment might be shallow and futile . on the other hand , knowing many subject will surely enhance our conversational skill in social gathering . let 's just say that knowing macbeth superficially wo n't be enough to write a thesis on the play , but it might impress some friend at a party . it depends on the situation . although i do n't have a fixed opinion on this subject , i 'm more inclined to having broad knowledge about many topic than merely knowing one topic exhaustively . in school at least , we have to be introduced to many academic subject , for how will we know where to choose from and what interest to pursue if we only , say , know algebra ? as we go deeper and deeper into our study , however , we will inevitably have to narrow down our interest , and dedicate more time to fewer subject , even running the `` risk '' of becoming specialist . nevetheless , a much a i love shakespeare , dedicating all my academic existence to him and him only would give me the impression of missing something .
