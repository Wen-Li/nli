i think that if one understands what is behind a fact , he ha learned more that the simgle fact itself . i agree with the statement proposed , because i believe that it is more useful to understand the idea and the concept behind a fact that the fact itself . for example if a student understands the idea and the concept of a physical law , if he is able to understand what the law explains , then he will be able to explain why some fact happen and which are the realtions between them . in that way , if they migth be able to understantd than a principle is a mathematical model to discretize and represent an aspect of the life , than they will be able to appreciate different appearences af unique natural principle in the each common aspect of the life . by learning only the single fact , the student not necesserely migth to make interconnection or inference between two fact dealing with the same principle . moreover , with high propability , he migth forgot the fact after some time , whereas if he had understood the idea and the concept at the basis of the physical principle he would be able to retrive the reasoning , recognise and classify a fact into a group instead of another .
