in a highly competitive market , more and more company are finding difficult to develop new way of selling their product . one of the most effective way ha been advertising in all it layout . however , although the efficiency of advertising ha been proved over the past of the year , it ha also been a very controversial practise because it doe not always present the product a they are in reality . that is the reason that explain why thousand of customer complain about the product they buy every year . i agree with this statement becasue i believe that the bulk of ad that surround u daily doe not give u an accurately description and image of the product we are going to buy . this phenomenon happens frecuently at christmas . during these day , a lot of parent buy gift for their child and they follow what they see on advertisement either on tv or in the newspaper . however , when child open their present they are not only the one that are dissapointed , because their parent are also surprised that the product is not a they thought in the beginning . the point here is that advertisement present product in a very attractive way and they manipulate the image in order to make it appealing for potential customer . however , what happens is that the final product is not a good a it wa presented or even it ha some negative aspect that were hidden in the ad . most company outsource their advertising campaign to others highly-specialized in advertising . these one produce a creative campaign of advertising that introduces a new product or new aspect of an old one in our society . with this practice , company are achieving to sell their product pretty easy and they are obtaining huge amount of profit . this advertising trend is just focused in the short-term consequence for a company . however , in the long-term , when a company advertises it product in a different way of what they are in reality , it may be losing customer and potential customer in the future because they see that the company is not saying the truth about it product . the last consequence of this practise is that a company will lose it position in the market and then all it profitability .
