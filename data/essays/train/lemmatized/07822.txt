yes for some what reason it may be true because from one point of view young people will be strong ang will have enough stamen to enjoy by going to trip etc.also they will have no family problem to bother about . while in case of older people they cant enjoy a much a the young people did in these case . while from the other point of view older peole who got retired will enjoy more than the young peole by passing their time with small kid . in which the young are busy with ther work and will have no time to do this . also the reaon may change from one place to another because in western country like uk , france etc.the way old people used to enjoy ther life is different from those old people who are living in eastern country . also the young people in north america the young star will always look to enjoy , ofcourse there majority of people doing this . while in eastern country most of the young star are looking to get be in the higher position rather than to enjoy . also young people will have more problem and tension than older people . in developing country the most of the older people facing more risk than the younger people . but in developed country they also enjoying with grandsson and grand dauthers . from the above information it could be concluded that it is difficuld to say whether young people enjoy life more than older people do . it may change from one place to another and also by the way the people likely to behave .
