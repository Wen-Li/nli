in some community , society have main project of helping others by having help center and certain committee to focus on specific need of the society and try to offer the required help in that field using young people a employee or volunteer . but those young people do n't have to be part of those establishment to help their community . they could do this by helping themselves first in educating themselves and having energy to fulfill their goal which take them to helping their community also indirectly . but these day young people do n't have enough time to do that . reasons are because they are engaged in other stuff which keep them busy not to help . unfortunately most young people do think that the end of their studying journey is to get a job and in turn to earn money . even if they would not just go for this process a minority may consider theft and turn into criminal only because of their lust for money . some young people are engaed so much in their job to an extent that they would not find time for their family . on the other hand , some are really having a job only because it is a must have thing which should be accomplished may be under pressure of family and every morning they drag their foot into work forcefully . may be if they had an option they would have been quitting job and staying at home amusing themselves and having pleasure . if young people out there thought right , considering their job , they would have alot to get in advantage to themselves , their family and community .
