will there be fewer car in use than there are today ? i agree so insofar a with the rapidly development of new technology which could reshape the way people live the life and people communicate with each other . however , in thougfull consideration , i think that there will increase more car than there are today concerning with the increasing wealth of individuls and the seperation between working area and living area . admittedly , with the complete development of public transportation system such a the development of underground transportation , the system will obtain larger capacity , which would be a replacement to the use of car . however , according to statistically survey , there is also increase in population . on the other hand , the development of internet will reshape the way people communicate with each other , which mean that people have not have to commuincate wiht each other through public transportation , however , it doe not mean that people will replace traditional way of communicating . some important conference must be held face - to-face . futhermore , i agree with the statement that there will be a increase in car due to the increasing wealth of individuls . it is human natural to enjoy the achievement of wealth , so , in this case , people will intend to buy some staff such a car to encourage themselves . the second reason why i think that car will be increase is involved in the seperation between the working area and living area . assuming the case that you live in a town nearby the city and there is no other transportation tool like subway or bus . you have to buy an car in order to arrive the place you work on time . in conclusion , i think that with developement of new technology , it will allievate the pressure on trasportation , however , car will continue to increase becasue of the spout of population , increase in wealth and the seperation between working area and living area
