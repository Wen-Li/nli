the first thing that come into the mind is that people are simply unconscious about the topic of pollution and environmental problem . what they really care is their comfort . everybody want to live in comfort , isnt it ? but they dont think about how much time their comfort will last . the answer should not say a long period of time because it is this comfort that will end the life on earth . everyday , the population of earth increase with acceleration , so , proportional to the number of peaople we can say that the number of car will certainly increase . if we are to think of ay decrease in this number , we should considers about people consciousness a individulas and government regulation . first of all , the car release outside , to the air , very hazardous gas which cause to ozon depletion . the people outside dont really know what the ozon deplation is . moreover , the old car that are not used anymore are themselves are the cause of the pollution becouse , the huge metal waste is also thrown into the earth . so , at this point , scintists have the real job . they should make both the individual and the government beware of this dangerous issue . secondly , there is also a conflict here that increase in the number of car make themselves useless ! there is a lot of traffic in big city already and this will increase day by day . at the end all the car will be totally useless . it will be that time that people will begin to think about using bus and railway . but , i dont think this will happen in a couple of decade . finally , with the advance in technology , there may be flying object that can supply the transport in the city so that people will no longer need the car . but for this technology to be reached , maybe it will take a whole century . to sum up , i think in the next two decade there will bw even more increase in the number of car simply because of the incresase in human population . it will take much more time for people become conscious about environmental problem . but in the end nature will adjust itself
