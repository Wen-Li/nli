as far a i am concerned , i am not agree with the statement at all that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are many reason that i do not like the group led travel , and i will just explore the most important one here . the first reason i want to bring forward is that travel in a group led by a tour guide is so limited , not only the space but also the time . usually , the trace of this kind of travel ha been planed before the travel begin . so you just take a limited glance at some place you want to visit , which just decided by the tour guide . there are always more place that will atractive your eye beyond the tour guide 's thought . another aspcct is about the time . it seems unwise not the follow the tour guide a near a possible , or you will fall behind . because the time of the travel depond on the tour guide instead of you . another reason , which is also commonly considered , is that the travel in agroup led by a tour guide is always in the holiday . for some aspect , it is not bad . however , travel in the holiday will cause many problem . it is obviously that the tour place are rather crowed during the holiday . if you want to take the group led travel , you just can avoid the unpleasant situation . what is more , a a result of the rush of the holiday travel , many accident are easily to take place . in addition , travel in a group led by a tour guide is not a good idea for family travel . in the modern society , people pay more attention to the time spent with family menbers . if you choose to travel with your family indepedently , you will find it is much easier to enjoy the life along with the travel . for the reason above , it is surely that i will travel without the tour guide . it is just realize the mean of the travel ---- for fun and pleasure .
