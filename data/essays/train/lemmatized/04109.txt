everytime , when we turn on tv or open megazines , there are always advertisement there . in order to catch customer 's eye , the seller do spend a lot of money to make their product looking better and even to give customors the wrong impression . first , the most common advertisement give people wrong impression is food advertisement . for example , the burger king 's hamburger are always bigger on tv and smaller in the store . this is really disappointing thing when i decide to get a super big hamburger . moreover , we never see hamburger advertisement tell customer exact how big a burger is . we never see a store say that we will see you a 5 x5x5 cm3 big hamburger . thus , we all come happily with a hope to get a super big burger , but leave disappointedly . second , the drug advertisement always try their best to delivery population a image of how fast and effect their medication , but lack of inforamtion regard to side effect . a very good example is the great drug , viagra . when viagra just came up the market , the drug company never mentioned that patient with coronary artery disease can not take this medcation . the consequence of not telling the fully information wa to put people in danger . later , durg company added the addition information when it adversed viagra . however , the strong image of rescure men 's sex life is far greater than the image of dying from heart attack when patient with coronary artery disease take the comnication of viagra and their cardiac medication . thus , drug advertisement always tend to lead the poluation to ignore the side effect . in summery , since we can not avoid not to see these advertisement , we should have our own knowledage to make a decision how good a product really is and try to gain all information we need before taking a new medication .
