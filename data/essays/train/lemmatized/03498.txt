nowadays young generation are involved in a lot of activity , which absorb all their energy . these activity can range from something related to their study , to something completely different a sport . all of them , however , are really demanding , and , therefore , they have to choose what to do . besides that , nowadays all young people like me are more interested in themselves , and in what they have to do in order to increase the number of skill they have , rather than in what other people are doing . this is also related to our society which is becoming more and more individualistic . all these thing lead the young generation not to take care of the need of other people , and , therefore , not to help them . this is what i experienced few day ago . i wa walking with some friend of mine in one of the main street in the city center of frankfurt , and , all of a sudden , a poor joung guy came to u asking for money . he stated he wa very poor a his father lost his job , and , therefore , his family did not even have the money to buy some food . i felt very sad and i tried to give him some money . i am not rich , but when it come to help someone , who is le lucky than me , i usually try to do it . on the contrary , the other young people who were with me did not even look at him and just passed by . they did not even took care . it wa unbeliavable . they told me that , a they are working hard every day and have to face a lot of problem at work , they do not see the point in helping someone who is not trying , a they do , to work hard and improve their life . this is only a small example , but i personally believe that nowadays we have no time and aver all we are not anymore , a in the past , willing to help one another . this can also be seen in the decreasing number of young people who do not anymore take part in social activity within their community .
