i do not agree with the statement , that in twenty year fewer car are in use than there are today . my opinion can be supported by the following fact . first of all the use of car at high number is restricted to the so called `` first '' world meaning mostly europe and the america . in many area around the world where we do have a high number of people living , like africa , india or like in china the use of car is limited to a small amount of the poulation only . we already can see here first sign pointing in that direction looking at the growing infrastructure in china and india dealing already now the furture expansion in the number of car . when these country do further follow the path of modernization we will have in twenty year a much higher number of people being able to purchase and drive a car . and even in the `` first '' world we do observe a trend to a further individualization being seen for example that people move out of city more in rural area . and in addition to huge country like usa or brasil where people have travel rather long distance to go shopping or to go to a hospital , having a car is even more important . so we have here on the one hand a real need for a car for covering distance and on the other hand the personal wish to be independant and individual by having an own car . based on the fact desctribed above we will have globally an increase of the number of car due to the modernization of major part of the world and due to the individualization of other part of the world . and both reason do require car either for just transportation or for fullfilling personal thinking .
