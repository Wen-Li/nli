i think that fooling the consumer , who is the one that buy your product , is like auto hurting yourself a by doing this you only lose more customer every day . if we look at modern day society we can notice how we usually get bored of something or someone very easily . from wedding that last one day , to event that the day before are hyped and the day after they take place they are forgotten , we usually change our mind more then one time a day . and this caused the increasing amount of mis-leading ad a the modern day society demand for high quality product at a low price . this is why i think a product that ha been launched onto the market must yes be advertised , but with a moderate dose and in a truthful and candid way . it is in human nature in fact to want something badly but once you have it to throw it away a after one day we are bored of it and disappointed by it . in other word : `` the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence '' . also it very hard to regain the confidence and trust of a person after losing it the first time . if a product is too hyped , too publicized and too much talked about , yes it will sell good on the first day , but soon after the consumer will realize that after all what they have been waiting for a long time and thought it wa perfect turn out a bad product full of flaw . in fact we tend to be more critical and analyze a product more accuratly the more we anticipated for it to arrive . this disappointment , that trust me , will be shared by many others will cause a series of complains on the internet or between friend , that will warn you that that certain hyped product is not a good a it is and will cause in other people a sense of afraidness of spending a fair amount of money on a product that will surely disappoint them . this is why i think a product should be mderatly pubblicized and when it is , describe what the product can actually do instead of filling a commercial or an ad full of asterisk listing the exception or the particular need that the product must match in order to operate a the ad say so . again by representing the average customer , in my humble opinion , i think company should start commercializing their ad in a realistic way and stop promising thing that do not even come close to the product 's capability . thus if company actually advertise a product correctly then they would have a bigger success than advertising it in a mis-leading way , making a fool of the customer , who at the end , is the one that buy the product .
