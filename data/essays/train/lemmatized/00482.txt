i agreee this statement . first of all , considered with the physical aspect , young people have more energy than older people have . this is simple difference . the biggest difference between young people and older people is experience . this experience is the most impotant element for enjoy life . older people experience the life process for example , school , graduation , work , marriage , to have child and so on . needless to say yound people have not exprienced such kind of life experience . therefore every single thing towards them are completely new for young people . they are very exsited to be expericed them . the first time to experence something is always fun . however once people experienced something . this something never be the first experience . to get to be familar with new thing make u to remove the feeling of fun . by using another word , older people are surrounded by the thing which they had already experienced . in this circumsatnce it is difficult to find out any passion and new feeling . it is just normal for older people .
