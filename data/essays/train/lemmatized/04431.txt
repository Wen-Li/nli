knowledge is the base of what we have . it is the thing that remain with u all over the year . knowledge is what make a person special from others . some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many acadimic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . this broad knowledge can help you anytime and you will not have to depend on others in every single thing out of your specialize subject and it will make you a well-known person who ha an experience in everything you want to learn about . others think that being specialize in one specific subject is better than have board knowledge because it can help to be better in your subject . it allow you to be the best and the person who can depend on in that subject . i agree with people who think it is better to have broad knowledge and i prefer to have it rather than a person with a limit knowledge . for examble , when two person go to a company and ask for a job one with a board knowledge and the other whith a limit knowledge i think they will choose the first person because he can be more helpfull . i am a person who believe in benig special in all the subject you love so i will agree with the first arguement for sure .
