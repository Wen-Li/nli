taking risk and getting into the job you do n't have an idea about , make people frighten all the time . we get affraid from loosing our money , our respect or sometimes loosing the people we love and care . i think we have to ask a question to ourselves here , do we really loose these thing when we fail . this can be answered positively . like yes maybe we can loose money but on the other side if you dont try you loose the chance of learning if you could earn much more money . lets take bill gates and his supporter a an example . for such a thing which nobody belived in , they spended their energy , time and money and they took the risk . what did the risk of loosing money bring to them is the richness of the world . there is an other subject we 'd be afraid to loose when we fail to success in the new job we 're trying , is our respect in others mind . in my point of view there is nothing to be concerned about this subject because while some people think you are a looser because you failed , some may admire you and the courage you have showed by risking your commodity . since you can not be the most regardable person in everyone 's mind you do n't really have to pay attention for this subject . since we all have people whom we love , care and hold special in our heart we of course may not desire to get close of loosing them . if we really ask ourselves the reason we keep these people special in our life , we will infere that these people are always behind u and supporting u even if we success or fail . they are always beside u to take our hand for helping u to stand up . as a result i can easily say that living in a routin manner life would be very boring and there is no reason for u to stay away from from risk because without taking any risk one can not learn to do what he do n't know to do ,
