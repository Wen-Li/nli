i think to have broad knowledge of many academic subject is good for people than to specialize in one specific subjuct . if someone only study about mathematics , he or she ca n't make a life more variously and miss many useful information for survive . i would present two specific reason to support my idea . first , a person who study only one subject ca n't sustain their life well . people are social being so they have to learn about many thing to survive . for example , if a professor of the history learn about history he or she could be poor because lackness of economic knowledge . my major is history , so i always see my professor who studying their own intrest . however , they are not good at financial techquinics , so they to miss much money that they could earn . if they could earn much more money than now , they can concentrate on their subject a they do n't worry about thier financial problem . secondly , one subject is related with other subject densely . if you want to study history you have to learn other language , literature , philosophis and so on . when i read a book about roman history , i also need to study about their literature and philosophy . in addition , i have to learn about other language if i want to read material from other country . it only allow me to understand specific factor accurately . to conclude , i think to study board knowledge of many academic becaus of it useful facor to survive and helpful factor to study your own interest subject .
