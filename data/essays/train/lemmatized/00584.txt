nowadays there is a contoversial between using your own car or using public transport . this is a consequence of the environment destruction and the contamination of the earth causing by numerous action that human make . today there are a lot of organaizations that are very concerned about the pollution and the damaged of the environment . they are trying to find a solution to diminishing this important problem . these organaizations try to encouraged people to try to not contaminate a lot and to use healthy way for not damaging the envionmet . one of the problem is using your own car our using a public transport . in my opinion i agree with the statement because i think that in a few year there wouldnt be a much car a now because other confortable and faster way of transport will be used , a for example the plane that it at this moment one of the best way of transport or another possibility is using car that work with solar energy or with water contribuiting with the environmet . on the other hand the car is the most common way of travelling of most of the people . people us their car a lot becuase is the most cheapest transport and you can use it wherever you want . also the car is very comfortable . the problem of this is that people should try to be concerned about the advantage or disadvantage of using the car or another transport . as far a i 'm concerned numerous scientist are investigating new method and way of travelling . scientist have made prediction about the future saying that by a certain period of time there will be fewer car and instead of using gasoline in the car use another alternative way . as a matter of a conclusion , in the future there will be fewer car because people will try to travell in a fastest and confortable way than in a car and also be concerning about helping and not contaminating the environment .
