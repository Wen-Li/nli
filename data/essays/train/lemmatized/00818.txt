i would agree the observation that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide if i have to select either `` agree or disagere '' . the reason why i can not clrearly express my observation is that it depends on the situation such a the country or the length of the stay . though many young people may also think the free travel better , i prefer to travel freely if possible since i do not have to care about a tour member regarding a meal , appointment time or place to go and i can go everywhere i would like to go . in this regard , if the tour member wa consist of only my freinds , it did not matter . however , when i travel in a county where i can not communicate with local people by myself due to language reason , i am relieved to accompany with a tour guide . in addition , if the length of the time to stay in a country is limited , i think that it is beneficial for me to be guided by a tour guide to know the location or way to stay rather than to struggle to know it by myself . of course , i can get these merit by hiring my personal guide . but , from my experience , it is difficult to find a good personal guide a well a expensive compared with a tour guide . due to the above reason , the best way to travel for me is to do in a group with a tour guide in the first day of the trip and after that , i would like to travel freely without care about other tour member . also if i have to select either travel in a group or alone , i will take travel in a group led by a tour guide .
