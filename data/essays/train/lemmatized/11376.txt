in my openion young people enjoy life more than older people do for several reason . i do agree with the statment because i have experienced life and i have seen it . first , young people , child and kid do n't have any wories about any thing . they do n't think of bill to pay or rent or what to eat or drink . their mind are full of imagination for their little world . for example , they have wild way of dressing up , like a prinsess or a solder . they have a wild way of drawing , they draw their family not the best way or in a professinal way but in a way that make them feel happy and satisfied . another reason is , they like to have fun and be happy in all situation . all they think of play , play play . they can all day long if you leave them with toy and friend . when they fight they do n't talk to each other for a minute or tow but after that they plat together like nothing happened . adultes however , do n't talk to the person that they are mad at for day , monther , and even year . for example , my sister got into a fight with her best friend and did not speak to her friend for a very log time . this caused their relationship to be broken untile this very day . finally , young people have young mind that are open to new thing and new idea and learning . kids learn faster than an audalts can . this show how they enjoy life and use it to make them happy almos in every situation of their life . in conclution , i believe that young people can and are enjoyiny life more than older people can . you can see that through the exampels that i have described in this essay and also through experience of life . i did not live my childhood life bacuse of many reason that i will not discus but i have learned to enjoy my life because i live it like a kid .
