i disagree with the following statement . i think that there will be more car then it us to be in twenty year for the following reason . first , i believe that developing country and city will get an increasing of their car in a few year . for instance , prospection of mexico or sao paolo demonstrates that the traffic will get bigger and intense in a few year . more people are goin in my opinion , car tend to be a symbol and will still be a symbol of wealthy and success people . second , even if oil price are getting up and oil reserve are diminishing , people will never stop using their car . for example , in the united-states people can not live without car because public transport have not been developed adquately by the government . it is necessary for a middle class familly to posse one or two car and they used it on a daily base . third , even if oil reserve are being reduced , scientist try already to find some alternativ to petrole . in fact bio-carburant will be prehaps the new carburant for our car . now , new kind of carburants that are made of bee or others cropswill interest car concessioner . finally , i think that if we do not find any alternative to move from one city to another , car will still be used a lot even in twenty year .
