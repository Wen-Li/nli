`` young people enjoy life more than older people do. '' , is that kind of phrase one can often hear in modern , western country , where enjoyment seems to be one of life biggest goal . wheather this is true or not it will all come down to the point of defining and measuring `` joy '' . but let me approach this matter step by step . it might seem natural and obvious to believe in this simple sentence because of the physical and mental ability of young people . they are healthy , strong , flexible and abitious to conquer the world , make invention , found family and many more important faktors of life . but is this really a joy any time ? they are often fight their hectic and fast environment and get quickly older , visible in burnouts , psychological problem , affection for drug usage and crime . i would agree that young people have an higher interest in their environment in general , but it doe not say if this interest to create , explain and dominate is joyous or a need , meybee genetically predetermined . how about older people ? when we hear this we might think of those tied into bed , unable to eat and care for themselves . but if you think twice you can find a lot of older people , who are happy with a slower live . my grandparent still travel more foreign country a year i could even afford . others write book and give their experience to the younger generation . we should not be mislead by the idea of `` maximizing joy '' in term of spending more money , doing more extrem activity and so on is always desireable . to summarize it i might be allowed to refence to kant , a german philosopher . more than 200 year ago he wrote , it is never possible to define a overwhelming good wich account for everybody but everybody shall have the right within certain border to find his own satisfaction ( quoted rater freely ) . therefore i am tempted to say this question is to be answered indivually . of course we can discus it , but the answears tranferred into real politics will quickly show very unpleasing result i assume .
