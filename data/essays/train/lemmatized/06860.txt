being successful in life is something that we all desire , unluckily only a few one will manage to get it . personally , i think that success depends on many thing and not only on taking risk because if you want to be the number one on something , you need to be born with certain skill , give the best of you and to make an important sacrifice . some people may agree in saying that being succesful mean to break the rule , however you can not break any rule if you do not know how rule work first . i mean , if you want to be the best at playing soccer , you need to know that there are certain rule that you are suppose to follow , like team work , solidarity , understanding your mate etc . in this case , to think that you will become the best football player in the world by doing whatever you want and not paying any attention at all to any recomendation is absolutely nonsense . obviously , when you behave like this , you are taking a risk , but that risk is ridiculous and naive . i wholeheartedly believe that if you ever dream of being a successfull man , sometimes you will have to take a risky step , but that step can not be taken without having the previous knowledge about something or withouth being fully aware of the consequence . the fact that we live in a society that everyday demand more and more , make u think that if we do not gain sucess we are nothing . nevertheless , success is not a matter of being the best at something , but being the best in all these small thing that we do in our everyday life . to conclude , if you want to be successful take risk , but do not let this risk destroy your whole life .
