i do n't agree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than loder people do . '' . as a senior citizen , old people have already finished their duty to their family and the socioal , so they do n't have many thing to involotion them . they can spend much time to travelling and to see their old friend who are also senior citizen , sometimes they can even walk for a whole day to enjoy the sunline and flesh air . at home old people are always no.1 . some people say that old people have not much time to enjoy themselves , but i do n't think so , a they have no work to do , they seem to have more time to enjoy life , on the other hand , how many young people really have time to realx themselves , a in the school they have countless homework to do , and countless word to hear from teacher and parent . to the young worker , you can never realx yourself a you must work hard a you have to affect your family and your parent . many people say that old people ca n't catch up with the society , something like music and game which is so atracted to u . but what will i say is that a them are n't interested in these thing they miss nothing . they have many thing to every day a these thing are what they think are interesting . and a a old people who have enough experience they always do many thing in a more quickly and easier than the young people . and old people always have enough thing to think a we need to spend a life to get .
