the above statement that is `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' it is not right . i disagree with this statement . many of the old people enjoy with thier life than youngers . in the oldage the people have leave all the burden and they are spending their own interested work . infact younger have more responsibility and work in that age , sometimes they ca n't enjoy because they dont want to loose their official work . forexample , long toor we want to go , in that time spending fifteen day of time for that , that is not sufficiant for all the youngers . some of them are missing for thier own impertent thing but old people are spending maximum time to that toor . not only toors but also in daily thing . moreover , old people enjoy with childrens and playing with them . they can act like a child like playing criket , chess etc. they can enjoy thier own way . old people work in their young age and then taking the rest in this old age with their interesting activity and ability . i conclude that , older people also enjoy . enjoyable thing and way are different but they can also enjoy . not young people enjoy life more than older people . young people and old people can enjoy themselves in thier own way , style and adjustment .
