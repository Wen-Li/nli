when compared to the past in modern society people are so selfish which mean they are ignoring their reponsibilities for their community such a helping . that can exactly be true when young people are considered . since they are going to be the adult of the future . why do not they give enough time to their responsibility to the community ? it can be discussed in two different aspect . firstly , they do not have enough time to give . because they donot organize their time according to their duty for the community . they spend all their time to their professional work or entertainment . first they are giving much more their attention to their other work especially to their professional work . for example a teenager spends most of his time in school and a young adult in his office . furthermore they spend their time also on entertainment . since entertainment issue take their attetion much more then helping their community . and entertainment make happy them much more then helping community . secondly , they are ignoring their duty because they think that somebody can do that for them . firstly their parent doe also their duty for community and they get accustomed to this situation . secondly , they think that they can not make it by their own and they are not capable of successing in their duty . to illustrate , in some social problem that require their help , a an individual they think it is impossible to handle . on the other hand , these reason suit their way of life . in modern society , people live a an individual not a an community so ignoring duty for community make much sense for them . to conclude , young people are ignoring their responsibility such a helping their community because of their not equally organized life style and their way of life . it can be inferred that young people do not give enough time to help their community .
