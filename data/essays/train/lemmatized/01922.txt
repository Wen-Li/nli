the issue at hand is that the youngster of the present age do n't devote enough time for helping their community . this issue is of significant importance because it question our ability to carry forward our ancient tradition to the younger generation . i personally agree with the above argument . there are many reason for which i agree to the statement . first , the youngster nowadays hardly get time to spend in helping their community . this is mainly because they are most of the time involved in academic or even over burdened by them . they have hardly any time to help their community , let alone relax . they are overburdened with assignment and test in their course most of the time . being an undergraduate , i hardly find any time for other activity due to my busy academic schedule . secondly , the youngster today are le inclined towards the propogation of their community culture . this is mainly because of the various factor , the main reason being the lack of interest on part of the parent . it is the parent ' duty to instill the feeling of belongingness towards their own community and culture . this can be attributed to the fact that the parent are also occupied with their work and hardly find time to spend with their child . the parent should also encourage child to participate in cultural event . however , the parent rarely show interest in such issue . another reason for this could be that the interaction and regular meeting between community have declined gradually . this can be attributed to the increased amount of migration of people to distant urban place in search of greener pasture . the long distance also provides hindrance to the regular meeting of the community . after my family migrated to the city , we could not find time to regularly meet our relative since the city wa far away from our village . in conclusion , i feel that all the above factor have eventually led to the lack of time for the youngster in helping their community
