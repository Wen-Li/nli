everyone in his life look for a prosperous future and like to get a job where he can apply his academic study and experiemtal skill . and to find this job he must be very good in his major . but the student must not concentrate only on the subject that are important for his major . so , it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to speialize in one specific subject . my friend studied engineering in the university , he is very good in his major and he know every thing about it . he graduated from the university with very high grade . now he is working in a big company . but the big problem with this friend is that he is unsociable . the reason for this loneliness is that he know nothing except his major . he can not talk about other subject like litereture , politics , or music . so , inorder for the student to be more sociable and to take more experiencies in life , he must have knowlege about any field . the student in the university must take course in the university that are not related to his major . for example , if the student 's major is physic , he should take musical course or philosiphical course in order to make his knowledge not restricted only in physic . so , he can make conversation with his friend about music and art . and if he set in a society and talk with older people who have more experience in life than him , he will look very intellectual . he benifets from that by having more friend and by making relation with big number of people . many people think that the student must focus in one subject that will reflect his future and his career , but i think it is better for a student to have knowledge about a variety of topic . throughout my education i took many course like music and art andi find it benefit .
