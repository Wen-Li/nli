you can find advertisement everywhere : in newspaper , in the cinema , at bus station and even on the toilet paper . so they defenitely influence u a lot . often we just buy a new product because the man in the newspaper had such a nice smile . it 's the question if you really get what they are pretending . i think there are a lot of product which are in fact not a useful or of the quality the commercial let them look like . there exists for example a tv-spot where a handsome girl watch a big screen with an ice-cream on it and while watching it dissapears and suddenly sit 's on an tropic island . of course this is not possible in reality but it should show , that together with the ice-cream you buy some tropical feeling . advertisements always are used to express some special needings to the person who whatches them . and a lot of study show that most of the people are easily to impress , especially with picture or video . from my point of view this is a dangerous fact , because advertisement often promise thing which a person doe n't just get because of buying the product . for example the commercial for smoker . there are always shown a group of modern and happy people , sitting togther , relaxing and of course smoking . so a young boy might think that if he buy 's those cigarette he will get a lot of new friend and self-confidence . but in reality it 's not that easily . in addition to that , only company with a great amount of money are able to start commercial . they will be shown everywhere and a lot of people will buy their product just because of that and not because of thinking it trough if it ha got the best quality or the best price . so i think it 's possible to produce le good product but at the same time sell lot of them just because of a wide range of advertisement . all in all , from my point of view , advertisement often pretend to give a certain use to the person that buy the product , but in the end it 's often just wishful-thinking .
