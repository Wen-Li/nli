i think that this statement can not be considered probable for several different reason . i guess the most important one is that there are many not western country ( a china ) , where the presence of car is actually not comparable with the one in the western country , which are fastly growing and whose request of car for inabithant is growing in the same proportion , that make the requestes for new car to improve really fastly , and this is not a short term event . the second reason is that to have a car is still an extremly important stutus symbol , which would be hardly dismissed by a large part of the population . to have a car , expecially a fast and expensive one , is a central way to subline the own social position , and i do not find any reason which suggest that it would change in the next twenty year . third , there is a general financial problem in the balance of the majority of the state of the world . this condition take away source from the investiments , also from the innovation and the development of the pubblic transport ( with the exception of some big city ) . this fact obliges many people to use a car , which mean to have a car , even if they would prefer not to use it . honestly i do not think that in the next twenty year there will be found new source to make the car not to be necessary . the last point is that the car industry is still one of the central industry of the world . its crisis would mean a strong crisis of the global economy , and twenty year are not enough to transform a strategical section of the economy in another one : it is improbable that in twenty year the car industry can convert is production toward other kind of good whithout a strong social impact . this is even the reason why the car production is so protected by the national institution in so many different country .
