i am to give my opinion on which is the most important thing for a student between undersanding idea and learning fact . first of all it is self evident that those thing are both essencial in a student education . anyway , a far a i am concerned , i think that understanding idea will help more a student in his future life . indeed , an idea can be usefull in much more area than a fact and moreover , a student have to understand idea in order to understand more deeply the impact and the meaning of fact . a student that have perfectly understood some concept is supposed to be able to use them to interpret the fact . moreover some concept or idea are so important for our society and the way it is functionning that noone can be part of the society without knowing them because the fact are most of the time based on the idea . for example to understand war in general , only event wo n't give you a proper opinion but understanding the basement of it , for instance the concept of the quest for power , will certainly help you . but on the other hand , being totally disconected with the reallity is not a good point , and a whole theorical learning is n't a good thing for a student because he must be able to use his learning in the real life , and knowing fact would help him to identify different situation and understand them better . indeed , some concept , like the concept of democracy can not be proprely understood without the hisorical background of it and it application in everyday life . furthermore , some historical fact are so essencial in our society that we can not , for instance , understand the current news , without knowing them . so a perfect learning is supposed to make sudents learn both concept and fact , in order to be ready for their future life , thanks to a complete leraning , that we are in fact
