having broad knowledge of many subject doe not lead to a good future . whereas specializing in a particular subject in more beneficial nowadays . i completely disagree to the statement that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many acedemic subjets than to specialise in one specific subject . '' nowadays there is demand for professinals , who know their job very well and can handle any task in a particular field . people who have broad knowledge about many academic subject , do not actually know what field they really want to master in and so they have knowledge about many subject . it is very well said `` a jack of all trade is a master of none . '' so this implies that to be a master or to actually achieve what you desire you need to be pragmatic and should know what is neccesary for you to achieve what you desier for yourself . i have even seen many people who have degree in many field but still do not have what they want for themselves . for example , one of my friend 's elder brother ha many degree in different field and ha alot of knowedge about many different academic subject , but he still doe not have an aim or a particular direction to move in . whereas one of my cousin had a master degree in computer , which wa his favorite subject from his school day and then got a proper job with proper status and a respectful social life . it is not bad to have vast knowledge , but having vast vast knowledge in many different field , stop you from being interested in a particular field . it is not only that having vast knowledge is important what is more important is to be more smarter and choos a specific field to major in . thus i would say that specialising in a particular subject is more beneficial than having fast knowledge of various subject . as , now you are wanted to be more knowledgeable about your subject , then it doe not matter how much you know about other subject .
