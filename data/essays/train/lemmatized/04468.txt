many people say that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . personally , i firmly disagree with the state that there will be fewer car in the future . i have two main reason to support my position . to begin with , i believe that there will be more population in the world in twenty year . it is no doubt that there will be more car at that time since car is the main transportation . to cite the first example , people need car especially the of developing country . it is the truth that the public transportation is more unconvenient than the developed country . unfortunatelly , the developing country often ha fast-growing population . consequently , the only thing they can do is to buy a car . in addition , i think that car is a tool we use to judge a man . car is not only a product , it is the symbol of the property , to cite the seconde example , we usually compare our car with other 's . i had seen many young people who want buy a new car even though they do n't have enough money , besides , the advertisement also help u regarde car a an symbol of future . considering the above reason , while there are many people think that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today , i choose to differ . i firmly believe that car will be more important in the future .
