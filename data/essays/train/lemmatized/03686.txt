i completely agrees with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide . in today 's world where advancement are taking place in every field , tourism industry is also marching ahead with great speed . now you can easily get the group package at cheap price with a tour guide who will show you all the famous place and will take care of your food and luggage while on tour . travelling in a group provides you the advantage of guide 's experience and group security , provide you cheap package and lot of fun than travelling alone or with family . while travelling in a group led by guide , you can benefit from the guide 's experience because he can guide you which place are the best to go . he can tell you about some famous temple , church and beach etc. , while travelling alone you may miss these thing . another advantage of group travelling is the security , there will be no fear of getting lost or attacked by somebody at outside place because there will always be somebody with you to help you . travelling in a group is cheaper too , because you can easily bargain with travelling agency over the ticket fare , hotel charge etc. because travelling agency will always prefer the group travel . on the other hand , if you are travelling alone you have no option and buy the ticket at higher price , and pay more for hotel room . travelling in a group mean lot of fun . you can never get bored while travelling in group , because you can crack joke , play card , and can have singing competition too . while if you are alone you will be devoid of all this fun . while travelling alone ha it own advantage of privacy and being with the family but i will still prefer travelling in group . i think group travel can convert a good trip into great one .
