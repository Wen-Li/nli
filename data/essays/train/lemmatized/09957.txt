for a long a i can remember , quite a few people have been debating on whether having a wide range of knowledge of many academic subject is desirable or not . regarding this point , some people seem to go for the knowledge of many academic subject because they think that broad knowledge enriches our life . however , i strongly believe that specializing in one specific subject is better since knowing of many field is not easy and one specific knowledge allows people to plan to career . to begin with , it is normally difficult to have broad knowlege in many field . in other word , learning and acquiring a vast amount of knowlege is arduous thing . for example , i had a hard time remembering all of content on the final exam during college life . i needed to put all of my effort and energy in order to study many subject , not to mention my major . many academic subject rather made me disorganized and felt hectic . it wa really pointless and not efficient . i took the exam , not understanding all part of subject because of the lack of time . after all , i got a low grade in my major subject a well a other academic subject . this case clearly show that culturing a huge range range of academic subject is not helpful . in addition , speciliaing in one specific subject is conducive to planning one 's career in the future . in modern society , it is the most important to understand and know well in one 's specifized area . this is mainly because , the company set a standard in the way they recruit employeers who have superior ability in their field . therefore , every person is required to have exceptional capability in their area . for example , one of my friend , min-su who specialized in english during college . he concentrated on only his major and tried his best to understand better . consequently , he got a scholarship throughout all his college life . furtheromre , just after graduation , he got a great profession related to his major . thus , this also illustrates that speciailizing one specific subject is beneficial in offering chance to plan a specific job in one 's life . to sum up , i firmly consider that it is ideal for people to specialize one specific subject instead of having a variety of knowlege of many subject in that it is exacting to take many academic subject and one specific subject help them fine a decent job . with respect to this point , there is a famous saying that if you want a well , dig one place .
