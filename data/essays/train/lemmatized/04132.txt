i totally agree with the opinion that if you want to become or stay successful in your life you have to try new thing . a change in the way of working is not only good for leader in the company , but also for the people working in the team and working for you . if you try different way to hit your target , you will be able to see different way to reach your claim . that implicates also that you will be able to find different way which can be different to your `` normal '' way of working . and perhaps sometimes one of these newly found way work out better for you and your whole company . if you include the people working for you in the different team into the process of finding these new way to work together and for each other , they will enjoy to be asked and will enjoy working for you even more and even better . you create a corporate identy and everyone will be happier because he ha been asked for his opinion . he is a part of the company and know that he is important for it and his chief . the change in the company , the result it brings and the new way caused by it will show , what is good and what is bad for the daily working . it will take some time , but you will see the change the new way brings . or if even the traditional way you worked before wa and still is the better way . going back to the old way is allways possible . by searching for the best possibility you gaine opportunity . you are allways able to decide for the best way for your company . that mean , you are also able to go back to traditional way and behaviour . a great chance !
