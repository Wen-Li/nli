statements about the future are always extremely unpredictable . but in this particular case i stongly support the idea that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today . twenty year from now there will definately be le car than there are today , due to various reason . the main reason being that , even if there are car , what will they run on ? ! unless human invent an effective way to run car on something else other than petrolium , car can not survive . also , twenty year later the wolrd population will almost double ! so there would not be any space for more car . literally ! the rapid use of effective public transportation ha already begun a it curb the inconvenience of traffic , parking etc . the people of the world will realise that if there are too many car , there also might be too much pollution , and the corruption of the environment is something we can not risk even today , let alone twenty year later ! the awareness of the populus of the world will definately increase and by then everyone will realise that if each person who travel from place to place ha his or her seperate mean of transportation then the whole world would be one big traffic jam ! for example , today in downtown manhattan , it doe not make sence for one to have their own car because it is much easier just to walk to take a cab . in my opinion , within the next decade the world will see the maximmum number of car it ha and then the decline will begin . cars in urban area are already begining to cause a problem in many country . they create noise pollution , emmit harmful carbon monoxide gas , and are very dangerous to pedestrian oweing to the tremendous traffic ! in conclusion , i would like to say that there will defniately be much fewer car twenty year from now than there are today a it is inevitable . therefore i agree with the above statement .
