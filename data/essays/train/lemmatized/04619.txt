well , this is an interstiong topic to be written about . coming to the point of knowledge , it mean that mastering a field of work at study . and this is divided into many branch like different subject we take . many people try to take a few subject or a single subject alone for their study . this also count for the field out of education system . this could be for the reason that they are interested in it and like to work on it . and moreover , people who are job minded , would work inyensively on their subject of choice to master it and a good job based on it , leaving the other subject unexplored ! according to me , the involvement of a person in a particular type of job is totally need based . but i would prefer to work on all the area ad gain knowledge of everything around me , then concentrate on what i need to . this could be a pretty way to do our job . you will have the minimum kowledge of everything . this ought to be followed because , you can not keep quite when group of your friend is discussing about a particular topic . you need not be familiar with it so that you can atleast join the discussion . or else it would look odd if you dont join the talk . afterall our skill are guessed by rthe work we put up . and we can also advice some person in a familiar topic we know . for example , let take a person who is very well aware of a subject in which he is interested , but is unaware of many other thing . and take person who doe know about all the thing he is interested , and also the other thing . for instance let u assume an interview conducted for each person . and in today world , a person who know his subject of interest and the other thing also , is only accepted . that would keep him a an allrounder . though the other person is a master in his subject of interest , that alone would not help him . lastly i conclude that , `` a sight towards the alrounder is always different from that towards a fish in a pond , which , though know everything about the pond but never know anything about thje world around it .
