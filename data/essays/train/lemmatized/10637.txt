recently , many student try to find an effective and efficient way to study , but they are always confused by the dilema : understanding idea is the first priority or learning fact is more important ? from my point of view , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept other than learning fact . and this can be fully explained from three aspect : first , nowdays people have more access to those fact so they do n't have to memorize them ; second , understanding is more essential to help student to be more adaptable ; third , understanding help student to develop creativity , which is the key force in this technology world . first of all , fact are easy to be found . nowadays people have a variety of way to acquire data and information . books , magazine , internet , video tape are all the powerful resource which help student to learn fact . for example , a student can easily get what happened in canada in 1870 from the internet , he or she just simply type : `` what happened in canada in 1870 '' , he or she can get thousand of ariticles and test which are related to the topic . moveover , the informaiton is saftely saved and preserved from all those medias mentioned before , so what is the point to try to memorize all the term and fact ? it is a waste of time obviously . second , understanding is more important to get idea . it is better to teach a man fishing skill other than just give him fish everyday . for example , if you just memorize `` 1 + 1 = 2 , 1 + 2 = 3 , 1 + 3 = 4 ... `` but do n't know really understand the concept of the rule of addition , next time i give you a question `` 1 + 100 = ? '' , you still do n't know how to do it . on the other hand , if you know the rule of addition , that 's much enough . you do n't have to memorize any fact such a `` 1 + 56 = 57 '' , you can do any addition question . that simple . last but not least , understanding help student to be more creative . as we know , this is a technology era , creativity seems more important than just accepting . in order to understand , a student ha to push himself thinking in a deep level , which help to develop logical thinking and critical thinking skill . the more a person think , the more knowledgable he or she tend to be . hence , he or she will understand more and be more creative . this is simply because they can apply what they have learned and understanded into different situation . in conclusion , learning fact is simple and brutal while understanding is deep and essential . understanding idea can let student be more knowlegable and creative while passively accepting and memorizing fact is just a waste of time . so it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
