recently , there ha been an argument a to whether a person should buy a car if he or she can or should keep using the public tranportation among my classmate . as a person using the public transportation for most of the time , i decided that , we should not consider this problem further because there will be le number of car in use in twenty year than in today . i provided some strong support and evidence for this thought . first of all , in twenty year , i think that most of the people will be much more aware of the value of public transportation ! if the number of car increase with time , there will be a great need for more highway ! since we are limited with the earth 's surface , we can not simply dedicate all the space we have to road ! even now we withness traffic congestion everyday . there is an ultimate solution for that : public transportation such a metro , bus and so on . they have some outstanding advantage like low cost for both the country and personal user , and le polution of the environment . because the number of people who think of the public transportation a a solution will increase with time , the number of car in use will even decrease ! in addition to that , most of the car are used for transportation today . in the future , with the increasing technology , we will not need to `` go '' to work . instead , we will be able to do whatever we do at home with computer ! for example , instead of driving to the university to attend a lesson , i will use the internet to attend the lecture online . now imagine the number of student driving to school . considering them staying at home to study make me believe that there will not be a greater number of car in the future . moreover , the available gasoline decrease everyday . in twenty year , the gasoline resource of world will be much le than today . although there are alternative way to make the engine of a car start without gasoline , there might be some serious problem abouit petrol reserve in the future . to prevent the event which will probably couse a third world war , i strongly believe that the world will make regulation to own a car . therefore number of car in use will decrease . in conclusiuon , the number of car in use will be fewer in twenty year that in today for so many reason . among those reason are people 's awareness of advantage of public transportation , advance in technology , and restrictive regulation to own a car because of limited amount of gasoline .
