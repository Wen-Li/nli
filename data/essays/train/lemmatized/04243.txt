now a day competions increase rapidly person win the race who use idea and concept at right time and at right place . for student both the fact understand idea and concept and learn fact are essential . sometime they get benefit to learn or sometimes to understand them . i am completely agree with the statement that understand idea and concept are more important then learning them . first , a far a student concern they have to learn lot of concept of their course and other thing . so for the student it is not easy to learn all the thing . therefore they need to understand the detail or main idea of the course . second , when student can understand the idea their chance to learn more thing wil increase . for example if a student can play any vocabalary quiz game then it would not learn all the word from dictionary for the quiz . but instead it can understand the meaning of root word a suffix and prefix so it become easily to learn more word . most important fact is that recalling or memorizing power . when student can learn the idea then it is probabaly not recall all the idea at right time and a a result it can loose the race . however , if he can understand the thing better then definately it would recall at right time . one example is that if the student ha to face any mathemetics related comepetive exam then understanding of the formule is more helpful then learning a their are more then 100 formule so to learn all those are not easiy . in increasing competition world student play important role a they are the bright future for the world . so to understand a much a idea and memorize those idea are really helpul in mordern world .
