numbers versus ideas when student are considered to be mechanical mass that absorb and memorize word and number without processing them using their own intellect , one can easily believe that learning fact is the only virtue that student should need . however , this is too far from being the logical and humane approach to the matter . it is the idea behind the fact that make the student evolve and turn into bright minded individual that will undoubtedly lead their society towards a better future . to compherend , for example , the mechanism that make an aeroplane take off is far more important for a student than to memorize the maximum speed of that particular type of aeroplane . it is comprehension that trigger imagination . understanding idea provides the learner with the opportunity to have an unchained mind which is absolutely the prime element of both individual and collective improvement . think of an individiual who ha only been practicing in his study the commonly adopted technique based on the fact that are already available , without bravely experimenting new idea . how far could he go ? not too far , that is for sure . if it had n't been for those who have bright idea labed a ` crazy` , our world would n't have been a colorful a it is now . as a conclusion , one should always keep in mind that we owe what we have today to those bright idea of yesterday .
