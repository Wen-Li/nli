i disagree with the statement `` young people do not give enough time to helping their community '' . you can find youngster doing commuty service at college , at the welfare club and anywhere they find themselves needed . college is main area of such service centre . they have their own group there that doe work like collecting fund from student for a worthy cause , or conducting any event , may it be cultural or academic to raise the money for a need . i would like to quote something related to the recent `` tsunami '' attack that killed life of many . there were casualty and loss of property and the poor people who live in coastal region were badly affected . our college group , who wanted to help the victim , raised a `` contribute some and save them '' event to raise money , and it colleceted a gross amount nearing eighty thousand . it would be small , when only one college is considered , but when all the college in that area are considered it a substantial sum . its even amazing how much such event in college throughout the country would have acquired . another instance to quote is the recent `` blood donation '' camp that wa organised by the youth club in my locality . the event wa done with guidance and it wa a huge success . people , mainly youngster - both boy and girl participated whole heartedly . and it surely would save life . not only at college or residential area , even at our workplace such service occur frequently - may be blood donation camp , may be raising money for a cause , or maybe visiting a hospital or an orphanage . these visit include spending time the child in orphanage and making them smile and doing cultural perfomances to give them a good time . or hospital visit - majorly to help in soothing the patient and hearing their problem . both visit end up in donation being made to them . these show that youngster are doing community service very good .
