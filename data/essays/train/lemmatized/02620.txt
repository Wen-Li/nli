what is going on these day ? what about the world , country , city and house that we have been living in ? i remember when i saw one of my friend , she wa saying i do n't care about that kind of stuff , and also she wa adding that even people who care , they do n't have any time to discus or help their community to be more clean and then to live happier . i strongly believe that it is not an excuse that saying no time for helping our community . firstly , the young people are the people who ha a lot of work to do on these day . students ha class that they ca n't postpone , they have alot of homework to do after school . but they want to live in a better world . then is n't it so weird to want without any help ? i think that mean we all are selfish . secondly , some of young people think that anyway the world is going to be worse than today , so who care in what way it is going to be slower . i do . i care about my family , my husband and my child , that i am going to have . i do n't want that my child ha a dark future instead of clean , happy , full of people who are smiling . finally , it can be said that although young generation ha an idea about the world which they are not going to change , i think with eveybody 's help , even young people who are so busy on these day , the world can be a place that is more clean and happier .
