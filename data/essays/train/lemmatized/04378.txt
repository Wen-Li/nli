in the city i live in you can find young people at every public place : in the street , in the town center and on public playground . often they hear loud music , disturb other people , drink alcohol or just damage something . this introduction show that i support the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community but instead they do no useful thing . but what are the reason for the behaviour of the young people , why do the spend no time for helping . one reason might be the numerous invention which were made throughout the year . mainly the invention for the freetime like the invention of the internet , the tv , or even the playstaion affect the young people 's free time activity . many young people have all of this invention in their home or even in their own room and they are used very much . thus there might be not enough time for helping the community . moreover in the modern socity one thing is very important : to earn money . money is very important for the young child a they want to afford the above named invention or they want to wear expensive clothes . the community service is not being payed or if it is payed it is payed it is payed worse . in a part time job young people can earn enough money to fullfilmost of their dream . thus the young people might work in a part time job instead of supporting the local community service . besides if young people participate in helping their community they are not free any more in their spare time . they have to keep certain appointment at fixed time . so all in all i agree with the statement .
