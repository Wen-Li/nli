i really hope that in few year the number of car go down ! today the car in our city are too much : our air is drammatically polluted and this is because of the car ; there is also a lot of traffic and sometimes you take one hour to go only on the other side of your city . i think that today all of people and government have understand that the problem is big and important : probably in the next year they are going to approve some politics in order to reduce the number of car and to offer some substitutive service or to improve the one that exist . i 'm speaking about bus , for short or medium travel , and train . i think that the govern and the citizen af all the word have to cry to obtain this . i think that petrol company and car industry that probably want the number of car increas in the next day ; ca n't be heard by the government because the most important thing are our wealth and quality of life . for a family of four person is today quite normal to have two or three car . i think this is very dangerous for our society . if there are a lot of car the problem is first of all the pollution , that i think is drammatically important and is necessary a solution very soon . other problem are the traffic and the parking . for all these reason i think that there will not be fewer car in use in the next year because is really dangerous for the population . if the number of car increas i would be very warried and i think we will have a lot of problem for our wealth . so i hope that the umanity is not so stupid to loke more at the possesions , like car , than at the wealth .
