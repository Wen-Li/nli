the issue on hand is contentious and of great importance a it ha it relevance to people in all rank of any society . i think that the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are many factor which support this view . society is not static , it change with time . the young people , the youth are an important part of the society a they are the future of the society . their behaviour , action and idea define the future of the society . compared to the old time , i think that youth are spending lesser and lesser time helping their community these day . couple of generation back , the young in a family too did some productive work for the family . helping one family is helping his/her community indirectly . nowadays the young are remaining unproductive for longer period and are starting to contibute anyting useful to family or community very late . for instance , youth spend a lot of time playing computer game , or chatting over the internet , dicussing some tabloid article with a friend for hour . not may spend time on community activites , which could be a simple a conducting or participating in awareness program , regulating traffic , helping the poor kid get education , etc . in the ester year the youth associated with their community more , their community wa an identity for them . with the medium revolution , the youth of today associate themselves more with the hollywood movie and football star rather than their own community . this only mean that there is motivation in the first place for the youth to spend time helping their community is missing . we can not put all the balme on the youth for this change . with the increasing competetion for job , youth are made to work harder and harder just to make their end meet . one really may not have any time to take off their busy schedule for helping their community directly . the young people of olden day did not have to live in such a fast paced world . they had a lot of time for lesuire , some time of which they allocated for helping their community . i conclude by saying that due to a variety of reason explained above the young people nowadays do not give enouh time to helping their community .
