some people think that it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide , because they can get more imformation from a tour guide and also they can make some friend through the tour . however i do not agree with this idea for these reason . first of all , i like to prepar the travel schedual by my selfe before the trip such a i would like to go this restaurant , visit this museam , buy this shop , and so on . without a tour guide i can get a lot of imfomation from internet befor i go to a trip . second of all , i can decide how many time i should spend in the place . if i find the really really good place , i will decide to spend a lot of time to be there . on the other hand , if i go to a trip in a group led by a tour guide , because it ha already dicided how many time i spend where i go , so i shoud leave the place within the time . i can not stand !! i would like to enjoy my trip ! so i really think people who want to spend great time in the trip , they should go a trip which they made schedual themselves . third of all , it is my challenging time to speak local people where i go to the first place . i like to comunicate with foreing country people . if i go to a country which is spoken english such a the united state , canada , the uk and so on , i can develop my english through the experiment . on the other hand , if i go to a travel with a tour guide i think i will depend on him because he always appear beside myself ! for these reason , i can not agree with the statement , the best way to travel is in a group
