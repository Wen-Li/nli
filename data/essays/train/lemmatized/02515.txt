`` i know not how the third world war is going to be , but i know that fourth world war is going to be with stone and stick '' , this is a famous quote by sir albert einstein . today is world of rapid technological and industrial advancement , the day is not far when there is a saturation of source eventually leading to retrogradation of the society . i would absolutely agree that in the next twenty year ther would be fewer car than they were today . i remember reading the poem of william wordsworth , beautifully describing the countryside and mother nature . in today 's world it is indeed impossible to find such a place in real . right from the inception man is driven by a quest for knowledge . there is an urge or a curiosity to know and to find out thing around him . this ha definitely led to the industrial revolution . one of the biggest achievement ha been the invention of the automobile . with the development of car and other mean of trasnport the world had definitely become a smaller place . conveyeance wa made easier and effective . but one important aspect to this revolution is the traffic congestion it ha created . i would like to state an example , i live in a big city and it take me one hour to reach my college which is just 8 kilometer away from my house . i will have plan out thing before hand incase i wish to go to a place somewhere far a it literally take me year to reach my destination . there ha been a significant rise in the awareness about the pollution caused by automobile . this pollution not only effect the environment but also to living being . the number of case of asthma and other lung disease have risen due to the ever increasing traffic and pollution liberated by vehicle . there are case of early retardation of child development due to the inhalation of harmful lead component released by the vehicle . in earlier day , car were a status issue . people who were wealthy only could afford a car . it is no longer so . although people are able to buy car but the maintainance of car is a difficult task in today 's wrold . it is said that buying a car is easier than maintaining it . today there is an increasing urge to go green by reducing the individual contribution to go green . people are reverting to the use of cycle and bike which use plant a fuel . people are becoming more health consious and hence perfer to walk or jog it up to their destination . hence i would like to conclude that although there is a continuous rise in the number of car , after a span of twenty year the number of car will reduce due to increasing awareness among people .
