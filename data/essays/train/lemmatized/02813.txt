yes , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . hence i eleborate below . students must know idea concept with this only the learn fact . in school university they learn idea and concept with education . by this knowledge they can learn fact . if they understand the idea and concept they can do what they want to do . with this they will suceed . learning fact mean by experince . after concept only we can learn . students ha to understand idea and concept so that they can learn fact fastly . without concept we can not learn fact . hence on weighing pro and con the statement is agreed . the importance for student to understand idea and concept . later they can learn fact . strike the iron when it is hot . facts are the past record and experience .
