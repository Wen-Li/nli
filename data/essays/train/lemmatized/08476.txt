travelling in a group led by a tour guide have many advantage . first of all , it 's the easiest way to learn about the new country , and it 's culture , you are travelling in . most of the time , the tour guide ha also many good advice , like where are the good spot located and what can be done , or what should n't be . you also probably feel more secure by travelling with a tour guide , than by travelling on your own . but despite all those advantage , i got to say that for me , there is nothing like travelling alone . because a trip must have a part of adventure , i mean you do n't really travel to feel secure , you travel to experience something new , you travel to discover new people , new culture , new feeling , you travel to feel free , wich you really ca n't do when there is a tour guide telling you what to do and where to go ( eventhough it 's better for you ) . but most of all , what i really would n't like to do , is travelling in a group . i remember when i wa in africa with my dad , travelling on our own , when we met all those group of french tourist with their guide . they were probably sleeping on better hostel than we did , their trip wa probably way more `` comfortable '' than ours , but i bet this wa le interesting . and is n't paradoxical to travel , wich mean to leave your country , to be surrounded by people from the same country ? what 's the purpose ? i 'd rather stay in france to be surrounded by french people . .. finally i would say that even if it appears easiest to travel in a group led led by a tuor guide , you will never learn the the same thing than by travelling on your own . and to me travelling is about learning >
