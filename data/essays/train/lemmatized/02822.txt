i believe that it is true that most if not all advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . if we compare the number of product that are today in the market to the number of product sixty five year ago , we will notice that there is a noticeable growth . because of that , the competition ha increased . producers have to come up with new idea how to present their product in a way that is going to convince the buyer to choose their product and not any other that is on the market . when they ca n't improve their product or if it is even to expensive to make an improvement , owner of company decide to make their product look much better in the advertisement than it actually is . human being are mainly stimulated when it come to buying thing by how a certain product look . for example , we can find a lot of shopping channel on tv . the product is always presented in a perfect way . here we can see how the product are not just visually perfect but also perfect in the way they work . a good example for this are exercise machine . lots of machine promisse you to develope a perfect body in a limited time frame . for their advertisement they choose people in perfect shape that might not even use that product in real life . but of course they claim how much that product ha helped them to stay a fit and healthy a they are . another product similar to this one is a weight loss pill , which always promisses people weight loss in a short period of time without having to watch what they eat . it is very dissapointing to watch how many people fall in to this trap , buying product and discovering later on that is wa not what they believed they would be getting for their money .
