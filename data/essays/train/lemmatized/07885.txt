the french government is looking forward to implementing a measure that ha triggered an important controversy . indeed , they want to enable child to drop out general formation when they are fourteen so that they could specialize in one specific field by attending class on this subject and making internship . it rest on the idea that it is better to specialize in one specific subject than to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i agree with this idea , even if i would like to nuance it by saying that a basic knowledge of several academic subject is necessary before specializing in one particular subject . first and foremost , people may not need a broad knowledge of many academic subject in their daily life or in their job . for instance , a baker may not feel concerned by the study of dna . people may also be more interested in a specific subject and want to learn more about it . for example a scientific may be keen on mathematics ; then he will wish to concentrate on the study of this field and drop out a deep study of physic or biology , even if he will need a basic knowledge in these field since these three science interact . therefore one can adquire a basic knowledge of several academic subject and then choose to specialize in one specific subject , in order to become an expert in this particular subject . nevertheless , the step during which one adquires a general knowledge about fundamental subject is also very important . a law which would allow child to leave school when they are fourteen ay be criticized from this point of view , insofar a it is the period of teenager ' life during which they should adquire this general knowledge that prof necessary to understand the world which surround them . for instance , they need to have at least basic knowledge of history and economy if one want them to understand what is at stake in topical issue . this understanding is of critical importance inasmuch a they will become citizen . as a conclusion , i would rather say that each and every one of u should decide to specialize in one specific subject which particularly interest him , but after having adquired a sufficient competence in several academic subject .
