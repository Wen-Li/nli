which do you prefer the person who know everything a little and the person who know one thing deeply for your life ? there will be no nessary to think of answering this . human society is so complicated that person who know only one subject can not surive in competion . thus i agree that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject for getting better grade , having chance to adjust main subject and creating developed and combined subject . understanding many academic subjest help to get good mark for main subject . academic subject are have related each other . that mean every subject can help understang the others . in my case , learning linear algebra in math department helped to understand in computer graphic in computer science which is my major subject . also creative writing class help me to write good paper for each subject . like this manner , knowing many academic subject are good to get good mark . second , broad knowledge of many academic subject give a chance to adjust main subject . choosing the main subject is important because it is related one job . so by knowing many academinc subject , student get to chance to adjust their subject . they can find good od bed last , it help to create new developed area . people created robotic by combing biology and computer technogy . it doe not happened with only knowing one subject . in conclusion , broad knowlege of many academic subject is better than to specialize in one specific subject . it help to get a good grade , to having time to think if choosen subject is suit for indivisual and combined more decent area . someday , university student have to study more complicated and more subject for graduate since many subject will be combined and developed in relationship for more year .
