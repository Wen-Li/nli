as the dictum say : `` hard work work '' . it is hard to become a succesful person , but there is nothing easier than losing what we have been working for . the goal of each person is to succeed . but there is no limitation to success . as an example , a rich person will always try to get richer . according to the old philosophy , the human nature is based on desire . a man or a woman is always in search of new thing that will allow him to develop his or her experience . no one of u is free because we are all conditionated by our perpetual desire . the satisfaction of a desire systematically caused a new desir . the philosophy call this `` the hegemony 's human nature '' . `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . '' let 's take the example of alexandre the great who wa dominating all the mediteranean area . because of his desire of hegemomism , he wanted to mater the whole world and that led him the the loss of his empire . let 's point out more concrete example : in the capitalist world , a company will always try to conquer new market ( a globalization ask for ) rather concentrating on his own market . .. this can cause the company 's failure . as far a i am concerned , i completly agree with the following statement : `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . this is the human 's nature and no one can denie it . but human are trying to decrease these risk with philosophy a the oriental philosophy by defending the next theory : `` control the desire in order to master only what we know how to do well and avoid the risk of losing what we have '' .
