in our modern society , individualism keep growing . because of this fact , the community need more and more help . but nowadays , the generation of video game seems more preoccupied by itself than by their commuunities . does it mean than young people do not help their community anymore ? in a first part , we will discus the growing individualism , and in the first part , we will see how young people help their community . to begin with , we live in society led by capitalism . this system encourages the personal achievement , through the american model of the self-made man . everyone ha to fight for himself to realize his dream , while at the same time , old or handicaped people , or even the family are alone , or in a bad situation . so , should young people sacrified time they would have put into their career to help these community or not ? however , our society are also the society of all the association . in the last decade , many association are born , living to help the community . and it is often young people that work in them . for instance , the association habitat et humanisme that help people to find a house by gathering fund is mainly composed by young people . furthermore , more and more schools and university develop association that help people . helping community ha become a common fact for student . i also think that giving time to helping community becomes more and more a strong argument in front of a manager , when a young people is looking for a job . to conclude , i would say that i clearly disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping community . in the contrary , i think they give more and more time for them .
