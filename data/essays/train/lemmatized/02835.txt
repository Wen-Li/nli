young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . this can be because of their selfish behavior or not having enough time to help but it is obvious that this is not a positive signal for the furutre of a community . when i wa a student in a college , there were some student coming from village . they were going back to their family a soon a the holdays begin , to help their work on farm or etc . even this situation sometimes had bad effect on their lesson , they had never thought not to help . now , when i compare with the new generation , unfortunately the scene is not seems to me so helpful and willing . they all say that , they do n't have enough time to help their parent even just for a few week during their summer holiday . the situation is similar for the public bus also . when i wa a child , it wa a pitty to sitting down when a pregnant lady or and old men is standing . but today , young people are rarely give their seat to the others . i think one of the reason of this situation is depends on the change of the game of child . it wa more training having team game than today 's personal computer game . team game are joyful a much a the personal game and also teaching child solving problem and living together . today 's old people are the child of past 's , and that 's why , we know helping and sharing more than the new generation . whatever the reason is , none of the excuse are acceptable for me . becasue i believe that a the time change , people are becoming to have more theirself-centered life style .
