the history of world is very old and in this history there were made lot of innovation , research and etc . it is impossible for student to understand every formula in their short life period , but for making research and development , discovering the history of the science and being innovative person they have to learn the fact for their releated study area . first of all without understanding the main idea , student will only keep the idea in their mind for the exam . that wo n't be true because for the research and development activity , which the student will affod in the future , they need the fact behind the formula . secondly by understanding the concept student will discover lot of new thing . for example , when they learn how the electricty wa found they will get information about the history of it and find out why it wa necessary for that time . moreover , they will be informed about the hole science , too . in addition , for being a innovative person , a student have to focus on the fact and the logic behind the fact . when he or she understands a new thing , this will improve his or her vision . on the other hand , to learn how the special number and formula in mathematics wa found can be boring for the student . while getting the logic behind a formula student spend lot of time , which they actually can use for something better for their career . in conclusion , understanding the concept and idea is a must but it must have a balance , also only in the related study area of the student . otherways the education system will change to a ` keep in mind , write in the exam ' system . and that will stop the development in the future .
