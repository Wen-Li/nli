i would n't agree with this statement . of course , it is very important to have a good overview over all academic subject . but after having achieved this one should decide on what is most interesting to oneself and specialize in this specific subject . first of all , trying to stay broad in one 's knowledge mean to preventing oneself in specializing in a specific area . but without doing this , it is not possible to gain a deep understanding of any subject and there is the danger that one is just scratching the surface . this is particularly important nowadays . each of the academic area ha grown extensively in knowledge and experience so that it is even impossible to get a full understanding of just a single area . furthermore , in order to produce new scientific result or new thought in an academic area it is important to have a good knowledge of the latest development in this specific area . this is can just be achieved by concentrating and working hard on one subject . moreover , i think that it is important to devolop interest , and maybe sometimes also disinterest , in certain area during one 's academic education . as far a i have experienced this , it is just possible to achieve great result in a subject when one is interested in the material and thus is able to develop enthusiasm for one 's one work . always forcing a person to deal with thing that are not so important for he or she , the person will feel uncomfortable with his or her work . so , specializing in a particular acamdemic area help and support the development of own interest and thus increase one one productivity .
