as people grow older their interest may change . whether young or old , each generation ha each ammusement . however i think that young people enjoy life more than older people do for three reason . first of all , generally speaking , young people have le careful to their health than old people do . as people grow older the possibility that they become sick would become increase . in hospital there are too many older people who consult in doctor for many reason . as opposed to that , young people can eat everything they like and go everywhere . health is the most dearest thing of all . second of all , young people ha not their life fixed completely and can change their career or plan of the future easily . old people cannnot never change their job or their partner of marriage . it make the life of old people boring and le exciting . in addition to that old people have heavy responsibility for their job and their family . in contrast , young people have much time in the future ; they can draw their dream a they want and can do their best in order to realize their dream . finally young people , perticularly young woman can enjoy fasion and cosmetic . in the department store the most part of the fashion floor is occupied by the clothes shop for young woman . this mean that young people tend to enjoy fahionable life and fashion brand target not old woman but young woman . young woman can spend more many fashion that old woman do because young woman can use their many freely . and a people get older they get their weight more easily that they were young and they cannnot wear the closethes that were fit to them when they were young . young people enjoy their life tma
