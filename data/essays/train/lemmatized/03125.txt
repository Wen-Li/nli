i agree in some part with the statement . people who succed in the thing they want , had to pas through different stage in life . for example people who is persistent with the idea they have to achieve a personal goal , it is more problably to be successful than perople who give up so easily and do not try hard even though they fail on the first intent . of course , if you try new thing and take risk you have more possibility to get what you want or get where you want to . taking risk take a lot of courage is here when people decide if they want to try to get better result or risk and get worse result . on the other hand if you stay in the comfort zone where you know you are doing what you like to do and you are doing it well ; you also have the chance to fail or to succed . because you are doing thing the way they have to be done , so this can give you a lot of self confidence neccesary to achive the goal you have in mind . for example , if a good income tax cpa ha a successful firm and good reputation , but he decides to study law to improve his knowledge about tax law and rule , to be that way more helpful for his client . at the end he will get better result even thouhg he think that doing this will take a lot of time to be with his family or in the office . he took the risk but it will bring better success to his firm . decisions play important role in our life . that is how we move through existence . how we sometimes we take risk and how other time we act cautious . we will never know if staying where we are or taking a risk will be the best thing to do . so we just have to decide .
