every statement ha two side one is negative and other is positive . but i will take a balanced stand for the above statement . in twenty year there will be few car in use , if technology advance a rapidly a one can think . on the other side , there will be more car in use than today . firstly , if government try to emphasize only on the profit making task then there will be very few car in future . the people who are already in power try to overcome the middle class and low class people . they will try to be at the highest level . on the other side of the coin , if goverment make some policy that rich people can own limited facility . then other middle and low class people come into limelight . so they can start thinking of facilitation . secondly , if government concernd just with economy , then we can say that there will be fewer car in the future . to maintain the system , government need financial support also . if every one try to buy a car , then there must be lowest economy level . it can cause the problem of valueless resource . thirdly , a the technology advance , rich people try to get the latest facilitation . but middle class people remain with their old car . this advancement can be in face of le expensive thing . so that other people can also purchase the same latest technology car . in sum , i conclude that the number of car will be fewer if currency value will be higher . this number can be increased if currency value will be le . so currency level is dependent upon the economical state of the country . if the government is well concerned about the the growth and developement of the entire country then there will be higher number of car in the furure .
