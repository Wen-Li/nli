there is an enthusiastically held discussion taking place at the moment at my university in heidelberg . students and professor are discussing if it would be better to have a more broad knowledge or if it is preferable to specialize during the study . i think that a specialization is better . one of the reason why i think it is better to specialize is the professional career . people with higher qualification in a certain area usually earn more money than unskilled or semi-skilled worker . the higher your qualification , the higher your sallary . i study translation and i know that only translator with a specialization in a special area , like engineering , accounting or medecine , have the opportunity to find a job and earn some money . the second reason why i am in favour of specialization is self-confidence . i have made the experience that i am becoming much more self confindent when i have the feeling of being an expert in something . translation is a good example again . only if i have learnt all the necessary vocabulary and all the grammar rule i feel competent and able to do my job appropriately . another reason to specialize is the life-long learning aspect . if i once have a certain kowledge i should continue to learn , and this is true for my whole life . if an engineer , for instance , need to work in a foreign country he can still learn the appropriate language . but first of all , he need to be an engineer . he still ha enough time to learn additional competence when he need them . i am absolutely convinced that it is wright to continue with my translation study before i switch over to learn anything else . i am sure that this is the right way in order to earn my own money after university and to feel self-confident in my everyday life . in addition , i can still learn thing in other scientific field when i have my university degree . but to earn this degree is the most important task for me at the moment .
