as these society is very development , many academic field generate in the university . some people argue that specialized education is efficient to develop the student . however , in my opinion , studying various academic subject is better for this society . first of all , it is clear that the university student ' should have a various knowledge . accumulating many academic study , they would develop because they could use their knowlege in the field that not only thier major but also other field . for example , i have a cousin who major is law . although he had hard to make a time to study other field , he study ecomomy also . at last he could enter the big famous economic company a a lawyer . he is so happy that the salary is high and he can use his all knowledge . many people arould him admire him because they belive that he know a lot . furthermore , there is no question that the society is needed talent that have the various knowledge . this world is not simple so only one field 's subject could n't do anything . these academic field consist that science with ethic , politic with medium and education with psycology . according to the believable reaserch , many university student are double-major because many company need a talent person that have more a two major . i also did also tow major , journalism and jepanese . so i could enter a japanese newscompany .
