advertisements alwasys trying to make you `` when i said you it is mean people '' looke at the product from another side the best side . this is there responsibilty and it is there job to market their product . they are spending fourtune on televission , radio and poster . in my openion i thought before that they are steeling from u by convencing our child in a product i am not interested in . but by the time i have read and understand that this is bussiness and this is how it worked . it ha some advantage and dis advatages . although it brought to u the very new technology , and , it help u by using all of the facility , but in my openion i think it is wasting for our money and sometimes it is not like what we see in the televession . now aday if you opened the televission you will spend muct time watching those product . even so if you go to the movie theator you will waste so much time watching those product and you were paying to watch it . in conclussion if i had acompany i would do the same thing because people allways do not have the time to think or to try those thing , they would say if it does'nt work well it would not matter because it wa cheap or if i am going to returne it i would waste time . if all of family were well knoledgable those thing will not appeare .
