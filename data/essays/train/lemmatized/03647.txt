to agree or not agree with the statement which saying : yound people enjoy life more than older people do , from me a a teenager , i agree with this statement , not because i 'm still young and i 'm enjoying life right now but i 'm going to explain this is some example , so i 'm going to right about my opainons using some example : as we know that old people doe n't like to enjoy life so much beacuse they will start to suffer from a lot of disease which forbid them to move normal and will take there strength away , i have a grandmother that she had a lot of disease and beacuse of that she 's always slepping and eating and i alwasys ask her to play with me and my borthere 's but she ca n't , so disease are one of the main resions that make old people hate life and not to enjoy it . however we should not forget the great benifits that we can get form them , the story that are full of expeariane and konwledge and wisdom which rarely you find it with the young . second point that i want to make is that the young have a lot of way to enjoy life like computer , watching tv , driving car , chating , make to frined 's , swimming , but old people ca n't do these thing so the find them silly and not interseted , so old people have to find some way so they can feel life and enjoy it , for example my grandmother hate tv and she always want to close the tv beacuse it 's not very good for the childern . at the end and according to the reason that i gave and the reason that other will carry , i see that young people know how to enjoy life and beacuse of that the are enjoying it everyday , but for the old people it 's so hard to understand those way .
