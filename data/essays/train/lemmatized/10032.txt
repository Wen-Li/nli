i would like to agree with the statement that ` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide ' . the reason for my agreement with the topic is there are plenty of advantage when there is a guide when we travel in a group . the major problem which we face when we are moving in a group is that defenitely the group includes people of different behaviour , the time punctuality and there will be no coherence between the people , if we are led by a guide defenitely everyone in the group listens to him and follows him a he is leading them . another advantage is that the guide will be familiar with the place we visit and so we need not waste our time on finding the way to that place and we do n't miss the place which are of greater importance . some people may think that hiring a guide will increase the cost of their trip , i think it is not true infact we will save alot of money we can ask the guide to take to the motel which we can afford and there would n't be a chance to e defrauded since peple try to cheat the tourist who are not native to that place likewise we can even save our valuable money and can use for another purpose . . guides also show the important place of that area a we may not be familiar with them . for instance , when we planned a trip to canada on last summer we are familiar with the place over there we got only one week to visit all the place and we got plan to victoria and vancouver , a we know thay are located nearby but some of my friend doe n't liked to lead our group by a guide they think that they will loose privacy but they did n't realized that we are lack of time and they decided to go seperately and we do n't want waste our time a the semester begin after the weekend , decide to hire a guide and we successfully completed our trip within time visiting all the tourist place over there , unfortunately our friend who went to the trip without a guide failed to return back intime , afterwards they appreciated our opinion . hence i would rather suggest a group to be led by a guide on visting an unfamiliar place , which would save money , time and provides u with the facility to enjoy the trip with more ecstacy .
