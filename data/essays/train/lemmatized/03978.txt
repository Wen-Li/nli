the aim of the modern education is not making the student learn or memorize the fact . instead , it is introducing them idea and concept . teaching idea and concept will make the student understand the underlying reason behind the fact . they will gain a broad vision which is based on idea and concept . through this vision they can understand and eveluate fact in a more comprehensive manner . it is more important for the student to understand idea and concept than to learn the fact because it is more meaningful and more practical . first of all , without idea and concept fact are not meaningful . the idea and and concept make the fact meaningful . for example without knowing the idea and concept of early twentieth century it is not possible to understand first world war . the dominant political idea wa nationalism which resulted in the deep hostility amng the nation . there are concept such a imperialism , struggle for market expansion etc . without understanding these idea and learning these concept one can only memorize the chronolgy of the war but can not understand it properly . secondly , it is much more practical to make student learn concept and idea rather than fact . it is impossible to make a student to learn all the fact . but if he or she is given a theoratical perspective based on idea and concept , he would be able to evoluate fact that he face . ideas and concept would turn out to be useful tool in h 's hand to interprit the fact . the fact are written in the book . if one need to use them he can open a book and read it . it is very easy . for this reason it is not practical to learn them by heart . in conclusion , it is more important for the student to learn idea and concept than to learn fact . it is better first to forge a theoratical framework with idea and concept then evoluate event in this framework . it is both more meaningful and more practical .
