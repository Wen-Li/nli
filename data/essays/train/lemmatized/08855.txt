it would be too easy to simply agree or disagree this statement . i will explain in the following paragraph why both are very useful . first we need expert who have a great and deep knowledge about a very specific topic . the reason for this is quite simple . without expert how could man discover new theory in physic for example or create new technology . if thales had never existed man might not have discover a very important mathematical theory , and it is the same for newton , galileo , or even einstein . without expert we might consider than man would not progress much and would remain at the same state for million of year . when you see how wa life a thousand year ago and how life is today you understand that these expert are compulsory for man . on the other hand of course we need people who have a broad knowledge of plenty of academic skill . we need them because they are the link between the different expert in our society . besides to fully understand a situation it is sometime a lot more useful to have a great background based on different area of knowledge than being a specialist on one specific subject . for example , to lead a project you will need someone , the project manager , who will be able to understand various area of activity so that he can sum up all the work done for the project and lead the project properly to reach the expectation of it . this person doe not need to fully understand all the detail which are know by the expert , but he need to have little knowledge in various area to understand all the expert who do not always work on the same subject . in other word this kind of person are useful because they can understand the `` big picture '' . to conclude , it must be understood that we need both kind of person because the work of the first one complete the work of the second . it is like in nature , we need water and fire .
