the question being asked is that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide is good or bad . this topic is very interesting because i like travelling very much . in my opinion , it is the best way to travel in a group led by a tour guide and i am agree with this topic . the first reason , why i prefer this is because if you are travelling in a group along with the the tour guide , you are very much in secure hand . i think this because in a group , there are lot of people around you . they are always there to take care of one another . but , when you are travelling alone , it might be hard for someone . another reason is that you get more knowledge about the specific place . tour guide is there to explain the history of some specific place that are important for the sight seeing point of view . others group member are there to give their idea about the place . the reason is that , which is very important in my point of view is you enjoyed very much in group rather than individual . for example . if you are going for the long tour in group for like 1-2 month , that group become like a family and you have not to worry for the unusual situation . the tour guide explains everything so well that you can get more information about thet particular thing . when you are travelling along , sometimes you missed very important place to visit especially when you are going to new place . in the conclusion , i think i am correct in choosing that topic .
