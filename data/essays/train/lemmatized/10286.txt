i am not really agree with the question . in a first view it is true that young people enjoy life more than older people do . they take all their life with a smile on their face , they are happy for all think also for a stupid think . young people have not a problem , they depend of their family , their parent , they are `` on the cloud '' . young people enjoy themselves with the major stupid think , for example i have a brother that is 20 year old and he with him frinds laught for all think , they enjoy with videogames , they spend all day play football or gooing away . but the difference about the older people is not that the older people do not enjoy life , they also enjoy life but in a different way . older people have a big think to resolve , they have a responsability of their home , they must pay the telefone , they must cook the dinner also for their child that could be outside playing with their friend . older people have le time than the young people have . they have all day full , they can not enjoy life if not during week_end and also they have a different way to enjoy their life . when you are old , after 22 year old , you look to life in a different way than when you were 16 year old . you have a different way to enjoy life . for example now i am 23 year old and i like to do different think from 5 year ago . i enjoy my life going to mountain and looking with my boyfriend the landscape or to go to eat , in a famous restaurant , some good fish drinking a good vine . so i think that it is not true that young people enjoy life more than older people do , i think that cahnge the way in which young people and the other do that .
