deciding whether it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject is a complex issue . on one hand , a broad general knowledge is apprexiated within society . on the other hand , today 's global and competitive business environment requires specialization on a certain area of interest . in my view , the advantage of specialization on a specific subject offset the possible advantgaes of having a general knowledge of many academic subject . firstly , business environment is getting more integrated and complicated day by day . technical development in technology and science make it impossible to know everything . since narrowing the focus of interest on one specific topic ease the intellectual improvement process . secondly , high competition in business and academic world motivates people to have in-depth knowledge about a certain field of interest . having confidence a specific topic can be considered a a prerequisite of professionalism . colleques value thought or opinion only if they trust a person 's expertise and competency about the subject . thirdly , specialization is a growing trend in busines life . especially , expert are looked for in crisis situation . thus , the ambiguity or recession in business cycle may be an opportunity for a specialized employee to verify his/her competency on a specific subject . also , specialization enhance the probability of promotion or shortens the time needed to reach a career goal . for instance , nissan , the japanese car manufacturer , needed a new ceo for the inefficiency of operation causing loss in recent year . nissan offered the position to a renaults employee who specialized in increasing efficiency in operation and dealing with crisis situation . specialization enabled the manager to take step quickly . under the light of above reason , specializing on a specific topic rather than having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is a motivating factor behind success
