i am agree with the statement . i think that people should make differents thing to make this planet a better one . what i mean is that much people do not like to do a big effort , but who really like that ? we need to start taking risk to be success . working with an own bussines you can feel better , because you are working for you and not for another person who maybe you will never know . you can research something and then bring put it on the market . i have some friend working by importants firm they like what they do , but i am sure that they will never take a risk because their parent never did . that is a big problem in my country , most of the family educated they childrend to study and work for an international company . in personal i think that they should induced them to create an own bussines . the term `` take risk '' maybe is not only for have your own bussines . other example is the university . most of the student after they have finished the high school they do not know which carrier they what to do . of course there are some guy that prefer the money before anything , so they study something which they do not like much but they will earn some money . also they are others who take the risk of do what they like and after few year they are famous scientifics . who know the future . in conclusion i will say my childrend do what they really want to do and if they should take a risk do not think twice and take it . i am sure that if we work in something that we really like , we will be a better worker and we will have a better life .
