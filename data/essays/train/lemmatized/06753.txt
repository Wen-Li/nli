in my view , in twenty year from now will be more car in use than today . so i disagree the fewer car in future . first , it will be changed that people buy a car more cusually . although , people started concidering environmentally friendly socity , like recomending a pubulic transportation , bus or subway . more atracting having a own car nowaday . many car company are very competitive , producing a nice , new modle stayl every year to attract consumer thouth a medium , televison , internet . and a cost of per car ha been aceptable for even young single person . fortermore , a life of each family member might be more imdipendent . havind a car for a personal belings will be possible in nearlly future . second , new nutural enegy or electronics engine have been found instad of oil gas . new type of car only us a little oil and conbine electronic enegy and it is already useig some region . they are low cost and environmentally harmless for earth . finally . i assum that even a lot of car in future dose not pollute a much a used to be . but more number of car will appear . and i disagree that it will be fewer car in use than there are today .
