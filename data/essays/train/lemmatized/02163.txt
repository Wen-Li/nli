advertisement ha become a whole part of the selling product process thanks to the expansion of the medium such a television , newspaper , radio . it consists in boasting the quality of a product , and emphasizing on them . but most of the time , the product doe n't look like the one presented on television , or in the newspaper . it look much better in the advertisement than it really is . indeed , for example in the case of a television advertisement , mean such a light , special effect , different angle of shooting can be used to make the product look better , and thus more appealing to the buyer . an advertisement for food will be shot so that the product will look apetizing , but in reality , the product the buyer will find at the supermarket wo n't even look edible . sometimes advertising for frozen food , will even use fresh food , instead of the real product that is trying to be sold . and the buyer is often deluded into thinking the image presented in the advertisement wa representing the real product . how many time did people complain about the difference between the brochure and the product , or the difference between the one seen on television and the one standing in front of them ? televised advertisement can also hire people to talk about how the product ha changed effectively their life , or how adequate and convenient it ha been to them . but this kind of advertisement is dishonest a it lie to consummers . they want by any mean sell their product to buyer by building a fake image product , and making it seems much better than they really are but it is not the way they should sell their product .
