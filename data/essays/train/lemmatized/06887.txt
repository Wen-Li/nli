i believe that successful people try new thing & take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well . if u keep doing same thing over & over again no one is going to impress what u did but if u do something new every one is going to surprise how u did this & they will become curious to know about it . without taking risk it not possible to do something new , ex.if u want to gain more knowledge u have to learn new thing to learn it but u are not sure that that knowledge is going to help u somewhere in ur life . but if do not take risk & do not start to learn new thing u r never ever in ur life is going to find out that knowledge will be useful for you or not ? it will be mystery for ur whole life u live . so i think that if want to be succed in your life start learning new thing instead of following same old thing that u already know . the 1 reason i believe this becoz , especially at this time world is booming , each & every second some one is investing something new that no one know . so to keep track with present world we have to try something new instead of sticking with same old thing u already know . ex.each & every day cell phone company , computer company , actually all eloctronics company introduce their totally different & brand new model . the another reason i believe this becoz if u try something new u will make more money than with the same old thing . ex.if u make new desing for cloth that no one invented yet , u r definateley going to make money.2nd ex.if u build the house , which is totally different than the usual house arond u going to make more money & u going to be more popular too . in other world it not limited for only electronic or builer buisness but it true for any thing u can imagine in ur mind , in today 's world every one want latest facility , design , equipment , etc . so , in conclusion successful people try new thing & take risk instead of sticking with same old thing that some one already invented . but remember 1 thing , success is not possible without taking risk .
