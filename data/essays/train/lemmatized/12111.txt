i totally agree with the statement given above that advertisment make product seem much better than they really are . if you believe everything what the producer say and what they sale then maybe you think that you buy the best product . but if you know that they give you not all the information , most people recognize the reason behind the advertisement . for example in politics , during the election , most of the elector vote for the candidate with the best advertisement . though they even know their ambition . so the politician waste most of their money to emphasize their popularity . but it is no matter of fact that the most popular politician make the best politics . i think the importants thing is to get into it if you want to be sure to by the best product . but you should never be sure if an advertisement told you that you bought the best
