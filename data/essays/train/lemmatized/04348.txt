i love traveling to some place where i have never been . if i go there , i will see something which is attractive or interesting and i have never seen before . it must be exciting . i have been to hawaii seven time . although all trip were alone , i had great time and also i have experiened that i have never done and i could to see my best friend . thus , i disagree with this sentence . first of all , triping by myself is always solitary , i many time felt that i want to go home and too much tree time because of alone . however , if you are alone , you could do whatever you want and you could go wherever you want all the time without caring other 's feeling . in addition , for me , it is easir to speak to other people who are stranger or other tourist or native people than if coming there in group , because i need to think about what time is supposed to see others and how they feel about it . so , if i go to travel alone , it make me feel more free than other . next , i met my best friend in hawaii . then , i wa walking among beach by myself . and i wa very free , also i do not have anything what to do . so i spoke to a guy who is going to be my best friend . he is a great person and very considereate . all my this trip , he took me to a lot of place and let me stay his home for 2 week with delicious food . i think if i came there a group , he could not accept me and he could not take many place , because of alone . inconclusion , i think that traving alone is more reflexible and more callenge and adventure eventhough there are a lot of possibility to face to danger . and , you could do whatever you want again . i think it is even possible to love somebody . there are more oppotunity to see someone who is important and to study from everything that i have seen and to think about my future slowly .
