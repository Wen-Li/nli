if you ask me if advertisement make product much better that they really are , my answer will surely be positive . in my opinion there are a lot of reason to support this fact . these reason have a feature in common : that advertisement are always based on deceit . first , when you see one product on tv , you see not the real product , but only a `` visual manipulation '' of it . it will always seem bigger , brighter , better than what it really is . in order to explain this , are you really sure that the famous big mac is really a `` big '' a it seems ? i do n't think so . so , before you chose to buy a product , go and see it in reality . most of the time , it will be a delusion . another point is the fact that , during an advertisement , there are a lot of `` distracters '' . in other word : it is not the product itself what is important , but what is around it . for instance : haven ' t you noticed that , in a lot of advertisement , there are a lot of beautiful girl or men ? what is the connection between a product to paint gate and a young pretty girl ? so , the advertisement remains in our mind not because of the product , but because of `` other '' factor . the last point is that advertisement play on our imagination : we do n't buy the product for what it really is , but only for what we believe it is . this `` imagination factor '' is created by a combination of the previous mechanism , and yet others , that gain their strenght upon other , even unconscious , weakness . so the bottom line is , never trust the advertisement , because they will always play trick on you .
