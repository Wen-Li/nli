yes , personally i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . thats mainly because we all know how to do a some stuff well . we are all special in something or another , it may be unique , but the fact that all of u are good at one thing is really - not unique . hence , if everyone doe what they are good at it , they will be reasonable successful , but more very successful or famous . people who like to try new stuff , who like to innovate or who try to take risk , are the one who are daring enough to know that their idea and plan might fail , but if they happen to go right - nothing stand between them and success . here , i would like to state the example of the wright brother - the one who are the mastermind behind u flying from any destination of the world to another such destination . trains were common that day , travelling by ship and car were also few of the more common and conventially traditional meens of transportation . however , the wright brother had an idea , which wa outlandish at that point , but if it clicked , they would have success at their foot , and the entire world would know them for that . and thats precisely what they did . they put that idea into practise . did their bit , and came out with a device that travel in air , and take u place in such short distance that were only dreamt of in that generation . thats why people who take risk , who have the courage to think out of the box and are willing to try their idea because they have confidence in them . by doing so , they take a chance of it failing or succeeding . fail , and the critic simply say `` we told you so .. '' , succeed , and everyone is astonished , and hail you - quite rightly so . people only take risk because they have faith in their idea and concept . people who have faith in their idea and concept are generally very intelligent and smart people , innovative people . hence they go ahead , take the risk , and bask in the glory if and when their idea prevail and the entire world ( a in this case ) reaps the benefit of their courage , idea and mainly - execution . therefore , i would like to conclude that yes , everyone can have a relative amount of success , but the one who stand out for their success story are the one who take risk and try thing which others do not dare dream off .
