there are huge number of advertisement that are being produced these day . in my opinion , these advertisement highlight the quality of a product , explain why we need to buy their product and give u an idea of how they are beneficial over other product of similar quality . advertisements provide u with the fact . they show u what the product really are . firstly , advertisement provide u the quality or the feature of a particular product . they try to convince a consumer by providing all the information about their product . for example , conside adevrtsing cereal . an advertisement about a cereal would give u information about the percentage of calorie , calcium or other vitamin that people gain because of that cereal . the advertisement is not exaggerating anything about the percentage . they are all fact and we can get the information on the cereal box . the advertiser can not lie about such information . second , almost every advertisement explains why we need to buy a particular product . after all , that is the purpose of an advertisement . they give u significant detail about the background of their product . for example , an advertisement about an intel pentium processor iv make u realise that we need an efficient processor to run our computer program . they tell u about the nano technology and how it ha been incorporated into their product to make it more efficient than other processor . this seems to be overwhelming to a buyer . however , they need to know what is going on with the product that they are about to purchase . moreover , a lot of advertisement compare their product with other product of similar kind . this is only to show how their product are far better than the other product . in conclusion , i think that advertisement only show the best quality of their product . they do n't make up anything to make their product seem much better than they really are .
