i have traveled many place throughout my life . i love to travel with my parent , but of course , there were many time that we traveled in a group led by a tour guide . i personally prefer to travel without a group and definately to travel without a tour guide . the first summer vacation that my parent and i went to japan , i wa only six year old . we were with a group of people , and there wa a tour guide . every historical place or any amusement park we went , we traveled with a big tour bus . the tour guide would then explained detail for information that tourist should know . though it seemed to be useful , i felt most of the time i wa `` trapped , '' and `` bored . '' and i wanted to see this very phenomenal temple on our way to the hotel , but i wa told not to do so because we were on the group ; it wa not on the schedule . i felt it wa such a disappointment . in addition , i could not have stay in a place where i wanted to stay longer ; daily schedule wa already written for u , and the place we went might not be the one i wa interested in . i have travled to hong kong , united states , korea , and japan alone or with my parent . it wa such a big difference compare to if i wa with a group . i could do everything i wanted . i wa free to stop by a comestic shop whenever i felt like it . my time wa flexible . it wa the best when i acutally went to korea and stayed with my friend ' house . they brought me to place that i do n't think i would go if i wa with a group . for instance , my friend 's grandparent garden and place where famous band concert performed . it wa incredibly entertaining and that is why i am passionate about traveling without a group led by a tour guide . though there are reason i partly liked to travel in a group led by a tour guide , i do not think that is the best way to travel . i am more comfortable either traveling alone or with my parent because it not only benefit the relationship between me and my family , i also see the world larger in this point of view .
