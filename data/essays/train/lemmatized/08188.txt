cars are one of the most widely used vehicels for travelling today and whether their number will increase or decrease in twenty year is a very polemical topic . according to me , yes , indeed there will be fewer car twenty year from now . firstly , the pollution caused due to combustion of fuel in the car 's engine is posing grave threat to the enviornment . governments and the people are increasingly becoming aware and concerned about this fact and hopfully new rule will be formulated on limiting the number of vehicle a family can own or the the number of car an office is allowed to have . people are making concious effort in reducing pollution due to car by making car-pools or travelling in public transport such a bus and metro train . this way , the number of car will reduce and more people can travel in the same vehicle instead of each one going seperately in thier own personal car . furthuring my opinion i would like to suggest that the number of car will also reduce due to the accelerating fuel price . the fuel price are inceasing day by day due to inceasing scaricity of petroleum . it is a non-renewable resource which is depleting rapidly and thus it scarcity will result into price-rise . so affording a personal car will become increasingly difficult for the common people . with the advent of newer technology such a computer and the internet the basic motive for people to travel is becoming le important . people can now download their office work on their computer , at home , and can work in the comfort of their home instead of driving and going to office . student can also attend lecture on their computer and submit assignment which reduces their need to travel to school everyday . they can interact with their proffesors and peer on the internet through text or voice message with the help of a computer . thus i would like to conclude that due to all these reason car will become redundant and , if used , will pose a threat to our enviornment and thus will become obselete shortly .
