i desagree the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there is today . the car is one of the evolution that is the most use by the population . have a car is very comon ; you can find car all around the world even in poor country . we will see why car are not ready to deseapper , firstly , because they is no solution to replace car , then that have a car become very ship , and finaly because now people thing car . firstly , there is no invention that can replace car . it is true that there is the bus , the tramway , the metro , but that is different you do not feel the same when you take your car alone and when you share a bus . cars is a need for many people to have their privacy , their confort . car permit you to be free ; go where and when ever you want . that the most important thing , and for the moment nothing can replace it . secondly , having a car is no more a luxury but a need . the cost of a car become le and le expensive . we can take the example of the new 4x4 build in china that it the le expensive 4x4 never built . the only thing expensive is the gas , but solution like '' biological gas '' from colsa for example . or more common , car which work with electricity . so there is solution of the high cost of the gas . finaly , nowadays people get a car a soon a they have their driver licence ; so they make their life with car advantage . nobody will wanted stoping using his car before we find others way to move . our car have a long life , sorry for the earth environemt
