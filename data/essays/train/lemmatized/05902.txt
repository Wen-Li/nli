is a broader knowledge going to increase once perspective in business and life ? let u think about a child in school at the age of 15 . in this case i would recomment that a child ha to learn a wide range of subject in order to become more intelligent and recieve a good knowlege from his school . but regarding a young person , at the age of 16 or above , who would like to go to university it seems neccessary for me that student get a deeper knowledge about one specific field . as everyone know everyone is individual and ha different interest in different subject . in regard to that : how can someone who doe not like or is even not familiar to biology study this subject ? in addition to that our environment need people who have deep knowledge , for example in the pharma industry . only these people are able to create new medicine to help people with difficult disease . it is necessary that these person are well informed about what they are doing otherwise it is a very risky operation . further more there could hardly be any competiton in our busines life if everyone ha the same education without any specialization . how could employee decide whether a person is suited or not for a job which expects deeper knowledge ? and what about a person who is interested in math , but this is the only thing this person is able to do ? it would get lost in the big competition and would never have any chance in improving his unique skill . as a conclusion i can say that specification is the only way to improve a person skill and to keep competition alife . people need specification a otherwise the unity and importace of a person would get lost and a a result of that one person would be unsatisfied , sad and helpless .
