image what the world today would be without a light bulb , the phone or the wheel . maybe some of these thing were invented only by accident , but they were also developed because their inventor wanted to try something new or uncommon . therefore , i agree that successful people take risk and in the following section i want to give some reason for this opinion . my first point is that without people that are willing to take risk everything would stand still . without people trying something new there would be no invention or progression and humanity would probably still be on the level of the stone age . if everyone continued tro do what he already know than it would be impossible to move forward . i also think that it is impossible for human to remain on the same level all the time a the human brain is prone to learn and develop . like child want to touch the hot oven just to see how it feel and learn , hurtfully , that it can be very hot , people also want to try if a square stone can roll better than a circular stone . although the need for progression is an important factor , there is also the point that people became successful or made a lot of money just because they took a chance where other part of society stood back and watched in order not to be laughed at . thus , it is an important feature of successful people that they try new thing no matter what society might think of them . because if they finally take the step and develop something new and unknown everyone in society want it and try to copy it . therefore , people who like to take risk and make the first step are mainly the one to profit from it the most . in conclusion it can be said that people who take risk are more successful because the do not care what others think about them or their idea and they are willing to embrace progression . as i want to be succesful in my own life i hope that i will be able to take some risk because i am aware that it take some power of will to do that .
