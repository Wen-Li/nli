personally , i disagree with the general statement that young people enjoy life more than older peolpe do . it is of course difficult to make a general decision here and there may always be exception to the rule , but i would even say that - in reverse - older people enjoy life more than young people do . there are various reason for that . while young people often tend to prefer a lifestyle which implies a lot of partying and going out to have fun , older people usually have gained enough experience to be able to estimate what really count in life . that is : not going out and getting drunk but basically thing like a secure job , a house , family and friend you can rely on . older people have learned about characteristic that are really important , whereas many younger people may still stick to superficial idea . in making hard and difficult decision , older people may have an easier time than younger people . adolescents will approach a difficult situation differently : they may be more naive , simply because they have never faced a problem like that . older people can relz on their life experience and see more easily which would be the best decision . they can evaluate situation better and are more sure of themselves . moreover , older people can look back on the accomplishment of their life and see what they have done . they do not have to worry any more about career thing and - hopefully - about money . they have worked all their life and earned enough money to be able to travel where they like to . with their partner , they have now the time and opportunity to see the country they used only to hear of and read about . young people have to think of their education and career . they have to think about their income . older people have the possibility - and should - transfer their knowledge to younger people in order to help them getting on with their life .
