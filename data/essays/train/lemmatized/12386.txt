life is all about the preference . some people choose go on the wa x while the other walk on the y so the perefences are depends on the way people want to walk away . this rule is also valuable for the academic life of people . some people prefer to study and to have knowledge about many subject , in contrast others want to specialize in only one subject . i do not agree with the idea that it is better to have a wide knowledge of many academic subject than to specilize in one specific subject . firstly , for example , in my university eligible student are given an opportunity to study double major and many eligible student from business administration department are stuying double in economics a well although most of them is goin to work a a manager in diffrent department of a company . however , in the business field employer require their employee to know pretty much about what they do in the business , for instance a marketing manager is not required to know about economics . second , it is waste of time because instead spending time to get knowledge about many different academic field people should devote all their time and get depth into the most crucial subject for their future and career . having a little bit knowledge about many academic subject doe not add so much value on the people s career , on the other hand specializing in a single subject can help a person to be famous all around the world just because of the contrubutions s/he make to this subject . in conlusion , i believe that focusing on one specific subject is better than to have broad knowledgeof many academic subject . although i have been studying double major , i have been trying to focus only on and paying more attention to economy class that i have been attending in the univesity because i want to have an academic career on economics and want to be a famous economics professor all around the world .
