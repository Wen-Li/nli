i agree the idea about young people enjoy life mor than older people do . there are several reason why i think that . the first reaonson , the young people are not the responsability than older people . may be older people have child . all the people know that there is not easy to educate child . all the time he try to give a very good condition for life . the second reason , the young , her aim is to go to th the club , cinema with her girl friend etc . .. and to get much experience , so it very exited but the older people have passed this feeling . the thrrt reason , i think the most important moment fot the older people , when they were young . because when you grow up , the difficulty of life incrase and also the responsability increase . in peculiar , when you have the child , you have a new situation and new life . all your past became souvenir . i brief , of carse the young people enjoy life more than older people do because it is logicaly and i gave these reason why i think that .
