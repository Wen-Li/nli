i will disagree that there will be fewer car in use in the next twenty year . i can give the following reason for my opinion . firstly , the population of the world is increasing exponentially . this will increse the the need of transport . when viewed in detail about majority of the country , the chief mean of transport is car . as per to satisfy the need of growing population the usage car will definitely increase in the near future which can be a good reason to contradict the statement the second reason is the declination in cost of car . when studied about the statatics from the time of invention of car . the cost of car is declined to a larger extent . this made car available to the large middle class society in the world . since the economic and financial status of the people are incresing the middle class society also incresing . this men the need of car is also incresing . this combine the declining price of car and the usage of car will be incresed . this mean that in the near future the usage of car will be further incresed . nowadays car are manufactured which run on battery . so , eventhough shortage of the petroleum resource will never reduce the usage of the car . car ha become the comfortable transport . . the comfortability will increase with the advancement in the technology furthermore , which make people to use car a their chief mean of transport . also car are safier to travel when compared to bike and cycle . in view of the above reason i believe that the usage of car will never decrease in the next twenty year .
