on the advertisement most of company make the product better than it actually is .. sometimes i fall into trap of advertisement trap and end up buying that product . when i actually use it , the product is horrible . advertisement is very important to business . it 's way people find out about the product . if the business company did not make the product great than nobody will buy the product . these fact should not be excuse to customer . if you want to make the money , make the best product and have the best advertisement . i always watch television at my home . when i see something good , i will always be like `` i have to buy that '' when i actually bought that prodyuct , i am always like `` man . . this suck '' . so , yes , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
