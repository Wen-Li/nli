be it young or old , everyone on this earth enjoy their life in their own way . the manner in which they enjoy differs from person to person . but still , i feel that young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people have a lot of energy . they are full of enthusiasm that they love to enjoy their life a much a possible . young people have a lot of fresh idea that they think of innovative way to have fun . for instance , during the christmas eve and new year celebrations , i saw a lot of young people shopping late night to buy gift for christmas and new year . and also they celebrated the festival in a grand manner by singing , dancing , partying and having lot and lot of fun with their friend and relative . older people also enjoy their life in their own way . for them enjoyment could be to read a favorite book or to play with their grandchild or to visit a place of their choice . they also celebrate their festival with their friend and relative . whereas , a people tend to grow older , their energy level deteriorates and are unable to participate in physical activity . though they would wish to dance or sing , their physical health might not favor them . in their old age , they are pre-occupied with other thing that they do n't enjoy a the youngster do . old people have their own way of recreation that differs from those of young people . i conclude by stating that both young and old people enjoy their life but young people tend to enjoy more than older people because of their high energy level and enthusiastic spirit .
