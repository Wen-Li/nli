despite the fact that there are numerous car running on the street nowadays , i think the number of car in use will start to decrease in the twenty year to come . there will just be fewer of them due to the following two reason : le birth and more advanced technology . currently there seems to be a trend for people to give le delivery of baby , thus reducing the population , which altogether would also cut down the amount of people using car . with fewer birth rate , there come le population on earth . these two are tightly inter-connected . take one family , for example , who want to go on a family trip togethere . when the number of family member drop , relatively there would also be fewer chance for that family to take on car a their vehicle for the trip . if such be applied to every other family on earth , there will be an apparent decrease in the amount of car in use a a result . another possible explanation for the decrease of car is the advancement in technology . as the year go by , the technology is enhacing and improving at a very rapid rate . complex invention such a car that involve the application of high tech were introduced to the world , enabling the possibility of moving freely from one place to anothe . it is then very likely to conclude that in the year to come , other alternative way of transportation might also be created and developed . in that case , it wo n't be necessary for u to travel through car , but via other motor vehicle instead a the alternate way . the advancement of technology a well a reduce on the birth rate are taking place even at this very moment . they can have various impact to our society , fewer car in use being one of the effect that they will bring . with these two factor involved , it can be thus expected that , in twenty year to come , there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
