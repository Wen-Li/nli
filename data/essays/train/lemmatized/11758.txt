i dont agree with this statement that sais that succesful people are the one who try new thing and take risk rather than those that only do what they already know how to do well . i think that both thing in different way can bring success to a person life . sometimes a person is good at doing something , and it really enjoy doing it , so she/he really put effort and commit to do the best they can , and they get success on doing that . furthermore , a person that dose n't feel good of doing something or feel that they can be better on doing something else should take a risk of trying new thing . for example , my mom wa good at her job in a bank , but she feel like she need a change and so she took the risk of trying opening her own bussiness . her dream wa to open a spa , that in my country there are few . so she did it , she took the risk and open her spa . now is the best spa in my country , even people from other country come to mine just to try the spa . what i want to ilustrate with this example is that sometimes if you take risk or try new thing you could be a succesful person , but this is not always the case . sometimes just doing what you now how to do well , and doing it with effort and willing to do be the best , you can also be a successful person . someone once told me `` do what you want , but do it right '' . so this is what i am trying to explain , taking risk or doing what you know how to do well , but do it the best you can and you will succed . successful is around the corner so try your best and you will find it !!!
