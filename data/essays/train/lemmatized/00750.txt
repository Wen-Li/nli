nowadays the sciense is advancing very quickly because of the progress of many academic subject , each day we know more and more about our world , about u ( human ) , the scienses is growing so fast , many people think that it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and other that it better to specialize in one specific subject , i think that it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject , my point of view is support for the following reason : firtsly , i think one must know about other academic subject too , because of that knowledge can will use on the future , since are many academic subject that are growing and we must to use that advancement , nowadays there are many people how have not only one profession and maybe have a better work since they know many academic subject and can work better , maybe can work even instead of other people , and do their work more efficient . secondly , in our day many profession have many academic subject in them context , many academic subject are binding each other for example the medicine is a complex of many academic subject like physycs , biology , anatomy , chemistry , mechanical instrument , all of these academic subject are binding each other and it imposible to separate them , and i think thanks of that binding of academic subject the medicine is growing very fast in our day , and i believe all of the profession have not just one academic subject but many . finally , because just thanks of the union of many academic subject all of the scienses are growing and increasing their knowledgements very fast . in conclusion i believe that it imposible study one profession or work in that if the person just should to know one academic subject because noone academic subject can not survive alone .
