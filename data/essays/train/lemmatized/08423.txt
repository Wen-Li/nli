i don not agree with that advertisments make product seem much better than they really are . it make consumer disappoited toward the product that they see through adverticment . the reason how advertisement make people disappointed is by showing unreal commercial then people would like to buy the product . and then consumer would probably spend much money on it even though they do not want really spend money on it . the effect of unreal advertisement bring make people uncontrlled . moreover , it make consumer happy when they see the unrealistic advertisments becuause it seems like the product people see is ideal thing or unimaginary thing that people do not have in ordinary life . however , once people get the product , they would be disapponted by the difference between their image and the commercial or advertisement . the effect of making exaggerated advertisment is only selling product to consumer . the owner of product seems like they do not even care about what consumer really want or need . they are only trying to make money for themselves to satisfy themselves . as shown above , making advertisement have to be more realistic toward our life to show the real aspect of the prooducts for selling . if advertisment keep making an exaggerated advertisment , consumer will not believe advertisement and coemmercials they see . that also lead to an economical problem that consumer are no longer buy product . thus , advertisments of peroducts have to be directly shown the real aspect through advertisement or commercial then people could enjoy their shopping with buying thing what they really want , after they see the realistic advertisement or commercial toward their ordinary life . consequently , people will not be disappointed toward the advertisments .
