while it is true that some people prefer not to take risk and experiment new thing , someother believe that only those who dare exploring the unknown and continously improving themselves can acheive `` success '' . i think that the successful people are required to try new thing and take risk , because their knowledge may get outdated in a short time . let 's take the example of fashion . fashion is continously shifting and it is always changing according to the mass request . if a successful stylist would persist producing the same kind of product after a fashion shift , he would bankrupt in no time a noone would be interested . other case of successul people can be scientist : what would be of humanity if scientist did n't make their experiment or tried unbelievable theory ? the whole science is a always-changing subjuct a modern science differs heavily from just 50 year ago science . in this very field we have great name such a heinstein who carried out his experiment of the relativity in phisics , or bell who could invent the phone only by trying different hypothesis in the radiowaves sector . one of the most striking example is the technology field , especially the computer evolution : computer power double every 18 month , and the software is always more and more hungry of resource . would you consider possible some of the great mathematics achievement , or , on the other hand , some befautiful 3d film , without the growing calcolus power of the computer , obtained by continued research ? in this field a well we can hear very big name , like bill gates , steve jobbs or linus torvalds , who were enabled to provide u with their great operating system ( microsoft windows , apple macos x and linux ) only by going against what they already knew and trying hard new solution . in conclusion , the key for success is obtainable only by hard work in experimenting new theory and only by will to continue renewing oneself 's knowledge .
