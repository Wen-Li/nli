i disagree with the statement . in my opinion , people understand idea and concept by learning the fact . it seems that we are unable to get the idea or concept untill we really know the fatcs . first , it is difficult for u to get the new idea or concept right away . for instance , whenever the professor give the new lecture , they need to organise the material and manage to set up the lecturing in order to make student understand what they teach in class . in fact , most professor would introduce the idea and concept at the beginning of the lecture , explain the detail by taking some example , and summarize the essence by the end of the lecture . obviously , it could make student understand better , even though not all of the student stay on the same level . second , some idea and concept are really abstract , especially those mathematical issue . we usually learn fast a long a we practise by ourselves . for example , i still remember my mathematical teach back to primary school . obviously , she did great job to teach u how to undertand the class and how to work out the question . one day , when we talked about the square of the objective , our teacher got a few student to stand up and measure the length and width of our classroom so that we could figure out the exact number of objective and caculate the square of the room immediately . as a result , we learnt the idea and concept through the fact we did . in conclusion , i personally believe that people hardly to understand the idea and concept unless they learn the fact . facts help u to completely understand and solve
