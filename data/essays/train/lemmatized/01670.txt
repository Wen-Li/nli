i agree and disagree with the statment to some extent . there are definitely advertisement that exagerate the product extremely . for example all the weight reducing product praised on tv are just pure bogus . there is research showing that pill that promise losing 10 pound in a day , or muscle stimulating machine develop your muscle over night are not effective at all . however , people 's hope and sorrow are abused by money hungry company to suck the money out of the believer . additionally , `` half truth '' or suggestive statement are used in advertisement to make the consumer believe in the superiority of the product . a famous chocolate praise it value by pointing out that milk is contained and that it is therefor healthy for child . looking more closely at the content reveals that not more milk is included in the receipe of this particular chocolate than in any other milkchocolate . unfortunately , people are very much fooled by colorful moving picture and convincing actor . new technology like tv or the web induce a high level of accuracy and verification . the crowd like to believe in what is shown on new medium a it is much easier to consume the information without much thought than constantly trying to figure out if the provided information is true and verified . however , many company believe that the advertisement should represent their firm image and product . they understand that customer who realize that they had been disguised by an add wo n't continue in buying that specific product . therefor , producing an accurate representation of the product with the advertisement is of extreme importance . for example it would be unwise if a car company would advertise that their car are extremely safe without sufficient evidence a accident falsifiying statement like that would result in huge negative financial concequences and law issue . the statement that `` most advertisement '' exagerate their product i ca n't fully support a i have n't looked into statistic concerning this topic . however , in any case advertisement have to be looked at critically a they definitely not always show real life .
