`` who want to be a millionaire ? '' is a tv show produced and broadcasted in many different country . everybody who regularly watch this show will recognize that people winning high amount of money in this show have a broad knowledge of a variety of subject . many people claim that it might be better to have such a broad knowledge of different field than to be specialized in only one given field . nonetheless i think it is better to specialize in one specific subject . the first point to support this opinion is the rapid growth of knowledge . man 's knowledge double every three to five year . several hundred year ago it wa possible to study theology , astrology , astronomy and medicine and then claim to be a man having the whole knowledge of the whole world , being extensively educated in any known field of science . with the huge amount of knowledge we have gathered today this is no more possible . thus there is a certain need to reside in one specific subject . a second point is that one ha to adapt to a certain grade to what industry and society need . industry is looking for highly trained specialist , engineer , physician and phycisists . but not for someone who tell them he know everything , but only to quite small extent . with this knowledge you might be an interesting candidate for `` who want to be a millionaire ? '' , but not for a good job in industry . third , i think it might be quite a boost for your self-confidence to be able to see yourself a a real expert on a given topic . last year there wa a certain awareness concerning avian flu , and there wa no single day without the news reporting about it . in most of those article and show there were citation of expert on the topic of virology , highly trained specialist who really knew how to fight flu . but there wa no single citation of anyone claiming to be the one to know little about flu , but also about every other topic . to have a chance a an expert , you need to be a specialist in this subject , and this will only leave you little time to gather broad knowledge of other subject . what we need today is the expert highly specialized in one specific subject . to address different issue it might be necessary to combine expert and build team , but in a world facing such a rapid growth of knowledge specialization is according to my opinion definitely the best and only effective way to go .
