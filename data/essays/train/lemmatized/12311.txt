i partialy agree with the following statement young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people often enjoy life more because the young people doesnot have much responsibility a loking to their family a the older people have . these young enjoy with there friend by going out , like a movie , excersions and many more . the older people even enjoy their life a the young people do . they also meet their friend play card with them , have a chat with them , talk about their young age life , discus about their family and so on . the older people also have more responsibility towards their family . the young people enjoy riding their bike with the maximum speed on the road . where a the older people can not sit and ride the bike like the young people do but they enjoy by sitting home infront of the television and watch movie or any comedy show . for enjoyment there should not be any age . we can enjoy irrespective of age group . there is one such situation the older people enjoy more than the young do , that is at the exam time , they have to workhard to prepare for an exam . some people enjoy reading but some doesnot . the old people memorize their young age and enjoy sharing with other friend by telling that `` i have jumped out from the hostel to watch the mid night show but unfortunately my warden cought me and punished '' . there will be lot of responsibility to the older people even then they enjoy alot a the young people do . by enjoying they can lost there tension and be happy in the future life . i finally conclude that the young people and the old people equally enjoy the life .
