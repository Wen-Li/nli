since i wa a child i thought that car wa the most important way to transport in the world . now i think that there are too much car on the street in the most of industrialized country . big number of car in europe , usa , japan . .. is the most human problem in twentyone century . more people think that in future we will drive future car with hydrogen alimentation , because this element can not produce any pollution . but i do n't think so . i 'm a student of engineering logistic and transport and i know what i saying . big study about this hydrogen car shew how hidrogen alimentation is more expensive than oil or natural gas alimentation . i 'm so disagree with the phrase that i can read on my left . in twenty year i think will be more car than there are today . i 'm so sure of that because there are much statistic that shew that salary people will grow up , so they can buy a car easier . i think also that anyone like travel in comfortable way . about this i can say for myself experience that it 's so bettre travel by own car than train for example . .. if you have a trip with your car you do n't have any time to respect and you feel more free and indipendent than any others way to move . finally i think that this affermation wo n't true , but i think car pollution is a great problem in our society .
