i agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . followings are my reason and example . social competition is serious today , in order to survive in society , most young people have to spend most of their time on school . after class , they have to study for exam and work on term paper . therefore , i do n't think they get time left to help ; sometimes it is not enough for sleep . another reason is that young people may think it make them sound old if they help the community . as we know , most of the work in community is done by old people who have been retired . in order not to be regarded a one acting oldly , young folk avoid to do so . take myself for example , i am 21 and admit i do not give enough hour , but i am not like people i illustrated in the third paragraph . often i go to the community library to help out the librarian . due to the lack of hour , i can only go there once a month , for i have to prepare for my school work . sometimes people are just being too busy to help rather than unwilling . in addition to what i mentioned above , there is still a limitation for young people to help their community , that is , there is no pay . it is a of waste of time to doing thing without wage . tuition fee is extremely high today , young people have to earn more money to pay . therefore , people would rather work a part-time job than community work .
