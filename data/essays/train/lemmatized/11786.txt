many people complanain that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in my opinion this is thrue because this is the way company use to incite people buying their product , and this is how people can only know about new product . first of all , when company make the advertisement for it product , it want to make sure that the product look perfect on the eye of the puplic . for exemple , if the company make differents type of product , it will make the advertisement of the perfect one . companies ca n't show their weakness for their own product because there will no one who will buy . second , advertisement is the only one way that people will know about new product . for exemple , when the company want to send the new product on the market , it use advertisement . appearently the company want to incite people for buying it product that is why it will make it unbelievabely on the advertisement in order to make people think that this product is so good . from this you can understand that most of the time the presentation of many product on advertisement is really different from how they really are . the company are so clever when they make these advertisement because they want to incite people .
