i certianly , disagree with the statement that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than learning fact , as we know that we can not creat a wall without a base . therefore learning the concept and theory behind it is very important . concepts will automatically show the fact in the future . for instance , if i want to learn a new language then i will first learn alphabet . i will learn them to pronunce and even to write . pronucing and writing letter will introduce me the fact of the language . how hard it is to learn ? and how easy it is ? implementing the idea practically will show you the fact and result . first we will learn what color will be produce when mixing it with the other color . for instance , we will learn in book yellow plus blue turn green . now , in order to learn the fact of this idea we will do it practically and we will find it true . this is how it is important to have an idea before implementing it . after learning principle and theory from book and expertise , we find them in field whether they were true or not . we learn fact through experience and it keep changing . however , concept doe n't change . therefore , it is important for student to learn fundamental skill and basic then start learning fact .
