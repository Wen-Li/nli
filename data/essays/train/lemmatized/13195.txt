i absolutely agree that the image of the product given by the communication ad is , in most of the case , much better than how the product is in reality . for example let 's take a campaign about pre-cooked food a roasted chicken : in the ad the chicken is always so beautiful , crispy and tasty . but once the product is in on your table . .. well the colour is maybe the same but the chicken is not tasty at all . actually it taste a plastic . another interesting example is a new mobile . the advertising state that the battery will last for several hundred hour and the software will do incredible thing for you . but in reality the battery charge will last for few hour only , two day maximum . the software will take age to get ready and from time to time it will just be stucked for quite a long time . that is what happened to me with my new mobile . i guess if a product ha to penetrate the market is ha be shown a extremely appealing and absolutely new and fantastic . to convince someone to buy the product the commercial ha to be very efficient , catch the attention and make grat , and fake , promise about quality and customer 's satisfaction . so approaching the product customer will not only buy the product itself buth all the valuable thing the commercial attached to it . i think there are so many me-too product , all looking more or le alike , that the marketing people are forced to rely on this kind of adverstising to make the people notice their product . for example computer from different firm all have the same feature , someone ha a bigger memory or screen or viceversa but none is really different . the real problem is that there are not enough differentiating value in product . even quality and the fact that they are really useful product is not enough anymore .
