i do not agree with this statement that in twenty year there will be fewer usage of car than there are today . i dont agree with this because , firstly , when the technology is increasing there will be more car in use than they are today . with the increasing technology we can have car which seem same a being in our home . now-a-days we are getting formula1 car which are the fastest car in the world . a the saying go `` increase in technology will increase the world in many way '' .cars are also in the same way , with the increase in technology the technology of car will also be increased rather than becoming fewer in coming year . secondly , now-a-days each and every person is prefering to have a car because it is a best a well a convinient way to go in a car rather than going in bus and train . because they may consume a lot of time waiting for all the people who are travelling at that time to come . but when this is compared to car we dont need to wait because we have our own car to travel . thirdly , a petroleum is decreasing day-by-day , we may say that car will become fewer in use than they are today , but technology is now inventing car which run by gas for example , gas which we use for cooking etc , . by this we can say that car can also be run without petroleum and can be run with gas either . so this will also not affect for car becoming fewer in the upcoming year . so i conclude by saying that car will not become fewer in use than they are today with the above stated reason . the usage of car will increase rather than decrease in the coming year .
