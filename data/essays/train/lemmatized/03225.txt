i agree with the statement that successful people rather try new thing and like to take risk than doing what they can already do . when you already know that you can do something , it 's just normal that you try a new thing . everybody want to try new thing . small child are the best example . when they are able to sit , they want to be able to walk . they get up and try to do so until they are able to do so . you 're coming further when you try new thing , you get new experience a well . there 's another example . if i 'm able to read a german book easily , it 's just normal that i start to read englisch book . i started reading englisch book when i wa in grade 5 . i already could read german book and wa successful in reading german , so i tried so get some new experience and wanted to try a new thing . taking risk is the same . people who are successful are often also secure . you only take risk when you feel stable at a certain level . successful people always stand on a certain level , so they are more willing to take risk . there 's also an example . if someone just built a house and now ha many due at the bank , he wo n't lend his neighbour much money . he 's unsecure about his financial situation and therefore now is more cautionous . all in all , you can say that successful people always take risk and want to try new thing . they feel secure in their life because they are satisfied with their situation at the moment . they therefore can risk something . it 's easier to risk something when you are secure . you ca n't lose a much a someone whose situation is insecure at the moment . another point is that sometimes you can be bored if you always do the same thing . to get out of boredom , you start to do new thing and also take risk . to summarize , i agree with the statement .
