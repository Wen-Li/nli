i do not support the idea expressed in the statement . i can not think of any clear or evident reason to think that fewer car will be in use on the near future . however , i can present three reason why i think car use will , at least , state a it is in the present time . the reason are directly related with the car industry and car customer . to have le car in use , le car should be sold , and that trend can not be seen happening in the near future . nowadays it is common to have at least two car at each household , and even more if there are young adult in the house . young adult see car a provider of independence and social prestige , so it will be hard to change their buying need . in addition , young adult are not the only one that think that car and independece go together , adult think that way too . workers are used to commute and travel short distance by car . improvements at public transportation by city administration are not changing the behavioural pattern of city commuter . by my experience in spain , i think that most of the people that use car , drive them to go to work or to the city , and this behaviour just seems to increase , not decrease . environmental pollution and gas price could be two other reason to decrease car use . however , none of those reason seem to affect the market . the car industry is focusing it effort on research to apply `` green energy '' to car . electric car or hybrid are starting to be common on nordic country and some region of the united states . i also hope that this type of car will be more common when their price decrease . in relation to last statement it is the problem of the oil price . experts and ecologist thought that the actual rising trend in oil price will make people more sensitive to car use and especially in the moment of buying a new automobile , but this is not happening nowadays . i think that the reason i have presented support the idea that car use is not going to decrease in the near future . if oil price have not helped to change the car use pattern , i think it is ver hard that any other thing would do it , especially in twenty year .
