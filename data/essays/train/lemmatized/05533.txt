i do believe that the young people nowadays give enough time to help their community . i am making this statement based on severel experience which i have described below . recently there wa a proposal for reservation of seat in leading educational institution for few section of the community in india . lots of young people opposed to this law . there were protest in several city against this law . i also took part in a protest in the city i lived . we protested by carryout a peaceful rally in the city . in all these protest it wa observed that the majority of the protester were young people in the age group of 20 to 25 . it is intersting to note that these young people donot gain anything from this protest but they knew that the law would kill the merit and affect the next generation of student . this wa their wa of helping the community and they were successful at it . another instance in which i wa involved and where i felt that the young people were doing their part to help their community is described below . about a year back i wa involved with a voluntary organisation which worked towards the upliftment of poor construction worker kid . we had planned to organise a party for these poor kid and we needed volunteer to organise some game and sport for the kid and also raise some money for the event . we made a call for the volunteer and it wa great to see that lot of young people turned up . the volunteer not only helped in organising the event but also raised money for the event by donating from their pocket . the event wa a great success . also i see lot of young people involved in creating aids awareness india . i do agree that in this age of fast life , people find it difficult to take some time out of their busy schedule to contribute to the society . but i do feel that all the young people are doing thier part by spending money or effort to help their comminities .
