a major feature in which we , the youth , differ from our predecessor , is in the amount of time we use in order to help our community , which in some case is none . multiple reason are alleged , some say they lack of time whereas others accept they are to selfish to help others without a vested interest . it is true that nowadays young people are always rushing to and fro , since due to the competitive world we live in , we have really tight schedule . in addition to this , if you bear in mind a youth can not afford most of the time to live close to our workplace , you have to count with the commuting time . for example i leave home at eight o'clock each morning and do n't come back until eleven in the night . sometimes it is not only a matter of time but of upbringing . if a person ha n't been taught to be generous , you ca n't expect from him or her to share his or her time for a certain task , eventhough when he or she understands it would benefit his or her community . it is a fact that moral value are decreasing and that a solution ha to be found . i am perfectly aware of how difficult is to handle this problem , since my 15-year-old brother ha plenty of time and although both me and my parent keep constantly encouraging him to do something for others , it ha really no effect . fortunately , there is people whose work is mainly focused on providing those type of service to the community , but this should n't deter u from trying to improve ourselves , that 's it , to reschedule or find a bit of time during the weekend and to bear in mind that the next generation will behave accordingly to what we teach them .
