because of two reason , i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason are a follows , 1 ) idea and concept are the fundamental of study and 2 ) learning fact doe not always explain u everything . first of all , i believe it is necessary for u to study and understand idea and concept in order to understand the specific material and advanced one a well . for example , when student want to answer math question , the first thing that they have to do is to konw the idea and specific fomulas . if they do not know what is `` to add , '' they can not even answer the question by themselves , even though the student know what the answer is going to be . in addition , if they do not know the idea and concpets , they can not progress to the advanced study because the advanced study is particulary based on the main and basic idea and conceps . second , i think that learning fact doe not always tell u everything . for example , when the student study the typical example of the law , such a who won the specifc case in the court , and so on , the student can not explain why they won in the specific case if they do not understand idea and concept . in addition , only to learn fact doe not tell u the process why fact were born . to learn the fact is also importnat when the student learn at school , however , the fact can not explain everything , only idea and concept can . as mentioned before , it is also important to learn fact because fact sometimes give u more clear explanation . in general , the idea and concept are more obscure that fact and it is more difficult to understand them perfectly . however , only idea and concept can be the base of the study and fact can not be . therefore , even though it is also important to learn fact , it is more important for student to understand idea and concpets for thier advanced study .
