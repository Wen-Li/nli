i am not young people , but i wa . when i wa a young boy , i believe there is no higher principle of helping people . but i have read the article at the newspaper which is young people nowadays not to try their time to spend helping other people . i think this is caused because of 2 reason . the first , it is bacuse of the development of indusry . a industry developing . we are more care about the study of technic and scicene than subject of moral activity . in the scool , the student and some of the teacher are focusing only on their classroom to go the university . they do n't want to teach and study human ' basic moral value any more . second , the western culture made our yound people selfish . traditionally , korean people are kind and like to help each other . but after the 20th century , western culture inported to korea so fast and widely . that make our young people changed i believe .
