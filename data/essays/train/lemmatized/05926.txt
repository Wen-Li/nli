`` it is all about the club , make your shot have a lifetime expirience '' ( wilson golf club ) this wa an advertisment for a golf club about five year ago . why do i mention it ? well i bought their product . in the modern world that we live in advertisment and marketing are everything inside a free market . adverstisment is an important factor used by producer to sell their product , it make the consumer become interested in the product and make him most of the time buy it . bringing my previose quote again what i tried to show with it is that by just listening to a propaganda and it advertisment i became so interested in that club that i finally bought it . i wa young and just becoming a part of a famouse hobby called golf . i wasnt aware of what brand were the best and so . so i just bought the one that called the most my attention `` wilson golf club . '' it had a great advertisnment wich assured me that it product will last foreever and that it will make my game improve a a whole . one year later it boke leaving me with no more than a memory . i asked myself why ? well in the business world company want revenue for greater profit . one way of gaining it is by the mean of advertising . if you have a firm that sell shoe who is just beign introduced to the market you imidiatly want money , through advertisment you can trick the consumer into buying youre shoe because they are top quality and they will never get old nor loose their power . through this mean of business you can expand in the market and the only one who could get hurt is youre client with your crapppy product . the world is filled with advertisment cartel and so . we people need to be aware that what we are buying ha a good quality because most of the time thing arent why they seem nor said to be .
