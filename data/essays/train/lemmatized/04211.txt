i agree that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only do what they already know . i have specific reason for my opinion . which mainly support the idea of success and development . the first an most important reason is , that i strongly connect success with challange . in order to have a success i need to have a challange . you can imagine a man who is responsible for opening a door or gate . he is doing this every day , without any change . therefor he ha no challange , because he ha done this several time and know what to to . without the challange he can not show a success and wo n't be recognized by anyone . the second point is that you need to stay open minded and learn to be successful . everyone recognizes someone a successful if he doe something spectacular , new or difficult . in order to do new and difficult thing , i need to know my capability . these capability will need training . hence if i do stay with the well known and do not train new capability , i have le possibility to choose of . therefore i am limited in the thing i can solve . in contrast staying open minded and learning new thing will train my capability and give me more tool to solve situation which lead to be more successful . the third reason is that you have to prove yourself to be successful . for example your bos will test you before he promotes you . he will give you thing to do that are new for you . for that you will have to take risk to solve this problem . therefore you need to be able to take risk to prove yourself and be successful . i had this often in my personal career . my bos tested me and gave me difficult task . he wa not mainly intrested in the result of the task , but how i did it . in conclusion , success need people to take risk , move to unknown territory and try new thing . without this there would be a stillstand not for yourself but also in the recognition of others . i do encourage everyone to take risk and try new thing whenever you can .
