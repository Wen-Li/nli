i believe that people do enjoy life more when they are young than when they age . life is a gift and need to be enjoyed to the maximum . consider a young kid about 15-20 year of age , for him life ha just begun . he is opened out to a world where there is joy and peace , sorrow and grief both at a time . for this young lad , almost everything he doe is his first time at it and will be excited no matter what . on the contrary people aging let u say about 35-50 year have already seen all that the young kid ha seen and gone through . for the old life just passing by . younger child often are more energetic and enthusiastic and yet more vibrant in doing something mostly if it is for the first time . while for the elderly , they have too many responsibility and burden on their shoulder that they do not seem to enjoy . thats why they take time off from work for a vacation to relax , just to get back and start all over again . in a way even if the old want to enjoy they still are held back and are circumscribed in their way . i believe the main reason why the young enjoy life more is that they do not have any burden at their tender age . all they have to take care is their grade and study . the rest all are taken care of from their parent . the old even when they retire think of their grandchild and their education . the beauty in life a i think of it is to live each day a a gift a this is mostly found in the young .
