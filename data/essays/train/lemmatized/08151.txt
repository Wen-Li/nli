some people belief that in twenty year there will be a limit in the use of private transportation will be limited . i agree with this openion . there are some reason that suport this point of view . first of all , there is an increasment in growing rate of human new generation . this would propbably let the govronment of the society to limit the ability for people to use their own personal car in the future . this one of the decession which might be taken by the society in the future a a solution to the predicted setuation of the future living . we all know that these car consums energy to work . for today 's situation , the car are using gas a a main sourse of energy to work , so the using of this kind of transportation is controled by the avaliable amount of this energy sourse . if the word is going to face the limitation of this sour of energy , there will be some new decesions to control the consuming of gas on the trasportation . limiting the use of this kind of private transportation can help alot in mentaining a good balance in the usage of such energy sour . the population will be asked to use the public transportaion such a bus and traind . another benefit of this decesion will help alot in reducing the traffic problem and the crowded street . in some huge city , the work place are spreaded every where . second thing there are mostly sopping mall and supermarket every where . if the future city will be like that there will be no longer need for personal transportation because the place are nearby and the using of car and personal car will be worthless smld
