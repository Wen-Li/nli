i definately agree with the statement that the traveling in group by a guide is the best , even though some people think they would like to make a trip individually . there are two reason for this : cost of the travel and the chance of making friend . firstly , i would like to point out that the cost of the group travelling is lower that that of private travelling . in many famous sightseeing place , there are discounting system . for example , the fee to see a famous garden in kanazawa , japan is 1000 yen for individual visitor but is 300 yen for group visitor . furthermore , the rent of the sightseeing bus is extremely inexpensive . in general , the rental cost is set cheaper for the group traveller . if a traveller is going to take a bus or train , he or she ha to pay more money to move to the other place . the second reason is that we have many chance of making good friend during the group travelling . in the bus or train , a tour guide is generally explain the history and the viewpoint of the next visiting place . the member of the group can listen to the explanation and discus what they would like to see . this conversation will help people to make friend . during my group trip to kyoto , i talked to many lady and discus the history of the city . they listened carefully and want to know more about it . after the trip , i married one of them . moreover , we will have a chance to sharing the experience of the travel . we can exchange the e-mail address to others to send picture . for all reason , a group travelling is the best .
