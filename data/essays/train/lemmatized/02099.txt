i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . everything in the world is based on it 's own concept , no one can do thing well except knowing the idea and concept . the fact is based on the idea and concept . you wo n't know the essential of thing unless you try hard to understand it concept . for example , when you are study a new word which you can not see it straightly and it 's hard to find it out immidiately , the easiest and the fastest way to know it is to know it concept . if you think to see the fact is much more important , then you will spend a lot of time to find it out , so it 's not that convenient . furthermore , to understand the concept of a thing is very important . when you study thing a a student , you ca n't catch the real fact if you do n't know it idea . when you are reading a novel , you even ca n't catch the idea , you even do n't know what it is talking about , how can you image what 's the fact is like ? so , the idea is the basic thing for understanding . and also , it 's really important for student to know the concept when they are learning acdemic course at school . for example , in the study of physics , it 's very easy to see the fact of any physical phonomena , but everyone know that how thing going , the point is to explain why it go that way . so you need to resist the consepts of thing based on again and again , then you can understand it and get learned . overall , the understanding of idea and concept are very necessary for u to understand . you may not really catch the real meaning by only seeing the fact , you need to understand the thing in
