some people these day , might want to travel in a quite place or by one 's self . for instance , there are some people around u who do n't like to be in a group and meet people . i support the idea of traveling in a group led by a tour guide . it would make people 's travel more interesting . for example , lot of information are givin by the guide , saving time and more opportunites to travel much more place . these day , traveling doe n't just mean playing . people also treat traveling a one of the education that student should definitely need . we could hear lot of imformation from the guide . there are lot of guide who are really intellegint these day . as we can get information while we 're traveling , it will allow me to be more thoughtful stdent and knowlegeable person . most importanly , people who are traveling can save lot of time than who are traveling by one 's self . the reason wht is that almost all of guide planned exact schedule which lead traveler to have much more thighten time . for me , i would'nt wate time by traveling . another reason is that we could have much more opportunity to to travel lot of place . most of traveler might think they want to travel and visit lot of place a possible a they could . for example , traveler would not want to travel fewer place than the other traveler who paid same amount of money . thus , these are the reason why i would prefer to travel in a group led by tour guide rather than just travel by myself . led by a tour guide , traveler could have more information about the place , saving time by guide 's plan and we could afford more opportunity to travel more place a possible . so i belive it will be more interesting for people to travel .
