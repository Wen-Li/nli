i disagree with the statement showing `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . for example , why do all of u deeply study about history ? this is because the knowledge of fact which happened in the past may lead u to think of how to think or how to act , now , and in the future . there is a famous japanese sentence shown a `` open your future by learning from the past '' . this exactly explains why it is important to learn fact . furthermore , i think that any kind of idea or concept is created by an event or fact which happened in the past . for instance , the idea to launch the united union , involving all nation in an organization to build an organization for them to solve national conflict by preventing war , wa created after the big event , the 2nd world war . after learning that this kind of war mean nothing to whole of the world and all of the population , the genius leader had reached to this idea . therefore , i think that it is also very important for student to learn fact a much a understanding idea and concept .
