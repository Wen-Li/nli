wheather in twenty year ther will be fewer car in use than are today is a controversial matter . it ha cost and benefit . in my own opinion i think that it will not ocur in the next twenty year . on the one hand , there is evidently that the poblation of the earth will increase in the next year . if now there are six thousend million of people wich most of them no have car , and knowing that the country not develop are developing now ( like china , brazil or india ) or will develop in the next ten year , the people of these country will buy car . in addittion , the developing country there are two car per family in now day , with the emigration the number of family are raising , so more car . and i want to add that the tecnology is there to make the car more confortable and with more security . on the other hand , car pollute the enviorement and people are now more conciounsly in protect the earth and the ozone . this could be affect in the market of the car in the world because people is using and will use more and more public transport in order to protect the earth . also is important that the natural resource are been used in more cuantity for all the product ( plastic , fuel , natural gas , etc ) and the car need combustible to work and now the natural resource are growing in use . to sum up , there are important the two way . there are people in the two option and i are in the the option taht in the future
