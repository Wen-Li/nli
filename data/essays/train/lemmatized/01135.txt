the question of whether it is more important for student to understand idea and concept that it is for them to learn fact is one of the very important issue which teacher , no matter the grade they teach is , should take into thier consideration . personally , i think that understanding concept is a more fruitful process than learning fact . the process of understanding concept guarantee the application of understood concept and idea to varied life-circumstances and situation . it also gurantees a prolonged usage of the learned concept contrary to learning fact which may just disappear from our memory . learning concept , in my point of view , make a fruitful learnign process where learner can make use of the learnt concept to reach great number of fact . if i teach you the concept of how and why people need to mix with each other and socialize , you can take out from this concept different fact about people , such a making friendship , getting married . .. etc . prolonged usage of knowledge is attained more , in my opinion , through learning concept rather than fact . concepts stick in our mind and do not vanish easily from our memory . so , if i teach a student a number of fact , i am sure that he/she will forget some of them just a the class is over . however , although teaching concept take much more time than teaching fact , thier availability in student ' mind last much longer . by the end , i strongly support the teaching of concept rather than the teaching of fact a teaching concept , in my standpoint , have much more effect on student ' achievement and development . teaching concept and idea open the door foor student to think actively and respond geniously to the event they encounter in their life . if we are successful enough in teaching concept a more prosperous future is guaranteed for our syudents
