i agree with that statement . i really think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . understand idea and concept is the key to learn everything . i do not think it is possible to learn in a concrete manner data thing if we do not have previously clearly understand the real concept or idea of what you are talking about . even if certain fact have to be known , i consider fact a secondary in the process of learning . i will demonstrate my thought in several point ; first it is very important to clearly distinguish the concept from the fact , for exemple the economy is a concept , although the precise amount of the american economy is considered a a fact . as that exemple indicates , we can not clearly understant data thing if we do not learnt previously what is the concept . the concept give the general idea of what we are talking about . the idea or concept give to the student the element to understand and analyse by themselves data thing . moreover , the understanding of a concept ha to be considered a an entire intellectual activity since it requires all our attention , our curiosity , and our capacity to absorb and understand information . for these reason , i think that data thing must be used to represent and illustrate the concept and not the opposite . the fact must be used to make the understanding of an idea easie , and it is too bad that the scholar system doe not often give enough importance to the understanding of concept . finally , i believe en concept since i think that student always keep in memory when they have understood it .
