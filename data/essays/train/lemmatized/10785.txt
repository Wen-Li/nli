`` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know hoe to do well '' . this statment is often said about people and what they should do in order to be successful . succes is measured by what you have accomplished . in life if you take risk your are going to be more successful because your are going to get better at what you do , improve in some area and learn . first , if you take risk you are going to get better at what you do because you are going to have more practice . having more practice you can see what you are better at and what thing you should improve . one day my friend wa really scared about making a decision because what if she failed . the first time she tried she wa right , she failed . but with practice the teacher is born . she became so good at what she did that she wa more successful . second , you are going to improve your quality . like my friend , she realized what area she could change and improve them in order to be better . if you dont take a risk you are always going to be good , and thats all . you want to be great at everything and sometimes we just need a little push and courage to know that at first maybe it not going to be better , but at the end of the road you are improving in every single way . third , by taking risk and chance you are learning . learning is the most important quality . if you learn from your mistake and from the thing you are good at , you can combine the knowledge and create something wonderful . people are successful because of what they do , the thing they create and what they are good for . every person during their lifetime ha to take a chance , risk what they have . if they dont they are never going to be great , just good at what they are . but if they do decide to take a risk they are going to learn so much more that even if they fail they gain more knowledge than a person who didnt take a risk . this is why successful people take risk , to gain to knowledge of different thing , and to be great at what they do .
