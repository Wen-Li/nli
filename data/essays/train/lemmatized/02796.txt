some people hold the opinion that most advertisement tell customer the product much better than they are . others , however , have nagetive attitude . as far a i am concerned , i would like to vote for the agreement for this statement . the argument for this point are listed a followed : first and foremost , the enlargement of the quality of some product in the ad is one of lot of reason for inlustrate the phenominon of the adervertisement did not show the truth . for example , once a couple hang around in a mall , a saler of tv told them the high resolution of that tv is the best quality to enjoy . they bought it by costing more , but finnally they found the good quality only come from the dvd presented in the mall . so , it is reason why most consumer do not believe what the saler said . there is another factor that deserves some word here . the ads always show fake feasure of the product . for instance , the picture of the product showed online . once you buy a good looking stuff online , do not feel so happy at once that you got a great deal to have your favorate thing . you maybe need to wait for the last moment that you recieve the shipped item you bought several day ago . in addition , the gurantee of some produce doe not only want to show the coustomer their item have good lasting quality , but also want adding a attractive thing for asking you buy them . if you finnally make a decision to buy them because of the gurantee policy , you may fall in a trap . from i have discussed above , the enlargement of the quality of product , the more preety but not real picture of the product , and the fake gurantee for the stuff are all the ad showed the product much better than they really are
