i think that we all need to have a minimum knowledge of many academic subject but we have to specialize in one specific subject . during the childhood , we all studied mathematics but also skill on language or history . and we all agree that it is essential for everybody to know some thing on many academic subject , because it is usefull all day long . you use mathematics when you are going out shopping , you have to know a bite of history if you want to understand what is happening on the political news , and you must know how to read in today world . but if you want to succeed in your work , you have to be the best or at least one of the best in the subject that you are dealing with . because today 's world is done of concurrence and nobody will help you if you do not succeed . so you have to train a lot and become the best in what you want to deal with in your life . look at a sportif . is tiger woods practicing other sport than golf ? maybe sometimes but he is really focused on golf and he is really specialized on his subject . if he had done during his childhood many differents sport he may not be the world number one at golf today . but culture is also essential and culture is about everything . the definition in french of a ` gentilhomme ' is somebody who know many thing on many subject and who doe not have a passion . if someone can speaks on many different subject it will be someone looked like an intelligent guy . thus if you want to succeed in your social life you must have broad knoledge of many academic subject but if you want to succeed in your work and earn a lot of money you then must to specialize in one specific subject and become the best on that subject
