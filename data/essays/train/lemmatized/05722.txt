even though it is called the age of specialization , it is much better to have the broad knowledge of many subject . i have heard some people saying that in the specialization age , a we called , it is not necessary to have all kind of knowlege on many subject , because trying to equip all knowlege will make people busy and finally waste their time resulting in failure . an pastor i have known for several year , many time told me about this . he is energetic and active . he always try to do his best in his field . but the result seems not to be very successful . one day he preached `` nowadays student have been so busy and tired of learing too many subject which are not related to their major . because of this , they seem not to have their own specific knowledge that they can use for the benefit of this society . they have broad knowledge but not very useful for their success . '' this sounded ridiculous . whenever he ha given sermon , he wa very monotonous and made the saint bored and sleepy . nothing interesting . there were many kind of people in the church and they had different background of their major . but he always used same and rutine article . suppose that you are listening same story almost everytime ! who can endure it . when some christian gave him a question , he had no idea , even he could n't join other conversation with others . it wa a fiasco . having universal and general knowledge on many academic subject can help people have broad reationship and successful social life . and the enormous knoledge will support his specific field and lead to good success .
