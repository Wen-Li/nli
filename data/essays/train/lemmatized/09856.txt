i mainly agree with that statement . i think it is obvious that advertisement make product seem better than they really are , because this is what advertisement are there fore . the aim of advertisement is to make people buy the product . to succeed best in this , advertisement have to make the product seem a good a possible . now it is clear , that with some technical support , it is quite easy to make a product seem better than it actually is . for examle , advertisement often use very bright and shining color , but if you compare the product with the picture , the real color are much more ` normal ' . furthermore , advertisement often use graphic , tabels or word that appear scientific to make the product seem more special , but if you know a bit about the fact displayed , you realize that they only tell very common thing any other similar product also ha . apart from making the product seem better , advertisement also use psycological mean to make people buy the product . especially , they often try to implicitly convey a message without letting the customer really be concious about it . for example a laughing person on a photo make people think using this product make them happy . or they try to make it plausible to people that they absolutely need this product because they belong to a certain groop . so advertisement often specialise to reach a distinct group of people like young parent , elderly woman or middle-aged men . however , i think , sometimes advertisement can also help to make a new product known or to inform people about special quality a specific product ha and how it can serve them . from a customer 's point of view , i think a middle way is best : one should not completely mistrust advertisement because they can really draw one 's attention to something useful , but on the other hand one should neither trust them blindly . from my experience i think it is best to either try the product , so you know if you want to buy it again or not , or ask someone who ha already tried it for advice .
