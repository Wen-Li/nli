giving enough time to help community is an issue that ha being of interest lately , specially in what regard to young people . it is believed that young people nowadays do not spend enough time in this activity a they should . even though many youth organization have been borned in the few couple of year many others have mostly dissapeared . moreover , there ha been an important change in life style during the last decade which ha modified the availability of time for this activity . on one hand , there is evidence that this statement is not true . we have observed over the last couple of year an important increase in the number of youth organization which try to cover this necesities and perform this task . many young people get enrolled in them and try to help others , mostly in an anonymous way . in what regard to my country , i can think of several different organization that try to encourage succesfully young people to get involved in their community . on the other hand , it is true that organization encharged of this type of activity excisted before , mainly related to church or to religous belief . during the last decade , the sentiment of religious involvement ha fallen drastically and young people nowadays do not usually relate to this group . therefore , while it is true that many youth group which try to cover this neccesity have arised during the last couple of year , they are mostly covering the empty space left by religous group . in the same sence , young people nowadays have le time to devote to this type of activity , since personal career have becomed more demanding . for instance , in many country fifty year ago woman did not use to work or study and while they were young they usually took care of helping their community . nowadays , young woman have a professional career a busy a man do . as a conclusion , i believe that even though it is true that young people spend le time helping their community compared to what young people devoted to this activity fifty year ago did , is also true that young people 's life ha changed drastically and there ha been an important reduction in the amount of available free time to perform them . therefore , i do not agree to the statement , since the word enough is not proper for this context . young people devote le hour but it may be enough given the amount of free hour they have left after taking care of all their responsabilities .
