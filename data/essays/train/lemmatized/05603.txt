i agree with the statement that it is more important to understand idea that it is to learn pure fact . i have several reason supporting my opinion on this topic . firstly , today nearly all fact are available anywhere at anytime . so the importance of learing fact is weakening . instead the time coul ; d be used more sensefull getting concept . for instance , it is possible for a history class student to get nearly all historical figure he need in the internet . there he can get them all day long , and with the help of mobile computing nearly everywhere . secondly , concept are very important to learn , because you need them in order to create own idea and concept . facts do not help much with that . for instance in my job a a controller i do not only have to know how some special figure , for instance the return on investment or the earnings of one year have to be calculated , but in order to improve our controlling instrument , i have to figure ot new figure . to do this , i need to know how to create them . i need to know which number would me of use to our management . to create new figure it is also necessary to have a general idea of mathmetical concept . these can not be learned by heard , but have to be understood . once understood , i am able to apply these concept to work on new idea . thirdly , for high developped country it is very important to be faster in developmet than for instance the fast developping country in asia . they are able to copy our industry product very fast after they have been developped by u . therefore we need to be faster in generating new product , new idea and new technology . you do not learn to create those new technology by learning fact . it is only possible to learn creating them by learning concept and idea . in my point it is really important to understand concept and le important to learn pure fact . this is because in future it will become more and more important to be creative and inventive . in order to achieve this , it is highly appreciative to have well educated , creative employee .
