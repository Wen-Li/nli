i think that it is more important for the student to learn the idea and the concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason of idea and the concept are more important is that learning a certain subject will be much easier to be understand by student . students have different way that they learn . some of them learn from fact , but most of them learn from idea and the concept . most of the time the fact can be difficult to understand . teacher can teach the student the basic idea and the concept in order to understand easily and quickly . for instance , the first few week in my government class my teacher taught by using fact , but most of the time , many fact were confusing to me . then , i asked my friend for help , but most of my frind that i asked were confused on many government system . after , i talked to my teacher on where i wa confused on and the way he taught u . i requested to him to change how he taught the class and he did the next day . my teacher use the fundamental of idea and the concept of the whole structure of government system and law . i learned many valueable and interesting information that i did not know . also , my teacher made this subject easy to understand and more entertaining so that all of his student can focus and get interested into this subject . if my teacher did not use the fundamental of idea and the concept , i would not understand the whole structure of government system and the government system and law . in conclusion , learn the idea and the concept is more important for the student than it is for them to learn fact . from my eperience , using idea and the concept can , not just fact , improve learning skill . class taught with using idea and concept can be more understandable .
