for the time being , the number of car in the world ha not stop growing . indeed , the technological breakthough with h.ford and the ford t provided the idea that each people would have a car . but nowadays scientits want to make people aware of the danger of car . so we can wonder if in twenty year ther will be fewer car in use that there are today . the market of car in rich country is almost full . in consequence , the number of car will not significatively . new car are bought just when the former one is over . in other way a lot of people especially in poor country do n't even seen a car or maybe so rarely . in my opinion when those country will developt everybody would like to fulfill his dream and to buy a car a people from rich country did . besides this problem , people that owns car feel they depends on it because they take it so oftently . but recent problem like polution make the point that the worl would have to reduce the number of car . the gaz exhauced by car make the athmosphere poluted . those if we want to provide a available to live earnt , we would have to change our behaviour . several govenement purpose bill to struggle with the widespead of air polution . one of the major point is to put public transport much more available in big city . in my belief , this is a big step forward to recuce polution and also car in city . if governement want to reduce number of car in rich country it have to make provide some waranties like developing also public transport in public area . for poor country , governement are experienced with problem of rich country so i hope they will not make the same mistake . before that car become usual , they have to provide a good network of public transport not for population to see too much interest in having a personnal car . finally , i support the idea that car will be fewer in the futur because , in my opinion , the problem of mass produced car is quite widespread and so governement will be smart enough to take them responsability to provide network of public transport and even to put restriction . however , i think that we have to focus in industry now .
