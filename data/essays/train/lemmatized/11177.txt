somebody think that learn something besides his or her specific subject is kind of wasting time and energy . however , if you have a broad knowledge of many academic subject , it will allow a better understanding of your specialty . a broad knowledge can also help you if you unfortunately meet with accident . furthermore , it give you more topic to talk with friend . with a broad knowledge of many academic subject , you can do better in your specialty . i believe everybody know sherock holmes , a famous dectective . what made him the greatest dectective in the world ever ? a broad knowledge . holmes is an expert in violin . he ha also achieved great success in chemistry . what 's more , he ha several book published on the how to raise bee . it is the large amount of knowledge in all the subject that made him a distinguished dectective . i remembered in the case that several people died after they have gone to swim in a small lake , holmes used his biology knowledge to solve it . it turned out that there wa a rather rare poisonous jellyfish in that lake . if he had put all the effort on his specific subject , maybe he would not be able to solve it . when meeting with accident , a specific knowledge may not offer much help . let u assume that poor david met with a leg fracture . if he specializes in chemistry and nothing else , he might sit there , cry . however , if david ha some knowledge besides chemistry , he might know to place some ice on the injured leg . what 's more , a broad knowlege give you many topic among your friend . almost no one like to hear a professional talk on the development on brass . however , nearly everyone fancy a talk on the history of opera . more topic among friend , do better in your specialty , and know how to do if met with a accident , a broad knowledge of many subject is definitely better than merely specialize in one subject .
