nowadays , a lot of business are growing and developing . as far a business is concerned , people who have started a new business want to succeed . in my opinion , the people who want to earn a lot of money have to try new thing because of following reason . first of all , if one ha a new idea , it would provide people interested . the most important thing of success in business or earning a lot of money begin with people 's interest . people do not interest what they already know . in contrast , upon seeing a new thing , they interest about the thing and buy it . thus , an interesting idea or new thing which are never known to people could succeed one 's business second and last , the world is changing rapidly and variety . one who know how to do well and doe the same thing , he/she is never going to be succeeded because the world is moving fast and requires new thing everyday . for example , one of the camera company ` canon ' ha changed new way on digital camera . the camera of canon ha ` cmos ' censor which is the heart of camera and in the past , ` cmos ' is the worst and cheapest chip . canon , however , ha developed this censor new way that is totally different way than before . ` nikon ' , one of the rival company of canon , wa tha best of camera in the film area . in contrast , nikon us ` ccd ' which is sharper than cmos but expensive . the censor ha given from ` sony ' , hence , it is expensive and it is not their own technology . through canon 's new trying and developing it new censor become the best camera in the digital camera . in the past , film is the only method of taking picture , however , the world photography market ha changed by digital and canon tried a new technology and finally succeed . in conclusion , the world need new thing and people need new thing a well . therefore , if one want to succeed , i would suggest two thing . be a creative to make a new idea and try a new way to succeed .
