i agree with the statement proposed , here is why . education ha walked a long way to become what it is today . take your father 's class and you will be confronted by a `` memory rule '' approach . everything ha changed and the place of the memory is one of the biggest victim of this evolution . `` learning fact '' ha the fatal flaw of beign associated with memory , otherwise , how you will remember a date , an event or the name of one president ? . a fact is just a tale of something that happend . the last couple of year saw an increase in education research . ten of theory ha been proposed and in some case , ha been tested . one ha emerged a the current champion : constructivity . constructivity mean that everything we are going to learn ha to be builted on the shoulder of something we already know . that way , we are not dealing with a million of separate fact to remember but with a few knowladge network that will activate a couple of related idea every single time we touch one of the idea belonging to the same network . what 's the magic of these ? , that study had proved that we have three tipes of memory , a short-term , a mid-term and a long term one . short term allow u to dig a lot of information but to lose it fast , medium will let u remember that we have touched the subject , but the detail will be gone . long term memory is composed of all the thing that impact u in a unusual way or the thing we use every day . constructivity try to place our knowladge in the medium and large-term area by changing the frecuency of use .
