the world is in permanent change and evolution therefore we should follow this evoluion in order to improve our life and knowledge . so there are some people who try new thing and take risk rather than keeping the old method even if they know very well how to use it . personally i like to be different from the others , so i use all the time new technique and method . this new way to do is very important because it could be a source of success . to illustrate more what i am saying i have an example ; last year i had my training at a small company exactly in the financial departement . what i discovered during my presence , at that firm , is that the financial staff doe not use the technology in order to improve the quality of the work . they do not have a computer , imagine a company now in 2000s year and it doe not have a computer . this cause a lot of problem to the company especially in analysing the daily situation of the company . so what i did is that i talked to my bos in order to buy some computer because they will improve the work and he will need le people . after a very long discussion he accepted to buy just one computer at the begining in order to test what i said . after one week he told me that his staff is very satisfied and they have now more time to do other important thing rather then calculating some small operation . but if you decide to work with news thing you should accept to take risk but i think that is a very logical result . because you will use new method and maybe new procedure that are not all the time good . so to solve this problem , i think that rsiks represent a part of our life especially if you decided to try thing differently . but you should remember that when you take a lot risk you will win more . to illustrate that , i will tell you an example based especially on my life a a would a bussiness woman . when i invest more money at any project automatically i think about the risk that i run . because it will be a hudge a the imprtance of the money i invetsed . so to sum up i want to say that i agree with the statement simply because new method and risk are a part of my professionnel life .
