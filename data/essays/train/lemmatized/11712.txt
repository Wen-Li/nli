i totally agree with this sentence : young people nowadays do mot give enough time to helping teir community . but why young people don t give enough time to helping their community ? in first , we are going to see that young people nowadays are busier and have a lot a thing to do . at last we will analyze the fact that young people are more concentred on themselves . first of all , nowadays , young people have very busy . indeed they have a lot of thing to do like doing sport , shopping , going to cinema , doing some trip , calling friend , organizing some party . . their life is different today because the generation changed . the society changed too and the mentalites too . that s why the free time that young people is more interested tahn before because they can do a lot of thing , more than before . they are busy to do other thing than to helping their community . then , maybe it s not their fault but just a modification of the society ( more modern ) . before , young people haven t a lot of thing to do that s why there were concentred on their community . moreover , it s not the only reason . young people nowadays are more concentred on themselves that is to say they don t think to help the others , for example in helping teir community . because of their eductaion too , they can not think about the community . parents don t learn the real value of community that s why they don t know what it s talking about . young people complain about a lot of thing but they don t know that nowadays their life are easier than before and funnier . according to me , young people should more thinking about the others and should learn how they can share with people and be more open . to conclued , i can say that this problem could be arranged if parent take care about it . young people have to make up their mind to be more accesible . according to me , young people should in first be more open and this could changed a lot of thing .
