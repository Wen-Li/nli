i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do n't give enough time to helping their community . rather , young people today are a dynamic force bringing change to the community and nation they live in , especially here in south korea . first , young people involved in the community have transformed politics , most notably in the 2003 presidential election . second , youth are playing a major role in jeju island , helping to get the island recognized a a unesco world cultural heritage site . third , young koreans are helping the nation in it 's geographical naming dispute with japan . for these reason , it 's not accurate to say that the young generation is n't involved in the community . young people have brought the wind of change to politics in south korea . in the 2003 presidential election , conservative lee hoi-chang wa poised to win the election , leading in all the newspaper poll . young people , whose voter turnout had traditionally been quite weak , supported the progressive candidate roh moo-hyun while the older generation supported lee . the old generation also had higher voter participation , so lee wa considered a shoe-in by many . however , 2 week before election day , mostly 20 - and 30-something campaign activist for roh moo-hyun campaigned for free in many local community throughout the country . the decisive factor wa the young generation ' use of the internet to bring far-flung community together online . the result wa a come-from-behind victory for pres . roh moo hyun . this never would have been possible without the work of youth politically involved in the community . second , youth in jeju island , south korea are the vanguard of the environmental movement there . in 2002 , jeju island wa designated a a unesco biosphere reserve because of the uniqueness of halla mountain , the highest peak in south korea . this designation came about due to a signature campaign conducted by the jeju federation for the environment , a quasi-student organization run by youth . also , the same young people are pushing to have jeju island recognized a a unesco world cultural heritage site in 2007 . these youth are having a huge effect on jeju island , helping it to become more internationally-known . finally , youth in korea are helping a large community , the nation of korea , in it dispute with japan over the naming of the east sea/sea of japan . up until the mid - to late-1990 's , no one in the world ever questioned the naming of the sea to the east of korea , also known a the sea of japan . japan unilaterally named the ocean between korea and japan during it colonial occupation of korea in the early 20th century . however , thanks to the effort of student and youth , this name began to be challenged . students participated in an internet campaign to lobby official of international geographical naming society to reconsider the name ` sea of japan . ' because of the overwhelming response from koreans , mostly the young , the international geographical naming body changed the name from sea of japan to east sea/sea of japan on nautical navigation chart . this would never have been possible were it not for the effort of korean youth in the international and national community . there are some who underestimate the participation of youth in their community , but the reality is that youth are having a major impact on their community through political , environmental , and international activity . youth are important member a well a future inheritor of their community .
