in this statement of choosing if will be fewer car use than there are today , i think my answer is there will be fewer car in some place in the world and some other place staying the same of even increase the car using . the following point are my reason for my opinion . the first reason is different country require different us of car . we know that in the world today , there are different level of country . what i mean is there are developed country and developing country or even poor country . different country require differents us of car like china . china is such a big country and it definitely require lot of car a it got the biggest population in the world . some small country like tailand or canada , they got maybe just one ten of the population a china , therefore they might have le us of car all the time long . the second reason i think is because car make too much polutions . there are million or even billion of car in the world . everyday we see car driving on anywhere a a city living people . in some big case like hongkong , beijing , newyork , these are major city in the world and certainly a too much car inside there will be more poluted gas coming out . people can easily get sick by those gas a it originally come by oil . also the plant out in the nature and all kind of enviroment . as people start to realize it is important to protect the nature enviroment , i think that some country will reduce the us of car in the following year . besides thoes who did a good job of protecting the enviroment and they need car us , these country might keep their number of us of car . the last major reason for my answer i think is about the new technology . today we can almost see computer anywhere in the world , we can see many differents kind of invention coming out . these new thing are invented for helping human being to live better . i surely to say that it will do same on the car . in many developed country like america and england , german . there are always new production coming out , there is now already a kind of car can use by no gas and just by water ! the resource is something we can get easily . anyway , my opinion is that a some powerful country can do very good on inventing , they must reduce the old type of car before . in a word , car are still important in some of the place in the world and some of the place are getting rid of them . it depends on how you want to use car and the most important thing related to it , which is the environment .
