i agree entirely with the opinion that it is more vital for student to comprehend idea and concept than it is for them to learn mere fact . why study fact , or even worse , learn them by heart to pas final examination when you will forget most of them shortly afterwards , anyway ? therefore , it can be far more beneficial to focus on teaching the general understanding of idea and concept . research in psychology ha proven that you will remember far more easily anything you have understood instead of learning it by heart . and normally , you learn fact by heart because there is not much to understand . moreover , in an increasingly dynamic environment , both in professional and private term , the learning of fact could be in vain . circumstances change more and more rapidly . what wa important to know now could be replaced by completely other fact who have to know in a couple of year . that is the case , for instance , if you have to change your profession a a result of structural change of the employment market . as a matter of fact , expert say that these kind of structural change will occur more and more frequently , so many people actually will have to change their profession several time during their life . the understanding of idea and concept can also be helpful in any profession a it offer a larger flexibility . you can not study all kind of solution to a problem by learning fact . because the problem is , that a a student you can not possibly know what kind of concrete problem you will have to face later on in life . as a result , it is far more important that you learn and train a certain approach to solve problem , by concentrating on studying major idea and general concept instead of investing too much time into learning fact . in conclusion , i would like to state again that the understanding of idea and concept is more important because it is in every respect more beneficial to the preparation for a increasingly dynamic environment . it is easier to remember idea and concept than it is to remember fact and , last not least , idea and concept are more useful a they allow are larger flexibility to new challenge .
