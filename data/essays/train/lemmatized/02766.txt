in my opinion , i think that for student it 's more important to learn fact . during each lecture of something , professor are used to give the student too many idea and concept which it will never remain in theyr brain . so , the best way to teach something to the student is give one thousand example about fact that can make improvement to the student . on the other hand sometimes is more useful for student just learn the basic of idea or concept understood during the lecture or studying in the textbook . infact , student 's get in trouble when he ha to understand a fact which is full of concept or idea that they didn ' study before to hear about the fact . moreover the answer at the question could be a different a the brain structure of everyone . although i suggest to everyone to improve theyrself learning fact i think that for somebody it 's not the best way to look for . firstly , student who ha a good memory should use it to remember the idea and concept that they have been learn . instead student who ha just a vision memory might use this memory remembering all the image presented in a lecture a a fact explaining the issue . moreover , who get easly in confusion reading different concept , most of the time difficult concept , could't undestand what he ha to do in some exercise or in any text where 's showed the issue . finally , i think that student have to do want they want
