i have been studying hard since i wa a child and now i am about to graduate in electronical engineering . in my university path i chose the subject i wanted to study and where i wanted to specialize in , so i surely think that it is better to acquire skill in one or few field than to have a broad knowledge , mainly because you will never be able to have a culture so wide that cover all the subject , and secondly since i am a pragmatic person and i would like to be expert in my field . human culture cover a huge variety of topic and subject so i firmly think that no one is able to build such a vast culture . in fact i think that even the smartest person of the world such a einstein could not know everything . moreover studying many topic can create confusion or problem to remember all the thing you have tried to learn . according to my pragmatic attitude i greatly prefer to acquire skill in a peculiar topic or field in order to become an expert . having a deep knowledge only in one field will help me to find a job that completely fit me and where i think i can contribute actively . in fact i think that everybody ha to contribute to the benefit of society in which he/she life and there is no better way to do that than focusing on one problem . in conclusion i absolutely disagree with the statement since i am trying to specialize in one particular field of elecronical engineering in order to become an expert . in fact i think that i will serve the society in which i live in a better way because focusing on one issue i will have many more possibility to resolve it .
