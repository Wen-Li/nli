the idea that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are ha growned to be old-fashioned and too simplistic . in my opinion , perhaps in the early day of advertisement the public wa more naive and advertiser themselves considered that the effect of advertisement wa much more powerful that it really is . today , i believe that advertiser have come to realize that it is much more effective to convey emotion and concept related to the product than to state it wonderful and nearly miraculous property . why ? for two reason . first of all , the public is n't a naive a some people might consider . they might be tempted to try a product that seems better than it really is , yet come to find that it is not a good . this can be harmful for the product 's sale in two way : the consumer will not buy it again , and he/she will feel cheated , misguided and angry . therefore , the image of the product will be damaged . as a second reason for why i believe that advertisement do not make product seem much better than they really are is that advertiser know that it is better to work upon the real-deal . that is , tell the consumer that what they see is what they will get . however , advertiser do try to make consumer think that what they will get is what they need . i believe that other than displaying the property of product on television or radio , advertisement work more and more on consumer 's need and motivation . they wo n't lie , they know that their consumer are n't fool , but they will try to convince you that a particular product is the one that best adapts to your need . it is a sutile yet powerful difference .
