i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are a few reason that can support my opinion . first , most people are having lack of time on excessive studying . the second problem is mass medium 's too much attention toward people 's private life . i agree with the statement , because of their lack of time , and the bad effect from the mass medium . as the first , people do not give enough time to helping their community because of the lack of time . most young people are really busy nowadays . young people who are under nineteen are studying really hard to go good college . so , they can not think anything but studying . the people who graduated college also have difficulies to participate on helping their community . althought they are free from the college , their studying is not finished . they have to work hard to get a good job , such a lawyer , or work in the big company . because of their lack of time , they can not paticipate on helping their community . in addition , the mass medium , such a television show or radio suffer young people to think about nothing , but just themselves . nowadays , most television show are based on people 's private life , that contains a famous movie star 's personal life or private thing . through this process , young people who watch televison the most , are attracted to think about their personal and secret life than the commununities . there are a few main problem that made young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their communitie , . their lack of time because of studying , and the mass medium 's too much attention toward people 's personal life . if these problem can be solved , young people will spend more time on helping their community .
