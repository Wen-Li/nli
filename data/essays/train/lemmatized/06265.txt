every one on earth ha his own idea that could impress or depress the the environment around him . the presence of these idea doe not cancel the fact that fact are dominant in our world . there is a huge difference between the two concept and most people get mixed up between the two . ideas are a special state of a person 's own inspiration and thought like the idea of inventing a time machine while facts are thing that remain unchanged for the rest of life like the fact that sun revolves around earth . although the fact are what taking the people 's concern , idea are more important than fact because from idea we can reach out fact . one good example of an idea developing into a fact is space rocket . first scientist had an idea of creating a method of transportation that could link u to space . they had the picture of a space rocket and they started to apply that inspiration and thougt to the facility they had ntill they fullfilled their satisfaction and got the idea of inventing a space rocket to reality tha it became a fact . now it is a fact that we have a method of transportation to the outer space . another good example is the idea of making peace treaty among different country . although not all country are on good term with each other , some worked really hard and succeeded in getting the idea of making peace treaty with others to reality that it became a fact . so that little idea developed into a fact that every one know about . in conclusion those who really think that fact are more valuable than idea are mistaken because a presented above we can see that almost all fact we know on earth have developed from small idea . basically , for one to reach or develop an idea , he must first start with an idea ; he may or mmay not realise that idea but a a matter of fact he could not have reached this fact without having an idea at first . that is mainly how ech minimal fact ha reached u today .
