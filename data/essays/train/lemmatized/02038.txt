i partly disagree with the statement because there are several fact every student should know or learn . for example , in history class , it is impossible to teach history comletely without learning fact that happened in the past . how should student know important date if their teacher leave out the information ? certainly you can combine the two method in your class but they should be both handled with the same importance . moreover , fact are something the student learn in order to understand the idea and concept behind them . to set up another example , think of the mathematician fact that one and one is two or maybe even of the theory of relativity of albert einstein . what concept can you learn compared to any of these fact , or what is the idea worth without the theory behind it . what i want to say is , that one is not able to live without the other in many case . on the other hand in addition to that , it is often said that within new method of teaching , it would be really more important for student to understand the idea and concept because if you once understand something you will be able to keep it longer than if you learn it by heart . that is why a lot of teacher try to help understanding some kind of process by figure or image of themselves . to draw a conclusion , in my opinion , you can not say that one thing is more importortant than the other . learning fact by heart is of course le important nowadays than it wa in the past because new strategy have been invented . i actually think that these fit together really well , because you obviously get the best result if you first learn the fact and afterwards you may try to understand the idea and concept behind it .
