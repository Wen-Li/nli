i believe that the young people enjoy life more than the old . there are two major reason for this claim . at first , the young people are healthier than the old people . health is everything for human . in fact , if one is not healthy he/she can not enjoy the life at all . most enjoyable human activity , such a relationship with the other sex , eating , doing fun thing such a playing sport game , dancing , etc. , require healthy people . as human age they lose their ability to enjoy most of these activity a much a they used to . for example , a 70-year-old man can not eat food that have high calorie and a number of unhealthy ingredient . in contrast , a 20-year-old college student can eat from the same food a much a he want , and nothing happens . secondly , older people loose their enthusiasm to do a lot of fun activity because of their financial risk . older people tend to avoid doing activity not only because of the health risk , but also financial risk . unfortunately , most of the fun activity in today 's world cost a lot of money , such a going for a vacation on an expensive island . at young age people do not think about financial risk of their action because they think they have a long life to compensate . however , older people would think that if they overspend they may not be able get a job and work to make up for it . although it may be argued that older people would have more money to do the expensive activity than the young people , i think that young people have the potential to work hard and save enough money for these activity . in conclusion , i strongly believe that a the people get older they enjoy the life le because of a number of limitation that aging brings to them .
