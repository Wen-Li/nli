this is a problematic issue we are going to speak about . it is not easy to steadly take a position regarding this statement : i can just provide my personal experience on this matter : it 's true that i do n't use to spend time in helping my community but first we need to make clear what we mean with `` helping mine community '' . i 'm not into any social organization or no profit company and in this way i 'm not helping my community , that 's true . but simply because i have not time to do that since i made a choice : i am a student and i chose to give the priority to my study in order to get a serious job , which obviously , if well done , will bring help to my family , my city and hopefully my nation , or better my own community . probably you'r gonna ask me which kind of job i 'm looking for , what background i have and what study i 'm taking to have such a weird idea about `` helping your community '' ... well i 'm a normal student and i 'm going to graduate in engineering , and that is quite common ! also the job i will find will seem normal , but not the way i 'll work . i am sure that if everybody work with interest and good purpose they do help their community , instead of working not motivated and not well prepared . infact working not well prepared of course is negative first for you , and for your entire community a well . so , my job right now is to study , and i have no time for being a volunteer helping my community in the `` standard '' way . i think that the best i can do in order to help my community is to keep studying hard , find a good job and work hard and in a positive way , and of course my job will bring benefit to my community . this what i mean for `` helping our community '' .
