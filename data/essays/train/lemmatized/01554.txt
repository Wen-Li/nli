it is true that fact could be helpful sometimes . it is for example quite good to know some important date of history or some name of important politicans . however , i completely agree with the statement that it ha a bigger effect for student to understand idea and concept ! there are several reason why i think so . one is that if a student really understands a concept he can adopit it to new issue or circumstance . a good example is the concept of fieldwork , the basic method in anthropology . if i had learnt just the fact about that method , for example who invented it and so on , i would have had a lot of problem during my first real fieldwork in cameroon . but because i learnt the concept and idea behind , i could adopt it do my specific situation . another reason why i prefer understanding concept to learning fact is that during that process of understanding you will made up your own opinion and you will create your own idea . so understanding is an important basis or fundament for further research question or further thought in other area and by the way you will learn all the important fact anyway , i am sure . as a last reason it is just much more interesting to learn concept than fact . so all the class and book i have taken or read which were based on concept and idea , i really loved . and i can still remember the thing and topic written in these book ! but the fact i had to learn for some multiple choice test i forgot the day after . . for all these reason i think it is much more efficient and fascinating to learn and understand idea and concept on scientific issue during university time . and , after all , i think it will be much more useful for a further academic or other kind of career .
