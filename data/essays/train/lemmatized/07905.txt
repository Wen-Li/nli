in these modern day , every each person want to be successful . i do n't know if they want it because of surviving or just for their ego . i recognized that there are really much more people are becoming successful . why ? i think they are doing the right thing that they already know how to do well . there are reason but first , people can start what they want to do with experience and second , sometimes taking risk can cause to go deep and fail so people would n't have a chance to get thing well . i think experience is the most important issue . for example my mother always tell me to wear sock but i never do it until i have got a really painful stomachache ! and i always tell my mother not to warn me about anything because when bad thing happened to me i understand well . there 's another example that , my father is a pharmasist and i want to be a pharmasist too . why do i want it ? it 's all about my father 's experience . he know everything about pharmact so i can use his knownledge . i see my father is working and i know how he doe it . i do n't want to be a teacher or engineer while i have already have my father a a pharmasist . sometimes people want to take risk but trying new thing is not safe at all . if they want to have a business they have to think about first and they should get information or help from the people who have experience already . i think this is such a mindless thing ! being a successful person is not so easy like leaving everything to chance . sometimes people need to be excited , and taking risk is a exciting thing but it may not brings luck . if people want to survive and have a good life they need to be successful so they must do everything well . i 'm sure if they have experience they would be lucky because they would make their life easy .
