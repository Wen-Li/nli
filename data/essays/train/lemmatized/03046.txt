many people on earth are said to only care about their own little person . it is surely true . but no one could ever say that they do not contribute to helping their community . directly or not , willing or not , everyone doe help his community , a everything is nowaday done for the good rolling of society . yound people are no exception and i would say that they contribute more than any other category of person to the development of a healthy society . here is a very simple exemple . mark , twenty-year-old student in biology . mark leaf in a flat a most student do . he ha a part-time job in a fast-food restaurant to pay his bill and doe a job no one would like to do for him . he ha no choice but to work but help his community by making nice tasty hamburger to two hundred of people a day , making them happy a they eat the best burger in their life . going to a fast-food doe n't seem that exciting , but some people do it on a regular basis . this would n't be possible without mark . moreover , by studying biology , mark will one day fill the empty space left by an old and tired citizen in an hospital or in a laboratory making research for cancer . we can say that mark contribute twice to helping his community by feeding it inhabitant and assuring it future health a he study . no one can say that young people do not give enough time to helping their community because , a they make their way through life , they are assuring the survival of this community : by studying and by doing different job no one want to hear about . another aspect of young people 's action for their community simply is their wish to travel . lots of cultural exchange are made in high-schools and college . this allows community to know more about other culture in the world , to be more open-minded and comprehensive toward people of other background , that may be leaving in the neibourghoods . it stengthens the link inside the community and between different community .
