`` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . '' i disagree to this statement because of the following reason . first , there is a problem in defining the term `` enough time '' . it remains unclear how much time any given person should spend helping the community . furthermore , who decides what is helpful to the community ? which thing that have to be done in a community should be done by volunteer and which should be done by professional ? these question arise when accusing young people of not spending enough time helping their community . apart from these terminological problem , there are so many young people doing voluntary work for the community . i experience that they spend their time working for the red cross , helping at home looking after elder family member , getting involved with the scout or at church . these are just example of the many place in a community where you easily find young people helping the society . the impression that young people nowadays do not help the community can arise , because today , a lot is expected of the young : during the morning , they are at school . in the afternoon and at night they are busy doing their homework , having a job to earn extra money or they have hobby ( e.g. sport or music ) . due to globalization , competition between young people ha become more . they have to work harder in order to be prepared for their future . nowadays , in a lot of profession , one doe not only have to compete with people from one 's own country , but with people world-wide . modern mean of communication and transportation have made the world a very fast-paced and competetive place . in order to be able to compete , young people nowadays have to be succsessful in a lot of area : school ( to acquire knowledge ) , hobby ( to show diverse interest ) , job ( to earn extra money ) , and community work ( to help the community where they live ) . as shown in this text , i disagree with the hypothesis given . first , there are problem with the definition and quantification of `` help '' and `` engough time '' . second , there are so many young people who work for the community . third , young people have to prepare their own personal future . did young people in former time spend more time to helping their community ?
