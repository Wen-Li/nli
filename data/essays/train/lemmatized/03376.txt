i think that a young person enjoy life more than an old one do . a child have much energy to spend in play , in fact he experience the world playing . in contrast an old person prefers to be quiet and avoids to move if he do n't need it . a teen first want to discover new thing , he increase interest , he fall in love , he start the way to become an adult person . differently an older person remember what he did and could become a savior . in reality i do n't think that the difference is the enjoiment of life , indeed a person can appreciate life if he want , but the topic is the quality of life . a young person life better because is more sane , dynamic , courious , stronger than an older one . i am twenty-two year old and surely i should enjoy life more than an older man , but i think that a child should be better than me in enjoying life in the same way . though this comparation depends from the range between the age of the two people , i am sure that a young person enjoy life more
