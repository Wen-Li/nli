i disagree with the statement that young people nowadays donot give enough time to helping their communities.the reason which i quote for supporting this statement are a follows : firstly , coming to the family they live in , they dedicate enough time towards their family member and help them in all possible way . for example if a boy from a family is asked to take his grandmother to a hospital for a medical checkup , he make time and take her . also he help the family in getting the necessary household item , paying of bill like current , water , house tax etc . , secondly , coming to the friend community the young people make time in enjoying with the friend , help them in preparing for the exam , also clarify the doubt if any amomg themselves . they can develop good communication skill and team work by dedicating time for their friend and helping them . suppose a youth is enrolled in the blood donation community he register his blood group along with all his detalis . if anyone is in dire need of a very rare group of blood , and if that person asks him for his blood he shall definitely donate his blood . not only are these the example , there can be many example which we find recently . for example coming to the orkut online access community , i am a memeber of it . i also became a member of many subcommunities like toefl ibt , m spring 2007 , visa online . i fine the member of those community answering actively to my query like what are the rule of toefl ibt , how is this different from cbt , how should i apply to university , which are the best , which is the best time for attending a visaic interview , etc. many youth helped me in finding a solution to many problem i faced . youth nowadays behave more responsibly . donate money to age old home , destitute , blind etc. , they help these community one wat or the other by voluntarily servicing them . many take great people like mother therasa , gandhili a their role model and try to identify these great people in themselves in summary , i say that there will be youth nowadays who doesnt give enough time to help their community . this may be because they might be unable to find the time for their communites or may be they might be busy with some important schedule , which they have to definitely attend to . also helping community may involve money which many cant afford . otherwise , many youth find happiness in helping out their community and they can cherish these memory for long .
