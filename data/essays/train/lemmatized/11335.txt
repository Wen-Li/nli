i agree with this statement . i have three reason which can support these statement . first , recently in there are some severe enviroment problem in the world . it is grobal warming and air polution . to solve these problem many country start not to rely on car a much a they can . for example , they try to make good transportation . some country ha low to support reduce the car . in canada a car which ride on more than three people can use road for bus and track . peaple do not get in the traffic jam if they are on this road . second , nowadays some country are growing , like china , india and asian country , and african country . growed country ha good transportation . come to think of tokyo , new york and london , there are so many subway 's line . growing country have so many population . if they have good transportation so many people use subway and they do n't need to use car . third , because of aging sosiety , young peaple become le and people who can drive a car will be fewer . in the future car demanding become fewer little by little and car 's price become expensive . such car people ca n't buy . i think old people use transpotation . these reason why i agree .
