in my opinion you can be successful in a variety of way , and a a result of different effort . for instance you have the people that take many risk and innovate in the economy ; i think they are needed in the society and in the evolution of thing , but they are not the only one needed . in the other hand we have people that know how to do thing and that stick to what they have learned in the process in order to be confident and efficient . successful people that take risk are generally agressive in their way of reacting to change in the market and sometimes they will innovate without reason . they wo n't stay in peace when thing have changed , and furthermore they will make change to the way of making business and to their sorroundings . this kind of person doe n't rest and is always thinking of way to improve the odds of making a good deal , a an effect they will push others in the field to innovate too in order to survive . there is no recipe for success , so to think that taking risk will help you assure that you will have success is totally wrong . when sometimes taking risk could help , sometimes it could make more damage than estimated . certain kind of person have other characteristic that are important in the economy , those person are the one that stick to what they know and that are efficient in that way . this way of being give them security and help them to be efficient worker , confident of the way they react to the market and it change . as a conclusion , there is market for everyone , and the different kind of being are needed in the way
