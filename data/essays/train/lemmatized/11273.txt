in the old time , people belong to the community . when they lived in the villege or town , everyone knew each other . but , pepole move to city nowaday so that their life style change . in my opinion , young people do not give enough time to helping thier community because they have to study hard , interest change for playing , and do not have aquaintance in the community . first of all , young person have to study hard so they can not have a abundant time to take part in the community activity . recently many people go to highschool or university . comparing for one hundred year ago , they must study much more time . if they do no go to higher education school , they afford to participate comunity activity . however , they do not have a time so they can not help them . second , young generation interested in playing than hepling community . for example , playing sport , music , and dance fascinates them . they feel community meeting are boring and not exciting . moreover , nowadays many young person are looking for more interesting event . they think community are not important so refusing attendance . finally , city life change the community ideal . as usual many people move from rural to urban place so they do not know each other . if you do not have a relationship around your house , nobody join the community . in addition , city life ha a bad human relationship . they are not interested in one another . in the conclusion , modern civilization afffected the social relation a well a technology development . young generation would change a lot of aspect . they got a variety of possibility . thus young people do not need to help their community because they have to study hard , interest change for playing , and do not have aquaintances in the community . therefore i do t agree the statement .
