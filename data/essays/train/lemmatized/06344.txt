some people might say that knowledge of many academic subject is better , rather than to specialize in one specific subject . i believe that one should surely pose knowledge about various subject but it better to specialize in one specific subject for many reason . firstly , student are taught many academic subject in the college but when they pas out and look for a job , they are asked to prove skill in one specific field . for example an mba student can choose specialized course while he is studying like marketing , finance , international business and information technology . this help the student to choose the field he is going to work in the future . a software development company would always prefer to hire a student who had taken up information technology a specialized course during college a it expected that he would understand the work better which he is expected to perfom during his job . secondly , it help student to take up course in which they are good at . for example a student might not do well in most subject in college but they would be good in one . so they should be given an oppurtunity/liberty to decide the field they are most interested in studying and making a career . few student are weak in mathematics but it doe n't matter to them if they are good in political science and they want to make a career in politics or administative service . i have even come accross few parent who give their child the liberty to choose they career goal or a specific field of education , no matter if they are n't doing well in most of the academic subject . in conclusion , i would like to express disagreement for a person to posse broad knowledge of many academic subject . after all if a person is `` jack of all trade , master of none '' he would not be able to work in this competitive world which exists today .
