most people would say that young people enjoy life more that older people do based on the fact that young healthy people have all their life in front of u and are never eager to experience more and more thing . as far a i am concerned , i do not agree with this statement . indeed , whereas young people have to face life difficulty , the elderly have not to deal with stressful life anymore since they are retired . moreover , older people have the rest of their time to share love with their family . first of all , when you are young , you are facing a lot of paramount difficulty and choice such a the employment and nowadays , unemployement , the right person you will marry , how many child you really want , how you will manage to earn enough money to feed your family and buy your house and so on . is it still obvious that young people enjoy life more than older one ? indeed , older people have overcome these kind of difficulty and are becoming more peaceful in their mind than in their youth period . older people have nurtered a long-time experience , thereby implying they have learned from their mistake and are accomplised individual . for instance , if someone were not completely satisfied with his wife/her husband , he/she ha probably divorced and got married to another person and currently living with her/him . therefore , in comparison with his previous marriage , the person will obviously say that he is enjoying life more than he did on previous time . moreover , their job experience and relating stressful live is behind them . older people could be retired with their accumulated money earned during their employement period where they zerre young . although they could not afford what they want when they were young , they usually have enough time and money to buy what they really want . secondly , young people are usually dedicated to their work , this leading to forget their wife/husband and child . the main goal is to earn money in order to live happily but the family suffer from this behavior . older people are settled in life and have usually earnt enough money to share it with their entire family and spend more time on holiday with them . for all the above-stated reason , i contend that older people enjoy life more than younger people do .
