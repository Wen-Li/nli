do you agree or disagree that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community ? it is a great question to be offered because nowadays young generation ignore how to helping and contributing their communites more than the past . i totally agree that instead of giving enough time to helping the society , they concentrate themselves more . first of all , because of the education from the family and the society , they teach the young generation that they should think themselves first then the other thing , even the thing are about the country and the world . the education tell them that no matter what happend , they should develope themselves first . according to this kind of theory , nowadays the young generation becomes more selfish then the past one . due to this situation , i think that while we discus that if the young people should pay more attention in their community , the education of family and society should be discussed at the same time . secondly , nowadays no matter which country you belong , it is kind of tendency that there are fewer child in a family , for instance , mainland china , only one child in a family is normal . depending on this situation , the child doe not know how to get along with the other people , how to care the peer and how to contribute himself for the society . surely , he will not focus on the need of the community and the world . the first task he think is how to develope himself well . besides , nowadays parent always give too much pressure on young people 's grade , and i think that 's also the reason why the young generation ignore the community and society . to the summarize , it is kind of worse tendency that young generation doe not pay attention to their community . in my opinion , if we hope to develope more wonderful society and world which we belongs , the first task we have to do is teaching the young generation doe not be selfish any more , on the contrary , they should focus on the society and world more .
