i am agree with the idea that in twenty year will be fewer car in use than there are today for differents reason . first , people are more concerned about the pollution on the environement than year ago , and they see a problem that we have with the higer temperature since few year ago . some people made the decission to use the car only for a specific and relevants situation . they use the public transport to go to work , they discoverd that with bus or metro they arrive faster , and they above the trafic in many city . second , health on sociaty it is every day more important . many people use a diferents way to try to be foot on their daily week . it is became more popular use the bike a personal transport . in many european city a dublin , barcelona , paris . .. goverments ate concerned and the are preparing the street for people who use the bike . also it is a good idea for have le pollution on the city and trafic more fluent . other people prefer to walk or runn when they go to work and they dont have to use the car , they keep foot without of cost . it is a big descision when you decide to buy a car . they are very nice and handy bthey are very expensive thing to have . cost a lot money the insurance and petrol , it is other reason for why i think in twenty year we will have le car on the street .
