i dissagree with the opinion that the way to travel in group led by tour guide . in addition , traveling alone give you more benefit . first of all , traveling alone give you much freedom . you can go every place where you want . tour guide ha a certain schedule . so visitor have to follow the schedule even if they want to see in same place where thy are . in my case , i went to china with guide . we have many schedule in a day . if we arrive at one place , guide said , `` get off bus and i will give you 1 hour to travel here , after one hour , let 's see in front of this bus . '' at that time i feel i am just like a machine and child . one of the reason that people want to travel is having a relax in a comfortable place with freedom . travel with guide take my freedom in traveling . second , traveling alone give you more time to think . if you travel with group and guild , you feel happy in a new place with many lovely people ( family , friend , girl/boy friend ) . feeling sympathy with people who you love in new palces is very good thing . but it might reduce to have personal place and time . because you should follow busy schedule in a goupe with guide . for example , i went to australia alone and tailnand with my friend and guid . feeling in these two travel is very different for me . in australia , i felt lonely in every night and thouht my family and friend . so i realized that they are really important people in my life . also , i had much time to think my future. ` what i want to do , what i like to do . ' finally i had got some result in that part . on the other hand , traveling tailand with friend and guide is just for fun . we had great time there . we did swiming for whole day , ate delicious food and did shopping . it wa fantastic but just for fun . for this reason , i recommand traveling alone to my friend . i think traveling along not with group led by a tour guide is better choice .
