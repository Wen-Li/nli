it 's 21th centry now , and if you visit to a developed country , you can see car everywhere . cars have become an important part of our daily life , on weekday we drive to work , at weekend we drive to tour . for myself , i do n't believe that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , car are too convenient . everyone want to have a car if they could . and , a the technology improving , to producing a car become much more easier than before . what 's more , they are even cheaper ! in the past , you may found someone complaining about car are too expensive . nowaday , you 'll only hear that people could n't decide which one to buy ! some family even have two or more car , for each family member they have their own car . that 's something you ca n't ever imagine before . the second reason i would like to talk about , is the developing country . take china for example , think about how many people are there in china . what will happen if everyone in china bought a car ? maybe it will be a super traffic jam , but it 's something that could really happen . in the recent year , the developing country , such a china , india , and tailand , had grow repidly on their economy . what make it worse is that they are also the region that have the most population around the world . combine the two factor , people and money , it will be a huge market for everything , and car , of course . or maybe you could tell the 600 million people to take the bus ? well , that still need a lot of bus , and still increase the number of car . i do know that car have lot of bad affect on our environment , and i hope that the number of car could decrease through the time . but , will that be happen ? i do n't think so . maybe we need more education on people about how the car hurt the environment , so that the number of car wo n't increase so fast . but to decrease ? i do n't think so .
