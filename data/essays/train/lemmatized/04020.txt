i really do not agree that young people enjoy life more than the older do . i think they enjoy different area of life but with the same intensity . it look like that young people are having fun with a lot of physical activity because at that stage of their life the body is always full of energy and rich of sensation . on the other side i see a lot of old people prefer mental activity such a reading , meditation and conversation . this happens just because at their stage of life they learn and take advantage of their mental skill . for exemple , you can see in the same park a group of kid having a blast during a soccer game , and their grandparent sitting on a bench and be completly immerse in a conversation or reading a book . even with music we have two different world : young generation enjoy fast and laud music that they dance till they drop on the floor . adults get excited with le hectic music that they can listen and dance a well . but , if you go to a dance studio , you can see that regardless the age and the kind of music people is dancing , everybody is enjoing that activity . the intencity they put in what they are doing and the reward they get from what they are doing is not related to their age . they just get from different sorses of joy sorses that are more fitting with their physical and mental status of the age they have . my impression is that both , young and old people get a lot of joy from the activites that they choose . like i said at the begining , they choose very different way to spend their time but the intencity and pleasure level they achive , i am sure is the same .
