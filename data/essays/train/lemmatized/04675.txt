to my mind , most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , there are a lot of advertisement which lie . for exemple , for product to wach white tee shirt , ad say '' more white than white '' , which is impossible . then , we discover there are a lot of liing advertisement when we try the product . when we buy a product to wash bath room , they do n't wash alone althoug advevertisement say . finaly , we find a lot of advertisement for only one product . he is always new , but there are the same ingredient . if we must n't be radical on this subject , we can say that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
