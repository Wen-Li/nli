it is n't difficult to me to answer this question because i have thought since i wa a child the same thing . according to my own experience i 'm sure that the better way to create and improve my student career and first of all my personality is to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . i refuse the idea that the best way is to specialize in one specific subject . i 've grown up into an academic system that ha always gave me all the chance to learn about everything i 've wanted . during these year i spent a lot of time to read about a large amount of material a scientific paper , historian one , literarian one and much more . i think that for a person with a broad knowledge is easier to find job , to create relationship with other peole , to follow the most part of television , paper , and book discussion . moreover if you do n't close any door on your back you can always come back and start with another subject . by the way i trust that also is important to specialize in one specific subject , because nowadays the world of work requires more and more specialistic worker . for example i 'm attending a course of biomedical engineering and i know that the society want to hire personal specialized the deepest a possible . and the world of science is not the only one ; also in economic field there is a great specialization . the university are following this way of learning proposing a large number of specialization course . in conclusion it could be seem a contradiction but for me the two idea are related : i believe that before is more important for a student to have broad knowledge of many academic subbjects , and then , only at a second moment , to specialize into specific one .
