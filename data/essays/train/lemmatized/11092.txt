this is a very extended statement , especially among old people . i believe , it is totally unfair to judge young people according to what it is done by a residual part of them . i have been working with inmigrants for more than two year . most of them coming from east europe with any spanish knowledge . our task is not only teaching the language but also offer them a pleasant face in an strange country . it is revealing how many people work in my ngo . we are more than 250 individual ! . on top of that , according to a public survey conducted by an impartial valencian agency , 2 out of 5 people under 28 are enrolled in any type of ngo . i prefer to see the glass have full than half empty . of course , i noticed there are more people that do not collaborate with their community that those that do it . despite that fact , in absolute term , there are more than 150.000 member in the city of valencia , that devote their time to handicapped people . i find this figure to be undoubtely compelling . a recurrent excuse provided for those who do not collaborate relates to the lack of time to undertake such social task . i agree . social work require a personal effort , but on the other hand it is all about organising yourself . i am proud to say that i can do all the thing i did prior to my engagement with the ngo . it depends on how efficiently you plan your spare time . in conclusion , i disagree with the statement provided . there are milions of young people around the world who deliver assistance to the other for free and those figure are increasing . therefore i do not share the pessimistic view of the statement and what it is more , i invite everyone to collaborate in the way they can since what you will receive is much bigger than what you will give .
