i agree that successful people have the ability , the courage or the skill to go beyond what they already know and they are able to do , for trying out new and sometimes risky thing . the history is itself full of example of scientist , leader or religious figure who gave a huge contribution to mankind by going further and passing the border of what wa known and widely accepted . their aim wa finding out new idea or new way of doing thing . in italy , in the 14th century for example , culture and science were still dominated by oscurantism and religion . the catholic church wa very powerful and many scientist were prosecuted and killed because they used to profess dangerous idea for the system . the world wa believed to be flat and none wa questioning this . it wa then when columbus decided to move forward and , convincing the king of spain to supply him with three small vessel , he sailed into the unknown , towards west to seach for a new passage for reaching the far east . eventually he discovered a whole new continent . this is an example from history but also nowadays it is possible to see how people who look for what is undiscovered can be successful . we live in a knowldege economy and big and well established company are often challenged by men and woman who discover new idea and lead the market towards what ha n't been explored yet . an example is google , whose inventor shown a new way of using internet search for market purpose . therefore , in our daily routine , we should keep on looking for what is new and we have n't tested yet . we should not forget that taking risk is the way human being develop or , in other word , like steve jobs , apple ceo said we should `` stay young , stay foolish !
