is not easy in this case to completely agree or disagree with this statement . reason being that idea and concept can not prescind from understanding of fact . a fact is something that is happened , while a concept is the reason why it happened . these two thing have to go together for an individual to be able to catch the complete essence of thing . for me , what this statement say , is that what happened in the past can easily be ignored , that fact , what truly happened before , play little or no importance in a student 's learning experience . every history teacher will scream when hearing such an opinion . in many case , fact can teach a lot more than concept . just think about our whole story , the story of mankind , and the big crime we would commit when ignoring what man did before u . you can study about culture and philosophy , about religion and mathematics , but you will never completely understand about yourself and the others until you 've learned about what ha already happened and what ha already been done . the concept of genocyde can be explained with hundred of word , but will never be fully understood until what happened ha been studied and observed through document and video . so the concept of , to give a contrasting example , driving a car can be explained with load of word and idea . but only when it come to actually show what happens if you take a certain action you can fully understand about driving . at the other side , i must say that without a complete understanding of basic concept , it is impossible to study proficiently any subject . whatewer will be shown to you , always needed will be a clear concept that explains the meaning of what you see . a major difference between an italian university and an american one is in the different learning method : while in the italian institution fundamental is the necessity of remembering word by word what is explained in the book , without any practical application , in the american method this study is accompanied by an active class discussion and group participation . the first method will obviously bring every student to memorize the concept studied , but sometimes without even understanding them , while with application and confrontation in the class , basic understanding of the concept is needed to constructively participate and learn . without concept , there is no understanding of fact ; without fact there is no `` real '' understanding of concept . the two thing must go together .
