i disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic subject because it is confusing and wasting time . when you want to have broad knowledge of many academic subject you wo n't be able to focus on specific subject . so , you probaply wo n't be able to determine which subject you should choose . in addition to that , you will be wasting your time to know about diffrent subject you batter save this time for your subject that you like for example , if i am interested in art i should look for subject that are related to art . that will make me more interested in art and also having more knowledge about art . however , if i am interested in many subject i will spend alot of time to know about many subject that i am n't really interested in . in short , having broad knowledge of many academic subject is confusing and wasting time .
