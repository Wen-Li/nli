in my oppinion it is nowerdays an important ability to be flexibel and to have a good overall education . but on the other hand many company are searching for the best people for a specific job . and if you want to be the best in a special direction you will have to study or learn this section very intensive to know what exactly you have to do . the main topic in my business career wa to be where people want me to be and do what people want me to do , because if it wa not the fact , the people would ask someone else to do my job and would do this also in other job . so my task wa to do everything they wanted my to do . on the one handside this ability saved my connection to the people who gave me the job and on the other handside the people made propaganda and a kind of advertisement for me and my good work . i never ever had a second of saveness what would happen on the next day in my life . i needed job and i needed to say yes , because of i would said no , my famly would not have anything to eat on the next day . if i were specialiye in one spezific job or direction , i would have to live with the fear that someday someone would come yo me and say that it is over and that this section is closing because there is no more need for the job i do . with my flexible ability this could not happen to me , because i could do anything they wanted me to do . germany with it high unemployment rate is the best example for good academical educated people , who are after their exam without a job because the education they have do not fir with the jobprofile . with a felxible education with broad knowledge it is easier to find a job and to save the job .
