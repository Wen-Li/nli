i agree with the statement that it is important for a student to undersand idea and concept . i belive this because in basically a student should should have curiosity to know more new thing this can be achived by understanding the idea and the concept . without curiosity there is no fulfillment of the purpose of studing . one reason i belive this because while understanding the idea student develop his practical way of thinking the subject and new idea raise question in the mind . in order to solve those question understanding the concept is important . for example when the student is working in a physic laboratory if he is familer the concept of the instrument then he can play with the instrument otherwise he hesitate to touch them . another reason idea and concept are more use ful because in understanding the subject the understanding of idea and concept is important . for example if a student dont know the cocept of vibration he can not understand about the sound . lastly it is important to understand the idea and the concept is when we are familer with the idea and the concept of the subject then automatically we come to know the fact . all the time we can not relay on the fact ever time . in conclusion to to above point it is important to understand idea .
