in twenty year there will be much more car in use than there are today , if nothing unusual like a world war happens . and the main reason to support this idea is just because the world 's population is growing very fast . in particular , the population of developing country is increasing at a rapid rate , and many of these country are attaining very high rate of development . let u think about china : it ha a population of more than one billion people . china 's economic growth rate is 9 % . nowadays still many people in china is poor , but a long a the country continues to recover , more and more car will be demanded . the same phenomum is occuring in country like brasil or india . the fact that the amount of oil to produce petrol is limited and will no longer exist a the main powering source used by car and other mean of transport , doe not imply that the amount of existing car will be reduced in twenty year . first , after that period , there still will be petrol enough to be used by car , and second , there will be other alternative source of energy like hydrogen . like or not , car are nowadays our principal mean of transport , even people do not use them in an efficient way . many people go to their job by car , and prefer it to the public transport . but , for example , most of the time an average person us a big car of four place for this purpouse . this cause many traffic problem and pollution . to solve this new public policy are necessary to reinforce and to enhance the use of public transport by making it cheaper . in conclusion in twenty year will be definetively more car than today but they should be re-invented . they probably will be different : smaller ( just for one person or two ) , they will consume le energy and use alternative-clean energy source . .. this issue is related with our great goal a human , which is to care about sustainable development
