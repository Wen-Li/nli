usually this statement is true now day , if you dont take a risk it is unlikely that you are going to change your current situation , obtaining a broader experience is a rich contribution to your overall performance in life . however in my opinion i think that this ha been true for only the last couple of year . decades ago , one would not see beyond what he now , because achieving self preparation and richness wa nearly imposible , much of the capital owned or technique learned came from family heritage , the clever thing to do wa to especialize yourself on what you best knew . now day the story ha changed and generally someone who think out of the box and investigates on differtent area , constitutes a succesful person . this is not very ackward since our economy and social trait have had a tremendous shift . aknowledging a vast array of skill will make you more efficient on your everyday life . i think that this is true because now everithing is linked to one another , you may find many thing that are related to your job but are not the base of your focus , this will force you to adapt to the problem in matter . no longer duty only involve a very specific duty , but they require other skill because the scale in which thing are done now , and the way communication have narrowed the world enable many thing to interfeer with others . in conclusion , been focused in one thing is clever a long a you dont require further learning on other area . a narrow mind will gain efficient result at a particular thing but will fail to absorb any other skill that may help him on the future . in the long run a compensation of knowledge will outperform a narrow minded person .
