when we talk about successful people the first thing come into my mind are scientist , inventor , person who is a pioneer in his speciality , and many other example , and a we can see the common factor between all of them is that they all started new thing and ofcourse took great risk to do them . so i totally agree that successful people do try new thing rather than doing what they already know how to do well , although some may be successful by doing this but in my opinion they are not a successful a the pioneered one or even close to them . there are many factor that i thing result in making those people more successful than others , for example , when they start something new , they have very minimal or almost no competitor in the feild they are trying to do somthing in , even if there are competitor they still trying a they do . another issue is that when somebody is inventing something new for example he will have the opportunity to be a legend for the whole world because simply if he succeed everybody after will follow , use or adapt his invention and he may be remembered for this for century even after he die and this is a great success . another issue is that make me feel that they are more successful is the amount of work they do , they try harder and harder to come up eith new idea and this required great effort and cause high appreciation of there work un like the lower amount of work needed by already known thing even though there are risk for them not to succeed , because it is not something anybody have ever tried to do or even thought about , i thinkl that you will do nothing new if you did not do risk . so with all appreciation to those who are doing already known thing i do think that those who try new intresting thing and take that risk are the real successfull people .
