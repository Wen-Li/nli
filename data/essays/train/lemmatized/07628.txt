i assume that people who are willing to try new thing and take risk are more likely to be successful . taking a risk also mean that there is a possibily that one is going to fail . therefore people who take risk are also more likely to fail than those who do not take risk at all . it also make sense to me to hold on to a traditional method if people have been successful using this method for generation . if one learns from a person who ha been really successful and ha achieved a lot , it would be nonesense not to use the information in order to do a good job yourself . trying to be successful by doing what one already know well is definetely safer than putting oneself at risk . still work a well a technique have approved throughout history which show that people who have been innovative gained success for example henry ford with his first appearance of mass production in the automobile industry . in this world of globalization one ha to try new thing in order to succeed and it is also helpful if one is able to adjust to new condition easily . to my mind the people who enjoy their work are mostly successful and to enjoy the job should also be the most important goal when choosing a job . poeple who only do what they are told and keep on doing so for year are more likey to get bored while working . therefore it is also a personal experience to try new thing and take risk . if one really want to be successful in business , creativity and the willingness to take a risk are two very important character trait one should not miss . it is reasonable to try out new thing because if you are not going to do it somebody else will and thus will also gain the success . we live in a world that constantly change and it is always better to be the one who initiate the change than the one who is force to adapt to the change .
