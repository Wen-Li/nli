i agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . people in the future , they will not use car a much a today , because they will be more awareness about the polution or negative effect of using car , and there will be many other transportation way except car since the technology will get much and much better . in twenty year , people who live there will not use car a much a nowadays , because they will pay attention about the negative effect very much . for example , even in today , there are many television program which alert of using car too much . they usually say using too much car will cause global warning and it will endanger human . like this , there will be more television program or other medium which talk about the negative effect of using car in the future , it will make people think they should not use car . it will cause le people will buy their car . there will be fewer car in the future . people who live in twenty year will not use car a much a nowadays , because there will be many way of transportation except car , since there will be much better technology . for example , in japan , especially around tokyo , there are high skill of train . there are more than 50 line of train around tokyo , and people do not use car that much there , since there are enough train to go to their destination . although japan produce car very much too , the more convinient train make the le people use car there . therefore the high technology let u use another transportation , but not car . i think people who live in twenty year will use fewer car than today . alerting many negative result of using too much car make people do not use car , and having a better technology like train make le people who have to use car . i hope environment will become better because of fewer car in the future .
