in order to sell a product the first thing you have to do is advertise it , to make it known by the people , otherwise they product wo n't be sold , doe n't matter if it is good or bad . in the next paragraph i am going to explain why i consider advertisement make product seem much better than they actually are and why company do this . first , we have to consider the subject of advertisement a a branch or subdivision of marketing , in other word marketing us advertisement to promote the product or service the company trade . in order to make the product popular , the marketer , publicist and publicity company have to make the product very attractive sometimes over highlighting the product 's feature and benefit . sometimes they create multimillonaire campaign to promote product that are not necessarilly the best in the market . for example in eastern europe a couple of year ago , they make a very big promotional campaign for one car , the dacia . the ad said that is wa a cheap car , the `` car for the people '' they stated , that is wa very economic , that have a traditional european design and that it will be the best deal for family and young people . what they did n't mention wa that altough it nice exterior design , the interior wa very poor and cheap , and even more serious , that car needed a lot of visit to the mechanic after the first 100.000 mile . as a result a lot of people wa unsatisfied and agry with the company that told them that wa the best option around . furthemore , when we consider advertising to make product look good , we just have to watch the tv commercial , or the internet where company promote their product in a very glamourous way sometimes . we can see beautiful model , actor or actress talking about a product or service that is not really a good a it seems . for instance , recently a friend of mine wa interested in a computer he saw on the internet , the design seemed very nice , with a wide screem and a lot of software installed . after a few month the operating system stopped working well and that computer did n't come with the original system back up disk , so he have to pay a lot of money to get it fixed to the same company that sold it to him . as a conclusion , nowadays in the market we can find a very wide range of product that seem to be perfect and that last forever . the true is that is not always the case and we always have to try something before we buy it in order to verify what the seller promesses just to sell more unit .
