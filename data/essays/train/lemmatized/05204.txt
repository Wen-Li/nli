it is an important decision , how to plan your syllabus . some student prefer to take a lot of course and expand their knowledge , whereas some other prefer to specialize in one specific subject . in this essay i will dwell on the advantage of specializing in one subject and argue in it favor . there are at least three reason why choosing one subject is better than trying to keep balance between many subject . the first and most important reason for me is that this way people concentrate on one thing and do not feel anxiety about time-management and deadline . in contrast , student who take three or four subject are very busy and stressed , because they have to prepare for many exam and see different lecturer , which is confusing and the result are not a good a those of the one from the one subject plan . in addition , when one specializes in one subject then this person ha more chance to be well-informed about it and do his best , being sure he recieves the best knowledge and invests in something substantial and prosperious . the second reason is that this kind of studying give the opportunity to work and gain your own money . usually student depend on their parent and have to explain why they need money , which is not very pleasant . for instance , i used to work when i did not have many lesson and i wa happy that i wa able to succeed in working and doing something important a an adult doe , relying on my own experience . the third reason is that the student can pay more attention to their relative , friend and even their hobby . moreover , life is not only studying and if we can not enjoy it , we should rethink our point of view . for example , student , who do not have fun and only study , get sick and miss the both chance . the psychology have proved that working hard is not the best for our health and we should take rest from time to time . in my opinion , it is better to specialize in one subject , because this choice make u have more healthy life , which ha is successful too .
