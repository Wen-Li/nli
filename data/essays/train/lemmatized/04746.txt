i agree that young people nowadays do not offer enough time to helping their community . considering too many entertainment in their environment and too many academic assignment in their school , and too le timie to rest , young people certainly spend insufficient time on their community-related task . first , it is too many attractive entertainment in our modern society that make young people indulge themselves in these entertainment . for example , in my dewelling city , there are full of all kind of entertainment , such a pub , movie theater , and department store . the young people spend their each weekend and holiday on shopping , seeing the movie , and playing . as a result , they have le willingness to devote to their community . second , it is a great number of school assignment that prevent young people from attending community affair . today , young student have more homework , assignment , and quiz to complete than before . because of the more accessibility of of knowledge and information , young people are required to do more practice and take more examination during their education , which reduce their possibility to join community . finally , it is lack of enough resting time that young people might not have extra energy to engage in the community affair . for example , in my country , young student have to attend cram school after formal school class . also , they are expected to take various art or music class only because their parent ask them to do so . in this case , they could n't have enough time to rest , not to mention that they plan to help their community . in summary , i agree that today , young people give much le time to helping their community for several reason , which may be mentioned above , too many time on entertainment and school assignment and le time to rest .
