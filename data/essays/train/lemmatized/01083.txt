i disagree with the statement which is `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' in my opinion nobody can learn something just by knowing what the subject is about . they need to know what they do , what they mean , what they symbolise ! to start with , how is it possible to learn something without knowing the fact ? just by understanding the idea and concept , you basically summerize the subject . if you call that more important than knowing the fact ; go head and good luck in life . if you do n't know what are the fact you wo n't be able to picture what is the real meaning of that subject . do you think that we would be this civilized and this technolized if we did n't use and learn the fact that ha been done about a similar action that might be done in the history ? history is a great teacher itself . for example , many leader have read about history but they read them carefully and fully . they didnt just read the summary because if they did n't just want to know the main idea . they also wanted to learn the fact . if you read them over and over again then you might be able to understand the mistake that they did in the past , so you wo n't do them also . facts are always reliable , because you can not chance them after they have been done . all our life , we live by fact . if the fact were n't that important do you think that government would have law which punish you for some certain fact that you do ? when you are just a child , you fall and hurt yourself or burn yourself and so on , then you get the fact , the idea of whatever you do ha a fact . in this world whatever a person doe ha a fact ! it 's just the way it is . we may not be able to chance it but ; it is for sure that we can try to learn from the fact from what we did . we are all human and we all have to except the fact that we have a destiny and to be succesful in that line of destiny we have to look at the fact not just the idea and the concept so that we can be successful in life !
