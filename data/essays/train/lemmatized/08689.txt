whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject ha been controversial among many peoplr . howener , i basically disagree with the statement that broad knowledge is better . i have two reason for this . this is because and most of all , the age want specialist than generalist . as a matter fact , too many people know a lot of thing , but they do n't have deep knowledge . furthermore , without specialized knowledge , one can not succeed in some field . accordingly , we should focus on the specific subject . for example , if student just learn about general idea and do n't study in-depth information , they would can not fantasticaly function in their field . from my thinking , i am sure that concentrate on specific subject is very very important . in addition , by focusing on some narrowed field , one can build his or her power of concentration . generally , poeple who do n't have power of focus are not likely to success in their field . besides , when we focus our body and mentality are strengthened . therefore , it is wise for u to concentrate on the specific subject . it is reported that 79 % people in the u.s live healthy and soundly when they focus on the specific subject . from this data , i realized that it is essential that concentrating on the specific subject . to sum up , i strongly support the perspective that it is better to have one specific knowledge than have broad knowledge . this is because it help to succeed and live healthy . therefore , having the specific knowledge is one of the factor having positive influence on our education , .
