there are many option for the university student in their study . someone can get deep in one topic and pay all his attention to this topic or ahve broad knowledge of many academic subject . my opinion is the research should focus on his study to get all the information about his topic , however he should also follow what is going on other subject . the definition of the world master is someone who know all the esential information about one topic . since it is difficult to reach all the knowledge about many topic , the reasercher should choose one specific topic and concentrate on it . in today world , knowledge is like ocean . if a fish want to see all part of the ocean , it will exactly lost his way . there are some example of people who chosed many subject to study and becomed succesful . for instance ; decards who is called a the father of geometry is know a one of the biggest philoshofers . newton who set the basis rule of the phisic , ha a lot of theory that are used in the modern mathematics . however , the number of these scinetics are limited . many good scientis are concenrate on one topic . in the universites it is difficult to find a professor who give lecture in two different departmant . however , the researcher should have the major knowledge from related subject to his topic . for example , the electronical enginieer working on television research and development department should know what is going on in computer technology to carry out his research . to sum up , it is better to specialize in one specific subject while knowing what is going on aroud .
