i think it is true this question because the student is more attention of the fact and for he is more interesting to learn the concept and the idea . i think he is more interesting seeing the television because in the time mean the concept and idea is very good for the preparation of the student . for example you do n't see the reality rather we see the documentary , because the first is n't shape the mind while the second in the time shape the student or all to think and at the reason of the world . another example is in the university the student during the lesson learn this and in the end or during the lesson he asks question and problem in those specifically . he show interesting for understand the concept and the idea , and the professor is more content to talk about your lesson . i think he is for more reason that the student and the young he is appassioned at the fact in the world and to learn the what will be the future for we .
