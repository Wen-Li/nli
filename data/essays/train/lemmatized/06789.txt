no i donot agree with the statement . youngsters are now a day really looking active to spare time for helping their community . community may mean by area , by religion , by race and many . now a day youngster have been looking for helping their home country in a big manner . i have many reason to support my statement . in olden day youngster used to work hard for themselves and their family . but it different in the modern case . youngster are being in the front row of doing service to all of their community . they help them in all the field . donating blood to the people in need , helping old people , lady in all aspect . students are conducting welfare programme , encouraging poor student by giving scholarship , helping the flood affected people by joining the natural disaster scheme and many to tell . the young people who are working in corporate job having been sparing time on saturday and sunday in serving the needy . they are enjoying happiness of helping in such manner . i had an example to support my staement . the following example took in my native place guntur . a small boy who is affected with a viral fever named denguea fever is in need of blood a blood from his body ha been completely going out . so one student gave 2000 r to that person father and asked him to give an advertisement regarding the need of blood . as my blood group too wa the same i went to the hospital to donate . by the time i went there were about 800 student who came there to donate . the boy in need is not a brother or relative of anybody . but all the student came there a they had the intention of helping people in their community . another best example for supporting my statement is the army of our country . according to the record of 2005 our army contained 80 % of youngster who were even ready to offer their life for their mother land . finally i strongly stand by my word that young people of modern time are sparing more time for helping their community .
