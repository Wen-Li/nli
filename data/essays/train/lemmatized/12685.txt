i strongly believe that it is crutial for student to learn and undertsand idea and concept than to blindly learn fact . it is important to do so a it is neccessary for a person to undertsand information before applying it . many a time we will encounter situation in our life where we may need to apply concept or fact that we know . information that can not be applied when needed is completely useless to u . it is very easy for people to learn and memorize fact , but if they do not understand what they memorized , information that they just absorbed will prove to be completely useless to them . for example , if a student learns a basic concept required to apply in a simple problem of mathematics , he or she can not use the information they learned in order to solve a more complex problem of the same kind since they never were able to understand the main concept behind it . if a person just learns fact , he or she is not excercising their ability to question . questioning is a very important aspect in learning . if people do not question , it is very difficult for them to develop intellectually . as questioning lead to reasoning and without reasoning one can not understand fact . if we learn fact blindly , we are not applying the potential within is . this may cripple our ability to advance . there will not be any difference among human and computer , except that we perform human function such a breathing and eating and they do not . after all , computer were created to learn , not think . facts are inputed in them , they do not have the ability to understand concept . we created computer because we understood concept and idea , we can not advance if we stop taking advantage of our abilty to understand and reason .
