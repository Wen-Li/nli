ideas and concept prepare the base of something that want to be learnt . learing from fact mean to experience something and so it mean to have a deep knoledge . thus , from my point of view it is more important to learn from fact rather than to understand idea and concept . if not , you do not really know what you have learnt . in order to learn something , the understanding of the idea and concept is an important thing . for instance , if you are learing about literature during a cert period of time , it is very important to understand the concept that it ivolves such a the social context , the different author and the style of writing . this create an important background of knoledge about the literature but you do not learn everything because you do not read the literature . in contrast to the above , if the fact are learnt a better understanding can be obteined . for example , instead of trying to undestand the idea and concept of this literature century , the option of reading the main book of this century should be taken . if the book of the main writer are read , the student will be able to infer a great deal of thing so that a better understanding is reached . most of the thing that are learnt by isolated concept and idea can be drawn by a carefully reading of the most important author . therefore , if you try to learn fact you get the concept and idea that you would need to understand something while with the other way around is not possible . thus , i think it is more important to learn from fact rather than idea or concept .
