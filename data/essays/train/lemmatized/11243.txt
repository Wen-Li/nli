sucessful people try new thingsand take risk rather that followin the crowd and repeat the thing which is already known to him . i firmly agree with the topic and decide to advocate with the comment . it is the vision of great eminent people who have taken great risk in life and try to catch their dream had made humanity to reach the zenith . their audacious capability in different field have brought glory to the civilization . one such example is wright brother who invented the aeroplane . the dreamt that one day man can fly ha resulted such a phenomenal discovery and today people and travel from one corner to another in instant time . same a the case of galvani , tesla and edison wose effort and risk have generated electricity in business world taking risk ha led to development of of great industry and due to this people economy ha flourished . great business man like henry ford , mittal and bill gate left their happy contended job and took up the challange to establish great business empire . another example wa lance armsstrong who disregard ailment for cancer and went on winning the great cycle race all great indepedance war are soaked with the blood of matyrs who sacrificed the risk free family life and jumped to fight against authority to free their mother land . although i agree that their are factor and high risk of failure . but without risk one can not reach his dream to come true . success is not absence of failure but overcoming of the failure . because of men who had tried new thing mankind had made such platonic leap . man ha reached moon , climbed everest peak thus the risk taken by people may apparant br pain staking but with time and effort harvest fruit of success .
