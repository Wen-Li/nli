first of all , we have to determine whether we are supposing to be in a high school or in a college situation . that definition make a great difference on my opinion . in fact , if we are in the high school case , i think it is important to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . the reason is that high school student have to primarily go over a many subject a they can to realize which are the one they are most interested in . second , a wide knowledge of subject give the student a wider view , it `` open '' their mind , and get them the opportunity to increase their culture level . however , this is not valid for senior high school student because once they reach the last school year before college , they should now focus on what they would like to study in the future . for instance , if a student want to study advertising at the university , he should start taking art class , or economics lesson , so that to receive an introduction , a perspective of what he will study the following year . on the other hand , talking about college situation , i disagree with the statement since i believe that , once you graduate from high school and you get prepared for the university , you should concentrate yourself on a specific subject . that doe not mean , by the way , that you do not have to study other subject . it simply mean that you have to channel your study on the subject you will need in your future job . taking the previous example , if i want to become an art director in an advertising agency , i will not continue studying language , math , physical education , and the other subject i wa used to study at the high school . instead of them , i will choose subject that directly concern with advertising , such a the history of advertising , the economic method of advertising , and other subject that best fit whit my future job . in conclusion , i believe that having a broad , wide knowledge of many academic subject is very important for it let u make up our mind about our future , but once realized our primarily interest , we should focus on that one and start becoming who we want to become .
