the issue if it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than fot them to learn fact is commonly discussed in our society . in my opinion the student knowledge is improved when thaey undestand not only the fact but the underlying idea and concept . in this essay i will support my answer with specific reason and example . facts are definetly the student knowledge base . before any consideration the student need to know what happend . so teacher need to explain the fact without any comment or personal opinion . in a second moment fact are trasposed into idea and concept . teachers should help student to understand what drove the fact and what conseguence it had . in our society is really important not only to know what happen but also undestand the idea and motivation . a great example is 11/09 . everybody see what happend on the twin tower . the real knowledge come from the undestanding of the nature and the couse of the terroristic attack . only in this way student can go deply in the problem and try to find a solution . in conclussion i'am completely agree that student should analyse problem leaning the fact and undertand idea and concept that are behind the fact . only in this way student will be able to find correct solution to the problem that they will occur into .
