cars are the major transportation in the modern society . in my opinion , there wo n't be fewer car than there are today . people are getting more and more today so that they need more car . also , people 's life condition are getting better . many family need more than one car . the techology is developping , people discover many type of energy source for car . many kind of energy are cleaner than the regular gas . the car ' number is growing with the population . people are the heart of the society . the society move for the people and the people move with the car . in america , people would n't live without the car . people are getting more and the car have to be more too . it 's easier to go around with car than the publish transportation . people have more money they will buy more car . in america , alot of family have more than one car , and futhermore some of them have three or four . people just do n't satisfy with just one car . it seems like how many car or what kind of car you have can show how rich you are . if they have extra money , they want to buy car . the energy for the car is much cleaner than before . in the modern society , the techology is always going so fast . in the past they think car make the air very bad and in fact , they did . so people try so hard to find many type of different energy for the car . and they did it . no matter when , the car will get more and more . they need them so bad and they wo n't get rid of them right away , maybe for 100 year
