i think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because school do not provide these opportunity to the child and child lose their familiarization with their hometown . nowadays , the child are expected to enter a high-level collage and get a master degree because they will get haigh salary or high position in the company if they can achieve to take a collage education . therefore , parent demand the school to give a good education for their child , and school make a rigid study carriculum . they give student a lot of homework that do not permit student to have a free time to do something . they study hard even after the class and remain staying in the classroom . they are getting tired and can not have a time to helping their community . by getting tired , they do not look for their surrounding . in other word , they can not afford to care about their community . in addition that , nowadays the connection with neighbor are weaker than before . sometimes a child doe not know even the neighbor 's face and the number of family member . it cause the careless to the neighbor . if they do not know the neighbor , they do not think they have to consider about neighbor . in conclusion , what i would like to say is young people do not have enough time to helping their community because they have to use their time by studying , and they are not familiar with their surrounding environment . however , we should not complain the child about this . actually , we , adult made this situation . we grab away their freedom and , we do not child to have kindness to the surroundings . we should know what the important thing which we have to teach child , high level education ? kindness to others ? it is important .
