cars using with in the 20 years in twenty year there will be le car in use than there are today . i strongly agree with this statement . in twenty years people must be responsible about their environment and they can reduce to use bad thing . nowadays , thechnology development very fast , no one think about , twenty year ago , to use an internet and to reach milions of knowledge le than one minute , and i can believe that in twenty year we use different veichles differ from the car . we have to because we have lot of reason to do it . first of all , oil stock is almost finishing and the scientist seek out the alternative energy supply . so , not maybe in twenty year but it occurs very soon , we can use different transportation . it is very nice to use different thing . secondly , people know that this type of transportation cause a pollution . not only damage the environment but also the people influence it . therefore peole get sick very easily . if we don not give back bad environment to the child , we have to solve this problem . moreover , car also cause a traffic problem everyday . when you are live in a big city , in the morning it is too difficult to go to work . sometimes when the traffic too heavy , it takse two hour to go work . in addition , scientist are working a different type of transportation , forexample they can use solar energy and they try to make a different veichles . maybe in twenty year people start to use this type of veichles . why not ? it can be excitement . in conclusion , in twenty year people use fewer car than today . because of lot of reason a i mention it . important part is if we want to live a wonderfull life , we have to reduce to using of car . and try to use to safety and envorimental friendly t
