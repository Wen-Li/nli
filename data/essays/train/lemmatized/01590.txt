it is often expressed either explicitly or implicitly that young people enjoy their life more than old people do . in my opinion , this is the wrong approach to this issue . let me first collect several similarity between those two group . both young people and retired people do usually not work or at least they do not have to work to make a living ( this if of course only valid for industrialized nation ) . therefore , they are left with considerable amount of leisure time at their disposal . why should older people not be able to enjoy this time to the same extent a young people ? they only choose to spend that time differently . old people might not enjoy snowboarding , volleyball or going out a much a young people do . but old people might enjoy going to the theater , make a sea cruise or just meet with friend a much or even a lot more than young people do . both group enjoy their life - but they tend to have difference concerning what they regard a enjoyable and worthwile . also , such a holistic approach doe not dignify a human being 's existence a an individual . saying that `` young people '' or `` old people '' a a whole enjoy their life much or le than the other group would be a crude generalization . of course , there are miserable , complaining old people who obviously do not enjoy their life . but take a closer look and you will find that it is not hard to find very similar individual among young people . the other way around : of course , many young people like going out , having a good time with friend and enjoying themselves . but you will have no difficulty finding a real party animal among old people if you really try to . judging people by their outer appearance , and age is part of that , doe not take their personality , their preference and their attitude into consideration . if you do so , you are ignoring an important part of a human being . because of the given reason , i disagree with the statement and i think older people can enjoy their life a much a old people do . perhaps not in the same way , perhaps not always a visible ( and sometimes offensive ) a young people . but they certainly do .
