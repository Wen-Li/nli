there could be several benefit of the travel led by a tour guide : travel more efficientlly , communicate better than individual travelling , not wasting time , and could be much cheaper and easier to explore new world . but if one , who think the experience is most important than just sight seeing like me , will disagree though all the benefit i mentioned . there ' re much more thing that individual free travel could get . first , the communication . if you travel a free travel , you can use your own language to communication with others during travel . through this , you may become to try more express your owns and it could help to improve your ablity to communicate with different culture 's people . for example , the free speaking with dweller or short conversation with people who take bus together . if you travel with the tour guide , you ca n't experience this kind of thing . there will be translaters who is tour guide when you face the language problem . second , various kind of anectdotes can be your own memorial thing . like many mistake during the travel or conversation with diffrent people , and process to enter , or culture shock , many thing that only you can experience , your own thing . they make make you remember much more after travel about what you travel . if you go with the tour guide , it can be easily happened , because tour guide indicate from small ettiquittes to the large culture of the country you travel . you ca n't learn your own experience , and furthermore , what you learned from tour guide will be easily disappear after travel . the main purpose of the travel can be the experience of new world . with tour guide , you might also be passive to experience that , it will not give plenty of opportunity to experience that by yourself . there could be more opportunity , if you travel by your own ablities without tour guide .
