through my experience , i can say that this statement is right . take a math for example , during my high school day , i had to answer lot of question . a math teacher explained the concept first , and then made u answer question . if i could understand the concept , it wa not difficult to answer the question . so when i studied other subject such a a chemistry and physic etc . i applied same method , that is , understanding the concepst , first . here is another example . in term of parenting , especially money related , i think good parent is not the person who can give big money to their child but teach how can make money . you might think this is a different story , but it is related to the topic , i think . all parent want their child to be succeed and rich . but ther are to type of parent . one is just tell their child how they made money , and instructs to do something to make money wihout explaning what it is the concept behind fact . another type want to explain what is impotant and more eccential . they know that fact will change , yet if you can understand the concept behind the fact , you can improvise to any circumstance . many young people inherit big money from thier parent , yet for those reason i mentioned above , lot of people do n't maintain their wealth . things is always changing , and i think along with the changing surrounding the fact can be chaged .
