students have a number of way to learn nowadays . personally , it is much better when i study a topic or a passage understanding the main idea . i believe that grasping idea and concept rather than fact is the best way to suceed . learning fact are very hard keep becasue you could forget them over time , understanding concept is valuable when you are in different topic or environment , and finally student skill could be enhance . it could be very valuable to study date or name of event for example . they could help you answer the question of your test of history . but you could forget it after few day . while understanding the concept could help for a long time . for example , understanding why the a battle started , what were the condition after the battle finished , and son on . it could be in your brain longer than learning fact . undestanding concept could be valuable when you are studying a different topic . for example , the battle could help you to understand the economic situation of people or the geographic situation after the conflict . on the other hand , if you just learned the date or name of the people who fought in the even , maybe you have to study againg for your business or your geography class . students could develop better skill if the learn concept and idea . they could argue for example , why the battle happened , or even learn that war conflict are not the best way to thrive . they could even interested and pursue a carer in history . i think learning concept and idea from a topic , give you many opportunity fot your future life . for all these reason , i support the statement that student should learn idea and concept rather that fact . it imprive their skill , help them to other subject and enhance their skill .
