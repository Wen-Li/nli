my grandmother often have mentioned like this . `` young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community . absolutely , you are not an exception . '' i agree the statement my grandmother because of the following reason . first of all , young people like to hang out themselves . in other word , they do not share their thinking and behavior their community and do not spend time their community . let 's recall `` friends '' , the most famous sitcom in the world which there are three woman and three guy . during their 20 's and 30 's , they just hang out themselves . i do not see an episode which above character have spent the time with their community . secondly , young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community because they think cyber communites more valuable than real their community . in my case , i am an active member of korea volunteer teaching program for kid . but i do not know my neighborhood and their child . owing to technological development and novice , young people are familiar with global issue and internet world and their interest are not limited in thier community . lastly , i would like say that community it self become more isolated and individual . a hundred year ago , people depended on each other and they were a huge family . but , there are no dependence , cooperation , respect for senior and original tradition in modern society . to sum up , i agree with the statement that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community for these reaseons ; they do not like spending the time with their community , they are familiar with cyber comminities than their neighbor and modern society is differerent from past society .
