i desagree with that statement . i have some reason . first , if we travel in a group with tour guide , we can not go where we want to . i want to visit some place any parson ha not visit or there are few people . i have been to philippines a a volunteer . when i wa there i could not go where i want to , because i must have worked . i think it is similar to group traveling . also , i prefer to talk with a person who ha different culture and opinion . if i travel in a group , there is no chance i talk some foreign people . i want to spread my view about everything . i think that traveling by mysefl is good chance for talking with many different people in the world . of course , there are many kind of people in my country . but i want to see someone who can not come to my country . third , i think it is good for u to think about place where we will visit . by thinking of unknown country or city , i think we can learn the counrty or city naruraly . so i like traveling
