i disagree about , it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because learn fact are more interesting , student can get more information when they are learing fact , and student can also understand the idea form fascts . when student are learning something , they usually very easy to get brod , that is more fun if teacher talk about fact . such a a history class , if the teacher just talk about the year and what issue happened in the year , stduents do not formilier with it , and the teacher talk about some story about thoes issue , student will pay atention to the fun story . students need to learn many information everyday , and learn fact could get many information from it . if a teacher show a fact about law , student may learn about many other knowlege , like math , different people . students learn fascts is not just for fun , is also can get the idea when they are learning . when a teacher are talking a story , student are still thinking about it , like which is de bad porsen , which is the good thing to do , and so on . i think learn fact are more important .
