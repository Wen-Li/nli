there are argument about whether young people enjoy life more than older people do . i agree with young people enjoy life more than older people do because of current peace , long life time and developed technology . first , recently , there are le war in the world than older day . in particular , in japan , there is no war for recent 60 year . so , child and adult can concentrate on study or playing with other friend . if there were war , we could not eat much , sometimes have to go to war , and so on . second , because we have longer life time than older people , we can do much more thing in our life time . for example , because we can live to the age of 70 or 80 , we can do another thing from 50 , such that we change our job or start new hobby . one reason of long life time is developing of the medical care . for the develiping of the medical care , we have more healthy time . so , we can do more thing than older people . finally , there is the dramatic developement of technology recently . i would like to descrive it by example of the knowledge of foriegn country . current younger people can know more about foriegn country than older people . the reason of it is that we can go to foriegn country more quicker than before . so , we can have the experience of foriegn country . and , because we have more developed tv , we can have more knowledge about foriegn country . in addition , we can connect with foriegn people easily , because we have e-mail which is new mode of contact with foriegn people . for other technology , we can enjoy life , too . in summary , young people can enjoy life than older people do .
