progress we enjoy today can be attributed to some scholar . those individual who understood the basic concept and idea of their respective field and thrived to develop them . there , however , is an imposing question of which is important for student whether to learn the basic idea and concept or mere fact . as a building strength is determined by it foundation basic idea and concept are sufficient enough for u to learn the fact . students should be taught the importance of these basic a much of the fact we know today are drawn by logical reasoning . many philosopher stress over this idea . facts which do not provide u with the understanding of how it work are merely of any use . for example , if a student doesnot know how an electrical engine is started and what principle involves in it working but know the mere fact of it us there is no point in his learning . moreover , with the rapid improvement in today world it is the basic idea and concept that are followed rather than fact . for example , consider system application process ( sap ) which is revised and updated every time so that it keep it competetors abay . if the programmer know only fact on which command lead to which result then he wil face problem in the upgraded version but if he know the concept on which procedure the compliler work then he can also use the upgraded version though with some difficulty in the beginning . finally , it is through these , idea and concept , that the student will , perhaps , draw inference on how some of the basic thing work and work innovative way rahter than thinking like a stereotype . thus it is teach the student the concept and idea rather than mere fact which is not advisable .
