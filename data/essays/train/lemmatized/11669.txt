i agree with this statement . the reason why i think succesful people are those who try new and take chance ha to do with this behaviour being the more suitable for adaptation . before i adress how these action may serve adaptive purpose , we need to accept that life in modern society , in old society and even in most biological system ( to cut to the chase ) is one of constant change . in light of the constant change in everday problem and necesities , the lack of hability to try new thing - or to be inovative - will invariably leave u lagged behind , uncapable to cope with even the most basic challenge . for instance , imagine an alarm company that decides not to change their sale stategies because the long time way of `` doing it well '' wa knocking door by door to offer their service directly into the costumer face . in the era of internet shopping for just about everything , this strategie would have foretold the collapse of the alarm selling time of this company . to point out on the need to take risk , this company , in the begining of the 70 's or 80 's would have had to start taking chance training their worker in the use of computer and comunications technology . it may have seemed incredible back then , that in 20 year a substancial amout of people would be purchasing just about everthing sitting in front of a screen in the comfort of their oun home . but , what might haved seemed like takeing a huge risk , had to be done . therfore , i belive that being inovative and brave ( taking chance ) with work , family and friend is the key stone of succesful life . a life that may not only cope with new challenge , but may actually improve the condition of those around u , and the condition inside ourself .
