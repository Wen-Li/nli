gathering new knowledge and understanding process of something is of high value at every time in a person life ; especially during study . but how should a person get new information ? in my opinion the most important possibility to get new knowledge is by understanding idea and concept of something . by learning fact , you can get only a small impression of how something work , because it is very complicated to know everything in detail . so by understanding the concept of the solution it can be assumed that this knowledge is aquired by the person . when some fact are only learned they are not aquired . by knowing concept of something the thing , missing by not learning every fact , can be dedicated from the knowledge . in a lecture wa sayed that a person forgets every seven year the half of it learned fact . therefore it is very important that people are able to dedicate fact from their knowledge . so a huge knowlegdege of fact can be made by understanding thing . but the other direction is not easy . another point is , if many thing are conceptual understood , the ability of understanding new thing is higher than by people who learn fact . so , if understanding of new topic is inceased , the competence in a sector rise faster and the specific concept can be also used faster . after study , many student will be confronted with researching new thing and concept . by knowing and understanding other concept it will be easier to adapt the searched concept from other concept . this ability make research faster an more successful .
