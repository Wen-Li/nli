i agree with the statement . the human being natural ability to think and to develop new idea in their mind , is a characteristic that can not be isolated for themself , and for this reason , person can not use their mind it could have an unsuccesful way life . the history of the world reveals that since the ancient year , the human wa always trying to develop new way to get food , to build a comfortable place to live and to be distinguished than others of it 's kind . by now , the story is the same , we all are trying to improve in at least in something in a way to be different than others . nowadays , the technology and the discovery made by some human , are in some way taking out of the mind of the people the ability to try new thing because of the fear to lose what they have or because they feel good with which they have , people feel they do n't need any more . but at the same time , when human are enjoying what they have , start to feel they need more and more , and in this point the human start to develop new idea in it 's mind . for this reason , the human being have to take risk on life , otherwise he can not be able to improve on something . doing what he learned to do it 's a good begining , but in some moment of their lifetime , they will start to take some risk , not only to feel distringuished a i said before , but a an impulse of the mind created by the insctint to `` think '' and `` develop '' new way to live . we human can live doing the same thing much year , repeating the same , but we always going to find in the very deep part of our mind a good reason to do that , a reason about improving , creating or making something new .
