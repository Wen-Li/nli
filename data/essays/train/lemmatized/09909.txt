in my personal opinion it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because in a modern world where access to a large amount of information about nearly every subject , problem , or iussue is quite easy to obtain via the internet it should be the main intention of every learning process to gain the skill necessary to deal with this mass of available information rather than simply collect it . first off all , no one nowadays will be able gather all the knowledge of the world . the attempt alone seems to be stupid . however , in order to deal with all this knowledge and opportunity a student have to develop the ability to select information , to destract the main idea of a source , and to handle all the useless information . secondly , one might say that it is easy only to focus on idea and concept while leaving out the effort to gain all the information provided related to a certain theory or source . this might be true , but the striking point is that only the concept of a theory can be used again on the next source by the student . thirdly , a student is not capable of endless learning . when sombody only store the fact rather than he focus on the concept and idea behind a theory or a source , than the space for other inofmation is filled with all his knowledge about only this source . learning is a process . you can stop it by obtaining mass of useless information . to summarize , the first aim for a student should be to learn about the method , idea and concept which enable him to deal with all kind of problem , source , and theory which may occur in his future c
