i do not agree that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . because i do not want to waste my money i earned to work hard and ask for quolity of product . because the product i buy is related to my life . if good is worse than they really are , it affect my life . for example , i often purchase good such a book or dvd on the internet shop . however , i sometimes disapear good i bought because they are so old and dirty . so , i will not use them for a long time . when i think of buying electical product , i need durable good . so , if advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , i disapear and must change it soon . the other example , when i bought food , it is bad taste and too expensive . if i bought inferior good , i waste monney i earned . i work hard everyday so i want to spend my money on my profit .
