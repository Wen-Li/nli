do the elderly enjoy life a the young do ? from a psychological standpoint , it can ben claimed that the way people perceive the world change a they get older . in other word , they get more realistic a year pas . thus , i am inclined to believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . to start with , younger people expect more from life , and , to a great extent , people believe in the possibility of realizing their dream in younger age . as a resut , this inner drive make people to enjoy the life in all mean , since they feel that they still have time to do what they want to do . however , a they get older , they start to think that they will never be able to be the person that they have dreamt of . secondly , younger people have the energy that is needed to enjoy the life . that is to say , they do not have to worry about their health situation while thinking about an activity . for example , it is almost impossible for older people to attend activity that need more energy and attention such a surfing , rafting , and skiing . on the other hand , some people claim that older peple enjoy life more than young people do , since they have more time than the young . in other word , they do not have to worry about anything else apart from making themselves feeling better , and enjoying the life . however , this argument can be considered a right only for a small percentage of the elderly , since they are not even able to find someone to accompany them for most of the time . taking these point into consideration , obviously , young people have more opportunity , and chance to enjoy life when compared to the old . however , i strongly believe that this situation can be improved in the future for the advantage of the elderly .
