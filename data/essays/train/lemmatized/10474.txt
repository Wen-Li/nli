i agree with the idea to travel in a group led by a tour guide because i believe that it is really helpful when you are traveling in country or city where you do not know the lenguaje , the street , the custom , or the law , due to that i think that is very important to be accompained with somebody who can help you with all this trouble , a an example i can mention that i remember a really embarrasing situation that happened to a friend when he wa traveling in europe , specifically in france , and he wa in the airport and nobody understood what he needed because nobody could understand his lenguage , due to that he called to his sister in who lived in other country and talked french , and finally he spent all his money calling her all day during his trip to ask her to translate him everything , like to talk with the waitress to translate what he wanted to eat , but of course that if he wa accompained by a tour guide he probably had not had spent all these money and he better could have enjoied this extra money buying curiosity or clothes or to make a larger trip , or anything . other excellent thing about a tour guide can provide you in atrip is that you can to know more about the history of the place , to visit important building , to eat typical food in typical and cheaper restaurant recommended by him and you can ask to the tour guide for more tip to make your travel unfforgettable . however , i am a kind of person who enjoys to be in a sure place with sure people a a travel group with friend , so , the fact to be traveling in a place where i do not know people is something difficult to me , due to that , i really think that a tour guide is an excellent resource , and is not a expensive a to pay the consecuences to be lost in a big city .
