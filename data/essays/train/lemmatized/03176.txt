some people say that young people nowadays give enough time to helping their community , because their time to helping their community . but i do not think so . i have some reason about it . firstly , young people are too busy and selfish . their time is occupied by their schedule . for example , in japan , my country , the number of people going to sram school have been increasing with high speed , because the quantity of thing for teaching public school of japan wa cut . in their school , they can not learn enough knowledge . moreover , many young people is always playng with their friend or is always staying at home despite of no something to should be done . because of those reason , i think , they do not want/can not help . secoundly , recently , the oppotunity for have relationship in their community is decreasing . especially , in urban area , connection between people is very weak . for instance , my friend have never participated event of her communites , such a japanese festival , instead of only seeing it . my home town is suburban . so i often take part in japanese festival . of course , all menbers of my familiy do , also , at the least the half of population of my town do , too . so i disagree the idea that young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping their community .
