when people travel to remote place they ussually think that the best way of getting to know well the place they are visiting is by being in a group led by a tour guide . this statement can be true if the person traveling is visiting the place by the first time . other way , by personal experience i think it is better to travel only with the people you know and without a tour guide . the tour guide are of great help if you do n't know the place you are visiting . in a lot of case if you do n't travel with a tour guide you can miss a lot of place to visit because you do n't know where they are located or what is the importance of this place . it is very important to know what are you visiting and what it represents , in the case of historical site , biuldings , or place . in my case , i like to travel alone . that way i can go wherever i want , the time i want , and stay the time i want in different place . i am an architecture 's student and obviously i like to travel . the reason i like to travel is to know place of great architectural and historical importance and i love to have time to appreciate every corner of the place i 'm visiting . i like to see everything , to touch everything , and to feel everything . to do this i need a lot of time and i ca n't have someone telling me where to go , what to do , or even telling me false story about some place . for example , if i have the opportunity some day to visit the versalles palace , i would not like to have someone telling me what to look or where to go . i will like to dance in the mirror hall and to smell in serenity the smeli of the garden 's flower . i think that if you know the place , or at least are familiarized with the place you are visiting , it is important to go in your own peace , and do thing your own way so you can enjoy the best your travel . this doe not mean neccesarly that if you do thing more privately you are not going to enjoy the trip .
