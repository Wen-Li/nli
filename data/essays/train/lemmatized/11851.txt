every one like to visit new place and different region . each one like to know the proper information about the place he visit . no one like to be lost inaplace he go to the first time espitially if it wa out of his country with foriegn people and strange language . there is astatement that say `` the best way to travel is in agroup led by atour guide '' . some people are agree with this statement but other donot agree . some people think that it is better to go to the trip with agroup because it would be friendly and you have to see and interact with more people and with that the trip wonot be boring . and they think that it is safier to go with atour guide because he will know more information about the place you are going to visit and also they wonot be lost a they are in agroup and ofcource the tour guide know this place and know how to interact with the forign people there . on the other hand , there is some people who prefere to travel with them self . i think that is because they donot like to be limited by aspicific program . or they donot like to deal with people much time or it may be because they think that if they traveled in agroup led by atour guide , this trip would be expensive . i think it woulg be better if i traveled with agroup led by a tour guide . i think that it would be more interisting and exiting . by that i can get the right information . and i like to go with agroup tp deal with more people . finally , i think the travel is really interisting and we have to enjoy it in the proper way by getting the true knowledge . we have to travel more place to get more information .
