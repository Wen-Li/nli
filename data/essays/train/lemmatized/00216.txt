according to me young people enjoy le than older people . in today world we see that compitition is increasing day by day . in older day people where having le mental burden a compared to know . today we see that education is more valued a it wa before . at present people pay more attention to give education to their child . parent are much worried about their chid . thus at early age child start their education . from the next day day their life become busy . after they have reach upto graduation they are frustrated now they are insisted by their parent to persue a higher degree in particular field . after they have completed their study they to search for job . they have to face problem when they get started with job . their daily routene is same except sunday . now at this stage they dont have any extra time . they have many responsibilties to maintain . whereas if we compare this busy life with older people life we come to know that they have enough time . they are thinking how to utilised their time . older people have enough time to have chat with friend whact telivison read book . i have seen various program been held for senior citizen in our society . they had a program once in a week . if we compare this with young people than it is seen that young people program are held twice in a year . it not of programmer falt but our world is become too busy . also on another aspect older people have enough time to meditate and do prayer . while young people are rather busy in material life fighting for better standard of living , better education etc.older people have done struggle in their life and might getting pension through goverment or from the company they have work
