nowadays , car are one of the most important feature of our living style . they make our existence easier by letting u move from one place to another faster than walking . they also let u travel to place far from where we live which otherwise would be impossible to reach . however , car have disadvantage such a the difficulty to find somewhere to park the car , the amount of money we spend on fuel and the pollution they live behind . in my opinion , in twenty year there will be more or , at least , a much car a there are today . but , the opposite could also occur . we can find evidence for and against both statement : on the one hand , the number of car have increased at an important rate last year , at least in the country where i live ( spain ) . the different sector of the economy have had good result and the situation right now doe n't make u think that thing will change all of a sudden . so , the trend we have observed on car growth could be remaining the same and make the total number of car in twenty year beeing bigger than it is today . on the other hand , a car are very polluting , lot of people have started being conscients about the damage we are causing to the environment and have started using public transport more often . in addition , government are creating law that restrict the use of a car in some city or even they are taxing people who drive their car in the city center . these fact could have a a result a reduction in the number of car in the near and even the far future . anyway , public transport are not usually a good a they should be and a lot of people , specially those who live in rural area , do really need a car to go to work , go to the supermarket , etc . using a car is something confortable and we all know that people like to be confortable . so , i wo n't go a far a to say that the number of car in the future will be bigger for sure but , at least , that 's what i believe right now .
