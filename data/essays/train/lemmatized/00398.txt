the car is always been , since the time of it creation , an important mean of transport . while in the past , it wa a reserved mean , which wa prerogative of the richest part of the population , nowadays it is used by almost the 85 % of the world population the question is : but will it remain a successful mean among twenty year or will be replaced ? or even more , will it disappear ? i think that all depends by the progress of techonology in fact the improvement of the man 's style condition could allow a new born also in mechanic field in fact , the discovering of new electronic element could bore to a new transportation mean and so render the car useless , but from the other hand this research ca n't never occur if there are n't fund and so money in my opinion , between twenty year , the car in use will be more than nowadays and not fewer , but they will have almostly , new confort and quality than the recent one . for example they could have more sophisticated circuit that allow to the driver to orientate whatever is his destination or they would be le polluting than one , perhaps with a non polluted system which convert the carbon dioxide into oxygen preventing all the disease that characherize the urban citizen but , on the other hand , if there will be more car , it would create an overcrowding in the street : all the people who have the car in fact use it almost the daytime and with the crowding of the streets. , the man ' / woman 's attitude could change giving origin to some unpleasant event in conclusion , i think that , if in the future , there will be an increasing of the car , which in my opinion will occur , i hope the people learn to use it in a properly way .
