it is intresting weather we look for idea and concept than fact . i belive that emphasising on the fact is good rather than idea and concept . so , i disagree with the above statement . ideas and concept were formulated by philosopher or scientsts where made question on the fact . for example scientist belive that earth wa large flat surface . untill one of the scientist while travelling on the ocean recognised that earth is not a flat surface because the the fact that oceance is appearing like endless and movent of steasmers proved the fact that earth is in shape of the globe . so , ideas and concept are not always true . facts are what we observe and these werwe stone of development . for example invention of chicken pox vaccination by the edwarrd genner , he discoved the vaccine by observing that person working with milk product were not affected by the perticular organism besause of the fact that they were ressistant to that organism . another best example is the health profession of physiotherapy which sound good for the fact . . the studens and physiotherapists stongly belive the `` evidenced based clinical practice '' . evedence based practce . treating the patiens with the best available stratages and protocol stated and proved by the student and physiotherapists . in coclusion , the student will more benifited when they learn the rel fact .
