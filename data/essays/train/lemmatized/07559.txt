i completely agree with the statement that it is essential for student to understand idea and concept rather than learn fact . this exercise is even more essential during early stage in their development . this is because understanding idea and concept help to develop a student 's mind . understanding an idea or concept encourages the student to apply his/her mind and come up with logical explanation , solution and conclusion . the student tends to develop analytical thinking and reasoning ability . he/she tends to becomes inquisitive and curious , constantly seeking information and looking out for answer . he/she tends to participate more in discussion and debate , which help him to learn from other people and undertand their line of thinking . he/she also tends to become more creative and contributive . and , these are essentially quality which employer seek when hiring potential employee . this is the reason that company stress more on personal interview rather than written test when hiring . they look out for the essential quality of analytical thinking , reasoning and creativity , all which stem from having the ability to understand idea and concept and connect thing . learn fact is an exercise which is essentially done over a period of a person 's lifetime . often , fact that student learn in their school and college life may become outdated a science and technology progress and new invention and discovery are made . hence to remain updated in a competitive world , a person is required to learn fact throughout his lifetime . in conclusion , learning fact doe improve a student 's knowledge base but unless he is equipped with analytical thinking and reasoning ability he is le likely to make an impact which will help him to succeed in the longer run .
