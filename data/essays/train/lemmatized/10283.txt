i 'm a person who like to experience new thing , i change lot of sport , i play lot of instrument . so i think is nice to try new thing . above all when you do something very well maybe you can annoy doing this more , so it appears ecxiting to do something new and why not a risk . it 's also important to know very well how to do a precise thing , above all if it 's your work , what i have say until now is referred to hobby and not to work . i believe that if you have a secure work it 's better continue to do that even if it bacame boring in the time . i think is good and beautiful to try new expierences and to take sometimes any risk because it make our life more interesting and more exiting , it 's boring to do only the same thing all the day for all our life , it is n't good , we have to try new sensation and we have to feel new emotion to permit ouselfs to grown up . personally , i think that our life is only one , you can live only once , so you have to live all the thing the nature give you in respect of the life someone give you . you can failed , you can not like what you are trying , but the important is that you have tried it , you can say `` i did it '' . if you died happy , without thinking to a thing you would like to do and you did n't creat the oppurtuniy to really do this , you may spent the most beautiful life that you can hope for yourself . to do something new in my advice is really great , it always give you an emotion that you ca n't receive from other occasion . you can always do the same thing and do them very well or try new sensation and stay well with yourself , personally , i choose the second one opportunity .
