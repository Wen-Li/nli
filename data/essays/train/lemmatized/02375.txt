i totally agree with the claim that young people enjoy life more than older people do . can the internet sparkle the interest of older people a it doe to young people ? the answer is definitely positive . but can them have the possibility to log on the internet ? the feedback is neganive . older people have no chance to learn the typing skill or the skill to surf on the internet systematically because they are too far away from the schooling life . thus , they seldom enjoy themselves by surfing on the internet . if the keeping away from the internet which can provide the more abundant entertainment than ever before can not to be a persuasive one , just consider the basic one . food is commonly ageed to be an enjoyment to all . but older people more or le have the problem in metrabolism , or digestion . they want to enjoy the delicate food but they find they are difficult to enjoy them freely . in addition a we all know that costume which is one of four basic neccesities in the daily life is everchanging . when man creates the costume , they treat them a the decoration besides protection them from the cold weather . when you dress yourself in the most fashionable clothes , you will feel very confident and surely very happy . nevertheless , there are seldom fashionable costume designed for or targeted to older people . hence older people hardly enjoy the fantastic thing a young people do . some say that maybe the modern world is only a place which is suitable for young people . to some extend concerning the point above , i agree with that . it is a pity for older people to live in such a world where they seem to be abandoned by younge people and the rest of the world . what can we do to offer more enjoyment for older people is a serious question we all shoulsd strive to figure out .
