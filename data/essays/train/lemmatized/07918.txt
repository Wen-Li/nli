whether to be a person who is equiped with plenty of knowledge from all kind of academic subject or just to be a professor in one field is not a straighforward issue . everyone keep a unic opinion on it . while it come to me , i would say that to be a professor is more beneficial . first of all , people should save their energy from obtaining knowledge from all category of field , which doe good to our advanced education . energy , just like time for human , is limited . with these limited energy , one can do what he or she like to do . but , once distributed to too many subjected , people ca n't be a professor in a certain field . for example , we know that teacher in the elemental school can teach almost all the course that are provided . however , if the child grows up and enter a college , no one can be responsible for all the class . what he or she need is a professor who know a lot in a particular subject , not a teacher with many knowledge from different subject . in addition , people with a great number of knowledge in some special field help solve the social problem . take the development of science reseaches for an example . without the technology brought by science research , we ca n't live such comfortable life today , we will still suffer from the deseases , hungry and disaster . without science research , we ca n't explain nature phenomenon and the secret of the universe . nevertheless , who are mostly responsible for these research ? they 're our scientist , most of whom are expert from different field . admittedly , to acquire a much knowledge a possible from different subject is advisable , because it can help people to know the world outside u a a whole picture . nevertheless , to have a much knowledge a possible in a certain field can benefit ourselves much more . to sum up , i think it is better to obtain much knowledge in one particular subject .
