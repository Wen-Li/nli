i completely agree with the statement - '' young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . the reason for my view are lack of ethic , lack of seriousness and lack of time . my reason will be explained in the following paragraph . firstly , the young people lack ethic . what i mean to say is that the youth no longer respets the concept like helping nature , modesty and empathy . the youth ha become selfish i.e. , young people always think about themselves and no longer care for the people who are in need of help . many friend of mine keep going for movie and party , very frequently . their expenditure come to around 1000 rupee a month , only for enjoyment . what i would like to say is that these people can help the community with money or by devoting some time but they dont . the reason for this might be lack of responsibility towards community or may be they were not tought about these thing . secondly , many of the young one are in the mind set - what doe i get by helping the community ?? my neighbour who is quite young and rich ( earning a slary of 40000 rupees per month ha never donated a single penny . rather he spends the money on pub , buying a new car , etc . thirdly , few youngster think that since they had gone through a tough time in their life , they try saving everything - not spending either for the community nor for themselves . also , few of them dont get the time of their busy shedule in order to spare some time for the community . lastly , many of the young people dont really understand the problem of the community i.e. , they lack empathy . i would like to conclude by saying that there are young people who help the community but are very few . in order to improve the situation , the young people have to be tought about the need to help the community so that every one is happy and also the contry prospers .
