i totally agree with the statement . i think that a student would acolmpish more with this technique of learning . this way he/she will not memorize while learning but rather understand how the person invented the theory . this ; is an effective way of learning but a teacher would not have the time for teaching every person in the class where that theory came for and what wa the way of thinking . by teaching like this the teacher open the theory in to debate and student will ask tonne of question . eventually there will be no left because every student will have different kind of question and some of them will deny the theory due to the lack of experiment and proof . in the other hand ; writing some equation on the board and making the student memorize them will be much easier because the student ca n't question but the they wo n't any more then they are given which shuts their mind to thinking and improving the theory . at the end they forget what they have learned throughout the year because they have memorized . finally ; this way of learnig is only for the student who have the abundant resource of teacher who can argue with them and for the student who doe not study only for the exam and who want to learn for life .
