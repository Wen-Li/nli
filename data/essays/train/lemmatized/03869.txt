there is an old saying that ' if u wanna be big you got to think big ' . that mean that if you want to be sucessful in life you have to think for new idea and new idea always come with great risk . i completly agree with this statement . most of the most sucessful people in this world have suceeded by taking new idea rather than going with the same traditional one . if you already know about the thing you are doing your chance of bringing a change are minimised a you have a path and the only thing you have to do is just walk on it . once a great man said ' if i have to walk on a path shown to me like a dumb ill rather walk alone blinded ' . one such example is of the richest man in the world ie bill gates . broke at the age of 20 been told to handle the family business by his father this boy had no choice left but the boy had one thing with him and that wa an idea and a will to do something to be something in life and that wa when he discovered his dream . but a then say u might fall a you walk alone but the person who is not affected by the fall is the person who suceeds in life a a result of it he became one of the most sucessful person walking on this earth . there are thousand of other example in this world but my point is that there are always ups in dows in a person life but if you have the will you will suceed ` a god walk with them who try ' .
