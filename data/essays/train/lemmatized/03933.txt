i completely agree with the statement . i really think that something ha to change . i mean , there are a lot of car on the street every day and people is always buying new car . somethimg ha to change otherwise there will not be enought space for people ! having car ha it problem . pollution fir of all . all the city ha to fight against the smog and the gas that damage the enviroment . they are trying to encourage citizen not to use their car . and what about the petrol ? the petrol nowadays is quite expensive and the resouses are not endless . talking about driving a car , we can understand easily that too many vehicle make long queue and a lot of traffic on the street . this mean a considerable waste of time . cars also need place to be parked , thus a lot of space is reqiured . that is why i think that something ha to change , and that in the future people will prefer to use public transport in order to avoid all these proplems . but i also think that people are becoming more and more aware of all the service that the internet can offer . i mean that a lot a person now prefers to work at home using the computer and communicate by e mail rather than driving to the office . and this way of working is becoming always more common . the possibility of buying good on internet ha the same effect . people can do shopping staying at home . they do not have to go out , stay in line , drive to the shop or to the market . those are all the reason that make me belive that in the next century we will have le car than today . i can not stand the traffic anymore . i hope i will get a job that allows me to stay at home . i will buy food on the internet and i will move from a place to another by bus , that in my town are very numerous . i do not need a car ! and i think that lot of people will follow my example , also because is a good way to safe money and time .
