i agree with the following statement : `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . first , by taking risk and try new thing , people can `` discover '' new talent and actually find out that they are good at them . if you are a painter and the only thing you do is paint , you might be already successful a a painter ; but not a much a if you try to sculpt and you find out that you are great at sculpting . you will be twice a successful now , because you paint and you sculpt ! we have perfect example in the world of `` famous people '' . let 's take a famous person ( such a famous realtor . .. donald trump for example ) who is an expert in what he/she doe , like realting , acting or singing and who decides to take the risk of trying something new , such a producing , directing , etc . .. and with surprisingly , we see that this person actually succeed in it . ( of course , there are some who fails but most of the time , they are successful even more because they tried new thing ) . another example , more personal now . we have `` friend '' in the family that is a well-known doctor . one day , he just decided to stop and to try to sell carpet . carpets coming from the middle-east , asia , etc . .. he started little by little but now he is one of the best entrepreneur in the biggest mall in paris such a printemps , galeries lafayettes , and others . we can definitely see that he is an example of successful people that try new thing and take risk rathen than only doing what he already know how to do well such a beeing a doctor .
