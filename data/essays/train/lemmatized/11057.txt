i agree to the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . but it 's also important to know fact . bacause every idea and concept still requires basic fact which are necessary to really understand them . you have to decline two kind of fact : fact which are basic knwoledge and fact which are only important if you want to handle it deeply . many of today 's student learn fact , but they do n't really understand it . and so it is better for student and for life preparation to understand idea and concept than only to know fact . for example : if you know how something work you must not know why it work . many student learn strictly all detail of an idea but they do n't realize the whole . in many subject you have to learn by hard to get all detail , but it is better to understand the concept which allows student to study , recognizing and solving problem which are still different but mainly the same basic . but student should know and learn fact , too . because in todaz 's life every problem must be analized and it solution must founded on especially fact . to solve a problem without detailed fact is very unprofessional kind of working . other person with ground knwoledge should be able to find failure in your documentation . learning must consist out of both : founded knowledge compared with idea and concept . ideas and concept may include fact which are neccesary to understand them . many student know and learn only a much a needed to pas an exam or anzthing else . this might be good for the moment but you ca n't pas life very well . a reason for this could be also a problem of teaching skill . all in all it must be important for every student to reach a founded education with both : detail knowledge and basic idea .
