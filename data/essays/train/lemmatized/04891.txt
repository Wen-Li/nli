it is important for the student to to learn fact than understanding idea and concept as the student are supposed to observe , study , interpret , analyze and understand the thing . in their day to day life they are exposed to many situation in which they should understand the situation and work on that . suppose if a student is facing a problem , he or she should first understand the situation and then work on the problem to come out of that . just by sitting in the class mugging up the theory and concept is not worthworthy . they should develop a practical approach for life . we should develop the ability to solve the thing we can use the idea or concept we know but not to the complete extent . we should develop our own skill , improve our analyzing ability and capability in every step of our life . by learning fact they will be prepared to face every hurdle and they will become confident . just by learning concept and without any practical knowledge they can not live outside . for example take a computer student , who know the concept of any of her major but not aware of any problem which she is going to face in her job that is she is not aware of the fact ( i . e ) the hurdle in her job she will be confused and she may lose confidence . she may not be ready to face the problem because she never knew that there are such fact in life which she or he should move off and achieve success . but by knowing only the fact they may not work out the problem , they should have the idea what to do and should understand the idea behind it and then should apply the concept to get success . they will never depend on others and get cheated by them a they are well aware of the fact . they will grow mentally strong and develop good analyzing skill . practical exposure to the fact make them strong and confident . however exposure to fact and knowing them is important in life .
