there si always the same question between young and older poeple . who enjoy life ? i am a young people and i can say that i enjoy the life more than my parent . but it is always true ? young people just begening her life and want to profit from it . they do n't know about dead , about real succes or failure . they only see all the year coming . usually they have a lot of project and dream and how to develop them . for example , i take me . i want to go to australia in order to develop my english and i wish to find a good job and perhaps to stay overthere . i really do it and i will really do everything in order to succed . a lot of people say me that i am little crazy to do this with all danger . this argue come especially from adult over forty year old . while old people have a long life behin them , they have enjoyed life before and today they are in their habit . they have already enjoyed life , or perhaps not . i see it with my grandparent , they have had a other life , with the war and other truma . today they do n't want to move . and sometime it is in the other sense , in other word , young people do n't enjoy the life and older poeple do it . for example , young people find a job , take a flat , have their friend and do n't want something else ( this is my brother ) . whereas older people always try to profit and take everything from life . i have a friend , who is over seventy year old , who travel all arround the world and try to enjoy all that she can . in conclusion , to my mind , i do n't know if we can speak about young or old people . each person enjoy the life in her way and with her past . one enjoy life with their habit and other with their dream and realisation .
