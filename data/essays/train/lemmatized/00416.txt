i think that the advertisement is what really push you to buy something that you need , or think you may need . because of the way the product is showed . some advertisement show just the product advantage , but doe not show the disadventages , so the client or the posible client ( you ) are convince that is what you need , without serch for others product that offert the same porpuse but in differrents way . some time we buy before do any research in differents product of the same kind . the price is something that really make the difference , because if bysides the advertisement show just the adventages and it ha a really low price in compare with other product of the same kind , that really influens your desitions , because you always want to save some money , at least if you are a normal status person . the advertisement are good to show you the differents kind of product you can find in the market for a certain porpuse , always if they tell you the trurth . some company just made their advertisement incompleated , a i said before they show you just the good part of the product , and sometimes they overfull you of their advertisement , so you will make your desition based on what you seen more often , you get to tell youself `` if you see it every where it most be good , so i will buy it '' . that is what push u to make mistake , we can not leave our desition on the companie 's hand , we have to do some research to make sure that what they are offering is what really is , and what i really need , otherwise you do not need to buy it . so my adventage is that always make sure the product you are buying it what you think it is , you can check with friend of yours that had bougth it , or with different store that sale it , do not let the advertisement convince you .
