i do n't agree with the statement that the le car will be in use in the future . why i do not agree stand for a couple of reason such a experience and observation of the past year , trend , change in people 's taste . .. when we look at the last 20 year , number of car in use noticably increased . although it might not be valid for every single country around the world because of financial reason and even may be moral reason , my point is made based on my country , turkey , and many other country a well . it is not because people make more and more money every year , but because they feel or it is imposed like to have a car is a need . of course this is debatable , especially depending on the country . the change time bring to people also are effecting the device or machine we use or make them become a ` need ' . for instance , in my country many people work very far from their home , thus they prefer or sometimes they have to have a car . another example is about student , particularly university student . even if they do n't study far from home , they still want to have a car to make their university life easier . if i have to give an example from my neighbor family who ha 4 car , one for each family member , who are mother and father and two student , my point will be more obvious i assumethese are some of the reason why the number of car in use will not decrease , at least in my country . i have to add another considerable influence in helping increase the number of car in use . that is the improving car market around the world and their promotion strategy , for instance commercial , tv program . in my opinion , they make especially young people want to have a car , young people such a my own brother who always talk about car , know everything about car , learned how to drive before having a driver 's licence ! everywhere there is so pompuos information about new technology and car . it make you feel like you have to have a car . of course , it is again debatable if people have to listen to this ` call ' or not . .. when we think about how hard it is to find oil nowadays , and also how expensive oil ha gotten , logical answer would have confirmed the statement above . but regrettably , it is not the fact . people are not careful enough or their taste or convenience is more important , i guess .
