i do agree with the fact that : in twenty year time , there is diffenitley going to be much fewer car in use than there are today . and the reason are multiple and very logic , first of all and most importantly is fuel , obviously and up to now every car a any other machine need some sort of energy to function , in case of car this main source of energy is oil , and a we all know the oil reserve in the plant is decreasing every day , and the supporting example in this case is very clear , and it ha been proven scintefically that the oil reserve is dramatically decreasing . secondley is maintenance of car , which is aslo proven to be very costly process . another good reason is expansion of people , building and other thing , which is making space le available for car these day . another very good reason is the availability of other way of transport , which is making it easy for u to commutte with le effort and lower cost , and at the same time giving u other safer way of transport and the supporting example here is the very bad safety record of car a method of transport . i personally think that the most important reason and supporting example for the above mentioned fact , is the effect of car on our environmint , the amount of co2 emmission car throughs into our environment every day is unbelievable , and i think it is the main reason which is going to make the number of car is much fewer in the future .
