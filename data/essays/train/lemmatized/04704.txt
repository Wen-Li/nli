i agree with this statement the importance of understanding idea and concept than learning fact . why do we learn ? what is the purpose of learn ? in my opinien , it is to develop from learning and to make advance . throughout several exemples will define the reason of importance of understanding idea and concept . business marketing is can be another exemple . before i learned marketing in the school and i have got good grade that time because i could well memorize everything learned in the class . however when i had internship in the five star hotel marketing department i wa embarassed , because before i did not understanding marketing concept and idea in th subject i forgot almost knowledge before i acquired . after that happening i read marketing book and tried to understand and applied in real marketing situation . through the process understanding idea and concept i could develope the marketing plan and apply marketin theory with modification the company situation . there is another exemple with development of science , we learn sience in the school but if we just learn that it doe not mean anything . all fact in the textbook are like about history of sience . with just the knowledge what can we do ? however , through understanding the consept and idea , we have some quriosities and exemin that we have developed science . acient people belived the earth is plat however some sientist understand and the idea about that wa not true they could find the fact eathis round . those tw exemples support the reason of agreement with this statement .
