i disagreen that successful people try to new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . there are have three opinion in my mind to talk why i disagree this statement . at beging of the statment , i think one of important reason that people can make successful because successful people have already to do this thing a they make successful , they use more time than other people , they contiune their work all day , not give it up , so they successful . it is not to easy to successful to every successful people . second , successful people a same a other people to do the thing , they just have more one experience than other people , before this time , they would have many experiencesto fair when they do this thing but nobody know it . successful are not clever than other people , only hard working than other people . third , new thing not only have already can try to , it need more time to think and to get some informataion to find some note about it , successful people can not try to new thing when they have not already . thenfore , they change some opintions whart they have already know how to do well . it is to bad to successful people . all of them cak \ n tell u successful people a same a other people , although they are successful poeople , they not alwat \ y successful in their life . if they only want try to new thing but not have alredy to do and to goive up that they have already thing , it is bad ideaswith them , almost can change their life and they can not a successful people in the world , so do not want successful , just hard work ev
