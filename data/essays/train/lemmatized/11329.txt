nowadays , young people are very busy studying or doing other thing , so they do not volunteer to help their community . in their teen they have to study for the university entrance test . other young people would play . they think that helping community is very hard . in my community , every teenager ha to study for their own good . the fact that they spend the day studying , they do n't have enough time to help the community . i am a teenaged girl and i want to volunteer to support the town , but i do not have the time . i believe that young people would like to help the community . in their middle school or high school , if they have free time they would hang out with their friend . because they did the hard work studying , they want to rest . teenagers would like rest in their home playing computer game or watching tv . in my school , student have to work for the community for amount of the time , but they would ask their dad to make a certificate which prove that the student volunteered for the work . they think that helping the community mean cleaning the street , and doing dirty and hard work . students should give enough time to help community , but they do n't . in one reason , student have to study for the university entrance test . even if they have the time to do the helping , student would play with their friend to relieve . many young people think that supporting thier town is very hard work to do .
