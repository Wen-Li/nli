i think first that both the younger and older people both enjoy their life but i think that older people enjoy thier life more . i am convinced with that for several reason . one important reason is that in order to enjoy your life you should feel secure and relax . i think older people feel more secure because they have already featured their life . another reason of why old people enjoy their life more is their financial status a generally the old people are richer than younger one which help them going on trip or performing a lot of activity . i think that the older people will not have a much commitment a the younger people have a in young age the person is always in stress looking towards building a successfull future , this of course take a lot of his time a he ha to study many course and prepare himself for entering the professional life . after that the young people become busy with thier new job they try to progress in their carreers and make money . they after that become concerned with building their own family by marriage and having baby . they remain always like this living in stress trying to accomplish many task and reach many goal until they reach to a relatively comfortable life . at this time only the begin thinking about enjoying their life and spending a good time performing activity . taking myself a an example i think i am not enjoying my life uptill the moment because i am always struggling to have a good life i wish for myself and my small family . i have always to study additional course , i spend my money in this course but i think this is mandatory to earn a degree a well a to increase my experience so that i get better job with higher salary . but if i look to my parent i find that they enjoy their life now , they go regularly to trip , they attend live performance and they enjoy practicing their hobby a drawing and reading . but of course i think that if i had a lot of money and a good job while i am young this will be the best option a i can enjoy travelling , playing soccer match and practicing some risky activity a climbing mountain and diving . but i believe that man ca n't get all what he want at the same time , so i am building my future now and i wish i can enjoy my life at a later period .
