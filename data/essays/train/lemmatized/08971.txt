today , there are many kind of person who behave in several different way . some take risk , some play it safe . most people think that person who take risk are more successful rather than others who do what they already know how to do well . it is difficult to say this statement is true or wrong . in fact , i think it is true that people try new thing and take risk are more successful than others for several reason . first of all , people who do n't take risk stay always in a same field . for example , a man who have already worked in a small restaurant have good chance to work in it for his or her entire life . on the other hand . eople who take risk could find their positive ability easily . therefore , they can work in a field that they are good to do for example . people who are not afraid to take risk could improve the probability to success , because they are always trying to do well . second , it is easier to get higher gain by taking risk . for example , an investor who invests in a mutural fund of a poor country could double or triple the amount of money faster . they take risk , but they are always challenging to make it better , therefore , they easily success in various situation . in contrast , people who do n't take any risk could get the gain safely , but slowly . we were all born to do something big to increase our well-being in this society , so why should they play it safe ? i really do n't think people who do n't take risk are more successfull than other who take risk . in summary , i agree that people take risk are more successful than others do n't take risk for those two reason . people are afraid to take risk to get more gain , but they should be brave enough to take some risk to succeed in their life .
