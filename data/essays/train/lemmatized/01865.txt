i disagree . there are several reason why i disagree with statement that say like young people do n't have enough time to helping their community . first , i think helping their community can be a great chance to learn about how to work . i focus on having lot of experience during the twenty all the time . there is a word in korea , `` to be a successful man , you should learn and learn , get more and more experience '' . as this word , learning and having experience is really important for any kind of person . besides , you can have a chance to get together with people meet first time . from my personal experience , the time you should have to be more friendly is not easy . however , after that difficult time , you can have new friend . and also , i think people should know about their community well . because , the community are the place where people decide to live , they must have many imformations about their community to do n't have a bad sight of their leader and change . to do a new thing that is not concerned with your study or work can be felt a a burdern . also some young people think it a a waste of time . but if people change mind and encounter bravely , people can obtain new thing and make their life more fresher . these are the reason why i prefer to helping community than not to do .
