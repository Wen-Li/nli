there are those who try new thing and take dangeous risk , and there are others who try thing which are already know to do well . from my point of view , it is better to do new thing even though there are a lot of heavy risk . there are several advantage of doing new thing ; new experience and sense of achievement . first of all , i can experience new thing and gain my knowledge . as i try and challenge new thing , i would find something important and valuable lesson that i do not know . for instance , i am joining in swimming club right now . since my coach moved to new swimming club , new coach came my club . of course , new coach did n't know my major stroke which wa free style . i told him about my major stroke , but he recommended me that i should swim at competition a breast stroke swimmer . i wa surprised because i never challenged to compete a breast stroke swimmer and that competition assembled very expert and elite swimmer . but i wanted to try my best . before the competition , i practiced so hard and asked my coach how i can swim breast stroke fast . as a result , i could swim the fastest breast stroke in my life at the competition . i learned from this happening a lot . second of all , when i try new thing that are never experienced , i would feel sense of achievement . if i try same thing that i know how to do well , there is no feeling after i finished those thing . i would feel boring and tired of it to do . but when i try new thing , i would feel exciting and passion to finish those new thing a perfect . i would collect data from intruments such a internet and book and ask friend how i can do well . if i finish my work to do new thing perfectly , i would feel sense of achievement and exhausted . considering all of above reason , most of people think it is better way to try thing that i already know because they wanted to do well , but when it come to me , i believe that people should try new thing even thought there are a lot of dangeous risk and difficulty . people should learn valuable lesson from new experience and feel sense of achievement .
