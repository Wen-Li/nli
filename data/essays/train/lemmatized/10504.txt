i agree with this opinion because i believe a lot of knowledge give people a lot of idea . it look completely true that for being specialist of one specific subject , all you have to do is continue to only study the subject for good . of course i think it is important for specialist to do their best for learning their topic . but i believe everything in the world is related complexly with others . for instance , let 's think about energy . it look very simply problem on fossil fuel , however it is not true . nowadays , most of human being can not live without energy . people must know that more and more use of fossil fuel make global warming . in addition , they also know fossil fuel such a oil or natural gas are limited . well , now , how many people can stop their convinient life thanks to energy ? i believe almost all people can not dispose their life completely right now . so what we should continue such life ? because of it , these day human are managing to deal with global warming and searching next new fuel of energy . when someone treat this problem , how can he cope with it , only using one specific subject ? engineering ? or chemistry ? or biology ? i never believe that any people could solve this problem only by one specific subject . therefore , i believe that everything is connected with others in some kind of shape , so we have to study many academic subject to cope with such difficult problem .
