i both agree and disgree with those two statemant . from my prepactive i thik what all matter is your comfor what ever you feel goood about you choose . basd on my experiance i traveled to many countriesaroud the wide world . howevr i just travel once with a group led by a tour guide , and i find it very intersting i have been to place that i have never been before even thought that i visit the contry before . the group led by a tour guide can save time and money . having a group led is very halpfull , becouse you get to see place without spending any affert or going around in cricles . it is very intresting becouse before you travel to the country , the group giude ha ha seted the shcudual . even it is chepper to travel with a group becouse evry thing is going by a group not indivaualy . when you travel by you self you are going to spend lot of money if you traveled by your self , or even straggle to find good plaecs to spend in . the disadvanteges of the group guide you cant haveprivecy . let say tat you are going in honey moon you are not going to choose a group guide . you might not get along with the group . one tiny disadvatage of the grop guide is some time they the scagual a plan and you might have fun , or you dont like the place to be exact . what i do recommend is if you have not tried the the group travel you got to try it even thought disagvantges but it 's worth it . the best two advandeges is you are going to save money and time .
