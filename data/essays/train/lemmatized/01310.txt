i will support the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . it is very short time that people are called a young . so i think most of young people enjoy their life because the time is really limited . my opinion is composed by the following reason . first , young people have enough time to study or learn at school . most of them are going to the school in order to obtain the skill or knowledge . sometimes studing is hard for student , but they can enjoy the class or lesson with their friend . futuermore , most of school have some interesting event for the student during the year . for example , my school have the event called `` internatioal day '' in which student in the international school will sell their traditional food or perform the traditional dance to other student . it is very interesting for me and i really enjoy it a i take a part of it . second young people have many opportunity to find out what they want to be in the future . it is difficult to think it but young people have enough time to consider what they want to do in the future . they can go to the university or expertise colledge in order to study more about the field that they are very interested in . sometimes it is possible that they can experience the social work in the society . for example many young people are willing to have a part time job . some people can find out what they want to do in the future through their job . finally young people can hang out with their friend during their free time . it is important to make a good friendship with others . most of older people do not have enough time to spend their time with their friend because they are busy . in contrast yound people can meet and talk to the friend whenever they want and can spend their time together . the friendship will be good a well . sometimes they can travel to the foreign country and make a great memory there . to conclude , young people have enough time to do something good for them . they have much time to study a lot , to spend with their friend and to think about their future . for these reason i agree with the idea that young people wnjoy life more than older people .
