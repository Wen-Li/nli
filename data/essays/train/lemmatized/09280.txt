according to the statement , there should be knlowdge on the academic subject and should gain more knlowdge on specialize specific subject . ` i disagree the statement . according to the passage there should have some knlowdge on other subject , than the specialized subject . for example take an electrical student his subject are totally consider of electricity , powerstations , grid , capictors , insulator , and etc .. , if he ha knlowdge o9n this subject he can move forward for higher study . if the subject for electrical student he have material management , environmental science , and etc .. , wats the use if he gain more knlowdge on this subject . he cant for social subject r statisc r banking . i wont tell that the student should not have knlowdge on this subject but he have to know som knlowdge on these subject . if he gain more knlowdge on the specialized subject ho will move on his course go forward for any compitative exam he will perform good and he will get score in that exam and he dont want to jump into other banking exam . and he keep his intrest on his specialized subject rather than his the unspecialized subject , he will becom topscorer i any xams and he might be famous all over the world and he is king of all continent . if he worked same for the board knlowdge of many academic subject a well a specialize subject he lost his much time on the board subject . if he spent that time for specialize subject he gain more knlowdge and he can score top in that subject and he can be school first for ever . from conclusion i give message that keep knlowdge on the boared subject , but dont neglect that subject and keep hard working on the specialize in one specific subject for more knlowdge .
