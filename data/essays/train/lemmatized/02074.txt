i definitely do agree with the statement because of several reason . firstly and most important , i suppose that learning just fact without understanding the idea or the concept behind , you do not have the context and the basis to keep single fact in mind for a long time . in addition , knowing the idea and concept always enables you to learn the fact later , for example when you need them . in generel , people do remember what they once unterstood but do forget what they just learned without understanding it . on the other hand , it is sometimes easier for student to learn the fact , because they get easier and faster access to reading material and book than to lecture and learning event which might better explain the idea and concept . in the short term , it might also appear more effective to learn just the fact in order to get a proper preparation for test , because it is often more efficient when test just ask for the fact . but in the long term , a i already said , it is much more effectiv to understand the concept which serf you a a valuable basis to put related knowlegde on . therefore , proffessors , ought to attract student to attend the learnig event in order to get an overwiev of the topic and understanding the concept and backround . from my own experience i know that i do not remember any fact of subjets , of which i did not understand the concept . but in case i understood the idea and the context , i know where my note are to get the demanded fact quickly . overall it becomes very clear that in the middle - and lorg term , understanding the concept and idea of a subject in order to learn effectively and keep thing in mind , is much more effective than just learning the fact .
