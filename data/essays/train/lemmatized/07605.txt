i agree w ? th the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the fact are forgetten easily but concept and idea are more permanent than fact . when i wa at high school i took lot of lecture that are h ? story , geography , math , biology and etc . i wa actually a successful student and all my exam grade were really high . however there wa a problem . when i did not attend to the class i wa stud ? ng before the exam , actually i d ? d not learn subject in detail just knew what they were . thus i passed all the class with high grade . when i came to university i recognized that i d ? d not understand many concept well . i have just known the name or date but why they are important is a question in my mind . somet ? me ? n class teacher asks someth ? ng that must be learned before but i can not remember even the main point . the only lesson that i am favor ? n ? s math which i really worked hard and examined many hypothesis and concept deeply during high school . in many lecture i benefit from my knowlodge related to math , so i am pleased to learn the math well in the past . furthermore it prof the importance of understanding idea and concept when working on something . students can not understand the importance of this matter themselves , so instruction should be responsible for teaching something in an understanting way .
