i agree young people enjoy life more than older people do . young people are strong , smarter and they can do work fastly comparing to older people . young people enjoy life in different way , they often go to movie , shopping etc . now-a-days young people are more brilliant , more smarter . young people when they go to park or movie they feel enthusiasm . for example , i am a young student i feel more enjoy when i spent with my friend . i often spend most of time with my friend , we went to movie , park etc . really i spend most of my time on new year day with my friend really it wa enjoyable day for me and i often meet so many friend and i tell new year wish with them . young people enjoy life more than older people but young people have to remember one thing you have to give respect , and you have to look them and you should be kind and respectful to them . finally , young people enjoy in different way and they have curiosity to enjoy and accomplish thing . one disadvantage about young people is that they do some thing wrongly beacause thay are teenager .
