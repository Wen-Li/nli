nowadays , people start to begin frightened about the fact that pehaps in the next century , there won t be enought oil or petrol and so that it will be impossible to use car anymore . i believe that it is probable that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i think the most important fact is that people strart to pay more attention at how and when they use their car because there are a lot of problem with country which have the oil . and another important point is that the ressourses of oil have decreased considerably these last few year . in addition to that the governement of my country try to sensibilize citizen to the fact that car pollute a lot and it is very bad for the environement . nature begin to take an important place in a lot of goverenemental decision which could also deacrease the number of car . however , for some the idea to not use the car is somethings unrealistic and unbelievable . these people do not care about the environement , and for them it doesn t matter if they pollute . so they are going to use their car . futhermore , perhaps , some new energy could be created such a electric or sun energy , which don t need oil and don t pollute and so that they could be used by the driver . in both point , there will not be a decrease of car in the street , because it would be new one with new kind of energy . in conclusion , i think that there will be the same amount of car in the street . nevertheless , i believe that with the new technology and the decrease of oil in the wolrd , it will be new car which don t need oil a energy . i also hope people would try to use le theirs car even if they pollute le . it would be better for the environement .
