in general i agree with the statement made , that there will be fewer car in use , in twenty year than there are today . .. it is hard to imagine , that the amount of car will be reduced , especially in the moment that a car is not only a way to travel but also a symbol of wealth and status . but there are to many reason which are against the fact , that this progress will continue much longer . for example the price for petrol : it 's the first time since a year , that the price for one litre petrol in germany is under 1 , 50euro . if the price for oil rise further ( due to the conflict in the middle east ) , the price for petrol will rise automatically . so , apart from the money you have to pay for tax and the insurance for your car anyway , you also have to take in account the amount of money you spend on petrol every month . i 'm doing my driver licence in the moment and i must honestly say that i 'm not really keane about it . of course it 's nice to have and very comfortable , but i live in berlin and the public transport is excellent-so why taking the car if i 'd be in town much quicker with the train or a bus ? ! further , the price for flight and train have decreased enormously during the last few year . why should you take a car to get to another city , if you could probably even fly nearly a cheap if not cheaper ? ! with the car , you would probably take much longer due to traffic yam or bad street , while you could book a cheap flight and get to your destination much more relaxed and comfortable . or the train nowadays . .. i took a train the other day going from berlin to frankfurt and back in one day , for an interview . all in all , it took me eight hour , which is still a long time but i wa driving in on of those new ices . i could have never made this trip in one day in a car . while i wa driving over 250km/h i could read my book , prepare my interview and just sleep without worring about anything other than getting out at the right stop . and by the time i got back to berlin i did n't even feel like i 've just been on a little germany-trip-i wa relaxed and happy . all those reason mentioned above are only a small number of reason why the number of car will decrease during the next twenty year . our world is changing . it 's becoming faster and faster and the car wo n't be able to keep up with the pace . in future it will be to slow and far to expensive for everyone to have one and use it in his daily-life .
