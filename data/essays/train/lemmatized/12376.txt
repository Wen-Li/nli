i disagree with the opinion that there are fewer car in use than there are today . nowadays , car support a lot of thing , such a nation , corporation of car , our life . there are two reason for my opinion : convenience and economic . first of all , car is so convenient for u to move somewhere . in modern city or nation in all over the world , most society is car society . the family living in town ha one or two car . it is impossible for u in modern society to discover the person who do not have car or use car . for instance , my familiy ha four car such a my father , mine , my aunt , and my brother . my father go to his corporation by his car every day . futhermore , if you want to go to somewhere , car bring u to the place where we would like to go . today , we are helped by car whenever we transfer anywhere and we feel convenient of useing the car . second of all , car society help our ecomomic situation . most people is use the car . for example , in order to use the car , we must buy it . all in all , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . we do not think the world that there are not car at all because of convenience and economic .
