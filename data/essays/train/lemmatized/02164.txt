better use of public transportation and different travelling habit , leading to fewer car : surely , this is the way many ecologist dream of the ideal future . but is it truly realistic ? not many argument available today support this vision . quite the opposite , in fact , seems to be taking place . first , urban planning tends to induce an increased use of car . the taste for individual home , with garden , away from the city 's pollution , encourages urban sprawl . the result of this is that any travelling need a car . shops , mall , museum , are simply too far away from the suburb for people to simply walk there . some might argue that the oncoming limitation in available oil ressources , a well a the growing concern about global warming , might change people 's behavior . however , one could challenge this view by noticing the current improvement in engine ' technology . they tend to make car cleaner and le polluting . this could make the moral dilemna to use the car or not an irrelevant one . cars will change , not how often people use them . another important factor lie in the need of developing country . china , india and brazil nowadays , and other country tomorrow , have a growing middle class and urban population . these people can afford to buy a car , even two . they might also start having country house , and car are often necessary to travel there . lastly , i believe travel by car corresponds to a deep trend in our modern individualistic society . people , when confronted with a choice , would rather travel alone or with their family than with random stranger in a closed space . this show that time and money are not the only factor when people have to choose between different way to travel . how good you feel , how freely you can behave when in a car , could outweigh seemingly more relevant argument . the tendency in the industry to customize each car for the individual customer is an illustration of the importance of this `` feel-good '' factor . all in all , i think these argument tend to go against the statement that the number of car in use will decrease . cars and the us of car will evolve - but their number are not likely to go down .
