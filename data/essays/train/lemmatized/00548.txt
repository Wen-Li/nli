learning facts mean knowing the past , who the culture of every incident and every fact are created and followed by our people . i agree the above statement , its is every important for a student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . learning fact are more essential than to understand these fact . mainly the student must know about the fact and he must understand the fact and then he must understand the concept . the importance of these fact show a good nature and brightness on the student by telling him or explaining these fact to him . he will be so active and will not do any misbehaviour in any certain accepts . after knowing the effectiveness on thes efacts the student will be more positive in nature . the importance of these fact is , we can learn easily these fact . it is very difficult to understand and perform in the real life . but putting on to the real life this lead a big role . for example take a student , telling the future or subject is simple for a teacher , the student will easily grasp the subject , but inside these subject the exists some many fact that evena teacher doesn `` t know . the teacher must get through these fact and must explain to the student so they may understand these idea and the concept must explain by the teacher to the student a to developed the sudents brain . for example take our indian culture , we can tell the student that out culture is this and we must be in such a manner who our beloved neighbour and the past people will be living . the student make take this lightly and they may not be ha every one live . they live ther own life . but if they understand these idea and concept they will complusory be like a past people be living . students are only one who make bring out nation forward . so , they have to understand every fact and they have to improve the skill by calculating and producing the concept . finally i conclude that student must know eney moment and fact . atlast i say that student must not only learn the fact but they must have understand idea and the concept .
