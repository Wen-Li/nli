students are important to learn or understand the idea and concept because by understanding the idea of the subject and consept of the subject , it will make student learn easily than for them to learn fact . stuends must sure about the subject by the concept and understand idea while the leacturer teach that subject . by understanding the idea of that subject it is so easy to study and it is easy to remember the subject a long a possible . so i agree that the student must understand idea and concept of the subject instead of them to learn fact . students must understand the concept of the leactures subject while teaching . for example , in exam it is easy remen \ mber the concept of the subject and it can easy for writing the exam . we can implement our own idea while we understand idea and concept the subject . we can do research on the subject by implementing new idea with our own concept . by understanding idea and concept of the subject we can seminar at different place and we can clarify the doubt of the subject . the reason for choosing that the student must keep consentrated in the classroom while the leacture explain . the student must intracts with leacture by giving new idea of solving the problem by this the class will be so involed in the topic of that subject . students can clarify there doubt with the leacturer . students must familiar with the subject by understanding idea and concept of the subject . where the learn fact are simillarly good to gain knowledge by there learn fact . it will take more time for them to learn factbecause they have now the concept and understand the idea by there own will take time . it is so tough that to learn fact with them . so i preferd that the student must understand idea and concept of the subjectby the leacture instead of them to learn fact . learning concept and understand idea are more important to student .
