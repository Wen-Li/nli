i disagree to the statement that young people today give le time to helping community . i myself form a relevant example . i am twenty-seven year old and have been actively involved in community service for the past six year now . i have taken up various type of project . i have given lecture in health camp organized for the slum dweller . i have organized blood donation camp with the colleague at my workplace . while i wa in gemany , i tutored english to student and job-seekers from various part of the world who had come to germany for study and work but could not afford the costly language school . being an electrical engineer , i have volunteered to teach professional course of electrician , to help people make a living for themselves . currently i am working with a project for rural woman . i am organising this project in order to build expertise in rural woman to take up small task which can help them earn a living and also rear the traditional rural art of cooking , stiching , embroidery , etc . and it would not at all be strange to reveal that all the activity that i have mentioned above have been done in group of fellow young student and professional . i name u all `` philanthropic enthusiast '' . i have seen people from different background joining hand to improve the society around . and whenever i have asked the amateur about the reason behind their interest for community , i have got the same answwer . that they all get a strange satisfaction in these volunteer activity . this feeling of fulfillment fill the void in their life which is created by the day to day struggle at university , office , personal relationship , etc . in fact , i feel that young people today are more active than they were a decade ago . this may in turn be to some part attributed to the education system across the globe . schools and universitites today mandate that a particular number of hour per week be spent in community service . this madate help student learn the advantage of such work and in the process they start loving it . they also realise that how the volunteer work serf dual purpose , of enhancing the community and the individual a well .
