i disagree with this statement . as a young people myself , i really do not have the feeling to enjoy my life a much a i could . without having any health issue , nor special disability that old people might have on a daily basis , i am just so concerned about my future that it doe not permit me to appreciate the enjoyment of the life . as a young people , your entire life is devoted to the preparation of the future and to how to cope with the responsabilities that accompany the life a an adult : a young people ha to obtain a high diploma to get a good job to pay the appartment to have a family and to afford for it . this is why a young person might go through his youth without enjoyment . as an example , most of student do , during their study , a job or an internship , to have money for some higher study or to complete them with professional experience that might be taken into account by their future employer . in such circumstance , how can they enjoy their life a student ? they have no time to go to student party , or they are too much tired . .. besides , most of them are conscious that these year were supposed to be the best , a their parent told them . young people do not enjoy life than older do , and they propbably enjoy it le than older do . although the energy of the youth render the obstacle of life easier to go through , it is sometimes hard to be young . the only thing that can help a young person to enjoy his present life is to consider that such a life will get better and better .
