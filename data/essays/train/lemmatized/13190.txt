the situation of learnning simplely but deeply or widely is a thing depends on the time . i 'm really not agree with only judging it by good or bad . human 's life is a long time , sometimes we should do something , but some other time maybe we need other thing . in one 's undergraduate time , it is fit to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . thus you have four or even three year to study in university , and also you are young . you have the spirit to explore the unclear thing and fill in your mind . it will let you do well when you face to social , a you have more theory knowledge and special experience . the enviroment of the university is good for learn more thing . there ha lot of excellent professor , and you can exchange your opinion with your classmate . for example , if you are comparing to make a design which is about geogerophy , how will adverse your bos to use your design ? but if you have a knowledge background about the geogerophy , you will do better . after graduating from university , if you want to go on developing youself , you had better to specialize in one specific subject . at that time , you have le time , and you must think about your life and how to offer your family . the fact will tell you that you should do something more deeply , a your spirit is limited . another reason is no one can do lot of thing in the same time . if you want do the best , you should pay more attention on what you are doing . just like we ca n't choose both sleep and eat . broad knowledge is a wonderful thing , but we ca n't control all of them in fact . specialism sometimes look like boring . what you will do depends on youself .
