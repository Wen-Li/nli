i agree with the statement mentioned in the question . there are several argument for my decision which i try to illustrate in the following essay . first of all , trying new thing and taking risk always contain new chance which would n't be offered to you otherwise . if you continue what you already know , there wo n't never be the chance to develope . i want to give an example to demonstrate my thought : i 've been living in small town in the south of germany for 20 year . i knew nothing about the life in a big city or how people in other part of germany behave . but last year i had to move to hamburg because of my new job . knowing nobody it wa a hard beginning in such an enourmous metropole . now i can state that my personnel horizont ha grown a lot because i made experience i would have never lived staying at home with my parent . furthermore , life would be very annoying without no action or risk . the most people have to work all the day and for that reason there is n't much time remaining for hobby . why should n't we try something extraordinary or ecxiting in our le free time ? for example , learning a new instrument or trying bungee jumping ? as for me , these are the highlight which enriches our life because they offer u a short break in our every day life . the third argument that i want to mention concern taking risk . i 'm totally convinced that we ca n't reach a high aim by excluding every risk . for example if someone give up his or her safe job in an economy in order to start his or her own business , there will always be the risk that the business can fail and that he or her will lost all the money . for that reason , it 's necessary to accept the risk and to be conscious of because you will only be able to success if you are n't fear the disadvantage or the risk .
