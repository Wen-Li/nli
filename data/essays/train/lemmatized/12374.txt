yes , i do think that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . after all , it is one objective of publicity and i think it is well achieved , especially nowadays . today , there are ad everywhere you look . on internet , on the street , in the metro , on tv and even in public washroom . big company have the power to buy a lot of publicity space and by placing their advertissements everywhere it can definitively make you think that their product is better then it actually . this can make you think that a certain product is the new trend . it is everywhere so why not in your home . many reality tv show use such an approach . they talk about it during the news , the ad are everywhere , you can chat we the `` star '' , you can support your favorite star . .. but the show is usually not that great . also , a lot of advertisement feature star . most nike product refer to a professional athlete for example . they want you to think that if you are wearing the new jumpman basketball shoe , you might be a good a micheal jordan . people do not think that they will be a good a the star of course , but at least they will be equip just like they are . but having a product related to a star doe not tell anything about it quality . there is also a huge focus made in publicity on the fact that a certain product is new . most people think that a new product or a new technology is always better than the previous one while this is not true . just think about the ski market . each year a new type of ski is released : parabolic ski , mini ski and on top of that , they are designed with new material . this impression of new make the product look better than the previous one while many scientific research often prove the contrary . because advertissements are everywhere , it feature star and focus on new , i think it look better than it
