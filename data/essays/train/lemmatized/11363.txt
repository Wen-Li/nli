in my university , most of the student tend to complete their study in the field that they started , and they direct their mind into one specific subject without going out of it . for student this easy path always give many advantage on their own field . however , without any interaction with other subject academic life might be too mediocre . students who satisfy all the offered course in one subject have a good chance to enhance in that subject , and they can easily follow what is required for them because the curriculum is already determined for them . for example , during the whole of his/her undergraduate study , a student who study in department of mathematic must register for a certain number of credit or course which are all related to mathematics . such a person whose mind is full of mathematical problem might be a very reputed academician or scientist in the future , but he/she loses the chance of learning different subject and relating and developing them . on the other hand , one who try to get a broad knowledge of various academic field can use those subject with each other . in other word , one specific subject can help to develop another . for instance , although i studied philosophy at the university , in the second year of my study i chose to register for a minor program on architectrue . this gave me o good chance to interprete architectural production in a philosophical way . i gained a chance to investigate architectural effect on human . in conclusion , even though specializtion on a single subject might be useful within that subject , for me it is more enjoyable and interesting to specialize in avariety of subject . this provides me to create my own style in the academy .
