i agree with the statement for several reason . many century ago , the total amount of scientific knowledge wa not very big . one usually think of a man of the 16 century , say galileo , a a complete man only if he or she master all the aspect of science . nowadays , every specific discipline ha grown to an extend that it is impossible to master it all . for example , let concentrate on physics . there are lot of very specific sub-fields , like barion particle physics or maser optics . it is impossible to know everything about all the specific sub-fields , even if we concentrate only in physics . since it is not possible to master an entire discipline like physics , i think the best option is to try to know a little bit about everything . second , people specialized in a specific subject can find very hard to interact with other scientist . every discipline ha it own mathematical tool , it own vocabulary and it own way of thinking . therefore it is really difficult to get a good interaction between a biologist and a geologist . a person who can handle many academic subject can interact with a lot of people . third , a scientist who ha a broad knowledge can always get advise from a expert in a specific field when needed . it will be much harder for an expert to get an aplication of his knowledge in other field because of the lack of knowledge of the potential application . for example , it could be really hard for a matematiscian to get an application of some probability theory to sociology . on the other hand , a sociologist that know a little of mathematics , could ask an expert all the question he or she ha . in conclusion , i think it is a better strategy to try to manage several discipline . one can always get advise from an expert if needed . also it will be easier to interact for a person who know about several academic subject .
