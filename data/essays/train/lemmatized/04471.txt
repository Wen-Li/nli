as iam an young people i will not agree the statement `` young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community '' mostly young people have many respondsbilities in these young age like education , part time job and looking there family work even thouh young people are helping there community in many way directly and indirectly . mainly the young people help the commnity or there nation by joining the defence service for there country . the young people were the first person to oranganse any function or meeting in there colony or society and these people only maintain all the orangements and success to activity . when people or country were facing problem with natural cliamatics like earth quake , heavy rainfall , or destroes mainly only the young people come first to collect the fund and give moral support to the people and govering bobies of nation . when an univerisies or collage celebrataing any event like collage day or any activity the success beyond that wa none other then these people the young people were good in helping the people in remote area by giving knowledge for them in education and promoting goverment project and program in development process . people now a day were aslo partisprating in many event which were relating to social and economics factor , mainly in social activity like helping the poor and old people in homeges and giving lot of support to these people who were in need . espeaicaly the young scientics and software enggineers were becoming backbone to the nation economy and development of nation . in many communitical active like marothons and sport event only the young people were getting all the pretiege to nation and community . not only these many event like protecting commnity from cleaness and emplyment all thing were going to be done by the young people . so my support to young is always good and it good to nation .
