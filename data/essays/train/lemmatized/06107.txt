my parent often tell me to enjoy life . i understood that they have some regret about thing they wanted to do but they did n't . that 's why i am sure that older people enjoy life more than young people . i consider that young people are people from 15 to 30 year old . i think young people do n't have time to enjoy life . except the young people who do n't care about his future , the others have always to work hard in order to have a good job , a good life . .. they are constantly worried by something . older people , who know that there are thing more important than money because of their experience , try to enjoy life a long a they can . that 's why my parent , and more generaly most of the parent , try to have good time with their child , even when child do n't want . the fact that older people know the death , and realize how life is short , is a reason of my conviction . they try to do everything they could n't do when they were younger , and that 's why we can observe more and more parent practicing activity `` reserved '' to young people . i remember the day i met a group of older people in a party organized for young people . it wa really amazing because they seemed to have more fun than u . i do n't say that young people never have fun . we see more young people in concert or bowling than older people . but the way to appreciate the moment is not the same . because of their experience , older people tend to appreciate more than u . younger people often do n't realize that life will not be always like a student life . they think that it will go on so they do n't appreciate . to conclude , older people enjoy life more than younger people , a far a their body allows them .
