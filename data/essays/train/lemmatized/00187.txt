since i wa a little girl , i have heard and read many successful story of different people . i believe and agree that successful people are the one who try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . first of all , my dance teacher always told u to get out from our comfortable zone when we are choreographing the dance . the dancer are tend to choreograph their favorite genre . for example , a dancer , who like a genre of modern , ha more possibility to choreograph a modern piece . however , if that person take a risk to choreograph a hip hop piece , there will also be a possibility to be a successful choreographer . my teacher told u that we are going to research and think about the choreography if we try new thing , which in this case a choreography . many of her student created masterpiece by taking risk ; those piece were selected for the state festival and other honored show . there is a chance to become successful , but also not successful . it is a life . some people take risk and then lose their property such a money , family , and more . taking risk ha a huge risk . however , if we try again and again , success will come back to u . one of the famous cartoonist in the world , walt disney , had to try new thing . because his company stole his character from him and gave it to other cartoonist of that company , he lost his job . but , he never stopped to put effort ; the micky mouse wa born . even though he could earn so much money , he tried new thing such a making a long animated film for the first time . the thing he tried had always risk , but he became successful eventually . he wa a person that if he love his job , he will always try new thing . this is one way to be a successful . in conclusion , we should never stop trying new thing in our life . even we face hardship , if we try so many time , those effort we put will be paid off . this is how to be successful . therefore , i agree that successful people are one who try new thing and take risk .
