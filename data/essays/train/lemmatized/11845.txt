world is on developing , and every day scientist invente anew mation or car , and a we are living in this wide world we are using these new invevtions and will use what will be discovered later , so i disagree with the satement that say there will be fewer car in the future for two reason , people need car to move from one plase to another , and also i think that tow are geting gigger and wider even if these car are poluting the environment . my first reason is that car are now a day like people 's leg they use car to go to there job , to go shopping or any where , moreover the weather is not always nice and sutable to walk so using car with air condition is mor practical , for example i am living in emerits and the weather here is hot all the year so l ca n't wallk to reach my school everyday so i use the school bus everyday to reach my school . the second reason of thinking that car will be using in the futhur is that town are getting widder and bidder so it is hard not to use car to reach your distiny in addition to that plain are expensive to use dayly for example when my father wa working in a another town which wa far way from our home towen so he usud airplans to go to his job every week it coast him alot in fact about of of his sallary . in conclution i think people cant stop using there car unless an another inventer invent something instead of the car to help people moveng from on place to another .
