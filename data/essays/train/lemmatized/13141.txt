in my personal experience , i have traveled both in a group led by a tour guide , and in a group with out a tour guide . i think that one of this experince is better and fun . next i will comparate this two situation . if you travel whit a tour guide , then you do n't need to search map , itineraires and local information , because the tour guide will have all the thing that you migth need on a trip , this is a possitive sigth of traveling with a guide . but also travel with a guide mean that you are not owner on you schedule , because you need to follow the itinerary of travel agency . for example , when i went to brasil with my class , i had to do all the thing that the tour guide tell u to do , so we ca n't decide wich restorant pick for lunch , or with pub to go on nigths . on the other side of the coin , if you travel by yourself , with out a tour guide , then you can do all the thing that you want to do , for example , if you wish to sleep all the afternoon on the beach on rio de janeiro , you can do it ; or if you want to spend one entierely day on just one place , you can do it too . but such a the first position ( travel with a guide tour ) , travel with out a guide implies some problem , for example : where can i change money ? , where can i register in ? , how much should i pay for a suvenir ? . in my personal opinnion , i think that travel in grup with out a guide is the best way to travel . this mean that you can program your own trip , and you dont need to follow an schedule . when i have traveled with out the led of a tour guide , i 've had more funn .
