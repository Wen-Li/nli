the goal of advertisement is to show product better that they really are , so i agree with the statement . if business people use advertisement it is only to increase theirs benefit . fot that , they need to sell more . by consequence , they have to show that their product is the best . for example , advetissements for french cheese . a `` camembert '' is the same everywhere . so to increase the sale , they try to increase some aspect like more cream . so with technology and artificial caracters the cheese look better on tv or paper but in reality it is exactly the same that before . when you walk on the road , and you see an advertisemts you are most of the time attracted by the product . for example a chocolate advertissement , with the reflection of the light on the slab , the brown color is more dark so it look better . but because the aspect of the picture is better , the product look better . so advertisement play with your sweety taste . depend on the moment of the year where you are , advertiser play with advertisement . for example , during christmas period , a certain product look better than three month ago only because there is a better or different presentation . this is the focus of an advertisement and in this case the only difference for the sale is the advertisement . if you want to rise your benefit , there is also the way : increase the need . for example for a vacuum , the used is the same every way but if you underline the fact that it is easy to use or esay to put an board the product look better . but if you think about that a vaccum stay a vacuum and you will use exactly on the same maner and it is the same product . due to the objectif of an advertisement , advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
