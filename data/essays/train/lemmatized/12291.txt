this statement ha been greatly discussed in many didactic environment for the simple reason that some consider the theoretical knowledge to be more important than the practical one and some consider the opposite . i wa lucky to have personally attended school that agreed and disagreed with the statement since i attended an italian high school ( that relies mostly on idea and concept ) and a canadian high school ( that focus more on real fact that occured ) . this is why foreigner find that italian know how to talk about a certain topic but they do not know how to actually solve ( or i should say ) `` fix '' it . my uncle , an engineer who life in canada , once attended a conference here in italy and he noticed how italians honestly might know more about the theory ( in this case physic or math ) but need help from the more `` hands-on '' engineer from abroad who considered real case during their education giving them a higher experience . in my opinion learning about fact is definately more enjoyable and gain a higher interest within the student . it also give you a better insight of today 's world situation . the reason why we study history is because we ought to learn about event that occured in the past and to prevent the same mistake or find a better solution . once i came back from my school year abroad it wa n't easy for me to get used to the old and stricter method . i tried to make my teacher understand and realize how a fact that occured implicitely ha the concept in it . experience also play a key role and to discus about real fact certainly help a lot . as once oscar wilde said `` experience is the name we give to our mistake '' . this is why i believe that it is definately important to learn and understand idea and concept but the next fundamental step would be to consider a real fact that concern it . italy ha a very ancient background on it shoulder and it would be very hard to change it attitude or point of view .
