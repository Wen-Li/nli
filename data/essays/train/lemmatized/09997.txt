in the era of ever changing technology , the person with specializaton in a subject and with a broad knowledge is needed . both specialization and broad knowledge about the subject is needed . there are many advantage on both side . specializing would help the person to understand the subject in a better way , aslo he can apply his knowlege to improve the existing world . on the other hand having a broad knowledge help in combing his or her knowledge from various field to produce a complex product . consider , the person with specialization in a subject , this person would able to work on the real life problem relating to the subject and might come up with a solution . for example , a eye specialist would know the various way in which the eye can be treated because he is well informed about the process a he had studied about the eye in detail . the specialized person can deal with the problem relating to their subject in a better way than a person having a broad knowledge . person with specialization can also do research and come up with a discoevry and act a pioneer although there are some advantage of being a specialist , having a broad knowledge is also required . the person having a broad knowlege can choose the best suitable and available method and integrate them to produce a product which is truly unique and complex . for example consider a robotic student , while building a robot the student need to know various subject like programing , mechanic and the electronic communication system . the knowledge from the subject is integrated in producing a robot which is combination of the subject . in conclusion , specialization help the person in better understanding of subject and also enhacing the knowledege by doing research , while a person who is a jack of all trade , that is to have a broad knowlege about many subject will have the ability to combine the knowledge from various field to create a unique product . so in my view both the specilazation in a subject and having a overall knowledge is need to futher our technology
