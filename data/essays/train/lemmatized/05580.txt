the textbook in which the student study with are listed with fact . most of them can not be taught by the student themselves without full understanding of the content . by this fact , other example and personal experience , i have been convinced that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . our current society requires student to use their knowledge effectively later in their life . by just learning fact , they can not understand the basic concept and idea to make their knowledge useful . our current society is advancing rapidly to fit our need and want . in order to keep the advancement , the student need to understand the concept rather than fact . if , for example , a student learns only the fact that one plus one equal to two , and two time four is equal to eight , the student will only learn the answer of that problem without any progress . the society work the same . students must learn the major concept and idea in order to progress later in life . another reason is from my personal experience . while i wa studying the political science , i could only memorize the fact and could not understand the concept . in the test that occurred a day later , i could only answer the question which were exactly same a the sentence stated in the textbook . i requested the professor for a retake . when i asked my father , who ha a job involving politics , he gave me the basic concept of politics and how it worked . consequently , i wa abled to get a perfect score in the same subject the next day . only with the knowledge of the concept rather than fact can one to put it in various solution to method . by just learning the fact , one can only earn one fact . by learning the idea and concept , however , one can use it into various method and eventually aquire numerous fact . therefore , i beleive it is crucial for student to understand idea and concept rather than fact .
