in my opinion , to have board knowledge of many academic subjedts is better than to specialize in one specific subject . first of all , recently sociaty want person who have variety ability . for example , when many company elect people , consider leadership , another contry languge ability . there are one example that my friend major is sound engineering . he have struggled it . he spend all time listen to music work hard .
