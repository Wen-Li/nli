i partly agree with this idea . i think that in twenty year , all technology will be more improved and those will realize the dream we are thinking impossible to do now . recently , the problem about car exhausting air are becoming more and more serious . the main reason about global warming which is broadly belived is the useages of many car . therefore , there are many people involved to develop car to more harmless vehicle . however , i think that shape or priciples of it moving will not be so changed . once i watched the movie dispicting the future world . there were many car . however , they did not look like moving by engine . they seemed to be using something like magnetic field and cntroled by trafic center . also , i have seen that car were flying around in the sky and took u to the destination in many sientific fiction . they resembles to the present car but the function are different . warp can be the one that is generally regarded to be a great method to move around place to place . it look really convinient and le tiresome . i remeber that i really envied the hero in cartoon moved so quickly by using warp . however , when i became a highschool student and learned physic , i found out it is impossible because it us real great amount of power to warp . furthermore , even if we combine all power existing in the universe , we can not warp a person to another place . i assume that car are the most sophisticated vehicle for transporting and the necessity will be still big in the future . however , the energy for using them might change and maybe they will be floating in the air so that they will be ableto go above sea . i wonder if this will still defined a a car but the appearence is like a car so i shall call it a car .
