since this statement is not very definite it is not easy to say if i agree or disagree . what i am saying is that not all young people are the same . neither old people are . at first , i asked myself the question : who is young and who is old - how old is old , how old is young ? if you ask a teenager he will propably tell you that everybody over 25 is old and if you ask a 40 year old he will say that 60 is old . in the following part of my answer i will thing of young people beening up to 30 year and old people are all the person beeing older than that . and there is still one big problem : not all people under 30 are the same , neither are the people over 30 . i think young people always had fun . young people go partying , they enjoy `` sex , drungs and rock'n roll '' , they travel the world , they play sport and enjoy their life . young people always have done such thing . my generation did , my parent generation did , my gradparents generation did my kid will probalbly do too one day . it is different with old people : in past day the people worked a lot and once they retired they died soon . they somethimes went on vacation , but that wa it . today old people start to enjoy their life , too . since the population get older and older there are so many old people who can spent their remaining time with nice thing . some move to a nice warm place in the south , some travel and do crus , others start going to university again . in today time people of all age have the chance to enjoy their life . there are always people who do n't know how to enjoy life , but that doe n't depent on their age . in the mainstream both , young and old people , enjoy there life . i can not say who doe more because they do it in a different way .
