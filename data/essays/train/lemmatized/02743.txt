successful people always need not try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . but sometimes i support that trying to do thing in new manner always give the interest and enthusiasm to work but at the same time all the way which a person selects may not lead to success . and when we talk in the other manner , the exact way to success will always be only one i.e. hard work which are the inspirational saying of swami vivekananda ( a famous pylosophist of india ) and one can not achieve the success if one doe follow the other way than working hard . the successful person only dare to take the risk to try new thing a he already experienced the success and the unsuccessful person can not take risk everytime to try thing in new style but he can search for the best path which would lead to his success in my opinion , i agree partially , that the successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well because they do not wanted to get bored with the same old way to do thing . and rather they like to have some risk to do their job in a different manner which would add the spice to their work and life . but at the same time it add the risk and the job may not be successfull .
