a the time passe , the world undergo many change in all field and aspect of life . people can sense the change in their surroundings , their life style and ofcoures in their attitude towards different issue . we may think of the coming future in many different way and see it from variuos point of view . some of u are obtimistic looking at the future from a positive out look , expecting the best to come and hoping for further development with le damage . others see the future from a different angle , thinking that the non-stop progress of modern technology will bring the earth into an unpleasant end . the future is not our time it is the time of our comoing generation , we only have the present time , and only the present time that we could change and improve , however , our action in the present time will participate in shaping the future , therefore we have to consider both the short term and long term consiquences of any action that we are about to take inorder to ensure our childern a better and safer future . it is hard to predict wether if the number of car in 20 year will be more or le than the presnt time . taking into account the rapid growth of world population and the increasing life demand , that urge people to move from one place to an other , to get their need done . you may think that the number of car is more likely going to increase by two or three fold , this is unlikely to happen for few reason , first , in oredr to fit this great number of car new road should be built and the old one should be expanded to fit the significant number of car , which mean that government have to reconstruct the infrastructure of the city in order to apply such alteration and to so great deal of money must be spent that will most probably exceed the government 's budget in most country , on top of that the international economy is declinig and the economist perdicitons indicate that this decline will continue for next 40 or 50 year ahead . government will search for more effective mean for transportation that produce le environmental hazard , like under developing the current under ground transportation and increasing the capacity also some regulating law may be passed in which car are not allowed to be used unless if the number of passangers exceeds 4 people . a a result the number of car in the future is most likely to remain the same if not decline upon the intorduction of new transporation mean .
