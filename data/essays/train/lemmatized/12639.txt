i emphatically disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . youth is a time of insecurity and uncertainity , of tremendous pressure to carve a name for oneself and succeed . one often hears about teenager or young professional taking their own life on account of fear of failure . youngsters are often too full of angst to enjoy themselves . they have to face peer pressure which may detract them from pursuit of their own happiness . on the other hand , older or maturer people are more sure of themselves and clearer about what they want in life . they are also aware about the limited time span that each of u have on this earth . they learn to enjoy each momemt to the fullest . with maturity people are better able to withstand peer pressure and make decision based on what they want rather than on other people 's expectation of what they should be doing . maturity also brings a sense of acceptance of what one is and what one is not ( in term of capability ) . acceptance of oneselves can be a truly liberating experience and open door towards pursuit of one 's calling or special aptitute . age often brings financial security enabling one to explore one 's dream , hobby and hidden ambition . the older people are also better networked socially and contributing member of their community - this positively impact their self esteem . i met anjali , a retired banker in my italian class . she wa the most enthusiastic of all student and ended up topping the class . post retirement she wa fully exploring her love of language and making full use of resource such a time and money available . she already knew german and wa planning to study next level of italian . when i met her after a year of passing out of italian livello i , she wa already through with her livello iii and enrolled in a french class . her zest for life is truly infectious . in summation i would state that older people are much more capable of enjoyment and they often do enjoy their life more than youngster do .
