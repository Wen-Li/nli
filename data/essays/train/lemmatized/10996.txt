it is highly probable that people who have reached success in life have taken certain risk that others were not inclined to undertake . in my opinion this statement could have a certain credibility , even if a satisfying scientific evidence seems hard to be obtained . on the onset , the issue is to define the term `` success '' . there could not be clear agreement on it significance . if for many success mean the holding of personal property or of large quanitity of material good ( money and the like ) , for others could be exactly the opposite . success for them is simply the reaching of a happy life , being satisfied within the family and the close community . it is true , however , that we could agree in general term on it perception . a successful person is the one who ha reached a certain social prestige , who maybe ha a certain public visibility or ha influenced in some way the life of other member of the community or the society . in my opinion , it could be true for certain person to socially succeed ( attaining a social visibility ) and become known by others . this is so because curiousity a well a capability of taking risk are part of humanity . intellect make human curious and willing to explore new territory . the natural quality of human make them to aspire to reach new goal thorugh specific project . for sure we have example of successful people in many field , like the humanity the finacial and industry and similar . we can think about plato or aristoteles or enstein or great leader , like julius cesar or poet like dante . they did something that distinguished them from the others . they tried new thing . einstein explored what wa unthinkable before him . dante left u one of the most complex and inspired poem . for many of them , however , it seems that the driving force is not the search of a personal reward for it sake , but the search of an interst in life coupled by curiosity and service to the society . in breif , if we know today that they gained success , it would be very interesting to explore what were ( and still are in successful people today ) the motivation at the base of their project and risk .
