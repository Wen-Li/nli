in my point of view i completely disagree with the statement `` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' . in my country , everyone enjoys life a much a possible and for them they do not care about their age . for them age is just a number ; they think that the spirit that is within themselves is what matter . so they enjoy their life to it maximum in any period of time . and so , do i . besides , everyone ha many goal , and one of them is to enjoy life . so no matter what age you are you can enjoy life . for instance a child could be thinking that he is enjoying life when he/she is playing with his/her friend , now let 's see a old person having a vacation on the bahamas spending his/her time with the person that he/she love . in my point of view , both people , the child and the old person are enjoying life , and i do not see why would one of them enjoy life more than the other . as i said before everyone ha a spirit and i personally do not think that the spirit get older a the day pas by . within one 's spirit there is energy . energy is what take u from one place to another ; to eat or not to eat ; to do thing or not to thing ; to enjoy life or not to enjoy life . so then , if everyone ha a spirit that mean that they also have energy , therefore everyone ha an equal amount of energy to enjoy life at any period of time . to put in other word , age doe not matter for someone to enjoy life . in conclusion , young people do not enjoy life more than older people do because we are all the same . it is true that when you get older the muscle start to be more flexible and solf and tends to break more easily than if you were young . but muscle do not have anything to do with enjoying life . it is also true that a you get older , your brain develops in different step and so you can think more deeply about thing that interest or bother you . but doe that affect whether you enjoy life more than others ? . well , in my opinion my answer would be no .
