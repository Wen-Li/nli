traveling another country always gave u enthusiastism . when i wa young , my mom and dad sometomes fought because of going trip with a group led by people or going by our self . whenever we have a plan to travel , although we have significant idea , we usally had the trouble . both of them give u convenience thing , however each of them give u good thing and bad thing . the way to travel with a group led by a tour guide sometimes provide convenience . the guide is guide u famous and popular place . also we do not have to make a plan for trip , and there is no percentage for losing road . however i belive that going travel without a group led by a tour guide is more effective . going travel without a group led by a tour guide offer a new and different kind of experience to traveler . we can try to find anywhere we want to visit . even if we lose our road or the way to go , a finding the right way , that is going to be unforgettable memory and experience . it is the travel for our enjoy and rest . however , if we go with a group , it could be very uncomfortable travel . we always need to think of them and watch out for them . there might be a scehdule that we do not want to . we can not do whatever we want to either can not go whatever we want to go . the last of all , we can save our money for traveling . there is some package for traveling in a kind of flight company . that is their job and they need money . it mean it 's cost is higher than traveling by ourselves . we can waste our money , even our time ! according to those reason , i prefer traveling without a group led by a tour guide . also i hope everytime i travel , i want to have much fun , at the same time i want to save my money .
