i do not agree with the statement because i think that , at least in the country i live in and for the experience i had , young people give aid to the community in field where the state ha not enough money to do everything it 's supposed to . i 'm not that old , so i can not tell exactly how it wa in the past , but today i can tell that also if society is getting every day more individualistic and selfish , people take care of the person in need and try to help them a much a they can . many volunteer organization have grown up in the city i live since i came here eight yers ago , and most of the volunteer are young : they mostly act in welfare , providing food to poor people and cover during the winter time . it 's true that it 's not the majority of the population , but i know a lot of people ( and i am one of these ) that spend part of the week trying to do something good for others in their own city . many people go far in the world , like in third world country , to help people there , but sometimes doe n't realize that just in the neighborhood next to their house there is somebody who need the same kind of help . but welfare is not the only field : volunteer organization have born also to help the state preserving the huge cultural heritage of italy , giving a fundamental help when an earthquake damaged the central part of the country , preventing the loss of incredible art treasure . i think that most of the thing i exposed are done by young people because most of them are still dreamer and feel better acting like this . they are usually more enthusiastic and to them it 's not enough to just give money for charity .
