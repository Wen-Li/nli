take the risk ! it is an one of the rule in guiding the way to success . it ha always been that successful people have been noted a risk-takers when they face a critical cross in the life . they try new thing instead of doing only thing that they already know . trying new thing will not always lead into loses or disappointment . on the contrary , it sometimes lead to new path , and great brand new result . it is in fact the way behind most of the discovery and invention of the human race . for example , christopher colombus wa so persistent in running after his dream of sailing into the east through the altantic ocean , and not through africa to the indian ocean . after he got his nessecary funding , he took the risk of shipping into the atlantic ocean , though many people thought that earth wa flat , and then eventually , he and his ship will fall down to to the bottom of hell . but , his out-of-the-box thought led him to discover the americas . in fact , he tried sailing to the east , and he reached a land that he thought wa india , but it wa not . his discovery ha changed the whole world and humanity . moreover , it proved that the earth is not flat , but rounded shape . in conclusion , we have seen that successful people did not do what they already know to do well , but they take risk that led them to the glory of success .
