i personally diagree with the statement that say that young people do not give enough time to their community . i disagree with it because it is a very general statment and it is a typical stereotype and categorizing of young people . in addition to that the statment is a non credible statement because it is abviouly based on personal opinion rather than on fact , since it is not supported by statistic or any menaingfull number . the statment carry alot of hidden meaning or even insult to young people because it picture them a selfish people who doe n't care about their community . not only that but it also indirectly indicates that young people are irresponsible people who do not positively contribut in their community , and are not active/usefull member of their own community . in addition to that , the statment that ha been made against young people is a very general statment , since not all young people do not give enough time to their community . there are some young people who are addicted to charity work , and who dedicates a lot of their time in helping improve their community and in helping others . thus we ca n't generalize . i also disagree with such a statement because i personally think that it is a weak statment becaue it is not supported by any kind of eveidence such a a survey , statistic , or any meaning full number . to me this statement is just like throwing accusasions on others . such statments are not acceptable to me not only because i disagree witth this particular statment but because if i accepted such stereotype it mean that i might a well accept other stereotype . and by doing that i 'll be encouraging stereotype that might be more serious or even dangerous and that might seriouly affcet our society , community , or even the way or even the quality of our living .
