this is an era of technology , of innovation , of invention and above all speed . twenty year from now there would be a drastic change in the technology scenario . as there ha been a tremendous increase in the use car during the past few decade there would be a change in future too . i agree to the point that there would be decrease in the number of car in the coming twenty year but not in the number of people driving car or the reduction in car manufacturing , there would be the decrease in the type of car driven today , more technology oriented car would be launched giving a marked competetion to the car of today . as in earlier time the fuel engine were replaced by better working diesel engine , in a similar way we have the broadest vision to produce more swift , reliable and the more faster model . with such a growth in the modern technology , we are sure to achieve our goal to lesser the car and increase the technology car of the future . with these car in the market we would be able to solve various problem faced now . though we have very good car today but we could build a stronger engine or the solar car or the car working on cell would be a greater idea in this field , letting the general public drive them at a lesser effective cost . this would also make our environment more cleaner to live and breathe in . this would too ehnance the country 's economy due to lesser consumption of the fuel automatically preserving our oil deposit and the fossil fuel . thus in the coming year we would have a world of fewer car of today but more better car of the future .
