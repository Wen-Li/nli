in the modern world we are able to sell good which are producted in europe all round the world . to let our potential customer know about our good or service we need to ad them . thanks to the modern mass medium : tv , internet and the press , we can ad our product everywhere . ads could be picture or tv clip or internet banner where we can explain which are the us of our product , what customer can do by it and how their life will be improved using that product . so we use the ad to pesuade people to buy our product for it characteristic or peculiarity . someone said that `` the advertisement is the soul of the commerce '' , no sentence ha been so true like that . often , for this reason , who make ad try to give to the product more than it ha really got . in this sense i agree with this statement because very often this people try to persuade u with false adjective , false implicit meaning trying to force u to buy that product . producers of ad often can persuade people to buy their product , but i think that , if the product is n't like the ad on tv , people will be very disappointed with it and they will talk to other people explaining what happened . in this situation the company which ad will lose his possibility to sell anymore his product . anyway i think that we need an international authority which check all the ad trying to delete lie and what can illegally persuade people to buy that product . we need a code of advertisement and who make ad must respect those law and he should be clear with the potential customer . i know is difficult to create an international authority , especially in those country where also the market is without specific law that can regulate it . but i think that if all the developed country join the effort , some improvement could be done .
