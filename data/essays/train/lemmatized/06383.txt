i do not agree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . it is getting more and more affordable , even for younger people who have just gotten their driver 's licence , to own a car . so there are much more , rather young people driving than in the past and i do not think that this will change . so this is a constant in my consideration . not only that more young people posse car , also people that are older will still be driving when they are at the age of 75 or 80 , because people become older but will stay mentally and psychologically fit even in higher age and will not give up on driving since it will - in twenty year like nowadays - be important for human to be flexible and be able to move wherever and whenever you want to . regardless of high car-densities that can already been found today , people will not give up on their car because they have gotten used to the convenience of driving . some sort of exploring-mentality will force human being to even drive further than today . with new car technology that will probably been found in twenty year that should not be a problem . another important fact in this consideration is the role of country like china and india . they are about to step up a progressive state in which industrialization take place . of course there will be high demand of car in the upcoming year . with it billion of people these two country will have a tremendous impact on the usage of car in the future . more and more people there will be able to finance a car and - with the course of industrialization - will buy one . under these circumstance it will be important to find new solution for avoiding high-traffic in urban area and pollution of the environment .
