its true that human is totally depending on the power of vehicle to move from one place to another . transportation ha made human day to day life more easy than before . in ancient day a people used to walk to cover distance from one part to another , now use of car and other transpotations made it much eaiser . motor car are usefull to take three to four or more people to one place to another . i disagree with the point that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . i feel that use of car wont be fewer in another twenty year . if we take an example technology ha improved so much that now most of the middle class family is affording to have a four wheelar with new model but same time those people who have old ambasedor or fiat car dont want to change their old model after so many year also . so their can be chance that after twenty year when technology will come up with new thing and modality for transpotation , there will be lot of people who will like only to use car . and also the poor people who are able to afford only motorbike can use car after twenty year . same time there also can be possibility that after twety year when science will come up with new invention and helicopter and plane can be available in cheeper rate a like today any of the four wheelar or if their fair will reduce to normal train or bus fair then sure there will be le use of car . in conclusion i want to state that my agreement or disagreement with this topic hardly matter . only the thing matter is how much technology ha improved and how it helping to normal or below middle class people for their transpotation .
