i disagree with the statement provided . because car are the efficient transport of a man.cars are the easiest mean of transport for the man today . if the man want to lead a luxurious life he must have a car . in the modern day car ha become the status symbol for a man . i dont have any sort that there will be fewer car in twenty year than today , a the population of the world is growing , we cant say that the use of car will be le a compared now . if the usage of car is le then what the people are going to use ? when compared to all the vehicle that are available now in the marked , the best transport that fit a family is car , which is affordable by a common man . if one ha to travel from one place to another , everytime he can not afford to go by aeroplane , train , when he is having the cheaper mean of transport . if a person ha a car of his own , he doe n't have to rely on the public transport such a bus , train , truck , aeroplane etc . though there are other mean of transport one should have a own vehicle such a car . if he ha a car it is useful to him at any part of the day . the need and desire of a man suggests to have a car . a man ha to face problem if he doesnot have a car . if he ha to travel urgently without wasting time he ha to prefer a car of a flight . the charge for the flight would be very expensive , so the man prefers to go by car . if he ha to go by mean of public transport , lot of time will be wasted for him a he ha to go to the nearby statin early to book a ticket and he ha to wait for the bus to go . so i dont agree with the above statement . hence car are not going to be fleeting and they are the only mean of transport which are going to be used by every person . hence there will be more car than today , twenty year from now .
