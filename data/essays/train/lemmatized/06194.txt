knowledge about different subject are important in this fast and devoloping world . one should have knowledge of many topic to survive . i agree with the fact that the broad knowledge of many different academic subject is better than in one subject . to begin with , i would like to draw attenton towards the fact that le knowledge le opportunity . a person with broad kwowledge of different subject can perform well in any field . many field are open for the person at the same time . but person who ha done specialization in any single subject will not be able do anything out of his field . . secondly , people with broad knoledgee lead to great achievement in life . for example if a person from engineering feild enters into management of any big company and manages it well . he will be promoted faster than a employee who is specialized only in engineering . another example if a student keep on reading course book and score well in each semester without good knowledge of computer . he will face big problem in performing any job a computer ha become a great need of the people nowadays . thirdly , if the person ha knowledge ogf many stream , he can change his main stream whenever he want . he might face difficulty in performing good in his stear and so ca n changer field whenever it is required . for example if person have taken both medical and non medical subject in junior college . he or she always ha chance to shift in the field in which he or she is performing well . in conclusion i would only say that knowledge about the different field is always a positive thing
