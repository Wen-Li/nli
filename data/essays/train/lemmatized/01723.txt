i agree with the fact that the young people have do not spend sufficient time to help their community . in an ultra modern world and a speedy world like this one need to do many thing for themselves . the main aim of an youngster is to get a well settled career . inorder to achieve a high career he need to do that extra bit in every mark of his acticity . secondly he doe n't find time to do all those community service . the thing is to find a career a interesing a he like he need to do many thing like going to the college , spending on the material he ha to collect for his college , preparing for the college . he doe that extra bit every where he participates . this make him completely enervated by the time he feel that he will help the community . the youngster think that it not the right time for them to serve the community . they may think that they may serve the community after they are well settled in their career coz that give them ample time . a well settled career can give the authority for them to help the community . majority of the youngster ha no interest to do all those community service . the fault lie with the family member . if an youngster is wasting time for the community service he may get a jerk from his parent what the hell are you doing . dont waste your time in serving those people . its time to change the attitude of parent rather than youngster . if an youngster is to lend their time for helping there is someone 's fault in the administration . its the administration 's work to see that everything is fine in the community . one ca n't blame the youngster for others responsibility .
