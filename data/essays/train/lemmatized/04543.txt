i agree this statement and we already see the example of this statement in world . let take the china a an example , a we know the population of china is to much and growing day by day for this reason people prefers riding bicycle instead of driwing car . if we think that every chinese people drive to work or home or another place then the traffic would be the biggest problem of the china that is why chinese people prefers the bicycle . in my opinion the population of other countiries in the world will become like china in next year and people would rather prefer alternative way of transportaion , and i think the best alternative would be the bicycle . let talk about the benefit of bicyles ; 1 ) it is healtier than driwing ; a we know in our century people dont have enough time for sport and exercise , because we need to work hard and if we use bicycle then we would catch the chance of exercising while going to work or home . 2 ) no traffic problem ; bicycle is easier to use and it is smaller than an average car so if we use bicycle instead of car than we wont have too much traffic and parkng problem . 3 ) no air pollution and energy saving ; a you know the exhousts of the car pollute the enviroment , and also in today economy the oil price are raising day by day , and i am sure that future 's biggest problem would be the the oil and pollution problem so people would like to use bicycle to save money and try to live healtier .
