cars have made such a difference in our life . they have made transportation easy and doing the rritual thing like visiting out parent or a family member easy , going to the doctor now is easier then it wa in the olden day . i dont belive that there will be le car in the next twenty year , if anything there will be a surplus of car maybe the tchnology will effect the car but there will be an increase in the usage of car . cars might be in a different structure to keep up with the technology and might have new gadget but the illimination of car it quit hard for the past century god bless henry ford heart we have depened on car and a long a i have been alive car wa the only mean of daily transpotration and to me the safest transportation . also another point i would like to make is that when a generation more like a century get used to using car it would be quite difficult in illiminating this source of pleasure and vital everydays use . a car is what brought me to this test center to give the tofel exam and without it i couldnt imagin any other sourse of transportation that i would be able to use on a daily basis . generally speaking transportation is extremlly vital and we can not live without it . car will be around for a long time until we invent a new way of trnasportaion and may i add safer way for example zooming u through laser or zapping u the to the exact position we would ti be found in . and i belive that it will be a while befor we rach such a stage in technology . cars are vital and will be around for a long time
