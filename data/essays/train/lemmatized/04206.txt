in my point of view , i can not agree with statement ; young people enjoy life more than older people do . because , i think , order people have experience , knwoledge and shape of life . young people almost think that they can any thing and they can break some situation with young power . but it is not ture , mey be . all need is , in my opinion , experience . when we solve some problem , we will call back own experience . and if we got a same stiation before , we could find solution form experience . older people have lot of experience , because they lived long time than young people . so older people could find solution soon . less problem make enjoy life . second , older people have many kind of knowledge . thus , older people can understand the almost thing . and they can share these knowledge with his sun or other people . he can teach someting . it is so exiciting and enjoynable thing . in the other hand , young people can not this sharing . because they are so young and they have not enogh knowledge to teach for another person . finally , older people have shape of life . it mean they can find a answer ; who am i and what is distnation of life . in yougtime , we alway search some ansewer ; who i am or what should do in my life . in that situation , we have no time for enjoy life . we always should keep thinking or searching . order pepole , however , will some answer about this question from enoght experience or knowledge . so they can not hurry in their life and they can enjoy his lest of life . all in all , seeminglly , youg peple have lot of time and they can enjoy their life more , but , in fact , older people can more enjoy than young people . because they have experience , knowledge and shape of life .
