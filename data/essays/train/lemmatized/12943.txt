the agree with the statement that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today because of the scarcity of fuel needed to run the car and the awareness created about the amount of pollution these vehicle cause . generally car consume lot of fuel and also give le mileage which mean that we need to fill fuel very reguarly . people use car for comfort especially when they need to travel longer distance , rather than sitting in a bus or train and stressing themselves and this implies that the amount of fuel consumed is high . fuel is getting depleted and thus the government are made to pay a lot to import fuel and thus leading to hike in fuel price and making the layman think about the utilization of car which are costing him a lot . thus in future this hike will be more and will make people think of whether to buy a car or not . the amount of toxic gas released by the combustion of these fuel is quite high and thus leading to trouble for human and other living being on earth . thus the government may think of other alternative of transportation and thus try to impart this to all the citizen and provide them with some common transportation like a train . it may make it mandatory also when the situation worsens . this could cut down the use of car and thus leading to fewer car after twenty year . another thing that need to be considered is the place it occupies . because of the huge size and the fact that these is le accomodation , it lead to traffic jam and congessions especially in big city . thus making people to think about it and find a solution for it by using common mean of transportation which could help them reach their destination on time . cars provide luxury and comfort but inspite of this , the fact is that there are more problem associated with it than comfort . thus in my opinion in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today .
