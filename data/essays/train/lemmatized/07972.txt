in my opinion , understanding idea and concept is more important than learning just the fact . this is because student may not understand the idea from the fact , but student may learn the fact from understanding the idea . for instance , imagin you are in the high level math class , and instructore give you an assignment paper . the instructor say just `` do it '' , to you . if you have a knowledge about that question on the assignment , you may do it . however , if you do not have knowledge , you never do it . therefore , you will ask instructor how to solve these question , and the instructor give you an answer-list paper . so you can write answer now . this is what i think about learning just the fact . in this situation , you never study math . on the other hand , if you are in the same math class , but instructor exchanged . the instructor give you the same assignment paper , and he say `` let 's start a lecture using that paper '' . next , the instructor bigins the lecture to tell you how to solve the question on the assignment paper , and he also recommends you and give a few time to consider the solving method or formula . after that time , instructor give you the answer or correct your idea about these question , and he also explains why this method is useful . at the end of the class , you have studied math , and if some question remain on the assignment papre , you can try to answer them from the knowledge of what you studied while hte class . finally , you can say that you study math .
