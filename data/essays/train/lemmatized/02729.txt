what is advantage of decreasing the number of car ? is it reducing the air pollution ? is it a sollution of the green house effect ? there are some people who agree with reducing the number of car and they believed that the time will really come sometime in twenty year . however , i do n't agree that the time when the number of car will be lower than now , and i think that it will be higher in the future . the car industry is too big to reduce the number of car in the corrent world . some contries rely on their domestic industry for their economy . there are many employee who work for the car industry . if an idea of reducing the number of car cames up , so many demo and strike would are held all over the world . human being is very selfish creature . how many people prefer to loose their convenience `` foot '' that take them wherever they want to go without getting tired . some people work hard for buying their own nice car , other have many car for changing a car for tpo like clothes . there are so many car mania and they would never allowed the movement of reducing the number of car . these day , tabacco company try not to show the advertisement too much because there are some movement to reduce the number of smoker . smoking is recongnized a bad for human health . however , if the movement of reducing the number of car came up sometime in the future , it would be difficult to succeed because the advantage seems like only for the environment of the earth , but not for individual . it will save the life of people at the end . however , i think that making the mind of people to move is really difficult unless the advantage directly look to associate with the benefit of people life .
