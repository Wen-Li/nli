in my opinion , it 's better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject because you reduce your choice of lifestyle and have to study for many more year on witch you could already afford a nice job if you had chosen to study many academic subject . by example , a person studying medecine academic subject will choose to specialize himself or herself to be a chirugian or a dentist , but once the choice is done , you have to study everything again to change your job . if someone wish to specialize in one specific subject he or she might get more into depth witch is a good caracteristic once you 're looking for a job , but you could also apply for a job that which is n't a good a you cool have refering to the study you ` ve accomplished . moreover , when you specialize yourself , you have to study longer to get your master degree and your doctora . on the other hand , if you study economics or marketing you have a much bigger choice and you can work in different departement . when you study economics , you can also specialize in one specific subject but most people end there study at the master degree which lead you to lot of differents job such a marketing , public relation , and many other . in conclusion , we could say that both thoeries lead you to a nice life and that the choice dependant of every student . however this choice can be made only once you get to this point of your study because you might descover a lot of new thing during your student periode . finally we could ask ourselves which of these two type of study lead you faster to the job you ever dreamed of a you 're a child .
