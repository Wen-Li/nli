i partially agree with the statement because i believe that it depends on the personal value and moral of the person in cause . this opinion not only deal with young people but also with older people . there are some young people who have a great intrest in the well being of tehir community and therefore do ther best to improve and make it advance to a better level . these young people have certain strong principle that they strongly believe in , taught at home from their parens or at school . while there are others that can see clearly how their community are degrading and do nothing at all about it . these people have different ideaologies than the people that do all that is in their hand to improve the community . how do we expect these young one to do anything for their communties if they blame them of their disgrace . violence , corruption , sexual abuse , racsim all these are factor that affect young people action and opinion on their community . if older people where to set themselves a example the young people that are being accused of doing nothing for their community would react , but no older people are more busy corrupting and degrading the community . the young people that try their best to improve these community are those that have strong faith and are very opptomistic . they have the will to undertake new project to improve the community situation , while others have simply given up on humanity a a whole and simply try to live with their community ; and their defect . overall it is a question of hope , principal , and faith in teh idea that thing can change to better if we try to change these thing .
