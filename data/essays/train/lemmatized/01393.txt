i agree that the successful people will try to do new thing rather than doing what they alredy know . if this not possible there may not any new invention for defence ourseleves in any case for eg ; medicine , computer , hydrogen bomb ets . , the successful people are well aware about their thing eg ; in case of a doctor particularly cardilogist , he may diagnose the problem of heart and treat it only the diagnosed disease but if he try to success in new thing like heart surgery that may increase the life of a man . another eg is invention of drug to treat the aids , it one of the major problem in our country . with invention of antiretroviral treatment the decrease in morbidity and mortality for example if a scientist is expert in television he may invent the differnt form of the television . if he started thinking better then telivison he can invent various technological tool like computer . tody we are using it a a important tool for not only commuinication but also for the discovery . to defence ourseleves with other one we should able to protect , this can be done by inventing lot of tool like hydrogen bomb , weapon , etc.historically the way of defence mechanism were improving by inventing new thing by the successful people . with inventing new way of tranportation like areoplanes . ship etc ; there is decrease the wastage of time in all aspect . eg ; to go to mumbai through bus it may take 20 hr from hyderabad but inventing the aeroplane it decrease the time such way that we can go with in 1hr . this show how much important in inventing the new thing by the successful person . finally , my conclusion is better to try new thing by the successful presons that may change not only the way of style of a person but the culture of the nation .
