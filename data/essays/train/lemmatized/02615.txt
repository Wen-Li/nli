i totally disagree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' its wa seen that in last twenty year their wa big change in the world of automobile and in the manufacturing industry of automobile . people are got edicted to the most sufficient and more easy way of transport to reach their respective destination . in today fast tracking ( moving ) life every one is used of his own way of transport . people want to reach their office , college etc in short period of time . now seeing this rapid growth of population and technology in every part of the world everyone is least concernd about money . in today life everyone is fond of the most convienient way of transport to go to their destination and in this competitive world every one is doing their best to get satisfied with what they do and what they get . seeing to all these option every one try to have a vehcile of their own and which can be comfortable for one family . since their is huge competition in this world of bussiness every company are giving their best in their source . everyone want to go out and have some fun with his family member , so to go out for a picnic with family the most easy way is to have a car of own so that one can enjoy his time with his family . in this generation and in this competition the price of the car ha come down and today an ordinary man can buy a car . by seeing the competition in the market each company is giving their best in the least price which they can and having much profit also . even some bank are providing 0 % interest on car loan . so by seeing this competition and rapid growth of technology car are becoming much affordable now . therefore i can say that in the coming twenty year there will be more number of car a they are in present but not fewer from today number of car because people choose the most easy and simple way of transport for their sake and the number of car will increse in coming future but will not come down .
