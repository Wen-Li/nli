the number of car in use rappresents a complex variable to study . actually we can describe this variable like a constant expansion a nowadays we can consider car a a status symbol . most of the people us car everyday and for any reason , such a going to work , to shop or to holyday . in my opinion now there is not a valide alternative to change this way of life . public transportation , like bus , metro is not efficient a people required : not all city block can be easily reached without waste too much time , and vehicle are le comfortable than own car . for these reason i think that number of car in use will continue to increase without a serious and global transportation politics . if i go arond i can see the highest percentage of car occupied from the driver only , familes that have more car than person in house , and on the other hand a bad plublic transportation .
