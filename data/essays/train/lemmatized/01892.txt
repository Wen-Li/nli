i agree with the statement that `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' because student can use their imagination to think out side of box which help them to think widely and nothing avoid them to think what they feel about it . first , for example of learning chemistry experiment , from what we call `` experiment '' , student have a right to find out by themselves . it is more interesting to know from their teacher giveing the anwer to them than have them explore it . second , for example of learning history around the world , because not always right thing to learn what happened , sometimes it is better to know what wa really behind the scene . it is good have a knowlege from what teacher from textbook but it is always need extra know ledge to understand what really history mean . third , for example of learning literature , like read excellent peices from excellent author which not always that these author have great life . they have good idea so write good story . most of all , it give intersting `` for student to undrstand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' they need to know how to flow thier idea by doing this .
