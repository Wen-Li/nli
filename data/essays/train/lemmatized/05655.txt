i disagree with the statement that successful people are the one who try new thing and take risk . if i ran a business , i would not take risk because i think it is not worth losing money . the possible loss would probably do bigger harm than a gain of money would do good . in these day it seems to be crucial to know which risk to take and which not . yet it is my belief that sticking with a good technique , maybe one inherited by a family member that hat run the company for a long time , can be more efficient than blindly putting everything at risk . always changing strategy to the newest model will not work a efficientlz a will a good plan that is realized over a long period of time without interruption . of course , this way of managing will not make a company rich quickly . but in my opinion , it is better to start slowly and work thoroughly , than risking not only money and time , but also job and finally the most important of all , the company itself . an other example is education . i could have gone to school le year , compared to the rest of the family . i would have tried something new . but with this new and very risky move i could neither count on the support of my peer , nor would i have an idea about what to do . i would be helpless . chances are , that probably other people could succeed in such a situation , but i am absolutely positive that for me , the `` safe way '' is the better opportunity . all together i find it more logical and mature to stick to known procedure that do work in everyday life . if somebody risk something , he or she can gain a lot on the one hand , but on the other hand , it is also possible to lose a lot . and losing a lot can not be called successful .
