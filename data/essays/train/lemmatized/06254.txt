life is like a virgin forest , with primitive mountain , river , grassland and flower in it . you can not pick a peak out of it without exploring or probing the true face of it . so doe age . different age-experiences enable u to interprete the code of life , the different prime in life , the dynamic enjoyment by walking through life . hence , i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i believe different age group can experience the identical happiness or joy by appreciating the different beauty inside of their life . first of all , it is believed that all age have it prime . 20 mean smartness and quickness , 30 encountering diligence and perseverence , while 60 sound sophistication and wisdom . they just focus on different strength . it doe not deny or differ their enjoyment in life . many nobel prize winner who achieved their biggest professional peak , enjoy the happiness of it when they are wellknown and prestigious in their later year . they had a particularly hard time in proving their hyposis or theory in their youth , like albert einstein , nikola tesla . secondly , happiness is a lifetime pursuit . people through all age bracket seek for the real joy of life . many saying tell u the happiness doe not discriminate age . a wise , intelligent novel or person can win high praise despite of the age of the author . furthermore , many people think the life is too short to waste . so , during their youth , most of their endeavor contribute their career , family and friendship . while , retired people can enjoy their interest , develop their skill since they got more free time . can we say that only young people enjoy a better life than older one . in conclusion , i support the idea that all age deserve the right to be happy a long a they explore the beautiful color of each age and pursue the real value of each age bracket . that is the color of life .
