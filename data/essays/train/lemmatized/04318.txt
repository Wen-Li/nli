recently , a hot issue about whether it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject is wildly discussed among the student and professor . somepeople hold that one can learn more about the world by having broad knowledge . and other 's agrue that having a expertise in a specific subject can led a bright way for people in their career life . as to me , i prefer to the former one that to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . since we live in a complex and extensive world , having broad knowledge contributes to helping u to know more about the world we live in . with the knowledge of many academic subjecs , one can easily explain some case that happens everyday around u . for example , one of my friend always lead the origniation by observing the poision of star when we hike outside . besides , have broad knowledge of many academic subject can also help u to better understand the knowledge in a single subject . becaues the knowledge is interweaved to some extent , the knowledge gained in one lessen can be applied to solve a difficult problem in an other field . for instance , i offen find that princples teached in management class can be a good guide when i plan to set a project that required by marketing lesson . at last , i think the student should not only to have broad knowledge but also to specialize in one specific subject a well in order to meet the demand of society /
