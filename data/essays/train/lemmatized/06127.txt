cars are a way of life today . they spell convenience because they get a person 's chore done much faster . it is possible to reach any part of the country with the help of a car and the inaccessible area have greatly reduced but personally i agree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use that there are today '' . today car are a very helpful mean of getting anywhere and they are incredible convenient . a person ha the flexibility of time while leaving and doe not have to adhere to some time like would have been the case while travelling by a public mode of transport . they definitely help you get to many place and is probabaly the easiest option when you have to make a last minute trip . but their convenience is out weighed by the crisis car will face in the future . firstly there is the oil crisis . with the ever rising price of gas , car will become a le economically viable option to ton of people . this along with the ever increasing shortage of gas . i believe that people will prefer to travel by public mode of transport because they will be more economically feasible and it will serve the purpose of helping them commute . shelling out ton of money every month just for gas may not be affordable to alot of people . with the price of gas now threatening to cross $ 100 a barrel i fear to think what the situation will be twenty year hence . also with the increasing amount of car and not enough room to drive , people will not want to drive to work or their education place because navigating all the traffic can be pretty tiresome . also the place available for driving freely and not through congestion i believe will be limited . while i wa an exchange student my friend from taiwan told me that because all the road are always choked with traffic not many people owned car in taipei . they preferred taking the metro or just walking . i believe with the increasing infrastructural development and increasing population the street are just going to become more congested . hence though the price of car might not increase that drastically because they probabaly will increase in proportion with the salary of people , the maintenance cost of car will definitely go up . by maintenance i mean the cost of fuel . if the cost of fuel rise by a very large extent , which i believe it will because the oil resource are depleting rapidly , car will not be used often by people . people will probably opt for commuting to work by public mean of transport while using the car only in certain circumstance . so i think instead of owning car people will prefer commuting by bus , train or even cab ( taxi ) but not many people will want to own car beacuse their high maintenance cost along with their depreciation cost would make car to not be a very wise investment . they could probably use that money somwehere else where it would reap more benefit . so in twenty year there will defenitely be fewer car in use than there are today . unless they make more and more car battery operated and somehow manage to miraculously bring down the amount of congestion on road to which even today most of the cosmopolitan city are victim be it london , new york , taipei , beijing or mumbai .
