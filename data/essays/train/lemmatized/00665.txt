i agree that people who take more risk in life and try out new thing are more successful than others . a good example for such a person is bill gates . he wa one of the first people in the world to do research on computer and who developed the internet . introducing a new technology to the market is risky because of all the work , time , money and effort he put into it . nowadays every country in the world us the internet to communicate . this show that gates ha had alot of success and that he is now the richest man on earth . therefore the risk at the beginning of his career have paid out very well . of course there are several people in the business world with a comparable history . another example of people taking risk are those who invest their money into stock . the stock market ist proposedly the most risky way of investing your money . on the other hand , poeple who are successful at the stock market are at least ten time a succsessful a people that only do what they know best . with good stock , you can make over 1000 percent the money you have invested in one day or even hour , while other people only get the same salary month after month . even people who already own a big amount of money do not simply let it be . especially these people let their money work for them in order to gain more and more . they also invest their money in maybe big , new , expansive and riskful business . but exactly through these investment they become even more successful . taking risk of course doe not always lead to success , but the one who try over and over again will in the end be the more successful . without trying , you will never know if the risk you want to take may lead to more success in life . therefore , the risk is definitely worth taking !
