in my opinion , i think that it is better for undergraduate student to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . what is more , it is better for graduate student to specialize in one specific subjuect . my reason are lised a follows . in the first place , the majoritey of undergraduate student face the problom of finding job when they graduate from the university or college , except the student who plan to pursue the higher degree . if they have broad knowledge of many academic , it mean that they have more oppotunitise to recieve a good job . on the other hand , it is obvious that undergraduate student just recieve a fundational education in the university . with the broad knowledge background , the undergraduate student will become move competitive in the job market . as far a the graduate student , since their task is be outstanding in one special field , and they have not enough energy to study deeply in various field . therefore , it is suitable for a graduate student to specialize in one specific subject . as far a i am concerned , i always believe that a graduate student is a person who is so intellegent that can contribute to the field of science which he or she is studing . ademittedly , having broad knowledge of various academic subject is definitely benefacial for graduate student to achieve success in his special field . as a result , it is greatly useful for everyone to devote himself of herself to enlarge the sphere of knowledge . taking into account of what have been discussed above , we may reach the conclusion that the undergraduate student should have broad knowledge of many academic , and the graduate student are more suitable to study in one specific subject .
