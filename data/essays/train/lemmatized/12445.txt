there is a lot of way to travel in the present day . when you are plannig a holiday it is neccesery to consider which one it is the best way according to the need for the trip you want . plus , a way to travel can be associated with the personality you have , because if you are a person who like the adventure you might want to travel alone , without any plann at all , so in this way you just need to pack a small bag and have enough money to eat . but if you are an organized person and you like everything right , maybe the best way to travel for you is with a pevious plann traced . in this way you will know what and when you will visit the stuff you already know you are going to see , and therefore it wo n't be any that change your ideal for the trip . you also must consider if you want to travel by yourself or just your family , or if you want to do it with a group of person who are interested in the same place that you wish to know and there are led by a tour guide . in one hand , f you go by your self , you can arrange your time whatever you want , so you will be free to choose when you want to do one thing or another ; in the other hand , if you choose to go with an already confomed tourist group you can also enjoy to be with another people and have the chance to meet different person and maybe different culture than yours . besides , if you are traveling wth a guide , he or she can show you the best place in the city . in my case , i rather travel in a group led by a tour guide because if i do not know the place , i am sure i can have a better experince with someone who already know the city o town we are going to . in this manner , it is easily for me to travel in this way because i also like to meet a lot of different people . since i wa a kid , i have travel a lot and anywhere i go i make new friend and this give me the opportunity to get more knowlege from other culture
