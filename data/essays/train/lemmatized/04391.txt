in twenty year car will be fewer than today . i strongly to say agree . fisrt , now a day gasolins fee inclusing day by day . for example , last month gasolin cost wa 128yen / little but , after 1month later cost is 134yen / litter this is what happening in japan . so nobody want to drive a car . drive a car , it is only waste money . not only reason for a cost , between the people now trending not need a car life wich mean some helthy people do not need a car , they are taking walk , ride a bycicle or tak a subway not using taxi . people always care about money and helth . third reason we afraid of oil peak . according to the news that in 5years all of oil will be gone and nothing to grow up any other oil line . oil is nessary for our life eventhough people waste oil such a drive a car . this statement say in twenty year car will be fewer than today but i think its happen in 5yeasr . we are keeping waste oil now , how could be take twenty year . it not such a long term it will be soon . so i strongly to say agree car will be fewer than today .
