nowadays , people make their advertisement so good so people will purchase , try , or use their product . however , are they really a good a they seem to be ? i strongly agree with the statement most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . in today 's world , most of the people will do anything for money , even when it come to the place where they will have to cheat on those who are innocent . most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are for the same reason a well -- they want people to buy their product . we can see it everyday when we turn on the tv , commercial from fastfood restaurant , toy company , and even computer company . one of the most representative advertisement is the one from mcdonald . i still remember the first time i saw the commercial of mcdonald , they made their hamburger in the advertisement so big and juicy that it seemed to be the best hamburger in the whole wide world . and after seeing the commercial , the first thing i thought wa to go to mcdonald and eat their juicy hamburger . however , after i had arrived at the mcdonald and ordered some of their best hamburger , i realized that i had been cheated on . the hamburger i had in my hand wa not an enormus , tasty hamburger . oppositely , it wa a tiny , dry burger with only a few pickle in it . from the time on , i barely trusted any advertisement no matter how good they look . the second and the last time i wa cheated on wa when the famous computer purchasing channel had this seller who completely fooled me by saying and showing simultaneously that how strong the computer he wa selling is . i wa in the desire of needing a new computer , a a result , i called them without questioning and ordered the computer . soon , i regreted what i had done . the computer i recieved did not work at all , i could n't even turn it on . at first , i thought it wa my problem , and thus , i called up my friend . what shocked me wa that my friend told me that the computer did n't even have a graphic card . for the true story above , i never trust any advertisement since then , i only believe in what i see , not what people say . to conclude , i absolutely , positively agree with the statement most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are .
