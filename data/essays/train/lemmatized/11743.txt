i disagree with the statement , because for me is ever necessary to take some risk and try new thing to have succes and not only when you know how to do well . in fact for me , if you dont't try one thing , you do n't try another thing because you do n't have the experience that the precedent thing can give to you . for example , if you do n't try to use a bycicle , you do n't learn to go whit it , and after you do n't learn to use a scooter , becaus is more difficult than use a bycicle . but if you learn to go whit a bycicle , after you can use also the scooter ; so you can use both of them . the experiences that you try to do , help you for enthire your life . this is the main reason because i say that is important to take risk and try new thing and new adventure . and for me also the worst experience are important because also this experience help you not to commit the same error another time . in fact , for example , if you drik mich alchool befor drive , and after you make ani incident , you learn that you do n't drink any alchool befor you drive for the next time . so , in the end , to take succes , for me is important find to try the higest number of thing you can do
