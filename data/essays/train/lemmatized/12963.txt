i am agree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they are . i think that it is normal because the attendence of the people are always big . a good advertisement must make a product seem much better than it is for a commercial law . in fact in the commercial law the product must be presented like a better . if the advertisement give some positive sensation to the people , it is just a little step for make a good product . it is not important if in the advertisement there is a good or bad product . but it is important like the product is seemed . for example i want to buy a new car . i see an advertisement that make a car like a good product and i want to buy that car because i believe that it is a godd car . this is a little example but for everything we can make an advertisement make a product much better than it really is . the consumist world in that we live impose u this new way of thinking . the people are joked to the adverstisement and then they are unbeliveable if the product is not like they think . when i wa a child i wanted a little toy because in the advertisement wa a new fantastic robot and all the child wanted it . but only with the passage of the age i learnt that not all advertisement tell a trouth .
