i think that is better to specialize in one specific subject , becouse today a lot of work are done by team of people , and any person ha a specific function . this is valid for team of doctor , for team of arquitects , for team of engineer : to realize a big project is not useful to have ten people who are quite good in doing the same kind of work , but it 'd be really useful that each of these ten people would be specialized in a specific part of the work needed . in this way it 'd be faster to realize anything without the interference of differents people on the same problem , and the quality of the intervents can grow . to improve our business , technology , medicine and all the others field of the society , we need specialized people , to be able in solving any kind of problem by asking to the ` right man` ! i think that to have a broad knowledge could be a good thing , also on academic subject , but at the end you need to specialize . it 's fair to know , for example projecting a new hostipal , what kind of thing need to be done before and which after , and how they have to be done , but just for general knowledge , a global cultural luggage that every people can build by his own . to specialize our knowledge in a specific academic subject , will be good to find a job that we like . however , with a more general preparation you can succed in finding a job , it could be a boring job , linked with a part of your study that you did n't enjoy so much , and you will be unhappy for the rest of your life , becouse all the company seek specialized people , and you have just a general knowledge of some subject . your job can be more flexible , but you will repalce other people for the rest of your life , without the possibility to succed in a specific field . is for these reason that i prefer to specialize .
