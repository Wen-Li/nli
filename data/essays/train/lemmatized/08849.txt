i think that being succesful in life depends on your personal perseption of goal , determination and commintment to your plan . being succesful also relies on your habilities and capabilies and in the type of choice that you have to make in time . i do agree thought , that taking risk o making risky desicions can make succesful a life plan , because in order to achieve goal sometimes the thing we can do well will not help u at all and therefore risk factor becames part of the ecuation . for example if we love our job but it asked to do something that we are not used to or we do not know well how to do we have two option . 1. taking the risk of doing it , taking into account all the extra work that the task represents by itself , or 2 . we let other person do the work and fail . if we decide to take the risk , we have to be aware that it is going to be difficult and sometimes an extra effort ha to be done in order to finish the assigned duty . the final outcome of the desicion whether it good or bad it depends on the performance of the person , but the standup point it that no matter the outcome , we have to always learn from every situation , making the good or the bad experience successful in term of personal growth . finally i think that no matter the situation we should be always looking forward to challege our knowledge and take some risk , thinking that we have to learn from our daily experience so in the future , all desicions made are going to be taken based on uppon them .
