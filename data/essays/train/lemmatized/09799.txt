community is the very basic entity along which many human civilization have thrived . it is the this feature that enabled man to evolve and be distinct from his fellow being on the eath . community is not just living together , a group can be called a community only when they interact and help each other in all aspect . considering this a definition of community i disagree with the statement that young people do not give enough time to helping their community . firstly what do we consider a a community with respect to young people . is it the family , neighbour alone . this would not be the example of community . a community would refer to every one a person is direcly or indireclty related to . in the case of a youngster the community is vast and more diverse . hence it would be obvious that one set of people like family for example might see a lack of participation in it activity from the youngster . this is not actually lack of interest rather it is the fact that considering the vast communits with which the youngster are in contact the amount of time they spend for one particular goup might be le . consider any calamaty or emergency , one will never survive such situation without the support from the entire community . in fact in this case it is the young generation which take the lead and help people recover . their active participation and zeal to help others is always evident in such case . finally the ` enough time ' which the statement emphasis is not relevant . it is the need of the hour that is to be fulfilled . the time taken for that can never be measured . helping the need in the way required and a doing it a quickly a possible is the best help and this is what the young people follow .
