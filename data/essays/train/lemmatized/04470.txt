i think helping student to understand idea and concept is important . that is not the only way about how to teach student . the other idea is teaching them to learn fact . students may get many different way of education when they start to learn . no matter the educator are the parent or the school teacher , the different way will influence student so much . lead student to understand idea and concept is a very important way . this way will help student to learn how to think . if teacher teach student to understand the idea and concept of one topic and teach them to think those concept more detail . students may use various kind of way to realize that topic , like finding information from the book or discussing with other student . students will develope the real thinking in this process . this way even can help student to develope their creation and also learn how to use the good interaction with other people . the other idea is teaching student to learn fact . most of parent or teacher usually use this way . they will tell student which is right and which is wrong directly . students know the fact of everything they have learned . they always accept what they learn . students do n't need to think too much . that will cause student ca n't differ what is the truth if no one tell them the fact or when they face what they have n't learned before . that will be a very dangerous way to educate student . i think the good way of education is teaching them to understand idea and concept . students may really know how to learn more and can think everything independently .
