nowadays people have to struggle to become someone , there is competition since the first year of school . if you want to become an important person you have always to take risk : if you have a good idea , that you think will be a succesful one , you have to develop it and to accept the probability to loose everithing . the greatest sportsman ca n't do only what they already know but have to constantly improve their skill : for example a motogp rider during the weekend before the grand prix try to develop his bike testing different solution but he hasto choose only one . this is a risk : if he ha taken the best decision he could win , othrwise he will loose . also at school if you have no time to study everithing for an exam you have to risk choosing the principal information that will be problably asked . everithing depends on the question : the exam will be a success or a failure , but it 's far better try the exam .
