an argument can be made for both of the opinion , to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject a well a to be specialized on one single subject . having a broad knowledge offer you the possibility to talk and debate with a lot of different person about several topic . this is a nice way to communicate with people and , doing it , even to gain additional knowledge . furthermore this show that you have a good general knowledge , which is valued highly in our well-informed society . finally , if you have an overview and the knowledge about several academic topic , it is easier for you to decide what interest you the most and , consequently , choose this subject a your specific subject . however , a case may be made for the opposing view , because if you were perfect informed about a single subject , you are able to concentrate on it and gain more knowledge in this main subject . as a result you will have the possibility to become a master in this specific subject . additionally it would be much easier for you to learn the subject you specifiy in , because choosing it a your main subject you have to have a special interest in it and if a person is intersted in something it is much easier to gain new information on the topic . another advantage is that you might have better opportunity to find the right job for you . since it is easier to look for a job in the newspaper , which suit your specific ability , you might have a better opportunity to find the perfect job for you and to impress your later supervisor by presenting the exact capability he wa searching for . you simply know on which strength you can relie . in conclusion , i believe that both is very important . in my view , you should have a broad knowledge of a lot of academic subject but in the end and referring to job opportunity it depends on what you are able to do very good in a specific direction .
