personnaly i do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people . indeed , of course these two different kind of people express theire life enjoying differently . i think young people , are more able to do physicals thing , like going to party , going to pub or playing . things which are interpreted by any body a life enjoying sign . but i also think that older people have more responsabilities , le time and theire conception of enjoying is different , they try to make everything pleasant and not only some piece of time from theire life like youngers . i mean , older people try more to decrease the number of bad thing in theire life while youngers , on an opposite way , try to increase the number of fun thing but these two technics have the same aim . the question is indeed a question of point of view . indeed , i think young people enjoy the present time , what they are doing now while older people enjoy the result of what they accomplished . i think that young look like more life enjoying but just because they show it easier to the others .
