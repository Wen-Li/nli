helping the community is a current problem . there are more and more people need help in our community . but we are living in an age with le attention and concern for the community versus an increased for one 's owns need and pleasure . in fact , there are more old people . the human body seems to be more resistant than before . medicine are more elaborate . some of them live alone far away or near their family . some of them can not be award over the new technologic . so they need help , sometimes only for speaking and walking . besides there exist unalfabetic people yet . i have heard that one by ten people in belgium is unalfabetic , it 's enormous . these people need help too . there exist association . finally , something is very important for me and community is the respect . if everybody respect each other a lot of problem in our community will disappear . respect between student and teacher , police and citzens , with authority , ... with doing i think that it 's a big step for community . it 's not difficult and i would add that 's a basic thing . here you are a lot of thing that you can do to helping your community . you can notice that i said ` you can do ' without specified who 's you . in fact , i agree with this statement . but i would clarify that it 's a problem for anybody who live in a community , not only for young people but also for adult .
