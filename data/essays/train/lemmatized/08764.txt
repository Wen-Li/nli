advertising is one of the key factor in the success of a product in market . some people feel that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i do not agree with this and will explain my point of view in the following paragraph . in today 's world , there is a lot of awareness among consumer and the product manufacturer know that they can not fool them by giving false impression about their product . they know that if they give a false picture of their product in an advertisement , they might fool customer for a short term but in the long run customer will know the real picture . therefore , intelligent and successful businessmen refrain from wrongly advertising their product . thus , we generally do not see an add of a product that project it falsely . in today 's world , only the best product are able to sustain themselves in the market . it is generally these successful company who can afford to invest and do invest lot of money in advertising . as the market is very competitive , there is little or no difference in the quality of product from two company . the motive of advertising of such company is to catch consumer ' imagination , to influence them emotionally so that they buy their product instead of their competitor 's product . therefore , i do not think that company that manufacture product that do not meet the market standard ever advertise their product . neither do they have the money nor is it worth spending money because there are better product available in market and consumer already know that . if we observe the advertisement nowadays , we find that they are very creative . companies sometimes do blow up their product in their advertisement but that is just to make their add more interesting and appealing than that of their competitor . they do not project wrong information about their product . therefore , i feel that advertisement project the product that they advertise correcty and that in today 's world , they can not survive in the market if they advertise a product falsely .
