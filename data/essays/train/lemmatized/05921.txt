nobody know how young people play more than older people ? even though young people can enjoy like an adult . but , they ca n't completely like a old people . they want to go to another place and they want to eat delicious food . and they want to be an aduly . but we ca n't help them . because , this world have rule . also we have to keep those rule . but young people who is under 21 their law is smaller than adult 's low . therefore , they are freedom . if young people have to strong of law , they can not enjoy ther life . also i would like to come back childhood . just imagine ! if one family go to picnic or vacation , their child what are they doing ? may be , they will play . but their parent will work like a make a food or convey their carry . also , their parent have to spend a money . their parent need a money for a vacation . that 's too bad . anyway , they have to make a money . their child use thier parent money . therefore , they enjoy their life more than older people do . that wa what i am thinking .
