in general i would not agree on the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . obviously , it is necessary to learn some fact at the beginning of your carreer . you can not understand idea concerning math when you do not know that 1 plus 1 result in 2 . but i think it should not be the primary aim of our education to learn fact because the world ha to be developped by u in the future , too . this is not possible when someone for example just learns the theory of albert einstein by heart , shuts down his book and begin with something new . he ha to learn it and then he can start to think about it . posing some question concerning the theory - talking to other student to get to know their opinion about it and afterwards creating his or her own idea which are based on his knowledge . perhaps this process could end up in a new product combining the learned fact and the own new idea . as a conclusion it is in my point of view a important for student to understand idea and concept a to learn the basic fact . this statement can also be connected to other topic of our society than math of physiks . we all know , that the most important fact is to realize an idea if it is done . this is definitely impossible when you are not able to speak the others language . you need to learn fact ( the foreign language ) and afterwards you can share your own idea with everyone . by this way it can surely be realised . so you can say , that there are two basic existing - the learning process and the creating process and for the biggest success both have to be combined in the most efficient way . every student should have basic knowledge in several topic and the more knowledge you have , the better you can understand existing idea and create your own one .
