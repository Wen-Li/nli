broad knowledge is better or specific one ? knowledge ha always been a question for all . how much of it is enough ? who is the most knowledgable ? what ever the qusetion , it is very vital in human life to have knowledge of many in a lifetime . however , knowledge of general and knowledge of acedemic is absolutely different . of course , everybody would love to broad their knowledge on many subject . in daily life , we all want to be aware of everything around u . that 's why , we all keep up with news and tv etc just to improve our vision of life . but , when it come to term of acedemic knowledge , this is another case and a lot more complex . because , acedemic career need a lot of hard work . to specialized on a specific subject doe not happen in one year or within an assesment . acedemic work is a part of developing and also creating on a subject one is specialized . in order to write new thesis or experiment or invent in a field , one should need very detailed and intensive knowledge of the field . this is why , specializing in one subject will be more productive . the more we learn we feel le knowledgable . because , every new knowlege will prove how much more we do not know about . also trying to have deep knowlege of many acedemic subject should be a very hard mission . this may end up with only gathering the information and not being able to develope it at all . this is the reason , i do not agree having broad knowledge of many acedemic subject is better . specializing in one subject will help the person to become an authority in the subject . while consuming new idea and article about the subject , the person can combine the knowledge and also can have the opportunity even to develope or create in the subject .
