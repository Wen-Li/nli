nowadays nearly all of today 's car depend on petrol , either in form of gasoline or diesel , in order to run . because worldwide petrol ressources are limited , one could easily assume that in the long run , for example in twenty year , gas will be so expensive that many people can not afford it anymore , thus there will be fewer car in use in total . but on the other hand gas price , especially in europe , nearly doubled within the last five year and nothing happened . customers are getting angry at polititians and the petrol industry , but commute to work by car nevertheless . also the industrial demand in transport is steadily increasing due to globalisation . packages and good get delivered all over the world and one of the cheapest way to do that still is by truck on the road . furthermore huge new market for automobile , like china or india are still on the rise . concerning the petrol problem there is also hope in technical development such a electric drive for car and truck or solar technique . even though there are still a couple of problem to solve these new technique may one day , lead to much more economic car or maybe even total independence of the world 's petrol ressources . that could weaken one of the most powerful argument not to drive car with combustion engine : the limited petrol ressources . personally , i believe that in twenty year there will be even more car worldwide . i 'm sure that the technical evolution will provide a good environmental friendly alternative to today 's gasoline driven car . last but not least , people simply love the convenience of their very own personal vehicle .
