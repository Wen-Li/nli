i do agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i think that young people today are le involved in community activity and spend le time there because the society in common became more individualistic . for instance , a lot of young people today perform individial sport or they perform sport only occassionally . it is no longer common that such people are organised in sport club and take responsibily a team coach or in training kid and younger club member from their community . it seems also that organisation like the boy scout or church have a problem to attract young people . and i think that young people were more politically engaged in previous time . there are only few young people nowadays joining political party or labour organisation such a union . in particular , most young people are reluctant to take political position on a communal level because they can no see any sense in it . one reason seems to be that the economic situation ha changed much over the last year . the pressure to be successfull in the job is much higher than ever before , and the high unemployment rate threatens a lot of people because of their proffesional future . hence , young people are urged to finish their school time time and study a fast a possible which leaf only very little time for community activity . in addition , it seems to be more common today to teach competition instead of collaboration , leading to a more egoistic society . a lot of young people start to learn this early in their career , leaving the impression to them that is not benefitial to take responsibilites in their community because of the time it cost . finally , the society became more mobile over the last year , which mean that in particular young people often change their job and living place . hence , these young people can not really get rooted in a community . but this seems to be a major prerequesite for any community engagement .
