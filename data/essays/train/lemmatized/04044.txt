in now a day sociaty , academic is more and more important , everywhere is looking for a high level academic school or college , but if we enter a better academic institude , are we going to be genios or having more ability for sure ? the main function of school and college is to prepared men , but they ca n't make one 's decision , for example , a man is going to studied in a high academic college but he doe n't like to study , all he want is to meet people and have a good time . these '' decision '' is from his only purpose and not by the college . deciding which academic subject to pick is depending on every single person . having a broad knowledge of many academic subject is reasonably , how could a man known everything little by little but when he is in front of a very specific problem , what is he going to do ? for example , an high school teacher is in her house , what is she going to do if suddenly her computer doe n't work and she need to work on her job ? maybe she know how to fix it , but if not ? she is just only a high school student . in the other hand , if specialize in one specific subject , there are were some unespecific thing that one man doe n't know it like he ca n't resolve a simply problem . every subject ha they own advetage or disadvatage one subject is depended on another , so i will agree with borad knowledge
