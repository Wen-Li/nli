the question that `` youg people enjoy life more than oder people do ? '' isn t right at all . i mean some old people enjoy their life also . on the one hand young people are younger their body do everytihng what tehy want to do . but on the other hand young people don t do the right thing that help their to live longer . for example they smoke more than older people , because it seems cool . and usually they take drukes and often they drink more . these are all thing which show that young people enjoy their life . but it isn t so , i mean when young people do that they want to go more to the death and they aren t enjoy their life they make it smaller . in opposite of the younger people older people enjoy their live , too . but not like the younger it do . they can not do much more thing , because they have family and a job . they want to live for their family . they must work to get money to buy food and some other need . they must show their child that they are good parent that do everything for their family . but i mean , no i think , that oder people do the same thing like the younger people in their past . we can that both are , i mean older people and the younger people , enjoying their life . the older people do it in the past and the younger people do it now . for me is enjoying the live very important , because when someone enjoy his life , he can say in future that he miss his past . he can ask his child the past of his live and he can say his child what to do in some situation . it s like the history , but of the personility of one human . i think that i enjoy my life but not more than my father it did , because we live in modern time , nothing happens at ti time . but at the time wher my father wa younger there happens so many thing . the world have change at that time , for example computer were made and other thing . i hope that i enjoy my life in the future .
