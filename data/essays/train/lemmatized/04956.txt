this is generally accepted that young people enjoy more life than olders , but is it really right ? when you are young , you are usually not conscious of all the danger of the life : for example a lot of young people go out , smoke and drink a lot because even if they know it is bad for them , they can not really realise it . this is in opposition with what do the older people think because they are more aware of the illness like cancer and they do not want to be ill because they have to work in order to bring money for their child 's education for example . the second point is that adult can not oftenly go out because of their child : they have to take care of them while young people can go out every night to the theatre or the restaurant or disco etc . on the other hand , the fact that adult earn more money than young people is a big point : the more you have money to spend , the more you can buy everything you need to enjoy . the entertaining industry is quite expensive , specially when you enjoy doing thing out of the common place . because people are leaving longer and longer and in better shape than fifty year ago , retired people enjoy travelling overseas in order to discover the more , and to make the most of the short time left to live . this last part of my text show what i think : it is easier to enjoy your life if you have enough money in order to buy you all the thing you will enjoy and also because when you are older , you have built the life you wanted , while when you are young you do not always have the choice of everything and you need to obey to your parent .
