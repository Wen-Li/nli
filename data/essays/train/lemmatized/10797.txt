i do n't think that successful people try new thing and take new risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . of course we all no famous example of people beeing successful in making a new invention , trying new way of buisiness or starting new direction in art , music and literature . but i think this is not the majority of the successful people . i rather think that the personality of them is usually another one , which is my first point against the statement . it is always easier to do what people accept somebody to do and to use old method to become a successful person . it might be sad , but it is rather likely to become successfull by using old `` trick '' , your family background or connection . so i think the personality of most of successful people is rather one , which us the old way , than one , that try new way . we only sometimes think that the opposite is true , because people , which were successful in making a new invention for example are more important for other poeple and for u . so we know them better . and when a successful buisinessman try for example a new trading practice , he ha a better chance to make good money , because he ha already a helfull background . and once more we will hear about him more likely , althow most of successful buisinessmen would not do this . my second important point is , that a person , which is working and living successfully ha no reason for trying new method or changing his live . why should such a person take a risk ? the history show for example , that most of the people coming to america were poor people , which had nothing to lose . the richer one usually stayed in there country , where they had a safe live .
