i agree with the author 's statement . since ` knowledge is power ' say a proverb . so , in today 's competitive world it is better to have broader knowledge of all academic subject . if we have broad idea of lot of subject , then the chance of oppurtunites increase . if aperson is attended for an interview for a post who is having good subject in various field will be obviosly selected rather than a person who is specialized in only one field , more over the person with diverse skill will face the interview with confidence . the person with broad knowledge will not essential requires any type of training . but the person know only one specific subject most probably he must be trained and guided under other matured people in that area . if the person with broader view of subject can easily follow the new trend in the market rather than a person with a little knowledge . although , a person with specialized knowledge in one area can perform very well in his field but he always abondon from task which consists other than his subject knowledge . a person know only a specific subjet fails to perform well if the boom for that field decrease drastically or it is in slum . but there is no such type of problens arises for the person who is good at myriad field . hence i conclude that a person with broad subject knowledge will always flourish in his field .
