i disagree with this statement . i would like talk about my opinion with 3 reason . the first , it is problem about feeling of u , human . we already know the eirth ha a lot of enviromental problem . i think co2 is a most famous reason of distroyeding the earth , so using a car is a big reason , too . however we already know how a using car is so convinience . if the famouse people or gorvanment said `` stop using a car !! '' , we ca n't do it . the second , it is problem in the developed county . i said about the car which made co2 , but now they are reaserching some ecology car in some company , forexsample hybrit-car . those are already famous , and sometime we can see this car in my city , but it is expensive than normal car . in the other hand , there are some problem in the buttery , too . some of people worry how we charge any enelgies . if resarchers make more serveys or think more useful idea , those will are used more people . then , how about the developping country . the last reason is problem of the developping country . some of the place in the developping county , there are no an airport or a train . the people who live in like this erea use only a track or a car . if they can not use those , they ca n't transport some food or thing . i think some ereas must develop to inprove own country 's economy of situation , so transportation are most important to develop . and this problem is not only this . the developed country send a lot of used car which is ofcorsed making co2 for the developping country too cheep . those will be more inreasing . this his problem is not only the developping country bout also the developped country . therefore i dissagree .
