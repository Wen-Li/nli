i disagree that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . of course , i know the effect of advertisement . for example , when we look for the production which we need , we always use advertisement with the beautiful picture and handsome model . according to these effect , those production look like better , and we are moved on our lust . but personaly , i think that these situation are changed nowadays , because we can check the information of product from the various news source . i would like to explain by two example . firstly , there are lot of advertisement in the world . also , these are not just by paper or pamphlet . by using internet , we can search those product easily and find lie or difference which the publisher of advertisement declare . secondly , at present , we can compare with other product , because we can take a lot of information from many advertisement . so , we do not buy the matter easily . for example , yesterday , i needed the desk lamp to study my major hard , and at first , i read the information about the lamp which i can buy from internet , and at next i looked in the phamphlet to get day before yesterday , when i went to the shop . then i went to one mole near my accomodition , and bought it . on this process , i checked and compared the product which i bought with other product again and again . and i could take the information about the real product . therefore , i do not agree with that statement .
