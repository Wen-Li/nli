i can not agree with the statement which is that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i actually think the statement is opposite , which is older people have enjoyed life more than young people have in recent year . in my country , japan , there are many young people who do not do anything ; they are staying at home and they do not go to shcool , do not go to work , or do not do part-time job ; they do not want to do anything , or they do not know what they want to do . now the kind of youth have been increasing , which it is a social problem in japan . this problem is symbolized the young people do not enjoy thier life . they get confused about their life . they do not know how they can enjoy thier life , because they do not have many experience and they can not find or understand what thing they are really interested in ; but they are staying their home . thus , they do not try to enjoy thier life . in while older people know how to enjoy thier life because they have many experience to find what thing they are most intererested in . and many older people have worked for a long time in some office or in home a housewife . so , they want to use the time for themselves this time . they know how to use the time moreover , they have desired if they quit job , they want to go hiking or traveling , spenting thier time for their hobby . they try to use the free time a they want , which is that they enjoy their life . there are two big difference between young people and older people . it can not say all young are same like non-desired people or all olders are same like desired people ; however , it is true the non-desired young people are increasing in our society . japan is the country which there exit most a-long-age people in all over the country . thus , that is very good situation , which older people enjoy life . they can help increase japanese life motivation especially for young people who do not enjoy life .
