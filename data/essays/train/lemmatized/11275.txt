i agree with the statement a i think there have occured various societal change during the last decade which have influenced the attitude towards community-help in general and especially for young people . in my point of view an essential step is taken in the early childhood . influenced by the fact that more and more parent are working , even mother return to work earlier than year ago , child have to occupy themselves also in young age . for sure , child choose activity which occur attractive and interesting for them . this point lead to a further factor which influence the decrease in community-help of young people . the new information technology , for instance internet , computer-games , ... appears more attractive and challenging to young people compared to community-help . also influenced by the fact that mostly both parent are working , they do not have time to help in community . consequently child do not have anybody to look up and follow . further i believe that young people do not want to spend too much time for activity in community , a they are much more interested in a variation of different thing and want to explore the world and it diversity . this is supported by national and internation policy which is presenting attractively the advantage of going abroad , make self-experiences in other country and culture , learning foreign-languages while staying in a country where this language is spoken , and so on . further thinking on my own experience in my home country , university and college are more and more centralised . therefore young people have to leave their home-village pretty soon after finishing highschool if they want to attend higher education . consequently people are at least locally separated from their community . to sum up , i regret that community-help is decreasing , however i can see reason leading to this development . and deep in my heard i hope that young people reflect on this development and put more emphasize on communtiy-help in future .
