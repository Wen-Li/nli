well i actually agree with this statement . i will explain briefly some of the personal conclusion that led me to think this way . the first one ha to do with environment . almost every person in the world know that the gas produced by car are damaging our environment . they are a lot of argument to sustain this idea but one of the most important is the destruction of the ozone layer . this terrible problem explains the appearance of many group and individual that are protesting and trying to change the rule of government and the habitude of world population . because of the concern of these organisation and many individual and under the advise of many , many scientist some world leader are engaged in this fighting , trying to avoid the world temperature to grow too much and attain certain level . one of the consequence is that government are trying to promote the common transport . for everyone having a car becomes more and more difficult . you have to pay a great deal of money to get your car insurance , you have to pay for parking in the street of many town all around the world ( london , madrid , paris . .. ) ... another important point is the decrease of world oil reserve . the expert calculate that in about a hundred or two hundred year oil reserve will almost dissapear . a lot of study are being conducted to try to find a material to sustitute oil . the finding are really amazing but for the moment they didn ' t find an appropriate substitute . well they tell u so . many people think that there must be many substitute for oil but that oil and car company doe not want to promote these one because of the money . if these invention see the light and prove to be good it will affect the market share held by these firm and in the future it can take to their complete dissapearance .
