i strongly agree that in the next twenty year , more or le , there will be le car in use than currently are . or , at least , those car will mainly use some clean sustainable energy source , other than oil . i think there are several reason to support this forecasting . on the one hand oil source are going to be exhausted most probably , in the next fifty year . moreover , road are currently already collapsed by car traffic . also , people are becoming increasingly awared about critical environmental problem of air pollution and other type of contamination . what about oil pool . although oil industry is a very lucrative business and enterprise are main interested about benefit , rather than environmental safety , a change in the type of energy source they use is mandatory because of scarcity of oil that in some year will prevent from using this energy for car engine . this might explain why some car industry have already made car with a hybrid engine that us electricity and oil at the same time . regarding traffic road , it is evident that any big city or even small town ha to deal with daily problem imposed by a number of car that overwhelm their phisical possibility . transportation by car ha become a very difficult task at any hour in our city . people are now more concerned about their health and environmental problem caused car . and
