traveling is for me the best way to get to know newpeople and their culture . by traveling you will know different place and experience the trip in your own skin is something that you will never forget . you can read many book about a particular place but it is only when you travel that you understand the culture , architecture , etc. of that place . many people say that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide and i totally disagree with that statment . i think that the best way to travel is on your own with a map . i have several reason for holding that opinion . first of all , traveling in group with a tour guide doe not give you the freedom to move around that you might want . when you travel by yourself you decide where to go and when . for example i remmember when i traveled in a group of fifteen person with a tour guide in paris four year ago . i planned and scheduled all my trip with this group and it guide because i did not want to travel alone . it turned out that i had a really bad experience with them . i wa required to get up very early in the morning because the excursion started at sunrise . imagine that experience for me that i am not a morning person ! . moreover i did not get along with the people in the group . there wa a big age difference that conditioned all our decision . when i wanted to go to a pub at night the rest of the group preferred to stay at the hotel playing card . i think they did n't realize they were in paris . secondly , traveling in group with guide is far more expensive than traveling by yourself . you can decide where to eat and how much you want to spend if you travel alone . you know the amount of money that you have and you know how you want to spend it . for example , you can decide to pay a boat around the river instead of paying a museum . to sum up i think that traveling alone far outweigh the fact of traveling in group . i must also say that the information that a tour guide can give you during the trip can also be found in many travel guide and book . so you might want to read a little bit before departuring .
