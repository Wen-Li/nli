i totally agree with this statement because many were those who were the victim of t.v ad , in advertsements the only intrest of the advertiser is to promote an object , an idea or a newly launched product not caring whether it might affect the consumer in a positive or negative way or if it wa a product intended for internal , use if it might cause any bodily damage . ads are the best way also to increase the sale of a product so overall it is mainly to increase sale and thereby profit . for example i have seen many ad on tv promoting for weight loss pill , or even short that when worn during exersice increase prespiration . some weight loss pill are fda approved others arent which might cause severe drug - drug interaction or even food-drug interaction resulting in severe damage to health . as for the short if not washed frequently , might also cause severe skin condition . other thing like topical cream that when applied can redeuse 1 or 2 or 4 inch from the waist or hip a stated by the ad can just make people more lazy , by believing the ad they buy it and use it then sit around the whole day snaking and watching tv thinking that a miracle will happen . when the result are negative they just loose hope and look for another product or quit trying altogether . other product include skin care product that make wrinkle disappear , they have the same harm if they are not approved and if they are not being officially sold in pharmacy . there are also ad promoting for long vacation in some luxurious resort , the idea may be appealing but on arrival there might be lack of facility and some problem that were not specified in the ad which might make the holiday tiresome .
