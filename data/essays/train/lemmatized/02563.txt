i absolutelly disagree with this statement , because you can turn it around and this will change the meaning of this statement : you know a bit of everything but you ca n't do anything really good . of course if you are not specialized , you can talk with everyone about everything but when a couple of specialist have a conversation , you come to a point where you do n't understand a word anylonger . you never will understand the really important fact about a subject , that 's why you are hard-speaking not really usefull . i have a medical disease , for example , then i will ask a doctor and not someone who know a bit about the human body . it also come to my mind that it is a difficult situation at the university . for example you have to write an essay then it 'll be pretty hard to make high-qualified research , because you do n't understand the important and complicated thing . that 's why your grade will properly be worse than the one of a specialist . further i have to think about the job market , e. g. the one of germany . we have many people who are unemployed and search for a work . if a company need a thatcher , than they do n't need someone who can work a little bit with wood , who know a little bit about the law and last but not least ha already made the roof a house . they need just a specialiced thatcher . that mean if you are not specialized you are n't often interessting for company , and it 'll be hard to find a job . of course there are exception , but to speak in general it 's just harder to achieve the goal in your life . all in all i really would recommend anyone to specialize on something , because then you are able to put all your effort in this subject , it 'll be easier to earn earn good grade and last but not least to find a job , that fit to your interest .
