in these day , the number of advertisement are increasing because of technological development . i believe most of these advertisement make product seem better because they only talk about good thing about their product and also they use attracting thing , such a people , to fascinate people . since advertisement only show benefit of that product , it seems much attractive to people . for example , my mother wanted to by a new vaccum . when she wa wathching tv show , there wa a commercial about new vaccum . it said '' this is really powerful and useful ! you should buy one !! '' or that sort of thing . my mother wa fascinated by that and next day , she went to the store and bought one . when she used it , she wa really shocked . although it wa really powerful , it made really loud noise and exhale stinct air . she wa really mad that the advertisement did not say anything about the noise . also since advertisement are to attract people , they try to make those nicer , which result to make product seem much better than they really are . for example , there wa a new kind of cd player when i wa 12 year old . i did not want to buy it since i had one already . however , i saw a commercial about it on tv and my favorate actoress wa advertising it ! and it seemed for me it is really cool to have it and i if i had it , it would make me prettier . next day , i run to the store and boughr it . however , it wa really useless and it look more plastic than the one that actress had . therefore i have never used it before . in conclusion , i believe most advertisement make good to seem nicer than they really are because advertisement only provide good information about product and also these try to make people to buy their product by using attractive people .
