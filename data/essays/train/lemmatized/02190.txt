`` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . '' being someone who plan to concentrate the rest of his academic study in mainly finance it is claer which side i am taking . through a broad knowledge one get a better view on life and experience it from many different aspect . through this type of studying one is educated , even if it is just a little , about various different topic . he get more open minded and can therefore for example contribute with his opinion in many conversation for example . his or her intellectual ability and academic knowledge grow much wider and one understands more about every-day thing in different field . although in studying a specified subject one will lack much knowledge in many aspect and field , he can on the other hand excell in his or her specific subject . in a additon to the previous point many job in our evermore advancing career world require specialist . in the end it is specialist who make great new remarkable discovery and move the world a step ahead . this is why i believe , taking into account the great competition which dominates the world we now live in one need to be specialized in a certain field . one can gain more knowledge in his or her field through internship for example . in my opinion if a person really seek knowledge he or she will definitely find a way to it . one doe no-t need to study it . one can always educate him - or herself through book for example during his or her freetime .
