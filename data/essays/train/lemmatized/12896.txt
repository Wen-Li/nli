i live in a city and i can see everyday so many car moving in the street and a lot of traffic . people are stressed and they are fed up of queue and skip in their timetable . this incredible amount of car moving doe n't have positive effect of course ! i think that pollution is the first consequence of the increasing number of car . that-s why i would prefear a car reduction in the future . at the same time i recognize the importance in having your own vehicle , you can go wherever you want , with no barrier and constriction in timetable , like for bus or train . anyway i think that there are several way to avoid pollution without reducing the number of vehicle . first of all , i think that in the future there will be dicovered the existence of particular kind of fuel to prevent pollution , there are already some of them in use . the second solution i would suggest , is the increment in electric vehicle business . today there are some of them in use , but they are not so common maybe because they are too expensive . any way i think that if everybody start to buy this kind of vehicle , it price will be reduced . furthermore , pollution does't seem to be the only consequence of increasing in car , but there is also a lot of traffic , a i mensioned before talking about my city . traffic make a city unliveable ! first of all traffic ha an effect on a person well being i think , it 's stressful , and then i think that it always make you change your program and your timetable , that 's why i think that in a future people will change vehicle anyway . for me , a solution to car increasing could be the emprovement of public vehicle > underground , train , bus everyday more efficient and faster . in such a way the pollution will be reduced but at the same time there will be le traffic in return of your own well being .
