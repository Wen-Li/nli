i think to understand idea and concept is more important for student than it is for them to learn fact . the reason is that to understand idea and concept is more creative activity for student . when we try to understand the idea and concept , we must consider lot of factor of idea and concept . at first we must confirm whose idea or concept they are , to add more information to them a the background . next , we make analyse why they have the idea or the concept using aquired background information . after these prose , we can aproach to the stage to make answer or own opinion . to get answer or opinion , student can make discussion with friend , parent , and brother . in additon , they can get some suggestion from their teacher or they also can make investigation using book or internet to add more information . i think that these consequent prose are very important for student to develop their way of thinking . in contrast , learning fact doe not need such pro . it is easy to access the fact without any kind of thinking . to learn fact , student just sit down on their seat in the class room and just listen to what their teacher say . in this case , the information is only given form their teacher to student . if student listen to what their teacher say and write down it on their notebook , they can get new knowledge . but do they use their brain to consider anything during this behaviour ? the answer is no . they just listen and move their hand to write . these prose are not creative and maybe macines can do it completely . in conclusion , i strongly think to understand idea and concept is more important for student than it is for them to learn fact .
