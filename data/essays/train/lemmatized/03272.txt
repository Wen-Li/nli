it is usually said that life is short and nobody should waste his time . i think that it is talking about both young and older people . however young one are physically capable of having more enjoying experience than older one so doe it mean that young people enjoy life more than older people ? not really to my mind . the priority of both are totally different , for instance young people can enjoy highschool or college and what go along ( party , trip , human experience ) nevertheless older people would actually enjoy having time for themselves or those they love . if we take a grand mother a an exemple , she mainly worry about her grand child and her child , she enjoys witnessing her grand son growing into a remarkable person . older people are more concerned about their own family instead of their own satisfation and that is what make them happy . of course she still take care of herself and ha her own way to entertain herself however it will not be the same a when she wa still in highschool , she might want to become gardener or travel all around the world , but her need are more cultural and family-like than those of young people now , if i take a sixteen-years-old boy , it is significally different . indeed his first concern is his own satisfaction although he also care for his family . nonetheless he want to have fun with his friend going out or playing sport . his need are personal and simple . he just have to seize the day without having to worry about his salary or his electricity fee . he is not responsible yet so he is enjoying life without having the same concern a an older person . to conclude with , i would say that both enjoy life a much a they can even though there still are exception . this doe not apply only for teenager and aged people but also for every category of age . eventually , a teenager will grow and change , so will his interest and his way of enjoying life .
