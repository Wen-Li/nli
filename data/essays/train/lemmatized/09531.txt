the most efficient method of learning cen be debatable but on one point all method that were produced ha the common feature of teaching the main idea and concept to student . if one learns the way , the process of problem solving , he can also create , introduce or experiment new solving method or new solution . for a student of architecture or design , if he can learn how to cope with the idea of design , including not stealing or not reproducing , he can manage create his own item and express it whether it is liked or not . he can have the courage if he learns the concept behind the designing process . in a social field , for example in sociology , the strudent 's main aim is to learn the idea and the concept instead of the fact . the history behind the thinker or the idea maker should be studied in order to understand the philosophy of these people . if a sociolog had learnt these main idea he can also have a chance to make his own research with the available method and introduce his own thought . unless a sociolgy student doe not know the idea and the concept , just the fact doe not mean anything alone and doe not lead a student to an approvable research . for an engineer student the fact also mean just the result of a problem but it ha no meaning if he doe not know the process of the experiment . the aim and the method of an experiment are the idea and the concept of engineering . the fact are like the result of any disicpline it is like a finished building . wheter it is a social science or an applied science the theory including idea and concept are the main brick to be built first . instead of these brick one can not hold a building even if it wa built , depending on false structure .
