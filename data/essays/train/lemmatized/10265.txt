i agree with the statment `` the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide '' for many reason . first you will go with someone who know the place where you are traviling at . secon you will get to know more people . third , it is more fun to travel with a group . finally , you will discover more place with the group . the first reason why i agree with the statment is because you are going to travel with some one who know the place very will so you will not get lost there where if you went alone you will get lost or even you might face trouble with the people if you do not know their trditions . for example , i traveled to south africa four year ago and i traveled with a group of people who were from different county and the person who were taking u in the tour teached u every thing about that place and teached u what is the best way to commiunicate with the people there . the second reason is that you will get to know more people and you might be a friend with someone . for example , in my trip to south africa i got aquainted with someone called john . john is my best friend know and after that trip we have gone to more that three country together . the third reason is that traveling with people is more fun than traeveling a lone because if you travel in a group you will find someone who speakes your language so you will not fell alone . for instance , i traveled once before to indonisia a lone to spend a vacation there . i found the place glorious , but it wa boring because i wa there alone . the last reason is that if you travel with a group you will see most of the thing there where if you traveled a lone you will not discover every thing . in conclusion , i prefer to travel with a group guided by aperson than travelling a lone for the reason i have mentioned .
