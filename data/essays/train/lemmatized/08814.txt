some people disagree the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . however , personally i agree the statement for the following reason . first , traveling with a tour guide could save time . for example , in 2005 i traveld to italy with my mother by using a tour company . my mother and i wanted to go to italy for a long time and so we were looking forward to visiting museum and historical place . however , there are many museum and famous place in italy . we worried about how would we do to see efficiently . we consulted with our tour guide and she gave u good advice . she changed out tour route to be able to visit efficiently , where we wanted to go . this example clearly show that traveling with a tour guide could save time . second , traveling with a tour guide could learn more . when i perticipated in the tour goint to india in 2004 , i were led by a indian tour guide . we went to many temple , but i did not have much knowlege of hindu and muslim , indian religion . then , he lectured me the religion and the mean of picture and structure in the temple . also , he answered my question . for example , what is the most famous person in india , what is the most popular occupation among indian woman and so on . i could learn many thing from the guide . the above experience demonstrates that traveling with a tour guide could learn more . therefore , i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by tour guide .
