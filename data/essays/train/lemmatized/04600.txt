nowadays we live in an era were the use of car seems to be very useful and that we can not live without it . in my opinion , i think that in twenty year there will be more car than there are today eventhough the public transport will develop enormously . firslty , the population of the world is growing considerably , this mean that on the next twenty year there will be more people reaching the age of having the driving license . secondly , a the year go on , the price of the car will be lower , the new technology make posible to produce car at lower price . this will make posible that a major number of people achive to buy a car . you wont need too much money to buy a normal car . maybe , luxury car wo n't reach to accesible price , but normal car i think that will . thirdly , it is shown that going on motorbike in the street of the city , the avenue , the autopistas is very dangerous . every year the number of dead people driving a motorbike increase enormously . people is taken conceuous that driving a motorbike is dangerous and that the possibility of having an accident is high . moreover , people will tend to prefear to drive a car that drive a motorbike . fourthly , eventhough the public transport are beeing improved in comfort , price , distance , etc . in twenty year it wo n't have developed so much to be able to not have a car and move around the city , country , world by public transport . cars will be yet necessary to do day a day thing , and to move around the street . to sum up , i think that twenty year are no so much to decide not to have any car , maybe in a future , if thing change , and the public transport improves and make more facility to people may reduce the number of car . but in a deadline of twenty year i think that all the factor that i have mentioned before will make to have more than today .
