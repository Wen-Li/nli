nowadays , the people are not a the same a the people in the past . in the past they were wise enough and give enogh time for everything . the time now is very important , and we must be carefull of it , because it is in our hand and also everything now rely on the time . but the young people , they want everything to to be done a quickly a possiple . for example , they do not like to wait much . they must do everything carefully and wisly and like this they will not waste time , and they can help their community in everything , they can do all their work in a good way . but , nowadays , they do not take care about these thing , because of the new envitions , which make them like this . and we all are responsibe about this , i mean that we must help the young people in everything that will make them take care of time to help their community , because the young people can do everything better than the other people , and this is because they have a streangh and the power to do difficlt work . for example , in the important place like bank , they want everything , whatever they do , to be done quickly . and a i said , the new envenyions today , make them like this , for example , the tv , computer , internet and another thing . they make them careless , not care about the community generally , they will do everything they can do to make the time go faster . in the end , i think that everyone must take care about the time , like he oung people , because everything rely on them to make the community better , and to make it very beautiful in it , and we must help each other to do this .
