how many car there will be in the future ? it 's impossible to know , but we could think about different ipotetic solution . for example if the petroil will be le in the future probably an effective reduction of car could be there in the next twenty year . but maybe a new scientific solution will be find , and a new engine like oxigen or hydrogen could be emply for replace the petroil . in my opinion i think car will not decrease in the future . why ? it is very simple , every year there is an esponential growth of people in the world . what doe this mean ? only one thing , more people more car . i think at this time , every family ha one car for each familiy 's member more or le . for example my family is composed by 4 person , me , my brother and my parent . me with my mother drive the same car , my father ha two car , my father 's company give him one , the second car he buy for sparetime . my brother ha a car and also a motocycle . at the end there are 4 car in my family how we are . how i could think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use there are today ? it 's impossible . the only solution , it is enlarge the public communication system , for example put in the city 's road more bus or tram than now , or increase the railway service , built underground system in the big city . to support this solution is necessary also an other factor : make cheaper than now the public service . until now if i use my car is cheaper than buy a railway ticket . every year the ticket is more expensive . why doe it happens ? the governement shoul make easier to use public service not harder , also for a different reason : decrease the pollution of environement , use in the best way the nature 's energy and doe n't waste them because very soon can be ended . for all of these reason , i think is necessary a large dose of good intention to make possible the statement : fewer car in the future . everyone must to do something to built this dream !
