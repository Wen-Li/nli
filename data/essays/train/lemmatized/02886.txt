enjoyment mean make the life happy . by satisfying the soul of the body not only physically but also mentally . if a person can get through both the mental and physical stress . then the person is said to be enjoying his life . for the enjoyment of the life especially the is no age limit . both young ang old people can enjoy the life beautifully if they plan there life properly . if not the person at any age can not enjoy his life . in my opinon old people enjoy there life more happyily than the younger one because , in this morden world people should run with the time they rearly get the time to enjoy . for instance if u see a school going boy/girl they alway run with the time . there curriculam schedule is so tight that they are unable even to talk to there own parent . they are totally missing there sweet time by enjoying with there parent which is necessary for a young child to share his feeling , which is not possible for a young child . but the older people are spending enjoyable life by doing the thing at the time they want to do atleast they are having that liberty . coming to the young people who are going to job they schedule is also not at all planned according to them . they hav to do hard work to earn money . the people around him will respect him only if he have money . so people all over the world is runnig all around to earn money . such young people who are at great stress full job are unable even to take care of there health . so they are also not enjoying the life . if we see odler people who are out of there job are atleast having right food at time . they are enjoying by taking care of there own grand child . thus , i conclude that even youngstrers can enjoy there life if they make some free time sharing there happiness and sadness with there family or friend . they can really enjoy the full sweetness of life than older one . because they have great time to enjoy .
