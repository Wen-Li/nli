whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today is an interesting question . in the world there are people with different way of thinking , culture , behaviour and need . as a result of this there are people that support that there will be fewer car in use than there are today because gasoline will finish , while on the other hand there are people that argue that will be more pollution so people could not drive their car . before i decide which position to support i want to consider both point of view . i think that car are very important in human life because with car human can move in same part of the world faster for instance than horse . for example i am a university student of politecnico in milano and i live about 10 km near university , so i always take my car . moreover i think that gasoline will finish but fisics will invent other thing to move the car . nowadays for instance there are electric car . i support besides that pollution of car is a wide problem but if fisics will invent other solution pollution of car can be eliminated . if a person asks me if there will be fewer car than nowadays i am sure that i suddenly answer that i do not think this . in the end i can conclusion that i disagree with the above statement because car are much important for the people yet . moreover i think that with car that can not produce any pollution in the future could be more car than today .
