i agree with this statement , but student should also understand the fact . students should undertstand the idea and concept of the subject what they learn becuase they will not be able to comprehend what the subject is explaining . however , the best way to learn is student should also learn the fact . they must learn the idea , concept , and the fact . first example is when student were reaserching for the famous black people from history , student must understand the idea and concept of their reaserch . then , they would be willing to study about the people from black history . after they finished reaserching about black people , the teacher should give the comment about their project . then , student would understand what they missed from their the information about black people . second example is when student need to solve the math word problem . students who do not like the math will not concentrate during the math class . therefore , the math teacher must explain the concept of learning math . then , the teacher should let the student to think about the math problem and find the answer first . it is important to let the student to think about the problem first and teach student the fact of the problem later . third example is when student were trying to get the solution of the chemistry problem . the quick way to get the answer is just ask to the teacher , but that is a bad idea for student . students must understand the idea of the chemistry and student will be able use this idea and figure the other problem . then , student should check with their teacher what the student got from their understanding . as you read , these are the example that student should underdtand the idea , concept , and fact . the important point of learning for student is to try to figure the problem themselves , but if they can not get the solution , they need to understand the idea and concept . then , stundents would eventually comprehend the fact .
