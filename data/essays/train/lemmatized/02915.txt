as people grown up , while attending at the school or on the way of making money for themselves and their family , us their previous knowledge and applies the theoritical education , gained before , into practical solution . decions make sense how to plan their life and reach to a point . a hard working person , who ha given the right decions and reached the success would be happy . because the life play many game on people and not everybody can suffer from , but the luckiest one do . it is really so hard to be successful . so a successful person doe n't take much risk . for example , the person , to be a doctor , an engineer or any other difficult proffession , should work hard , spend more time on the education than having fun and traveling outside etc in the period of being a student . after beginning to make money and may be marriage and having baby , he would thank god that he ha a job make money and earns enough for his family . so he would n't risk a successfull life story but just do what they have already learned in a tough way . successful people are the one , who doe , what they know how to do well . but the lazy people can not reach success that easily . becasue they have not been well educated and have not been qualified , they can not gain ability to survive the life . they find life to be very difficult about money just because not having a good job because of the lack of education . in this point of view , such people who ha not much ability but ha the only chance to be rich easier , for instance to gamble their whole money or find a way of making legal money by business , may take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well . despite they have nothing doing well , so they have nothing to loose .
