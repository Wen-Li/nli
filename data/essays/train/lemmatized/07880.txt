in wealthy region of the world , it is common that a typical family ha more than a car per person . sometimes , especially when i am stuck in the traffic , i wonder if this situation will ever change . i strongly believe that in twenty year the number of car will decrease deeply . and there are mainly two reason that convice me contending that . firstly , enviromental protection is becoming a topic of paramount importance in government policy . many people 's health ha already been negatively impacted by the polluting effect of a too heavy circulation . therefore people are a lot more concerned in the prevention and limitation of this problem . public transportation is generally considered to be the most effective solution and car user seem more and more willing to take advantage of it . then , it is evident that having a car ( or more than one ) mean wasting a large amount of money . it is part of our daily routine reading that oil price ha increased once again during the night . not to mention the huge insurance cost and the several and varous type of fee related to the use of a car . last but not least , it ha to be taken in account that many municipality , in order to reduce traffic in the city center , usually come out with special permit to park in certain area . such permit are generally perceived extremely expensive by the the majority of the population . in conclusion , enviromental protection and incresing cost should convince all of u that a more limited use of car would be a better solution for everyone . of course , also government and educational system should help , and it appears that they are on the way to sensibilize people to that effect . these are the reason why i am positive that in twenty year it will not happen to me to be stuck in traffic a often a it occurs to me now .
