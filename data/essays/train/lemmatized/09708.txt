i do not agree with the idea that it is more important for the student to understad idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . i mean understanding the idea and concept will help the student in some way but this will not be enough for them to learn the thing elaborately and accurately . learning the fact in an operational way is much more better for the student than only repeating some concept in the textbook or memorizig them . i think all the class should should include an application part of the lesson which is given in it . imagine that you are in a biology class and learning the anomal behaviour . will it be satisfied for you to read the passage in the text book ? of course not . it will be better to see real life pattern on animal behaviour to learn the concept adequatly and accurately . so in such case student might visit a zoo or a national park by the control of the teacher in order to see the real life fact in a natural way . another good example could be a computer science class . we all know that computer programming is an operational thing and the best way of learning it is to use the computer in the computer lab . you may use the textbook again to understand the concept but that will not be enough to imagine the proggramming in an excellent way . you should use it and learn it by making mistake again again much more better than reading it usage in the text book . another cricual point on this subject is the fact that it is already proven by the educational psycologists that learning the thing by real life experience is much more effective than learning the one which are previously prepared by the teacher . suppose that you are making a cake from a cook book . will your cake be excellent in the first time or will it get better by the time you make it again and again ?
