i do not agree this opinion . in my idea , older people enjoy life more than young people do . when person is young , he and she do not know what is the life and how important of the life is . because they have le experient of life . they maybe catch up with money , they maybe abandant themself in the luxury . they can not recognize life is important to them . when person grow up , they work for life and they married and then have the baby of their own . they begin to realize that life is more important for them . a lot of person thought that young proson have the opptunity to enjoy life , and older person is late for enjoy the life . i ca n't agree the idea . young person begin to their new life of them own . they just enjoy themself not the life . life include family , associate , work , friend and so on . older person enjoy more family and associate , compared with young person enjoy more themself and friend . in the sorround of me , there are a lot of youny person selfish and competive . they can do whatever they want to achieve their goal . when they got about 30 or more year old , they began to realize the life . they found they have lost a lot important life with their family and friend . they became peace , and began to enjoy the real life . when they enjoy the life , they found which is more important for them yet . in my conclusion , older people enjoy their life more than young person do . but when young person got enough experience of the life , they will begin to love it . recognize the life need a long cource of experience . recognize themself is also important to enjoying the life . so young people enjoy life le than older people do .
