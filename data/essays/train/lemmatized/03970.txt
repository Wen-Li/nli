advertisements are a huge impact in today 's society . they impact greatly on the decision people make when choosing one thing over the other . they can make one person change their mind about a thought they were holding very strong or make that thought even more stronger . i agreee with the fact that advertisement make product seem much better than what they really are . when looking at an advertisement people look on how this add make a product look , the color , the person on it , the letter , many thing influence a person perception on the product by just looking at the advertisement . if an advertisement is very colorful it might make a person thing oh this product is fun or it seems like very easy to use . if in contraty it is very simple , the person may look at the product a boring or very lame . also whoever is on the add can affect this , if we see a celebrity we might wanna use this product just so that we look a pretty a they do the problem with very well designed advertisement is that the prodcut may not be a well designed . many pepople when they see an advertisement that call their attention alot , tend to assume that the product work just a well a the add wa put together , and in many case this is not true . in my opinion i think advertisement make look product so much better that they really are . in my own experience i have encountered this problem . once before i wanted to change my brand of sahmpoo and a i wa looking at a tv add and i saw a particular kind of shampoo that callled my attention a lot because in the add there wa a calebrity displaying how her hair looked after using this shampoo . it callled my attention so much i thought my hair wa going to look like that if i bought it . i bought the shampoo and i came to find out my hair became very oily on the root and very dried at then end , nothing like what it looked like on that particular celebrity . i wa really dissapointed . i think that when purchasing a product that we want to be of great quality , add should be the last part we focus on . we a potential buyer for any industry should focus more on personal experience people have had with this product or just by doing some research . adds do not show the true quiality of a product all it doe is make it more falshy so that people spend their money on it .
