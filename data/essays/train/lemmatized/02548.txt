i absolutely disagree with the given example . older people enjoy life the same or more a young people do . this is due to the fact , that young people live life according to their expected future , creating this way a false sense of eternity . therefore , young people are unable to experience the marvellous mystery and beauty of daily life . on the other hand , it is well known , that older people live life more intensive . older people are capable of experiencing every second of their existence , because they are aware of their mortal destiny . life is based on experience , life is what we create on a daily basis , but life ha an ending . life is uncertain , but death is certain . everyday responsibility have made young people , a myself , unaware of the reality of our existince , of the real meaning of life . life should not be just about completing assignment and working for a company , life should be something deeper . but it is well known , that our industrialized society ha made out of u working machine , and taken away our freedom to live life accordingly to our decision . as one grows , one is taught to be a person who dedicates most of it life to the well-being of the society in which one 's live . before , for example in my country , reaching 65 year , one is obliged to work , and one will be able to live only after turning this age . this is an important reason , that explains why most of the young people are uncapable of enjoying life , the way they should , and why older people are capable to . it is a pity , that most of the people in our society will start to live life just after having dedicated their entire life to society . it is during this stage of life , when older people realize that their life is mortal . it is during this revelation , that people start enjoying life more . every second is precious , and every second could be the last . it is this fact of life that make older people enjoy life more than young people do .
