although much people may agree with this statement i disagree with it for several reason . the first point is that there are no reason to support this statement . why should an older person enjoy life le than younger people ? older human have the same possibility to enjoy life a younger do . they are able to go shopping , to go to cinema or whatever they want . furthermore i may say that older people enjoy life more than younger do because generally they have more money and know exactly what they want . because i am young i have to try out what i like and what i dislike . for example , if i travel to austria and after the first three day i realize that i do not like this country . in this situation the whole holiday will be bad . if i had been older , i would have known that and would not been traveled there . it is also the fact that older people are having more pastime when they are free from working . so they have much more time to do what they want . due to this they would enjoy their life more than younger people which still have duty like going to school or working . moreover , younger people are stressed more often because they want to have success in their job or in school . so , even if there is time to do something enjoyable , they just will not do this because they are too stressed . the third reason why i disagree with this statement is because of my own experience . nearly all the older people i know are enjoying their life very much . my mother is an example for that . since she is older than fifty , she is more often in bar and club than i am . she also ha many friend and enough money to do whatever she want . my last point deal with the danger of deseases in age . i do not think that this fact consequently prevents older people from enjoying their life . in my opinion , knowing that life is short and may also end in the next year is an argument for enjoying life . in that situation people perhaps will care about their time and use it a well a possible . in the end i think that older people may enjoy their life even more than younger people do .
