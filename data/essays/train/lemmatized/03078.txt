there are a lot of argument in our day which tend to warn u that car will be fewer in twenty year . cars were build in order to facilitate for people their transportation but will it stay for ever ? first of all the main factor that make u believe that car will be fewer in twenty year is the unbelievable speed of the growing rate of the population . it is becoming bigger and bigger . just imagine if six billion people have a car where could we find a place to park our car ? if in our day we are facing huge problem of traffic what would it be like in twenty year ? in our day the government decided to build metro station located in the underground and they decided to increase the number of bus in order to resolve several issue concerning the parking and the traffic . they are trying to encourage the people to use different sort of transportation especially the metro by decresing the price and by doing it faster . by following the same idea , the japanese and the chinese government decided to encourage their people to use bike which are symbolic to them . second of all there is another problem which is the pollution which is destroying our environment day after day . the petrol is being extinct . some study estimated that in a period of fifty year it will disappear . that 's why the country are building eoliennes onshores and offshores in order to use the force of the wind in order to converte it into a mechanical force . several car company had the idea to build car that need electricity and not gas . but unfortunatly the population and the lack of place doe n't help the compagnies to find a logical solution that could hopefully resolve all these problem generated by car
