while some people have a deep and specific knowledge of one subject , others have a broad knowledge of many subject . the question arises which of those option is better . i persoally agree with the statement and think that a broad knowledge is better . if you have a deep knowledge of one specific topic , you surely are a specialist in your specific field of interest . you may call yourself an expert . you can work on one topic that you like and that maybe ha become part of your life . however , the disadvantage is that you only have specific knowledge , which in the worst case could lead to a lack of understanding for other topic . as life ha lot of facet , it would be useful in my opinion to have a broad knowledge of topic which concern the world we live in . although with a broad knowledge you are never excellent in one specific topic and may not see your own academic development in your field of interest , you gain an insight in various subject and , which is most important , you can also use your knowledge in daily life situation . that knowledge can in a way widen your horizon and maybe it could a well be very useful . if you can speak lot of language for example , this could be handy for you when you go on holiday and find yourself in conversation with native speaker . in this daily life situation it is more useful to speak a few language in an average way than to speak one language perfectly . i think you can not say in general if it is always better to have a broad knowledge or a specific knowledge . it appearently depends on the character of the person and his or her preference . nevertheless , maybe you could also make a comprise . you could have your own specific subject but at the same you could confront yourself with other subject in order not to lose yourself in one specific topic .
