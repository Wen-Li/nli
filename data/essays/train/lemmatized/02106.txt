i agree with the argument that within twenty year the number of car in use will decrease compared to the current situation for a variety of reason . to begin with , almost all of the people who are using car and even public transport to go to work , and surprisingly even the one who rarely go out , complain about the overabundance of car on the road . a lot of car mean a lot of traffic and noise , hence a lot of time spent while trying to get to one place from another . those factor put stress on people and so make use of car an undesirable thing for them . secondly , people are aware of the fact that extensive use of car cause air and noise pollution . that probably explains why some citizen had already left big city for out-of-city area where there is few pollution and noise . as people become more conscious about the environmental effect of extensive use of car , i guess they will give up driving and shift to alternative way . another reason , which is connected with the reason i mentioned about so far , is the increasing investment of local government and municipality on public transportation . subway in that sense is a good solution a it brings the heavy load of traffic underground and allows for quicker and safer transport for people . as public transportation network becomes wider , people will give up driving for a shorter and safer time on road . and the last reason i want to mention is the rapidly increasing price of oil . for the last couple of year there ha been a sharp increase in oil price because of global economic situation and the iraq war . furthermore , the oil resource are not a much a to meet people 's demand for many more decade . as a result of those , the increase in oil price becomes inevitable . because people 's budget do not increase at the same rate with oil price , they will use their car le , eventually causing a decrease in the number of car . in the light of the reason i mentioned above , i believe that people will shift to public transportation and finally the number of car in use will be fewer than today .
