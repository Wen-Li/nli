i 'm fully agreed that we should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specfic subject . this is will grow up the knowledge and it will increase the educational part in the personality of the people . for example , if you are invited in a converance that is talking about somthing that is not realted to your speciality . then , you will be unable to talk and discus any point that might be mentioned or raised in the conversation . from my point of view , reading many book and article that are not reated to one specific subject will help you to be more sophosticated person . another example , sometimes when you are specialized in one academic subject such a computer science and you read about other subject is not related to computer science such a math . you will see in some point there are some smiliraties . as a result of this , the knowelge will be widly increased in the two subject not only in one specific subject . having a different career in the bacholer degree from the master will also increase the knowldge and it will be better to have the bacholar speciality with the same master speciality . finally , i encourge and motivate every person that should enlarge his knowlege and know many acadmic subject rather that stik in one specific subject .
