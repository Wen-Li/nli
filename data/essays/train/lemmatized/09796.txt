in my family there are lot of people both young and old . being a young person or being an old person ha it own enjoys . however , i am just 22 year old and i think i agree with this topic . firstly there are some enjoys of being an old person . being an old person may be give a fresh feeling . beause of the fact that ; older people in my family have worked all through their life . as a result they know the importance of the time . therefore , when they find a chance to travel , they use this chance . in addition to this they are much more experienced from young people and use teir experience while enjoying . there may be some enjoys being an old person ; however there are also some distinct disadvantage . first of all older people are occasionly reluctant about spending time to enjoy . they generally prefer to rest that stem from their older age . in contrast to younger people are rearlly reluctant about spending time to enjoy . for example , if a friend of mine call me and propose to go to a bar , at that time i accept him proposal . another example ; last summer i went five distinct vacation place for my holiday . i had enough energy to travel lot of place . but i think if i were older , i would not go to five different place for holiday . probably i went a seaside and stayed there allthrough the holiday . in addition to these older people always wish to be more younger . it mean that the younger you are the more enjoy you do i think you can easily make out from the explanation i give above why i think younger people enjoy life more than older people do . being a older person ha it own enjoys but , i prefer enjoying a a younger person
