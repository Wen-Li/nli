t is a fact that young people are the back bone of the nation , they are the one who could strongly contribute to the country success and eventually in developing the nation in each and every aspect . each and every one would dream to be posted in a prestegious job after the education , but there are some people who lend their hand to help the poor and people who are both physically and mentally retarded . i believe one should be in a position to help others without asking anything in return from them . to develop this kind of nature the government should release some documentary which will explain the kindness of helping the othere which will inturn develop the country . i strongly disagree with the point that young people are not spending enough time to help others , becauses in my graduation i accompanied with several classmate and visited oldage home to help them a part of a lending hand program conducted by our college , we dint expect any thing in return either from the college in form of certificate or from the old people , i myself had a great time helping them for that couple of day . my sir always use to teach me one thing , if u help some one dont expect anything in return from them even a thanks , rather ask them to help atleast three people in their life and ask those three people to help three other people individually , this concept i have implemented in my life from that day and asked many others to follow the same . i am sure it will spread throughtout the society and one day the entire nation follows it in which not only youth will be involved but also the child and elder . i am so confident because i have tasted it fruit in the early day , some unknown person repeated the same thing to do when i have recieved a help from him . so , i conclude that anyone who belief that young people doesnt have time to help others are on the wrong assumpsion and i want each and every one to follow the above mentioned concept .
