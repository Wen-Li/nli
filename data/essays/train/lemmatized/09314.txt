yes , it 's all true . in mine particular case i have seen this question because i come from a little city where there is a different type to think respect a big city a milan . i find my time for mine community because is the place where i live and i prefer to live in a community which i have built . many young have lost ours value . that value which it ha stayed of my parent and my grandparent . there is one good reason : i think which the new generation are too vicious . i 'm agree with the fact which the young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community because there is too thing which it brings out the way the young a me . for example the drug , the too drink , necessity of to have more simple money and the fact which there is n't a good social statement who it follows young people . the life is hard but to give for the others mean to receive .
