i believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do because they have lot of time for themselves and they are not occupied by thing like pressure to success and sacrifice for family . therefore , i think older people are more likely to enjoy their life than young people do . one reason why older people can enjoy their life better than young people do is because they have lot of time for themselves . people , a they grow old , retire and have time for themselves . because they have a lot of free time , they can do whatever they want to do . today , young people seems to forget what they like to do because they have no time to think about it . when someone is old , he or she can do thing that they have wanted to do for their life . not only can they do thing they wanted to do , but also they can learn to do new thing . just because one is aged , that doe not mean that he or she can not learn new thing . because they have free time and mind , i think , their ability to learn new thing is higher than ever . furthermore , old people do not need to sacrifice for anything . old people have sacrificed themselves for their whole life . young people seems to have no time for themselves because they have lot of thing are going on around them . young people are devoted to their work , family , and future . most young people have goal and work hard to achieve that goal . when people are young , they tend to think about succus , not fun . enjoying and fun is for people who have time to stop and look back . these day , young people do not even have time to think about what they have done two or three hour ago . how can a person who is so focused and dedicated for something think about stopping everything to enjoy one 's life ? people say whatever it is , there is an order . people need to be educated to success . they need to work hard to achieve their goal . when they reach their goal , then they need to take a rest . only then people can enjoy their life . consequently many people say that young people enjoy life more than older people do because they are more energetic and active . but i disagree . i believe older people can enjoy life better and more than young people do because they have free time and mind , and done everything that they need to . older people are the one who have finished and done their purpose of life . they worked hard for their whole life to accomplish the goal once they have set . like young people , they need to sacrifice themselves for their family and work . for their whole life , they have no time to enjoy their life . but now they have both the time and right to enjoy their life . nothing is hold them back from anything . because they have free time and mind , they can understand and experience the true joy of life .
