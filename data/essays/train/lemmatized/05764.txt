i thing the statement '' young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping thier community '' is wrong and right . you have to look at all aspect this statement give u . on one hand existing enough people who do not interessting for community . these people are in their own world and could only see their own problem . sure , you have to manage your own life first till you can help other peole but there are also people who have a good life and no problem and are not interesstest in social life . on the other side there are many young people , who are visiting old peole or doing other nice thing . the problem nowadays is the politics . if the politics would not be a bad a it is in the moment , younger people would have their head free for other thing like the community . for example , the problem to get a job is a very difficult thing . many factory - owner want to have good worker who should not be silly . so the not intelligent person are not getting a job . if you have no job you can not buy food or can not rent a appartment . when a young person ha a problem like this , that he or she maybe ha to sleep at the street , he/she can not look after the community . sometimes also the problem exist that people want to help , but they can not because the social-houses are in a bad vioce . if that happens there is no use for the biggest help . so all in all you can see that for every statement you have to look at many aspect to get a result . but in the end i think the statement is right because young people have their own thing they have to do and could not care about so much aspect in their town . and in the end you can see that every person is a little bit egoism . that is very dissapointing but the truth .
