does the entertainment and taking pleasure from life depend on the people age or not ? i believe that it is basically the character of the individual the response lie on . it is true that by the age , people have been loosing their physical activity , capacity especially in term of participating in sporting activity . but enjoying life is not only limited by doing sport or showing the strength of your body . as we grow up ' our intellectual capacity also improve . how about reading , playing bridge , doing hobby like medels ? all depends on the character , and also for minor factor his or her background ( education ) , the environment his or her living in ( his friendship ) and financial mean . if the person is positive twords the world , life itself , i definitely believe that he or she will find the way to take pleasure from life according to his or her social-economic environment . this approach is always true when we are facing with difficulty . is it acceptable approach to leave everything aside and wait for the death ? we , human being are thinking creature . so we have to evaluate our circumstance and act accordingly . if we take one step further in order to develop what i am suuporting that we must creat the best condition favourable for u to take more pleasure from life .
