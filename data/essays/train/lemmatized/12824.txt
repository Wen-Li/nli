i agree with the statement on understanding idea and concept for a student is more important than learning fact . a distinction should be made between student in the phase of learning for developing skill for improving understanding of the life and those in the process of learning for a specific work . the latter may necessitate knowing exact detail for the proper practice of a work . nevertheless , improving understanding of idea and concept is more important to have a capacity to understand life . first of all , a good reasoning develops with understanding idea and concept . a student memorizing all the fact know nothing indeed if he or she could not find the linkage between the fact . for example , a student may memorize date of historical event . however , identifying cause and effect will be provided thorough analyzing idea and concept . secondly , a it is the era of information , a bulk of fact are encountered every day and they are prone to change with a rapid pace . it is important to extract a useful bundle of information from there . in that sense , idea and concept provide a frame for evaluating everchanging fact . to conclude , considering the student undertake learning for developing skill for better understanding , idea and concept should be given utmost priority in the learning process .
