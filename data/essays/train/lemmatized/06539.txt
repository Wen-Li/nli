i agree to the statement that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today for three reason . thinking of the polluted air and the growing width of the ozone halle , the number of car must be reduced whether we like it or not for the survival of the global citizen . first of all , we have to improve the condition of the polluted air . in developing country , such a china and korea , they have a growing number of automobile , which cause even worse air pollution . also developed country , such a the united states , have a great number of car a before , a they are used to the convenient way of life with automobils . however , we have to have clean air to survive on the earth . if we continue to live in this polluted air , much more people would die because of polluted air . we have to do something for the betterment of human being . secondly , there will be le amount of petral available to keep the car running . oil is not sustainable resource and it will be used up if we keep using it . to obtain enough amount of oil , there will be more case of international conflict and war . therefore we have to think of alternative way of transportation , such a public transportation , car sharing , and even walking to work . thirdly , the number of people who can buy a car will decrease because of widening of the gap between the rich and the poor . these day , the rich get richer and the poor get poorer , and unfortunately , the number of the poor outnumber the rich in many case . this is why i have to agree that we must reduce the number of car in twenty year , although i now indulge the luxury of driving to work . i really have to think of what i can do to improve this environmental issue of the world .
