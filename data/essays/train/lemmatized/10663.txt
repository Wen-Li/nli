i completley disagree with the statment presented in this section . to posse any form of knowlege is an advantage for any individual . however , stating that it is better to have broad knowledge in many subject a opposed to specializing in one subject is a complete error . there are many reason which serve to justify this claim . one , reason which serf a a contradiction to the claim presented in this writing section is if everyone had a `` broad knowledge in many subject '' there would be no one to specialize in specific subject and this would hinder any advancments in subject that are not studied specifically . the statement that having knowledge in one specific subject a being le beneficial then having knowledge in many subject greatly contradicts the way our world operates today . if in today 's world we did n't have people who mastered and speciffically looked into subject where would we be in term of advancment . for example , when looking at an individual who specialilzes in computer , if they had just had knowledge in many academic subject then how can we see any potential for improvments . when an individual specializes in a field or subject they contribute to the advancments and discovery , which in the long-run will benifet our society a a whole . another example which may be included to illustrate the contradiction of the statement presented in this section is if everyone `` only had a broad knowledge of many subject '' then where would we be in the medecine field . with an increase in disease and virus in today 's world it is necessary to specialize in specific subject , that way we can improve the society we live in . to have a broad knowledge in many subject , and no specific knowledge in some subject would be a disaster to mankind . this is because you would have to picture a world with no technological , no medicene advancment and a world void of what our society need to prosper and become a better place .
