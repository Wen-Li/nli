there are , indeed , a vast number of way to succeed in life . some may make attempt to immitate what the previous hero have done in order to be a successful a they were , and some may do only what they already know how to do well . however , there may be some others who try new thing and take risk in their action . although all the way of becoming successful in life mentioned previously may seem reasonable , i believe that the genuine successful people try new , unique thing that no one else ha ever done in history , and this can be supported by using the example of some sport , and how some new idea can influence the success of the team in it entirety . firstly , doing what people already know how to do well mean that it lack in originality and uniquness . this implies that what people are doing is not only familiar to the people who are using the method , but also to the people around them . it is possible to enhance the understanding of this point of view with an example of a soccer game and strategy that the coach us in order to win a game . if the coach decides to use the strategy that he or she know well , it implies that the other soccer team would know how the player are going to approach the game , meaning that it would make the player on the opponent team easier to predict the action that the player are going to take . this proposes that there is le chance of succeeding for the team that is using the familiar strategy to win . secondly , trying new thing can make not only the people themselves confident and content with their own action , but also , the people who are watching them . in my opinion , the act of trying new thing is truly able to cause a greater inspiration on the audience . although the act of trying new thing may be perceived a being too adventurous and experimental , i sincerely believe that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well , based on my own experience in the real-life situation .
