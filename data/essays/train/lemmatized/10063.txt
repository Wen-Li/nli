the issue at hand is whether the young people today devote ample time in helping their community or not . the topic is very important because of it deal with the youth , who will decide , dominate and mould the future of the world . i disagree with the statement . i think that young people invest a lot of their time , energy and resourses in working for their respective community . the first and formost reason for believing so come from my personal expericeince . i along with my friend regularly spend time in doing community service . this wa a habbit inculcated by my parent long ago but i am proud to mention the fact that even now i stick to it , though no parental check is present now . various survey conducted by prominent ngo 's ( non government organization ) have highlighted the fact that , that recent year have witnessed a steady increase in the number of young people and student who voluntarily come forward for doing community work . since any kind of community service would also require a lot of physical activity apart from the obvious financial investment , it is but obvious that the youth should take the onus of this task . springing up of a large number of body , organization and other institute which work in the area of community service bear testimony to the fact the youth today ha not shunned it 's social responsibility . infact coming across student who spent a mjor part of their summer break doing community service , ha become more of a rule rather than an exception . infact to encourage this trend further , now almost every professional organization a well a educational institute allow their respective employee and student to carry on with their community work apart from their designated assignment . in the light of the above reason i can confidently claim that young people today devote sufficent time in helping their respective community
