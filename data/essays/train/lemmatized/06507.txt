i disagree this statement . young people should enjoy and obtain many good thing from experience . on the other hand , they should have many thing to grow up . first , young people should study . when people became older , there are not opportunity to study something . to study sometimes make feel boring , but it will make use of in the future surely . further , while you are in the young age , it will be easy to understand rather than learn to in the old age . second , people enjoy a variety of thing by use money . as you get older , we can earn the money and enjoyable . also , you can find own favorite hobby a you tget older and older . also , it will be not good which young people to use money from their parent . third , after retired the job , people have alot of time to do someting . for example , people who retired the job can go overseas , go out somewhre anytime . they do not have to irritate to something or be hurry to do something . thus , older people can enjoy their time a they like . one reason that , they were hardworking , and did for child to grow up . enjoy life connects with the past life because they made effort each other . that reason people should enjoy life after get older . in addition , peole should study and have experience , while you are young age . that will make you to grow up and can know about the life of happiness . that reason i think older peple enjoy their life . /
