`` everybody back to the bus please ! '' the voice of the tourguide wa a distressing a the shrill sound of my alarm clock on a monday morning . we had had only five minute to look at the exibited apollo rocket , when we were called back this way , off to the next sight . the short drive wa made unpleasant by the overly obese neighbor , who spilled into my seat and pressed me against the glass of the window . this is , how i remember my trip to cape caneveral in florida on a guided tour , one of a group of 24 tourist . not an enjoyable memory . some people like to travel that way . i think that traveling in a group led by a guide is almost a guarantee for a regrettable experience . first of all , you have to do what the guide tell you . the plan were made under consideration of the special logistics and economics that a group brings with it , by people you do n't know . on a trip to spain i took with a group , i wa not able to visit a church i had read about and which interested me . instead i had to go to a so-called `` spanish evening '' ( in spain ! ) to see mediocre flamenco dance and eat less-than-great paella . then , of course , you are constrained by the time table that wa set for the group . you can not linger around a sight that fascinates you . no , you have to rush off , in order to check off another item the agenda . a friend of mine told me how he wa rushed through the tower of london by his tour guide , although he really wanted to spend more time there to connect with the circumstance of the prisoner which were once held there . and , above all , you do n't chose your travel companion . the behaviour of other group member is sometimes the straw that break the camel back . the perfect example herefor is maybe the movie `` trains , plain and automobile '' . all this should make it clear , that it is better to travel with people one know and like . and to make one own 's plan .
