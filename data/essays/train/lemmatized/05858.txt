i absolutely disagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . there are two point that explain my disagreement . the first point are the high cost of a guided trip and the second , more important point are the freedom and the flexibility that one doe not have on such a trip . the first reason of my desagreement are the cost . the cost are always an important part in the planning of my trip . if you chose to travel in a group led by a tour guide , the prize will certainly be higher than if you do the same travel by your own . in a guided group , several people need to get paid for organising and making a trip , for example the people from the office , the bus driver and the tourist guide himself . by going on my own , i save all these cost and can spend the money on something else . the second reason why i disagree with the statement are the freedom and the flexibility . in a guided group of traveler , one ha naturally no freedom to do what he or she want to do . the guide tell the people when to stay somewhere and when to go , when to eat and when to go to the restroom . when i travel , i want to make my own decision . i want to have the possibility to eat when i am hungry , to stay at a place a long a i want or to leave it whenever i like to . connected to this freedom is flexibility . on a guided trip , everything is booked and scheduled and there is no chance to change plan during the trip . however , i prefer to be flexible . if i like a place , i want to have the possibility to stay there for longer then i planned . if i travel without guide , i can change my plan whenever i want to and i am opened for knew thing . to sum up , i desagree with the statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide because the cost are normally to high and because it would mean a lack of freedom and flexibility for me if i joined a guided group .
