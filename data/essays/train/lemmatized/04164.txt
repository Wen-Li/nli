it is really hard to say if young people enjoy life more than older people do , because , i mean , they probably could both enjoy the life in different way . however , i will try to give different reason to support my opinion which is that young people enjoy life more than older people do . first of all , young people have le year that the old one . is it important ? well , my answer is yes . why you do not think from a physycal point of view for example about the strenghtness ? young people can do lot of physical exercise to keep their body in shape and do sport having fun . unfortunatly , fun that older people can not have because are weak or they have disease that make their body prone to trauma . secondly , the soul , the spirit of young people ha a positive attitude toward the life . why you do not think about the lackness of experience of young people , expecially the negative experience of adult or the consequence of certain bad behavior ? young people have this advantage to explore their life without basing on the past and doing so they can enjoy life more and better . therefore , young people can program their life to have success , and when they reach success they really can enjoy their life . thirdly , young people have the possibility to build a family , having kid which are i think the best part of the life of a young person . kids really give you the force to enjoy your life and to go through the different problem that you will encounter . in conclusion , for the above mentioned reason i strongly believe that young people can really enjoy life more than older people
