i today world with advancement in technology and hundred of television channel running with immense number of advertisement . these advertisement are best way of marketing for company we can see advertisement of everything from soap to paint and not only on television but also in newspaper road hoarding etc . but the question arises , are these advertisement really true ? what they advertise well not always . the advertising industry is continuously growing because of the launch of new product in the market almost everyday . the company want to show there product a the best one in the competitive market and in this race they generally mislead the consumer . the advertisement developer make it so attrsactive and convincing that consumer is fooled . even some people love to watch advertisement on the television because they are so attractive . in the recent past we have seen so many case comig up in the courthouse related to these advertisement the consumer report such thing if they dont get the said result . for example there wa a case on a skin lotion company . the advertisement of that company claimed that by applying this cream you will become fair in fifteen day . whereas it never happened and subsequently the customer reported it . such advertisement are nothing but tool of fooling innocent people . the government agency should certainly make stricter law to deal with such problem there should be strict consumer law to protect people and they should review the add and test the product before letting anything being marketed . summarily i would say that most of the advertisement are misleading the customer thus taking away there hard earned money and people should also know about there good and bad .
