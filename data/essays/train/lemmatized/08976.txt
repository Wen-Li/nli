this is not a topic for a toefl test , but could be a final work of a master degree in law science . but we can try to tell something also about this . .. in my opinion we live in a world in wich the pubblicity is too much important , comparated to wich it effectivly keep . .. in a year , in our crazy world , the big society spend much more many for the pubblicity instead than for the safeness of their stabiliments ( and consequently of their worker ) ... much more than for the insurance of their worker . .. much more than the development of the society in a contest of `` social responsability '' ... it 's horrible ! but it 's our world . there are many conseguences of this scandalous behavior , some of which kill a lot of person every year , others that fired worker every day , others that make poor person to be more poor . .. etc etc etc . .. but in this tragedy , we , the person who not have a relative dead in a factory or who do n't have a friend who can not arrive at the and of the month , we impact only on the face of the problem : the product and the pubblicity ; or better , the contrast between the product what we aspect to find : usually an abyss . i do n't know what to say about this . .. it 's normal : propose something to the client and construct something different , is the best way ( and it 's legal !!!!!!!!! ) to reach much much much money in few time . and we know this to be the first aim of a society .
