i think travel in a group led bay a tour guide is the best way the tour guide is a good assitance of tourist . because , during the trip the place are strange to those visitor they do not have any ideal about the place they are in . everytime when people go on a trip in the new area , always get the tour guide . the tour guide konws the detail of the area where they in . it mainly include : the induction of the area you are travelling , the map of the area , the landmark of famous scence of view , even the hospital , police station , hotel , and so on . follow the tour guide , the tourist can do a quiete perfect travel plane , find out the most beautiful or most desirable place easily , chose the fastest traffic to get there , these or save time and money . and the place chosen by the tour guide are all valuable , which are the place the visitor must go . if the tourist without the guide they may miss the good view or funny case . and when the tourist traveled in group it easier to organize some funny activity . like a party near the beach . the more people the more happy atmosphere . during the trip the tourist can make friend with each other , even a starting of love . it is kind of good communication between people especially for those people in the city , buzy with their work all day . but something sad is that recently , the tour guide becomes a commercial pormotion gradually . like , the guide cheat the visitor with the local shop onwer , this kind of issue always happened . sometimes the tour guide 's oppinion may not suitable . because everyone ha their own taste , the place chosen by the tour guide the tourist may not like . and with in a group it ha limitied freedom everyone must act follow the schdule , when the tourist travelling on one , he do not need care others , just go to everywhere he want . though it ha some short , it still a good chose for tourist
