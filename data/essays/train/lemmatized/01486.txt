in these day many topic have become important point of discussion . one of this , is the belief that in the future le car will be use because of consequence of different reason . in my opinion , we will still use car in twenty year time but no for so much longer and no a much a we use car now . the main reason why i think this way , is because obviously our natural resource are decreasing very quickly , especially , the petrol and everybody know that this it is a limited resource . anyway if we still have some , in twenty year time , the price of petrol will be so expensive than just a few people will be able to afford it , and it would be reflected in the number of car in use . another reason to support my idea is that hopefully , harder law in relation to enviromental and ecological issue will be aplied , therefore people will be more concern about the danger we are exposing earth just using our car everytime we want to go somehere . but , probably , more than anything else , the reason cause i thing car will no be in use a much a they are today , is that important change in transportation , distribution of the city and new energetic resource will come soon . maybe new discovers about the use of nuclear energy will help to develope new way of tranportation or will increase the private use of the aeroplane . if we think , that probably the city will be situated far away from each other and in more isolated area , with no road , the use of the aeroplane a private transport will be very usefull . summarizing , if the volume of car will remain the same , will reduce or increase , is a question that will be anwered in a very short while . meanwhile , i think we should start reducing the use of automobile and bidding for alternative way of tranportation a the train , tube or tram which are more favourable to our enviroment .
