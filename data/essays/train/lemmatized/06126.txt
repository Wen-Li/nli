today , the new generation is not a sensitive a their parent . they hid after their childhood and escape from the responsibility . i agree for the statement . young people do not give time to help to other people . i guess this situation come because of only one thing . `` technology improvement '' . technology refers so many area . television , advertisement , music , i-pods , game and of course computer and chatting . young people prefer watching tv or playing a computer game to giving time to help their community . they all friend do this a well . they spend so much time at their room and do not talk to theis parent a well . in school theis conversation with their friend are not about the community . in spite of the problem they share only the game and their online communication skill . internet is now widespread . it make the distance closer . the young people find friend from other country . they improve their foreign language and they learnt the culture of the country . they like chatting to unknown friend . on my opinion , the young people are not guilty but their parent . parents should be a leader for their child . they can coordinate and organize the time to play , to study or to meet the helpless people . sensitivity begin in childhood . sensitivity is teached only by parent ; not by teacher or friend . they can learn their child that the life consists of not only the music , friend , tv or chatting but also people , tree , ecology , and the world they ca n't imagine . technology is a great strength and opportinity but it necessary to learn how to use it . be sensitive and be awere of the community . spend time for them .
