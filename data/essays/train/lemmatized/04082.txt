advertisements have such an important place in our life . as soon a you switch on the tv or the radio , you are bombarded with a weatlh of information on product ranging from basic necessity like food and water to household comodities like utensil to the extent of luxury like car . but , do advertisement always potray the right information ? in my opinion , advertisement are all about the hype and they seem to inflate the use of the product to the extent that it can harm an individual both physically and psychologically . this is because the maker of the commercial are expected to be perfect in portraying the good quality of the product that can bring huge profit to the company . the negative point of the product are entirely missed and ignored until the consumer fall into the trap of `` buying the product '' . one example of physical harm can come from the advertisement of say , an anti-depressant drug . people see the advertisement that potrays information about how good the medicine is and how well it will take away depression from your life and at the same time not cause any harm . the individual absorbs the information and if he/she keep on having the medicine , it can ultimately cause harm and severe dependancy . another example can be given from a simple situation . a girl who ha curly and frizzy hair see an advertisement of a shampoo that show how curly hair can be transformed into smooth and silky hair . when she us the product , it fails to deliver result . this can have a psychological impact in that she is made to beleive that she ha bad hair that can not be changed no matter what . therefore , i fully agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and one ha to use both common sense and personal judgement in analyzing the utility of the product or a they say `` take them with a grain of salt '' .
