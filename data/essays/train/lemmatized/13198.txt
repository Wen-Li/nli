young people now a day spend very le time in helping thie community . according to the above statement now a day each and every one is very busy with their respective work . day by day the techonolgy is increasing very rapidly but still the work load is not getting supressed . when there is heavy work load there may be no time for others to participate in helping their community . for example , a student is given lot of home work at his school . at this point one may not find time to play or relax . if one is under pressure of completing their regular work and finding no time to enjoy there they may not be able to communicate with other activites . because the student is not only pressurised at his school but also at his home . because parent are more concerned with his carreer a they wanted them to be more dedicate towards their work . there fore if the workload is reduced and if they are encouraged the youngers can try to allocate some time in helping thier community , secondly , the school also should allocate certain programme where the student can realize the importance in helping thier community . they should know the importance of helipng their community , because thebasic programme the community consits are keeping the society clean , whether all the facillities are available or not . such thing make student benefit in various way . if school allocate certain programme then a student may try find time in helping thier community . therefore i paritially agree that young people now a day are spending very le time in helping their community . not only student in school , even in college and those who are working can contribute their time towards helping their community if their work load is lowered . therefore when the workload is reduced they have enough time to relax and in the mean time they can help their respective community .
