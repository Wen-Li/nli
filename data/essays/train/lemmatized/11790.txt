it is often discussed in the medium what factor are responsible for the success of an individual . many people believe that successful people try new thing and are more willing to take risk rather than only doing what they are already capable to do . in my opinion this point of view is correct because only people who take certain risk have the chance to excel in their career . to begin with , an individual can only grow personally by taking certain risk . for example , i did an internship in new york last year and could not have profited more from this experience . before flying to the us i wa feeling insecure because i did not know what wa about to happen during my internship . i wa worried because of the new language , the working environment and a possible culture clash . indeed , the first time in the united states had been difficult for me but every week wa easier that the one before . after completing my internship , i can wholeheartedly say that taking this risk ha been the best decision of my life so far . i am much more confident now and have gained personal and intercultural skill that will help me in my future career . furthermore i am convinced that every new experience ha a definite impact on an individual ' development . even if an experience seems to be negative at the beginning or a person doe not succeed immediately , i am sure that these negative event only make a person stronger than before . by analyzing the reason for failing a person is able to work on certain individual weakness . in addition to that , i want to point to the concept of learning . for century it is widely accepted that people have to learn in order to become better in what they are doing . not only in school , college or university class but also by attending work-shops in the professional life people are constantly forced to make new experience and learn additional aspect about different issue if they want to be successful in life . in conclusion , i absolutely agree that one characteristic of successful people is based on their willingness to try out new thing rather than sticking to the thing they already know . taking risk is fundamental if you want to succeed in life . only by facing challenge an individual will be able to grow a a person .
