i wether do or do not agree with this statement . from my perspective and i can only argue in the case of germany , the truth lie somewhere in between . because , on the one hand you can support this opinion by stressing effect of globalization through which young people do not have time to engage for any kind of help for their community . one can say , that the pressure of worldwide competition increase the freetime for every young individual . but on the other hand , one can respond that the personal demand after social relationship and altruism included still exist in a similar way like century ago . if we are looking into hospital or other institution , which are aimed at helping other people , we can still find a lot of people with very different social background who are engage in social work , e.g. for old people . here one can oppose , that the number of people who are engaged in those insitutions increased very much . for example the engagement in political party . the german social-democrats loosed around 600000 member until the 1970ies . but are those number good indicator for the engagement of young people nowadays ? one can say , that especially younger people do mor often use new technology to engage them for their community , e.g. they are organizing event in their hometown or something else like that . so young people do not need to be `` physically '' engaged in their community . often they are member of other internet based community or just handle thing through this new medium . but one can at this point argue , that this is an evident developement nowadays . unreal community were founded through new medias and the modern kind of community is not important anymore . i think this discussion is endless and depends on age and experience . from my perspective younger people are thinking in other more postmodern way . this is way an answer to this question is really hard to give .
