today , we talk about the issue is about did the new generation really spend enough time for their community activity or not . according to my opinion , i agree that they do not actually had enough time to help the community that they involved . when we talk about the main community for the young people is the family and the school . and i will talk about how they did n't do them best in this two community . family communities . as we know that , when the people growed up , they do n't want to depends on parent more , all of them want to got another sky for themselves . but do it mean that we do n't need to spend more time for family ? do it mean they should seperate from the family ? i say no . cause the family community is actually the base for everyone , it 's also a strong supporter for everyone . and how to build a successful relationship into family is really important . from such reserch from teenages criminal , the percentage of teenages criminal are growth year by year , and there 's nearly 60 % of the teenages had bad relationship with family . so , we can know that those social problem occurs actually because the teenages did n't really spend time to build a good relationship with family . so , if they even do n't spend time with them family , how can they say they helped out with the family community . shool communities . did u ever seen the report about school violence issue ? did u saw the picture show the student shooting their classmate ? that 's what had happened in this world now . school communities , is the people spend most time when they wa young . when we saw those bloody conflict had happend in school , we could know that this is the evidence we say they do n't give enough time to help their community . they did n't spend time to talk to them classmate , they do n't want to working with friend , they can spend more time in msn but not in class . they do n't participate the school activity cause they are not interesting . that 's why we say they did n't really help out the school community . so , beside in this two reason , we know they did n't do them job ,
