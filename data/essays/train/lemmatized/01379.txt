i agree with this . i think the use of car will decrease than now in twenty year . because now a day the price of the gas is becoming higher and there will be no gas in the future . some company started to make a hibrid or eco car , but it will not much the demand and many people ca n't buy such a expensive car with not finishing the loan of the car which thay have now . also , now the global worming is the big problem in the world and the car use is the issue too . but there is a problem too . because the way of transportation we have is just a car and a train . so if people stop to use car , there will be no way to transport , because train is already full with people .
