advertising ... bliss or curse how many time did you a buy a product expecting it to be of high quality and usage , only to be disaapointed later a you discover it limited functionality and below average quality ? i am sure some may agree with me that this scenario occurs often , and soon lead to people arguing whether advertisments make product seem better than they really are . though i can relate with those who argue that it is the buyer 's responsibility to verify the exact specification and functionality of an item before purchase , yet i belive that in our day most advertisments do `` beautify '' product to seem better than they are . if we consider the hypothetical or rather normative purpose of an advertisement , it would be to show a potemtial customer the existing functionalies of a product and convincing him/her to purcahse that item . but with capitalism taking control of the world , definition have started to change , and the business world ha adapted to new mask keeping revenure - rather than business integrity-as the ultimate purpose . hence advertising became about doing and saying anything and everything to sell that item , regardless if that item is worth selling in the first place . if we take example from the world , we can look at the historic and famous cigarette ad , which usually try to promote smoker a `` beautiful , adventerous , cool . .. etc '' , yet not until recently , failing to inform smoker of the health risk , and high cancerous rate . another example would be plastic surgury ad that try to convince those who are running after the illusion of youth , that the usage of this creme or that mask , or those injection will actually turn back the cycle of time . again failing to tell patient that it all a matter of 5-7 year ( the maximum ) till any `` fake '' effect disappears , leaing them with possible health hazrds . lets take insurance company for another example . such company tend to `` sell '' their promise for safety and wellcare guarantee , yet failing in most of the case to warn the client from all those `` exceptions or situation '' where `` they just dont cover ! '' . even war ha a been a commodity that advertisements ha successfully over-rated and made it shine . the war on iraq wa advertised a a legitimate procedure to fight terrorism , and liberating the iraqis . . and ... and . . ! alot of innocent decent people fell for these `` shiny '' word , but look at what really happended . the american economy ha suffered greatly from it , half a million iraqi have been killed in 3 year , more terrorist have emerged ! business should be eithical , sell what you have , or else dont !
