it is widely believed that youth is synonimous of happiness , health and well-being . according to my experience , i think that in this respect youth is a concept that should be more related to the soul rather than to the biological age . i have met two group of young people . the first group is formed by those people who really enjoy life and live in a healthy and happy way . despite their age and few experience , they are able to handle life issue in a very creative and optimistic manner . the second group is formed by those who face life a a battle where they have to fight with each other , a in a competition , missing the beauty of the journey , always looking to the goal . most of the time , the latter group , because of their lack of experience and wisdom , may find themselves trapped in their own personal psychological conflict , which prevents them from enjoying life fully . it go the same for the elderly . there are , according to my experience , two group . on the one hand , there is the group of healthy people who really enjoy life , most of the time even much better than most of young people . these people are wiser and have learnt how to better deal with life challenge . they are healthy and are engaged in plenty of outdoors and indoors activity . they really deserve admiration and respect , and should be regarded accordingly . on the other hand , there is the group of people who is always living in the memory of a past that is never coming back , with regret and sadness . people , who have not became wiser but , instead , melancolic and angry . people who , probably due to personal circumstance , have lost their joy and the taste for life . so , i do not agree neither disagree with the above-mentionned statement , since i believe that age is in the soul and in the person 's feeling rather than in the physical appearance and biological age .
