wheter it is more appropriate to receive a broad education or a specialized one is a common yet difficult question to answer . i would like to adress it quoting my personal experience . being naturally curious , during my childhood at college and high school , i tried to discover a many topic a possible . hence , i did all my best in every course , not neglecting my weakest point ( biology for instance ) in favor of my center of interest ( language , mathematics , sport ) . this led me into mastering most of the subject and therefore i wa frequently in top-five ranking . my first moto wa a thirst for knowledge , but it rapidly turned to be an advantage . indeed , thanks to my effort in all topic to get a broad knowldege , i wa considered a a good over-all student and wa offered a lot of opportunity a regard my superior study . this wa the first benefit of my wide stock of knowledge : being acknowledge a a capable - if not talented - student . i continued my study in the scientific area , in order to get an engineer degree , a i wa interested in the automotive industry . of course , the education i received wa much more specialised than the previous i got . anyway , i did not focus only on major , like mathematics and science . my eclectic taste pushed me to keep on studying thoroughly what were considered secondary topic , such a litterature or even exotic language ( italian for example ) . hence , even if it compelled me to provide more effort in order to perform well at all exam , i have been able to add more string to my bow than what an average engineer ha . the effect of such a personal commitment is clearly benfecial today in my job . as an engineer , i am considered by my fellow a a man of letter . my skill at language and my interest for history and culture enable me to tackle more easily several situation like dealing with foreign customer or partner . this is an asset over my teammate and it ha contributed in promoting me to position that would be hardly accessible to a mere engineer of my age . besides , today i am proposed several opprtunities abroad that would be unthinkable without the `` extra-skills '' i have always tried to get . of course , i can not deny that the specialization i needed to become an engineer is useful , a it wa a pre-requisite to my career . anyway , i think that without my widest background , i would have been limited in my career evolution , a it is the case for some of my friend . besides , on a more personal point of view , having a wide rang of knowedge , even basic one , provides you with a lot more confidence when tackling problem and especially unexpected event . indeed , it can broaden your thiiking , thanks to word meaning ( language ) or analogy ( science ) , and therefore help you to figure out different solution or approach . last but not least , a borad knowledge keep you open to the world , a it doe not make you think too narrowly . to conclude , i would say that specialization ; ight help
