with regard to the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' , i totaly agree with it is important for student to understand idea and concept . the first reason is that student can hold theory and applied science much longer this way than learning only fact . the second reason is that student are able to link different subject at the university , and therefore they can understand much more thing in the different subject . i am studiying at the university in cologne and i have friend , who belief in the same statement like me . i often ask my proffesor at the end of the lecture , when i couldnt understand a lot of thing in the idea and concept , which he or she ha presented u . the reason why i do this , is to capture all the thing to understand the idea and concept . otherwise i cant understand the whole lecture , whe i onlz get the fact , e.g number or date . i also would forget most of the fact , when i only get the fact without learning the idea and the concept . the second reason is that student are able to link different subject at the university . it is very important to understand the idea and the concept to link theory in the different subjcts a a whole . when i understand the concept and the idea , i am able to link the subject to each other in many case . i am quite sure that i will do the same until the end of my study . i hope that my collegue will also follow me the above outlined reason are why i always agree with the statement that `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept .
