the best way to travel there are many different opinion on the way for traveling . some people like to travel by themselves or with their friend while others enjoy their time with a company like a tour guide . those people who believe that the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide feel more comfortable and learned for they can travel and learn a lot of new information at the same time . however , i am one of those people who would rather travel alone or with my friend . the reason for this is because i do n't feel very comfortable when there is a tour guide around . firstly , i really like to have my friend or relative around me while traveling because that 's how i have fun . also , even when i do not know a lot about a place that i am planning to visit , i go online and get more information about that place . i read and get direction to find my way out easily rather than being with a tour guide . this is not necessarily because i do not like tour guide but it is just because i believe that i would have more fun while i spend time with people that i am very close . furthermore , i traveled many country with and without tour guide . some of the place i went to are germany , russia , and holland . even though i had difficulty while traveling around because of not knowing the language , i still enjoyed my time during the vacation . on the other hand , when i wa with a tour guide i felt like i wa under a lot of pressure to listen to every detail that he provided . for instance , when i went on a tour in a museum in germany , i got very bored and tired because of the explicit and unessential amount of information provided by the tour guide . my tour guide kept trowing date about the important building and no one really paid attention because everyone expected to learn some interesting fact rather than simple date on the tour . i think i would have enjoyed my trip better if i wa by myself . lastly , i like to have conversation with my friend while traveling . but when there is a tour guide and a group of people around me , i can not get chance to chat with my friend because talking would be very disrespectful . therefore , with a tour guide i can not really enjoy my time even though it is ver nice to learn new information about the place that i visit .
