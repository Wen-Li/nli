it is now the year 2006 . when today is compared with 20 year ago , it is easily seen that thing have changed a lot . nothing remained the same but technology changed more than anything else . when car wa first invented , a developed country president made a comment about the car . he said that it wa an unnecessary invention and people would not like travelling in it . they would surely be bored of driving it one day and would return back to the horse they were riding before . but his comment never come true . it is clear that he doe not like invention but most people like . since technology is getting more advanced day by day , it is not hard to guess that something that will be more useful than the car will be invented soon . maybe in 20 year people will not be driving car . i strongly believe that in 20 year a mixture of a plane and car will be produced . so people will not drive on the earth anymore . this new invention will be good for everyone . since there will be no car on the earth , there will be no traffic jam and since our `` plane-cars '' will be in the sky there wo n't be any accident because there will be plenty of emptiness in the sky . also this invention will be closer to the sun . so it will work with sun energy . as you see there will be no need of gasoline . people will not have to have a budget for gasoline because their car will work with only sunlight and it will be free ! also if it is night and there is no sun , it will work with moon light . the idea of a `` plane-car '' is just a dream for now but it sound good . maybe it look like a real fantasy , which is impossible to occur but we should keep in mind that some time ago many technological device that we use now looked impossible , too .
