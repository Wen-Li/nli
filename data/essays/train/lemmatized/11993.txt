i would like to respond to this question by saying that i strongly agree with the statement presented . in my opinion , most advertisement do , indeed , make product seem much better than they truly are . i would like to back up my opinion by introducing several argument , ranging from the tremendous expansion of the advertising industry to such common example a mcdonalds . in the past year , the advertising industry ha grown faster than almost any other industry . if the quality of many good wa a amazing a often claimed by it producer , such a huge amount of promotion would not be necessary . the most popular example is the fast rise of the search engine google , which generates tremendous amount of money from it advertising activity . this helped the founder of google to become two of the richtest people in the world in a remarkably short period of time . in it frequent advertising campaign , mcdonalds claim that it product are not only delicious but also very healthy . scientic study , however , have found that the so-called ` fast food culture ' is one of the most significant reason for the enourmous increase in overweighted people in the united states . unfortunately , many people are not aware this is not only a problem for the individual themselves but will also have devastating effect on society a a whole , given the large amount of health cost these people will produce . another example of misleading advertisement are the spot procuced by the banking industry . many large investment bank promise prospective client le risk or higher return that can be achieved by investing in secure asset like government bond . however , the burst of the internet bubble in the year 2000 and the subsequent bear market in stock ha shown that none of those high-profile financial instituions wa able to life up to their promise . in conclusion , the recent growth of the advertising industry and the promotion campaign of several household name such a mcdonalds clearly prove that advertisement make product seem much better than they really are and often provide prospective customer with misleading information .
