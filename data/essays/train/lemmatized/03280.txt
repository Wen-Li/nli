i disagree with the following statement which is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . the reason are been shown next paragraghs . the first of all , leaning fact can halp student understand easily about what do they know the idea and concept . because whatever how mach they understand idea and concept , but if they can not ues thoes in the fact . the konwleage which is what do they get will be uesless . the most inportant is how to ues the idea . the second , leaning fact derectly effect stendents to be successful easily when thay graduate from their school . the raeson is more fact which they learned can help student to think a lot about the situation . from the fact which they learned , they could get the great idea about how to conturl or hand out the fact which they encounter . finally , learing fact can get more uesful idea than the idea which they understand and concept from others . becaues the idea which the student understand and concept from others are still others . i mean the idea are not the student ' experience just idea . but the fact which are all from the real situation are been uesd in the socirty . in the conlusion , i think the student learning fact are more uesful than understand idea and concept from others .
