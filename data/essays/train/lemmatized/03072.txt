in my life i met a different people . some of these have a variuos knowledge about many many topic and they have their opinion on somethings . others of these know very well a subject only . in my opinion is very important have a knowledge on many topic and is not good know a topic only and can talk about the same topic only . i would be like a first type of people , because know everything make a general view of the world and of what happened in the world . then knowledge open your mind and take to be a more pleasure person . one time i met a man who know everything . he is a very likely person , because with him can speak on all and can argue on all . he ha a his opinion always and on everithings . then i learned somethings by him , he know more then others always , and he have an explanation on all what you ask him always . he is a very interesting person thanks for his huge knowledge . on this example my opinion is better on people who have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than people to specialize in one specific subject . for this i would be like man who i had a description before . in final , there are many different people , these can be put in two category . in the first one there are a people that have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . instead , in the second one there are a people that specialize in one specific subject . in based on the example that i reported and in based on my experience i agree with the statement , or rather i have many consideration on the people that know many thing and for this they have a their opinion on everythings . it is a very good thing . i hope that i will learn many thing to know somethings on
