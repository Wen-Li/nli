first i am going to examine , why people are successful . from my point of view people are often successful , since they first tried to do new thing and took certain risk and , second , they did one thing for a long time . if people do one thing for a long time , they should get better and should know how to do it well after a time . for this reason people often do what they already know how to do well , when they are successfull . but they often also tried new thing and took risk . therefore i can not really agree with the statement , but i also can not really disagree . in contrary to the statement there are people who even do both of the alternative . for instance , my teacher of martial art try always to do new thing , but also stay doing thing he already know very well . that is why i think that successful people neither try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already nor do what they already know rather than trying new thing . another reason for not being able to directly answer the question is that there are also people who are successful , but neither ever tried new thing nor really know what they are doing . for example , a friend of mine only had to take over the company of his parent to succeed . he make increasingly much earning with his firm without really knowing what he doe . and moreover he never had to try new thing and he did not even take risk . to put it all into a nutshell you are not able to make such general claim on successful people like in the statement . nonetheless if i had to choose whether the statement is right or not , i would finally agree , since successful people could tend to try new thing rather than doing what they already know . but that can not be generalized .
