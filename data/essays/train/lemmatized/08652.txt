this is the age of modern science and technology . so there will be many change taking place with in our world in the near future . while some set of the student disagree with the given statement and others do not . i agree with the following statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewers car in use than there are today '' due to the following reason . nowadays the population is growing a bit faster than the past . due to this growth of population in a limited area like our earth , so there will be automatically a rise in the use of vehicle for their transportation . for example nowadays privacy is considered a the major element . due to this reason people are preferring for buying car than using public transport like bus , taxi etc . the scientist are in search for possible solution for solving these problem and also human are also concerned about the growing pollution mainly smoke pollution . they were trying to reduce this pollution and traffic problem by inventing car which will not cause any smoke pollution . for example , they invented some sort of hydrogen a fuel in place of petrol in order to reduce the smoke pollution . in order to reduce the traffic problem they are ought to invent space car which will ply in the air instead of on the road . this will surely reduce the traffic jam . mainly people are concerned about their health nowadays . they think that their health will get spoiled if they are exposed to such sort of pollution . so they are also in a great need to reduce pollution and traffic jam . so in the near future there may not be any car and there may be only space car which will ply in the atmosphere rather than on the road . and due to their great concern about their health they will prefer to walk and ride bicycle for reaching their office . for example , in developed country like japan and china , people already began to use bicycle and walk to reach their office , school and any other work they wanteded to do . they believe that it not only reduces the pollution and traffic jam but also make them healthy by reducing obesity problem . from the discussion made in the passage , we can come to a conclusion that there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
