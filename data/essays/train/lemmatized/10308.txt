well , my over all preceptions about advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . i disagree with this statement for several reason . firstly , i think that many advertising company advertise for the matter of money not more . secondly , i know that many product do not deserve a very big advertising through a personal experience . many famous company advertise for their product to attract people to buy it or to love it in some way . what i mean that is advertising company look for a something which all people love it and try to put it in the advertisement . as we know pepsi is one of the most company that advertises for it product . and all people know that pepsi is very harmfull after if we drink it for a long time . well people didnt say that . scientists said that and due to many experiment on pepsi . people also can discover by them self that pepsi is not good . a very simple test , bring a broken teeth and put it in a pepsi cup . you will soon discover after a couple of hour that their is no teeth . in addition to my first example which prof to people that pepsi is very harmfull and they always advertise for it on tv . i would like to talk on another example which is junk food . i watch tv for around 4 to 6 hour each day and i can see alot of advertising for macdonalds and burgerking . if a normal person see these advertisement , he think that jumk food is good , while it also very bad . junk food may lead to cancer disease and block in heart artries . its full of harmfull oil which is used several time . some people are also overwaited from junk food . all doctor advice to stay away of junk food . in fact advertsement people are professional and they know how to affect people through these advertisement . and a far a i know and i think it not fair and also it not legal to try to cheat on people . i take this a a cheating method because when they are advertising you think it a good product and it suit you .
