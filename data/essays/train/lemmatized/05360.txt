at this day , many people think that it is the best way to travel in a group with a tour guide . in my opinion , it is better to travel alone because you can do what you want to do and you appreciate more your visit . i prefer choosing what i want to do because i do not like do something when i do not want to do this thing . for example , if i am tired i must follow the tour guide to visit a monument . when i wa in cuba , i visited a lot of city and monument alone . i wa happy because i do what i want . if one day i were tired , i would stay in the hotel and took the time to relax . with a group , you can be independent and i am independent . when you visit a country you appreciate more your visit when you are alone . for example , when i go to a museum i prefer to visit it alone because i am not with many people . i can move if i want , i can stay a long time to see a painting . and if i want to stay just one second to see a painting , i can . when i visited the louvre , i wa happy to be alone because i could stay one hour to see one painting and by contrary , i could stay thirty second in front of another . you can have a lot of advantage to travel with a group ; but in reality , i prefer staying alone when i visit a country or a city . i am an independent girl , and i do not like be with a group .
