nowadays , old people blame young people of not helping their community for enough time . they accuse young people of being more personal than being a part of the community . if you just look at time spent on community , they seem to be right . on the contrary , if you examine the condition , they are not . today , it is very hard for a young person , to have spare time . because working hour and condition are worse than older time . they have to work hard to have a job . if you are not a devoted worker , it is possible to lose yoru job . in addition , finding another job is much harder today . a young person who may have the opportunity to help his community is probably a well-educated , economically secure . nowadays , people in same condition a menioned above are numerous . this give the opportunity to the employer that if he/she fire someone because of not staying overtime , he/she will find a new employee in short time . in the past , qualified worker were rare , because of war and epidemic . also , it doe not make any difference , even if you spend much of your time in helping community , your effort are negligible compared to the need . communities are getting larger and more people need these time and money . older people look at the number of people who need help and they claim that young people do not help them . i tink this is not fair . government and local authority should help community , not individual . today big money is required for fulfilling these need . older people may make larger donation and professional may do the job accurately and effectively . so , it is not fair to say that young people do not use their spare time in helping their community . it is the condition that prevents them from it . young people do not have enough time or money . older people should get involved in the subject and help their community . if they are unable , than government and local authority should do the job . please , do not make young people life harder .
