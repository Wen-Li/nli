nowadays a lot of people like to take riks and test their own limit . everybode try to hone their abillities . some argue that this way of life is just limited to successful people , because they achieved nearly everything else . on the one hand , the successful people explore new thing and have le concern about risk . but on the other hand , i think , that these feature are not just trait of successful people , rather a typical human behavior like eating . the need for certain risk , new expieriences and to be good at something is part of everyones way of life . first , risk is often connected to the hormon adrenaline . if a person is in a dangerous situation his or her adrenaline level increase . this is often assiciated with a drug or the feeling to be alive . successful people may have a greater need , because of their prior accomplishment , but this feeling and the hormon is common to every human being . second , the desire to try out new thing and gain new expieriences is common to everyone . for example , young child explore their surroundings and they find mostly great joy in it . this behaviour ha obviously nothing to do with success . third , we live in a highly specialized world and nobody is able to be good at everything . successful people , to my mind , have specialized in one trait to be successful . to learn another skill may lessen their ability to be good at their prime skill or at work . i study electrical engineering and i have to specialize to recieve an adequate education . without the proper education i will not be able to find a job and because of this i will not be successful . in conclusion , you can say that there may be a stronger appeal for successful people to experiment with new thing , but the main idea are merely human . the successful will not experiment extensively , because they will use the etch that made them successful .
