i disagree with the issue that a person should have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise in one specific subject because of many reason . first of all , like it is said that little knowldge is dangerous and harmful . when u know about a lot of subject but a very little of each , you may probably mislead others because you are not aware of small n accurate information which can lead to a lot of problem . secondly , when you know about the subject in and out , you can always deal with any problem that come across that issue . for example , if you have done a major in account in your college , then you can probably teach in the college or atleast help someone who is in need , because that person can trust you with the information because you are a testimony in that case . but if you have little knowledge of many subject , then you cant be a testimony and people will not trust you for any information becuse you do not specialise in any subject and moreover when you are a testimony because you have specialised in one subject , you get a broader aspect of getting a good job . but if you have a little knowledge of many subject , you end up nowhere . for instance , a professor who is specialised in accounting can influence others with his achievement in his field . and can encourage others to follow one specific target in life because it lead to a brighter horizon . but when you are not sure abt your strength , it lead you very doubtful becuse you are not sure of your capability . atlast i would say that specializing in one subject make you a testimony in public for the same and it lead to a secure future becuse you are sure of what you want to do and you dont mislead others with wrong or inaccurate information .
