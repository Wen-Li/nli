success in the life there is no one in the world who doesnt want to be successful . in the school in the work eveybody struggle for doing his or her best . but what is the best and how is it obtained according to me the mean of successful people is that doing it best without so much ambitious . but having some special success requires taking risk . the more risk brings the more success . of course not every time but generally this statement is true . doing always same thing and waiting or watching the other one doesnt make to earn much thing . for instance you are a reserach asistant worked in a laboratory and you are allowed to do some experiment which are interested your study . your super visior is waiting from you discover some thing which isnt say before . if you just do the same thing before which are done because of taking for you guarantee you can be stay in a situation being a research asistan year and year . since science and technology requires invention you have to study a lot you have to take some risk . in some chance play also show that without tahing any risk the money is far from you . we all know some people are very full of good luck but chance is also limited . in this case study a lot in our area and taking some risk teach u new thing . consequently taking risk is necessary in today world more quality requires some risk but may be sometimes this risk result can be hurt u but all of u known this no pain no gain .
