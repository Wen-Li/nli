i agree with the statement according to which most advertisement make product seem much better than really are . i have often made the experience of disappointment in front of a real item that i had only seen on a television screen or on a billboard . and for sure , i am not the only one to come to the conclusion that advertisement is just about misrepresentation . every day , one ha the occasion to see , for example , a poster that present the wonderful characteristic of some new beauty cream and the terrific effect it will have on the reduction of line and dark circle . the fact is that the efficiency of such potion have never thoroughly been proved , and that their using ha never prevented anyone from reading the trace of time on the face of an old woman . but nowadays , advertisement is a necessary evil in consumer society . indeed , the goal of producer is to sell more and more every day . advertisers are hired to achieve this goal . they try to present the product so a to create a desire , even a longing for it , so that people buy it a soon a they can . they repeat the operation in order to accelerate the process , and to earn more money . advertisement , then , necessarily us spectacular word and emphatic image to make people dream . advertisement , for some people , only sell dream . hence the habitual disappointment when consumer face product a they really are . advertisement then is often a legal issue . the problem consists in knowing if the advertisement is mere puff and blow , or if it really corrisponds to a visaul form of contract . if such wa the case , the advertiser would maybe be liable for making a fraudulent misrepresentation , and one could clame for damage .
