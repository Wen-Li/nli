nowadays community are at the base of our society , which is made up of child , young prople , adult and old people . adults and young people are the most active part of our society . the statement ca n't be taken a an absolute , i think that it depens on the society in which we live . at different society corresponds a different way of thinking . first i have to point out the importance of the education . as a matter of fact especially in europeans country and north american country , where education is a fact of great importance , young people are more involved in our community in order to help them . it is a biunovocal relation a the more young people can help their community the more can be both educated and help in their growth . there are some activity such a parish activity that inovolves young people . for instance i usually help child to sudy a a volounteer . that is a good way to help our community . nonetheless i have to state that in some delevoping country young people have no much freedom and that cause many problem in the relation between community and young people . moreover all people tell them what to do without giving them reason . besides there is some young people who do n't figure out why they should help community . this is due to the fact that there are egoist and they do n't like to help others . but it 's not completely thei fault . there are different outlook in the education of a person . one can choose not to force his son and let him stay all day in front of a computer or in front of television or one parent can make the choise of spend time explaning to his son the importance and the lovely sensation that hammer out in helping others , that i sto say in helping community . in conclusion i support the idea that if it seems that young people nowadays do not give enogh time to helping thier community maybe it is because they had never seen adult do that with passion and love . so we have to own out our resposabilities and never give up in front of unforeseeable hindrance , instead we can change our outlook and we can share our sparetime with young people in order to focus togehter on the big opportunity we have to help our community .
