i agree this statement . because there are some problem in car . for example car accident , porution and trafic problem . i will explain why i think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are to day . especialy i will forcus on the enviroment problem . one major reason that i agree this statement is enviroment polution . recentry this is big problem . co2 from car destroyed ozon . as a lesult templeture becoming high . so ice in north pole and south pole is melting . then water level becoming high . in a few year later , cost and city near cost will dissapear . it is seriouse ploblem . so many people try to stop this ploblems . for example i always use pubric transformation such a train and bus . but cause is not only car but also our life . for example plastic bag and air conditioner . govermant and people try to save earth recentry . because earth is good place to live . there are tree , air and water . so we realised that we have to clean the earth to live long time . however car ha no advantage for the earth . it just polute . so it will be fewer car in use than there are today . the other example of these opinion is plastic bag.5 year ago it wa usual to use plastic bag . we could get free at super market . but now we have to pay for it . so people become using own bag . i think it is same a car . the plastic bag that 5 year ago is same a car in now . the plastic bag in now is same a car in 5 year latter . it will le than now . in conclusion , car will be fewer than now . because it is not good for enviloment . if we continued using it we could not live the earth in twenty year latter . so i agree that statement .
