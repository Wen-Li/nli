i agree that people right now do not give enough time to helping their community . because i think that i am a sush person , i realy do not give any time on my community . i spent my time on school or shopping , but no on my community . the reason that i think are many . the first reason is the most of people do not know how to help their community , that is true . because in my contry , taiwan , we do have this habit to do social serve , and no one teached u when we were kidd . for my example , i live in a very big community . since i living there , no one had told me what i shoud do to this community , even my friend , too . all we know when were kidd , just play or go to school . therefore , even i want to do some for my community , but i realy do not know how to do . the orther important reason that i think is the people right now all focous on themself , they realy do not think so much . the most of people nowdays , is too bisy to do the thing they want to do , they never do the thing they do not like . because i know a lot this kind of people , they know how to play , to shopping . but every time , when school need u do some servies , they all run away . these reason is what i think .
