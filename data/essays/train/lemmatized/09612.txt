i agree this statement . people who successed on business usually try new thing and take risk . to begin with , only new idea can success . an old idea woudl n't make you rich or popular . only new idea do . people usually interested in new thing because they think it is cool or trendy . for example , many people bought new type of video game like wii or playstation3 in japan . some people bought these game on impulse because the news program or tv showed a great systeme about it and mede you buy it . now , how about old type of vide game ? will you buy it ? answer is no even tv suggested it because you already know what is problem of thes old game and you can find out that tv 's information is not always correct . another reason is that risky cahnce will be worth a lot . many rich people tried vey hard to became rich . in another ward , the took many risk to aim their goal . so risk annd success is relating . if you took risk , you might fail . however , you might do well . when the risk that you took is greater , the prize is also great . that 's why people who did n't take risk would n't sucess . it is similler to gambling . for example , my uncle went to the casino last year . he first played a slot machine which needed only 10 cent . he won many time , but it did n't make him rich . eventually , he lost 10 dollar . in conclusion , trying new thing and taling risk would make you success . successful people do n't do comon thing and take small risk .
