i believe that best way to travel is to travel alone . most importantly , this give u an opportunity to explore the place on our own pace . we do n't have to rush to keep up with the travel schedule provided by the tour guide especially when we want to do something else or want to be at a place where others are not interested and therefore not covered in the travel plan . in this situation , travelling alone many turn out to be more productive and fun filled leaving more time to spend at the place which captivate our interest . in addition , we do n't have to compromise our preference over the majority because the main aim of the group travel is to satisfy the majority rather than taking care of individual which some people are expected to compromise . for an example , if the group decides to go to an art museum , while my interest lie somewhere else say a tech museum at the other corner of the city . there is no way both could fit into the schedule thus resulting in compromise on my part which is not acceptable to me . the people who prefer to travel in a group led by a tour guide can argue that guide can offer u valuable detail about the place . but there are other way to get the same information such a internet which provides almost every detail one might expect to know about a place such a sightseeing location , restaurents , important festival that might coincide with your travel date and so on . thus , it virtually elliminates the importance of tour guide . moreover , travelling alone also offer an unique opportunity to mingle with the native which almost impossible if we travel in a group . i describe this a unique because spending time with the native is the best way to learn about their culture , custom , eating habit and other important characteristic not visible otherwise . they can also give u valuable information about the monument found in the area such a background history , the reason behind their construction , etc . though , there are a few advantage of a group travel , i prefer to travel alone a it offer the flexibility which is of foremost importance to me .
