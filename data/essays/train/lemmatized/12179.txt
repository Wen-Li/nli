it is difficult to think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all the car industry is strongly related to the petroleum industry , and they play such a strong role in the world 's economy ; i mean that there are too much interest of too much powerful people , so car must be used to sell fuel that mean petroleum . it is true that the worldwide transport communication have improved in the last year , a huge `` air traffic '' ha taken place especially from the ` ninety , furthermore high speed train have been created , even here in italy the government is about to creat a high speed line . and there are also other way of transport , for example ship , metro and bus . however in my opinion every man , every woman , prefer to move whenever they want and wherever they like without paying attention to reservate a ticket or arriving in time for the departure and whatever . and i am an example : i even can not immagine to stay without my car , i need it for my job , i need it for my holiday and i can take it whenever i want without make a reservation and i am never in late , i mean that my car is `` always waiting for me '' . as we well know petroleum is going to the end , the reserve of these resource , called black gold , are almost to the end , i do n't know who will be playing the economic rule the next 20 year , but let 's thimk about hydrogen . cars working with hydrogen already exsist , but it is too much early to replace petroleum with hydrogen , for the reason that i mentioned above . one thing is true : petrolemu will finish and so hydrogen working car may will take place , and if not hydrogen , another alternative type of carburant , but it is in my opnion that car will be much more than now
