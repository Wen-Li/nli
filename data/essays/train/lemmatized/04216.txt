i do agree with the statement , that advertisments make product seem much better than they truely are . but do the producer of the product really have another option ? these people want to sell their product a often and a efficient a possible , which of course is understandable because this is what they do for living and also our modern century offer possibility to make a product look perfect , such a tv or the world-wide-web . so why should n't they make their product look brilliant ? we all have experienced the following situation in one or the other way once in our life . imagine yourself coming home from a strenous day at work and all you want to do is relax with some good food in front of the tv . you switch the tv on , and there is a commercial about teeth whitening toothpaste and additional material . the commercial show a beautiful woman , which is now , after using the bleaching material once , even more successful in her carreer and private life since she ha bleached her teeth . throughout the entire commercial she is smiling and having a good time and so the person watching this scenario naturally want to indentify with her and want to get the life she ha . after buying the entire bleaching material that is offered in the drugstore around the corner and going trough the ritual of testing everything , you will soon find out that it doe not work out quite a well a it did with the woman on tv . so you do it over and over again , and than after a while you notice that whenever you eat something cold or extremely heatened your teeth start hurting . and there you have it . this is not what they tell you in the commercial . white bleached teeth and hurt go together . every dentist tell you that bleaching and exaggerated bleaching can and will harm your teeth . i think this story is perfect to show that a product at first sight might seem perfect to you . it concentrate on wish and play with desire you naturally have , for example , the wish to fit in a certain way of life , the desire of having a successful carreer and finding the love of your life . the product promise more than it can really give to you , so of course you are disappointed if you do not get , what it ha promised you before . so my conclusion is , look behind the advertisement and do not believe everything because the real word differs from human dream .
