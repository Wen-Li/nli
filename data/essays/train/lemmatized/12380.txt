an idea or a concept is a point of a view about a fact and different people may have different thought and use different method about the same topic . i believe it is equally important for student to understand idea and concept and to learn fact about a topic . to explain better , it can be said that the fact are like the target and the different idea and concept about that fact is like the different way going to the same target . for example one can say that the best way of melting the ice is by heating while the other can argue that putting the ice in the room temperature and wait till it melt is a better way . the two have different idea about melting ice and of course have reasonable explanation for their own method , but this doe not change the fact that the ice turn into water at the same temperature under same condition . i think , the student should first learn about the fact but it is an important for them to learn also how other people reach to those fact . to give an example , fact is like a car and the idea and concept are like how to use a car . one without the other ha no meaning , and both are necessasry to drive a car . consequently , to learn about the fact is crucial for the student but at the same time to learn about the other people 's point of view , their thought and their method is also an important part of their learning process .
