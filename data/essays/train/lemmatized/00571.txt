yes , i agree this statement . for nowadays the young people do n't give enough time to helping their community . say the truth , i think the young people do not care anything beside themselves . why i say that they do n't care anything beside themselves . for exapmle , we can see all the trash near our community and there are no one to pick it up . we can see the pinte on the wall . we can see there is no one to heip old people cross the stree . that make our community more and more cool in live . if we do more there can have more warm into . because they do not care so ther are more problem happened . like housband hite the wife and kid , old people died in ther own house for several day and young people stolen from the lady pack . all the young people only care where can go for play ? and go shopping . is that right ? in my opoion , i think we can do more for the community . like have a center for old people to go . and the center have more young people to care the old people . because lot of old people are very lonely . young people can give them more power in live . and young people can learn more experense from them . i 'm a young people . but i will spend more time to helping community . on the weekend i will go to the community center for a class . i teach piano to people for free . there are student , old people and the house wife . every time i finish my teaching i feel good . i know today i do the right think . there is more mean in my live . i believe that make young people spend more time to helping their community is good . that we call community education . that will make our socity better and teach how to care other people .
