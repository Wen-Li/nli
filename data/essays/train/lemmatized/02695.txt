is there fewer car in twenty year than there are today ? although there are many variable and uncertainty may affect the number of car , i agree with the statement . first , the airpollusion is geting more and more serious . in the last centry , the human being have made too many car . in some big city , the exhaust of car is the main reason to cause breath illness . the goverment also notice that , and it try to prevent the problem getting worse . one way is to reduce the number of car . besides , to drive in the rush hour in the city drive all driver crazy , and it is almost impossible to find a parking lot in the down town . the trafic problem in the city also attract people to go to work by taking public transportation , and give up their desire to own their car . the number and quality of public transportation are growing in most country , and i think it can replace the role of car in the twenty year . finally , the oil price now ha raised about three time a three year before . the pertroliem will be depleted someday , and people 's concern about the problem is reflected on the price now . so the cost to maintain the car is much higher than before . i believe under the presure of rapid growth of oil price , people will turms to other choice , such a bicycle and bus , and the the number of car will be reduced . all in all , i regard that almost all the varibles do not promote the increasing of car , and fewer car in the future can be expected .
