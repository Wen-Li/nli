new york city , 2026 . for a time-traveler from today , the city is hardly recognizable , for one main reason : car have almost disappeared . where are all the yellow cab , the traffic jam and the continuous flow of car ? instead , there are electrical bus , and a few fuel cell car , that only the richest can afford . is this assumption realistic ? in other word , will there be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today ? in order to answe this question , i will evaluate the different factor that play a role in this issue . as we all know , oil and natural gas resource are doomed to be over by 50 or 60 year . in the meantime , their price will continue rising a it already doe . this lead to assume that car are going to become a luxury that fewer people will afford , and hence that the number of car will decrease . furthermore , global warming is now being faced a a real issue for our planet , and fuel consumption by car largely contributes to it . some government are already raising tax on gas , in order to make people reduce their use of car . they also encourage public transport : 30 people in a bus represent a much smaller impact on environment than 30 people in their own car . however , oil price rise and global warming are also faced with a more innovative approach . technologies are being developed which will allow car to be cleaner for the environment . hybrid engine , cell fuel , electric engine , are probably what the future of car is made of . as soon a the price of these technology becomes effective and competitive compared to oil , we may expect a rise in the use of such car . the remaining question are mainly when this shift will happen , and whether the price of a car will be affordable . i think we may first expect an overall slow decrease of the number of car in the next thirty year , followed by a rebound . maybe by that time our behaviour will have changed , public transport will have spread widely , and the rebound will not occur so much . but owning a car is - and will always be - a pride and a feature of independence , which lead me to assume that car have a bright future .
