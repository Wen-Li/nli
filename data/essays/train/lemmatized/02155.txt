our world develops rapidly nowadays . cars , building and other thing around u change from time to time , some time for better and some time for wose , i think that in twenty year the world will have major change , especially in the transfomation technology . i agree on the fact that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . the car technology is impoving rapidly and each year we hear about more developed version of the car , however , nowadays people are concerned about the invironment and how car can affect it negatively . so , alogside the development , i think that car manifacturers will take this problem into account and think about creative way to prevent invironment problem and solve them , such a : pollution . in my prediction , i see the world in an optimistic eye twenty year from now , i think that car will be replaced by le harmfull transformation device , such a : a developed vesion of a bike or even skate . there is also a possiblity that car factory may create car with wing or small air-plains which will keep the car off the earth . another reason why i think that there will be fewer car in use , is the economy and the oil price . the demand on oil will increase which will make it 's price increase , the high proces of oil may make people think of other transportation device . plus , the oil resource may stop producing , because their is a possiblty that oil may finish in the future and car depend on oil in order to run . in conlusion , i tottaly agree on the fact that car in use will be fewer in twenty year , and i believe that it is an advantage for our world a well a our invironment .
