many people , mostly from older generation , fecklessly asserts that young people lack the virtue of self sacrifice and the will to make better community . however , i would like to point out that we can not even prove that time consumation of young generation ha declined nowadays if we look at the situation in several perspective . therefore , i do not agree nor disagree on the statement . firstly , there is a difficulty on actually measuring the time spent among young people for helping the community . we could gather some sampled data from public organization on participation of young people . however , the statistic could ignore some hidden contribution from them . maybe the younger generation got wiser and follow the virtue of humility which will make them to hide what they have done form making better society . even if we disregard the unseen contribution , and prove that the time consumation is declining , we should look at the environment the younger generation are facing today . the older generation did not have the notion of `` unlimited competition '' which the youngers are faced with . the young people could be splitting their precious and important time to community contribution while older people , when they were young , had much more free time to contribute . from these point , i would carefully disfute that the younger people are not contributing much of their time to the community .
