with the development of scientice and techonlogy , people pay more attention to the education . in today 's society , wether we should learn many subject or not ? some people think that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . i agree with this opinion because it can improve and extend prople 's knowledge and people should have many interesting subject to catch up with the development of society . but others do n't think so . the first reason can support my idea is that people acquire more knowledge from different subject . every body know that different subject have a few relationship . when you have trouble in one field , you can change your mind to use distinctive method from another field . if you do n't know other knowledge , you may give up the question or waste a lot of time to think about it . the second reason is that we should keep up with the development of society . nowadays , many employ need the compound person that have broad knowledge . when the employ fire some person that useless , they will fire the person that have learned one knowledge or skill but learned many skill . for example , if you can speak many kind of language , you will find the job better than person that can speak one language . that 's the different . otherwise , people that learned one subject have some benefit . such a , in conclusion , i think that people should learn many academic subject . because it can extend knowledgr and keep up with the development of society .
