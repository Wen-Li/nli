i do not agree with the statement that `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . i believe that the amount of car in the future will be the same if not larger than in the present day . by analyzing the past and comparing it to the present one can notice the increase of growth in car manufacturing . as time go by more and more car agency are being created throughout the world , therefore more car are being made . there are many type of brand of car that exist today such a jaguar , bmw , daewood , and others which did not exist 30 year ago . therefore i believe new agency will keep surging and the increase in car manufacturing and making will continue in the future . also by looking at the population growth in the world and taking into consideration that car are the number one use of transportation throughout the world , show that it 's demanding will always be present . the greater the population , the larger the amount of car that will be needed , and if the world 's population continues to increase then so will the amount of car . in the present day car are the most popular mean of transportation for the majority of the people around the world , and until this popularity is taken or replaced by any other mean of transportation , car will continue to be the greatest demand for people and therefore more will be purchased . overall i think that in the future the amount of car will either stay constant a the present day or will be greater due to the continued emerging of company which make car , the population growth , and the poularity of car . the demand for car around the world is too high nowadays to predict that there will be fewer one in the future .
