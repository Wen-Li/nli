` young people enjoy life more than older people do' to answer this question i would like to first illustrate what is enjoyment ? everybody ha different mode and way to enjoy life . or when can a person enjoy ? to enjoy everymoment in life one ha to be without tension and be confident about yourself . now if we compare between young and old people in term of the point given above . first one is `` tension '' ? normally old people have lot of tension like marriage of his daugther which is very common in indian society , then they have tension about their life after retirement ; whether child will take care or no etc . . now if we compare the same thing in the life of young people then we see that their tension are not so severe , they do have tension about career and other minor problem and even if the problem are severe they have the energy and confidence that they have more time to handle but old people have time constraint . it is true that young also ha time constraint but it is not prevalent since people believe to die old not young . it may be true that one can enjoy life being at home but one may get bored being at one place . young people have lot of option for enjoyment since they have lot of energy and enthusiasm to be adventrous so they can go anywhere like trekking , swimming , moving around in the town , flirtting etc . .. but old one have le choice since their age and energy level act a a major obstracle . even if they want to go somewhere they will not be allowed to go alone since they will be stopped by their child , daughter-in-law etc. and they need to have somebody with them and it may not be very practical since young people dont like going out with old people . i enjoy every moment of my life but when compared to my father and mother they do not since they are burdened with lot of tension . thus i truly believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do .
