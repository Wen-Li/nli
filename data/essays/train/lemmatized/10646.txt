the topic is yong people enjoy the life more than older people . i really support this statement due my experenceses by watching my life , my fater life and my grand fater life . the main reason for enjoyment is more young people is that age very fast age . it mean that young people is ourney any where easily . generally young people are more healthy than older people so they can eat any thing in this age and drinking is also doing everthing easily . the younger people are going to restrents and pub to drinking . they can not made any arrengements for it but older people made arrangement for going outside and other place . if they going to cold place they are face so many problem due to cold . the another reason for enjoyment in young people is they are working high a compared to older people . in present senreio the picture is young people dominet older people it mean that new creation domminated in experianence . young people enjoy thier work also than the older people . the young people are enjoying their life due to student life in college and ot having duty but older people having more duty than young peolple . student and newly married people are enjoying the life without having so much of duty but but the older people having risk of his life and his child life also . if any health problem occur in the older age it is difficult to retain good position but it is retain easiy for younfer people due body made of age . if any problem occurs in older age it is very difficult one to them . but some of the older people can also enjoy the life than older life because the young people generally life in city they are working with tension and traffic problem but so many old people are life in village or cityends they enjoy the life thier family and no tension
