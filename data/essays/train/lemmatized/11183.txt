by the improvement in the technology and the fun , the people began to seperate from each other and this caused the lost of the love . it can be easily seen in the young people . they are the common example in our life . and unfortunately , nowadays young people give le time to their community . as i told in the above that i believe that the main reason for this s'tuation is the improvement of the technology . with the technology you can insulate yourself from the real world or society . for instance when you take your place in front of the computer you can spend lot of hour in front of it without any bored , you can play game talk with people that you do not know or listen music , whatever you want . after the mobile phone invented the travelling decreased because many people can know eachother with talking on the phone . another reason for this is that the young people began to think only yourself not the others . for example , they go to party they are having lot of fun and they want to this all time they only want to have fun in their life every responsible thing becomes diffucult to them so that they do not want to do these thing . and it come from the technology . and there is a culture mixing in the world everyone want to be like the other one and so young people can loose their own idea or their own behaviour and the most important one is that they can lost themseves . in summary , the young people give le time to their community from some reason like the technology and the wiiling of having fun in their age . however , the ypoung pepole 's behaviour can change in the following year if the techonology decrease .
