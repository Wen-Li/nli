in my opinion , it is more important for student to understand idea and consepts than it is for them to learn fact . i have some reason to support my opinion . first reason is student can not learn fact if they do n't understand basic idea . for example , if student are studying about world war , they study why the war happened , how many country were in the war , what wa happened afrer the war and so on . then , student start learning the detail fact such a how did people live during the war , what kind of strategy did each country have . second , if student have understood idea and concept , they can easily guess more detailed fact . for instance , student can guess people were forced to join the war if student have knowledge what is war . to understand idea and concept can help student guess fact . also , it is easy for student to aim their goal if they understand idea and concept . if student make some robot , they need to build robot according to the manual say , how to build the robot . on the process of building the robot , student recognize some fact that the robot ' part are need to add some oil in order to let robot move more smoothly . like this example , student can build robot because they read the instruction . if studets follow the instruction , they will be aware of more information such a adding some oil . of course student can make robot without adding some oil , but their robot might move slowly or even be unable to walk . in conclusion , i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because : to learn fact , student must understand the idea ; student can guess fact if they understand the idea ; it is easy for student to aim the goal if they know the idea and concept . these three are the reason .
