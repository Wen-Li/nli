i totally agree with the idea that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well . many various example can illustrate the exactitude of this statement . first , the evolution of the medecine and of the new discovered remedy is perhaps the best example ever of this statement . over time , scientifists have made very important discovery . as a result , people can live longer and healthier than before . even though we have not found yet any remedy for aids , we have already made a lot of progress in the treatment of this horrible disease . another very illustrative example of this idea is the example of the chef in a very famous restaurant . if he want to keep his reputation and his client , he will have to try again and again new recepies . he can not keep the same menu for year and year . therefore , he ha to innovate and try new taste , new combination of aliment . this implies also to take some risk . indeed , the chef is never sure that the client will love the new kind of food he ha cooked . finally , the evolution of the plane is also very illustrative of this statement . years ago , people would not have imagine being able to fly one day . however , thanks to some brave pilot , we can now flight from one continent to another in a very short time . this amazing improvement in transportation would not have been possible without ambitious pilot and engineer . in conclusion , i really believe that we have to try new thing and take risk if we want to be successful . therefore , i want to find a creative job that allows me to try new experiment and to take risk . i am conviced that it is the best attitude to adopt if we want to improve our way of life .
