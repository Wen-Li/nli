advertisement ha been increasing a lot during the last 30 year . doest it work or is it just an illusion ? knowing how much money company are willing to put in advertisement i have to say it must work . now there is some more reasonable way of responding to the question . we coud talk about packaging fo instance . between to product that offer the same thing , that are at the same price , i would rather choose the best looking one . for me the product aspect reflects it real quality . in this case the true problem is comparison . i do n't think you make a product seem better than it really is , the point is making the product seem better a the other product ! i think this is really working . there is another way of advertising a product : getting the buyer to know the product before he even get to buy it : advertising in magazine , television . .. in my mind this may be more efficient because the buyer wo n't necessarily compare the product to the other one . he will just get in the store and search for that exact product because he ha been told it is the best . in this case it is true that advertisement is used to make the product seem better than it really is . now is it really working ? it depends on the price of the product . if you buy only once something really expensive you will really look into advertisement because you ca n't predict the quality of the product with previous one . now if it 's a cheap product that you buy every week , i think advertising ha no influence except the first time . in fact buying the same product lot of time ables you to compare the real quality of the product .
