i agree with this statement for these reason . first , most advertisement appeal an advantage of the product , hiding a disadvantage . let 's think about the advertisement of a medicine . most of them highlighted the effcet of the product . not even suggestiong the side-effect of the product . in particular , the medicine for a diet , which is popular in these day , too much focuse on how effectivly help people lose weight in a short time , not even considering side-effect of the product . if the advertisement of these product do not warn people about the side-effect , then people might get medicine too much than they should do , and cause a big problem . secondly , advertisement tend to attract a customer by changing a slogan or an image of product in purpose . the real product seem not to be different from the one in the picture , but if one closely look into the product , one might notice that the real product are slightly different whatever in color or size . this is one of the strategy of advertisment to sell more product , but it prevents the customer from judgiging the product correctly . in addition , studiest indicated that these little change using in the advertisement could have a big impact on the customer . third , people are likely to listen to someone who are widely admired . because of this fact , some advertisment appeal their product using the statement of the celebrity ; futhormore , these celebrity appear in the newspaper or tv show to advertise the product . this make people entirely rely on the statesment of the celebrites , and purchase the product without deep consideration . advertisement is useful sometimes because it provides useful information about the product to customer . but it could fool customer in order to make product seem much better than they really are by exaggerating the advantage of product or using some tricky way to advertise the product .
