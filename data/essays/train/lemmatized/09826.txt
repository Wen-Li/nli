in the last twenty year we are complitely driven by the power of the economy . it is for this reason that it is not really important the quality of a product but it is important the message that that product give . it often appens that we become complitely blind when we are buyng something . infact we buy some product only because we have seen it on television even if we really do not need it . i can say that because it also appen to me . two day ago watching the television i decided to buy a porticular product usefull for making sport because it help you to get back your energy after the phisical effort . i play basket with my friend during the weekend , fir of all during the saturday afternoon and we play for four or five hour long . that is way i need that product but i bought it even if i did not know what it wa composed of . i thing that this sistm is very dangerous because the product control are not accurate ant the final consumer is always the one who risk . today it is not imprtant what do we buy but it is only important the economy developing . i think that in order to eliminate this problem we should pay more attention on the control that the government shold do when allow anvertisement to do damn . now i also remember that last year , during the winter holiday , i went with to the market of my town whit my mother and there wa a lot of people in front of a shop because they all wanted to buy a particoular cristmas food . we also bought it just because we watchd an advertisemet , thinking that it wa good . however when we came home we took it for dinner but it wa disgusting . the problem wa that we should have test it before .
