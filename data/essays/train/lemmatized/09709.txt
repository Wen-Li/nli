in tweety year , there will be fewers car in use than there are today . in order to explain this topic , we can show that this is a controversary point , depend on which condition you look at this situtation . first of all , it 's easy to think that the automobile industry is growing up very quickly , and there is more and more car on the road . this certainly du to the increasing of the price of the train and plan ticket this last ten year . but , you can tell , that ingenior in the industry try to change this problem , not by trying to reduce the car industry , but by trying to find a new way not to polute the planet , like by biocarburant . furtheremore , it 's nearly impossible to avoid people to use their car , like for working people , or people living far away . and in addition , today , having a car , is also to be part of the social world , to be autonom . however , you can also tell that the future of car is not clear . when you see the fast evolution of all the other way to be drived . furthermore , lot of people prefere public transport a a cheaper way to go to work , and gouvernments understood this and is developping this , like in hong kong , where you can do everything without anycar , or in london , where the city doe n't allowed any car . or even in strasbourg were the french gouvernement make cheaper ticket in order to encourage people to let their car at home . in addition , we can not planned clearly in which way the world will evolute . if you take a an example developped country , because it 's the one who will be more affected by this matter , you can already tell how they already try to developpe other way to move in and outside of their country . take a an example , the train developement and the decrease of the price in some compagny helped by gouvernment . in order to conclude about the evolution of the number of car in use in the road in tweenty year , in my opinion , i can say i agree with the fact there will be more and more car on the road , this due to the evolution of the population . but with the news technology , the bad effect of this in the environment and a a bigger scale in the planet , can be reduce , which is a good point , and a a matter of fact that the petrol ressources in the world became really rare , which can be a real turn in the car industry , i hope in the good way .
