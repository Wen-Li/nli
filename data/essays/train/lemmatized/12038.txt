event though it is really important to understand idea and concept because they represent the basis of knowledge , i disagree with the statement because i think that learning the fact is a much important , a well . i have several reason for my statement . first , i think that the fact enables student to understand a concept , because it is more concrete , it is a kind of illustration in a lesson . for instance for concept in science , such a chemistry , it is not possible to understand a concept without experimenting a fact that illustrates the concept . the concept of status modification for solid , liquid or gaz can only be assimilated when we have learnt that water evaporates at 100 degree and is frozen at 0 degree . secondly , student remember easier the fact than the concept , because it is more interesting and le academic for him . for example , during field trip , student have good memory of their trip because they considered it a an entertainment even if the purpose of the trip wa to teach an academic lesson . afterwards , student would remain the concept because they would remain the trip and what they have seen during it . finally , it is more practical and efficient to learn fact than learn idea . ideas and concept are abstract notion that are difficult to learn and to represent in the mind . because they are very exhaustive in book , it is difficult to learn and to understand it without fact . if we take the example of child that learn idea and concept all the time at school , we notice that they know their lesson appropriately but finally they do not really understand what they have been learnt in class . so in my opinion , the best way to study is to learn fact a much a understand the idea because they depend on each other .
