i am totally agree . in elementary school teacher show an old way to learn about everything , specially area of study like history , literature , geography , philosophie or civism ha taken by student like a bunch of name , date and fact that they have to memorize . nowdays i figured out that memorize fact is not the best way to understand . in graduate school i had the oportunitie of take a lot of understandable class that i can still remember . the best way to learn and understand at the same time is doing more than one reading , consult more than one book or one opinion about something so you can have more than one point of view . for example , if i have to investigate about modern architecture may be i can talk about la ville savoye of le corbusier in poissy , france , 1929 . but the only thing i am doing there is taking some information that already exist and writing it down in my paper . that is just a transcription . but in stead of that if i try to understand the philosophical fundament of the modern movement , the reason of le corbusier that made him design a diferent kind of building ( never seem untill that year ) and explain the origin and reason of this architecture i will surely explain to everybody , including mysefl the result of my investigation making not just remember it but know the who , when , and most important of al , the why . so i definitly think it is more important for student ( and for life if you think a little more about it ) to understand idea and concept . it is known that a good student is the one who can explain himself all kind of concept that the one who just ha memorized a lot of information that ast least it worthless .
