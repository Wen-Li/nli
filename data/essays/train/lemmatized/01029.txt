some people think that in twenty year there will be fewer car in the use than there are in today and some diagree . whatever , there is many factor the show u the way how number car will increase or decrease . in my opinion , i think that 's trurly not because a we see nowdays the number of car are growing up fastly because of the number of people . in china the number of people is more than 1 billion person is there , and in india the number of people will grow up and become more than china in fewe year . this crowed of people will increase the number of car . other thing , if we take that last twenty year we can determind that the number of car that the country they asked were increased due to people . what is more , the number of car that is produced is become more and more and the company will not stop producing because of the custemers demand . as we see the traffic jam now day are increasing and they are going to be more and more . as we see the number of studing who learn how to drive a car are increasing in all country and the school will need more car to teach these student . in addintion to that , the veraity of car are more and more , if you want a four wheel drive you can choice a car from a plenty of car in one company . how about the aother company do they have the same ? yes ofcourse they have many type of car for of road for in road even the interior accessory . these factor say 's that the number of car will increase without stoping one day , so the world become more croweded and number of car will be infinity .
