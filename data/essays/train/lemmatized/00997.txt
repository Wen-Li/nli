i totally agree with the given statement . ideas and concept are associated with the thinker and innovator . whereas learning fact is associated with the follower . the understanding of an idea or concept give student the ability to innovate , and to develop their ability to deal with different circumstance and problem . merely memorizing fact will simply let the student know of a particular solution , but would not empower him/her to develop new solution . let u take the example of classical physic . there are several equation and several form of equation . however , these numerous equation are derived from certain core concept of principle . once these principle are understood , any equation can be derived . but the understanding of these concept is extremely important to master trhe subject . this doe not only hold true in the case of science / technology area . understanding the concept is critical to all area of study . for example , a management student refers to several case study . but the intention for this is not to merely note the action taken by earlier manager to deal with problem and to keep a record of the same . the intention is to analyse and think of possible solution and to understand how the particular decision wa taken . this approach would give future manager capability to come up with innovative solution . today , we have so many electronic gadget to manage data . do we wish to turn our brain into another data storage warehouse ? our brain can do something that not even the fastest computer can . that is to innovate , to think , and to get idea . let u not waste it by encouraging student to give importance to merely learning fact . i am not averse to the idea of learning fact . it is important . knowing the fact enable u to speak confidently about a particular topic . however , knowing the concept behind those fact is what will lead you to innovate new fact !
