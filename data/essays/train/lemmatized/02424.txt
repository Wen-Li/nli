people born , live , and die . this is the typical cycle of human life . in this cycle the people choose the way of their life individually . some people prefers an enjoyful life , such a entertaining , travelling doing thing they enjoyed , while the others prefer working for their future . but it should't be understood that people who are working do n't enjoy the life . from this phenomenia the topic come to the question of how can people enjoy life and who can enjoy life more . in the answer of this question generally it is encountered the statement of young people enjoy life more than older people do . this statement make a categorization of people by their age . but i do n't agree with this statement . it is right that young people have more physical ability to the older people . but it should n't be understood that only the physical ability are enough to enjoy life . young people ha more physical ability , but their decision ability are n't grown up enough to make always the right decision on the situation they encountered . for this reason they can fail while they are trying to enjoy . it is also generally thought that older people are working and do n't have enough time to make different thing which would be enjoyful . but it should also be considered that working on the job which is your ideal would be the most enjoyful activity for you . working , improving or inventing new device , generating new idea , dealing with your own interest also can make your life enjoyful . finally , my last opinion on this statement is that the life would be enjoyful if you are on the way of your preference . if you are doing the thing in your dream , and on the place where you wanted to be the lifge would be enjoyful for you . so , from that time the age doe n't affect your consideration about the life .
