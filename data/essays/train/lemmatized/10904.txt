before presenting my point of view , i think it is necessary for me to examine the question carefully . which one is more important , learn the particular fact or acquired the concept and general principle . it is a matter of balancing the pro and con of these methos , the decision , therefore , is not easy to make . in my opinion , idea and principle concept are more important . the first and foremost reason in support of my positon is that it is impossible for u to learn every fact during our limited lifetime . take mathematics a an example , we could not do all the measue the three lenth of every triangle and it is easy to make some mistake . however , we could just calculate the length precisely and quickly by using the principle . another compelling fact in favor of my position is that fact are often to specific and not conviencing and we learn little from particular fact . a striking example is that many fever could be healed by keli . although in some clinical case it would result in some side effect , we could not deny that it is not a good medicine just by observe such a specific `` fact '' . i cite this extreme example merely in an attempt to demonstrate that we would make false decision by observing some specific fact . i can not deny that fact is important some time , for instance , in study history . historist must use numerous fact and evidence to prove their theory . this alone lend no strong support to undermine what i have substantiated . from the discussion mentioned above , i can finally draw a conclusition that it is more important for student to understand idea . it make u solve problem more effectively and make right decision . i just could not imagine how could we do our work if the know no fundamental concept .
