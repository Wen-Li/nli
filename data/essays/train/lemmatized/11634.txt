in my opinion , the given statement is right on the one hand , but it is not able to be used to every specific subject on the other . classes of different subject have always been different and will always require different strategy to handle the material which is taught in them . for those subject who tend to be in the technical and scientific area , understanding the main way of working is far more important than any detail . in general , understanding the fact of how something , e.g. a motor of an entire power plant work is more important than learning and knowing any single detail without really knowing what purpose they are for . in my opinion , especially scientific subject like chemistry or biology and technical subject like engineering will get along wonderfully with that statement . for those kind of student , it ha to be important to understand the function of technique they are confronted with while attending their class , omitting minor detail ( which are often omitted by professor and teacher themselves ) . after university , being confronted with your job , there is no use for those who learned by heart any single detail of a machine they are confronted with now , but not knowing the way this particular machine work in general . in addition to that , minor detail are also often described right on the machine , but their general way of working is not and should have been understood earlier . moreover , i think idea and concept are were and still are the basement for development and research . with monotonously learning and repeating fact , it is far more difficult to understand and without knowing about the core concept , there is no possibility for progress and new development , e.g. in the medicine and biochemistry . but nevertheless , understanding the concept is not always the one way to success . being very helpful in technical subject , i still think that you should not use this method in subject like history . in these specific class , detailed fact of our past are equal in importance a understanding the concept , e.g. the concept of communism invented by lenin . to put it in a nutshell , i am convinced that the given statement , which is to concentrate on an idea than to the fact , can be very useful for everything concerning development and technique , but it should not be used to those class that deal with the past . in these particular subject , you should spend half the time for the idea and the other half for the fact .
