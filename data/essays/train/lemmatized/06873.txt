broad knowledge of many subject in comparision to one specialization on one specific subject . there is a famous saying that `` knowledge once gained is gained forever '' . academics play a important role in one life it prepares a base for a person to reach a highest point of attainment of knowledge , but a with just a mere knowledge about anything we cant get the success so therefore specialization is needed . today world is greatly moving forward going for new advance in every aspect of life either it may be in term of health , engineering , agriculture , pharmacy , commerece , management etc or any field . every day advance are coming in every field , this change in society can be through change in field of research and technology . the scientist , engineer who are experimenting new technique is through specialization in one single stream . if a person do not get specialised in `` it would be like jack of all and master of none '' , but this it is also important that a person can lead to final assesment through collecting all the evidence for every single conclusion a approach to other field is also desirable so basic knowledge of other subject is very necessary to reach the result . knowledge is a process of continous learning , it requires lot o skill to learn knowlegde same a during schooling it is necessary to study all subject a it interact u with worldly important thing and later on when we move to subject of our choice we move to particular stream we gain knowledge about every basic aspect about it later on we reach to specialised subject . the concept is same a child when he come to this world he need to take small step first to learn to run in future . so at the end i would i like to say thatbroad knowledge of many academic subject is essential but to reach a hard core research or invention specialisation is compulsory .
