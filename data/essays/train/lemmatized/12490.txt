i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . there are two reason . first , young people nowadays tend to be raised to be more self-centered in capitalistic place . they are being told , either directly or indirectly , that fulfilling personal desire or achieving personal gain is more important than helping community . in capitalistic place , people emphasize more about their personal ability and achievement rather than their sense of devotion and caring to a larger group other than their company . although our school system and community try to send out the opposite message , individual competition and the collapse of the sense of cooperation are on the winning side . second , young people today are raised to be more spoiled . they get what they want eaiser . they are more indulged in their personal comfort and pleasure . many of them may consider helping community a waste of time . they may think , `` what would helping community do me any good ? that wo n't necessarily make my report card or resume look good . who care about community service certicates ? besides , i will get more fun to hang around in a mall and eat ice cream with my friend ! '' in my opinion , the most inner reason that they see no point of helping their community is because they are not used to helping and giving , but more to receiving . nowadays , parent who raise child tend to ask le but give more and more easily . when people start to raise fewer child , they make their only or few child the queen and king of the family . modern parent ' indulgence creates more selfish and indifferent child , which is harmful to our community and society .
