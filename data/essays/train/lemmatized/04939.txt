today it is very difficult to invent new thing or find new way to be succesful . but what is the best way to be successful ? should you take risk ? and for which person it is easier to take risk ? in my opinion it is not easy for an unsuccessful person to take a risk . becauso there must by any reason because this person is unsuccessful . so perhaps an unsuccessful person already took some risk which were not successful . so they are in a kind afraid of taking new risk . if the new idea is wrong they will lost again . and this is different at successful people . they have a lot of success and for them it is no problem to take risk . they are not afraid . if the risk wa wrong there is a base under them and nearly nothing could happen to them . but one reason why successful people are successful is that they take risk . for this i will give an example . you have to imagine you are the ceo at a big company and at the moment the number one with your product in the world . but there are several smaller company which are coming closer and closer . one day a customer want you to create a new product , but with your machine this is not possible to take the order . the customer sais that he will go to the other company if you do not built or create the necessary machienes . taking the order will cost a lot of money and the success is not sure . what would you do ? i think it is much easier to take the order for a company with very much success . they know they can take risk because if the order will not be good it will not be all over . it is different for a ceo who 's company doe not work right . on the one hand the company need the order but on the other hand it is the end of the company if the order will not be successful . another reason is that successful people always want more . so they do not think about a much a unsuccessful people . so i think it is easier to take risk if you are a successful pearson .
