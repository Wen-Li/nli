we learn a lot of knowledge from school . teachers usually teach u to understand idea and concpets from book . we usually learn fact after we face it or after we get experience . i disagress this statement . i think that learn fact is more practical than understand idea after we have job . i believe that learning fact is very practical and it will help u in the future . we usually learn concept from book . we rarely learn fact from book . so most people learn fact after they have a job . somtimes , people do n't understand fact , so they get into the trobules . here is an example , i have a friend . she just graduated from school last year . she used to work in a restaurant . after three month , she told me that the fact are very different from idea and concept . she could n't realize why everything is different from book at begun . moreover , she had a lot agreement with her bos , and she got into trouble . she felt unhappy everyday . therefore , she quti this job . in conslusion , i believe that learning fact is more important than understand the idea and concept . i think that if my friend could learn fact in school or from book , she might not got into trouble and lost job . in short , learning fact is more important .
