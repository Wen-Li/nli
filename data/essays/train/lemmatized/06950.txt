carnot , a very famous french physician wrote three law , one of wich i could translate this way : `` with time you gain in organisation what you lost in energy '' . he wa speaking of fundamental physic , but i think that this could be applied to human being . when you are young , you are filled with energy and you intend to do or try everything , travelling around the world , practising extreme sport , a we say in french , burning the candle by both end . but do we enjoy life more than old people ? answering this question is quite difficult for me , a i still have n't tried being an old man - it will come soon enought . but however , i think that you can enjoy your life , young or old , no matter your age . each age ha it own pleasure : when you 're young they may be a bit more intense or demanding , but when you 're old , i suppose pleasure are more wise and simple . moreover , a time go by , you can enjoy - maybe - your child , and grand child . that 's a real advantage ! joy come from simple event : the visit of your family , a good meal all together , etc . on the other hand , you may have hard time when aging : disease , loosing memory , etc . that 's the big advantage of being young : generally , you 're more fit , and moving around , doing sport is not a difficulty . but being busy all the day is not allways enjoying life : you can have multiple activity and spend most of your time unhappy about everything . to conclude , i would say that if enjoying life is having a full life , then young people enjoy life more than older do , but , if enjoying life is just being happy and taking care of yourself and other , then there 's no age for enjoying everyday 's life . ..
