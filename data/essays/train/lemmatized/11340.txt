the demand for car is rapidly increasing . but in twenty year time , i think there will be fewer car in use than today . i agree with the idea that the car number will increase in twenty year , and hasve some reason for agreing . first , the fossil oil based energy source are dicreasing . it is getting expensive and unefficent to use those resource for the energy supply of transportation . electricity , nuclear energy source , solar energy and even hydrogen is in consideration for replacing the fossil oil usage . there is also another reason for this replacement which is the air polution that is caused by the fossil oil usage . in order to reduce the polution government are limiting the gasoline type and quality used in car . that also rise the price . not only the fossil oil reserve but also the iron , steel and other metal reserve are forcing u to use our resource more carefuly and more logical for our future . we should understand that these natural resource are limited . considering the population growth , and the size the big city 's reach , it is possible to understand the need of a special way of transportation : public transport . the trafic jam , the time consume ride are causing caos , trafic accident , polution in the city . because of these result of personal transportation solution , annual expenditure of the economy are increasing constantly . this is not a weight every economy could handle . i think the public transportain , especially the rail usage ha to increase to handle these problem . fossil oil energy source could be used more efficiently and harmless in different area of the industry . more enviorement friendly and economic solution ha to be found and used for transportatin problem . the car company are working on the alternative energy usage for the future to substain their company . some big company buy the other company to reduce the competition and some others have merged . this could be analyze to understand the sector 's future characteristic . i think the shrinking market condition force car company to fight harder to survive . with all these sign , i think in twenty year there will be le car in use than today .
