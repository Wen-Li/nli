i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . although i agree with this , i think there is a difference of the meaning of `` enjoy '' between young people and older people . at any time , we have a large generation gap between young and older people . and i think nowadays that gap is increasing more and more . i want to show the example of the conversation between my mother and i , when we were watching `` gohst in the sell '' , which is japanese tv animation about the future world that people live with robot . in the story , almost all people have a computer brain in thier head instead of real brain , and they can process the information or the data that they see through thier eye , like a computer now we are using . in that world `` ture human '' which are like u , are decreasing . even they have a real brain in thier head , which is just tiny part of it for living . after watching this animation , i excited about the concept of the sotry . for me the computer is a really familiar thing . everyday i use my computer for the assignment which are given by my high school teacher . also i stoarge my favorite picture , music , and movie in my computer . so when i watch `` gohst in the sell '' i even thought that i want the computer brain in my head ! but my mother wa defferent . firstly she could't understand any concept about this story . she could't understant why the computer brain in people 's brain , why they are not robot and so on . finally she said `` it is so boring . '' in truth , there are lot of dificult word about computer system , and also confusing time passege wa in the story . but i really suprised at the fact that she did n't enjoy the story . and i realised that what i enjoy is not always what my mother enjoys . the meaning of `` enjoy '' is different between young people and older people . however a i said above , these day , technology is everyday improving . new thing such a computer are sometimes difficult for older people . but i know that there are many way of enjoying life . i understand that everyone enjoy thier own life very much .
