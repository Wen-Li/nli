i agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . to tell the truth , to say `` the best way '' is very difficult for me . because to travel in group , and to travel in alone or a few companion , both have advantage and disadvantage . actually , when i wa student , i looked down on group travel with a guide . i visited many country with my best friend by ourselves , we had really great experience . to make a itinerary , to write a reservation form in english or the other oreign language , to enjoy talking with local people in some foreign language with dictionary , to try ethnic food . .. and so on . but , some museum did n't have an explanetion in english !! consequentry , we did n't understand the exposition at all . we had many cultural and histrical question about this country , but we could n't get an answer . the guidebook wa n't enough for that . on the contrary , group tour with a guide is very different . when i participated in group tour , i wa really impressed in the knowledge of a tour guide . she ha a long - experience of a tour giuge , and her talk of the country wa wonderful . sometimes i cried when i heard the historical story of the country . still now , about the country i visited with group , i have much information . but in group tour , we ca n't comunicate with the local people , ca n't choose the hotel . it is a disadvantage of group trip . anyway , the group tour is n't bad than we thought . especially for people who want to know about the country .
