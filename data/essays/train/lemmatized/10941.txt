`` successful people try to new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , i agree with this statement because that the person can not get success without doing new thing . if he do the same thing that already done there is no anything special between the others and the successfull person . i strongly agrre with this statement . example in our country there is one successfull person in the bussiness that he created many revolution in the bussiness system . he is the one of the gretest person 's in our country . he use to do the new thing istead of doing the same thing . he started with small firm and developed many type of product , he wa not satisfied with the bussiness with the same product he strated many type of bussiness in different feilds and established a big group of company . he is very successful person in that feild eventhough he wa ot satisfied with that . he use to invent new one and start that firm , with that capability he started many small product and became a successfull person . he started many firm in all feilds like in the feild cell phone , petro chemical , cotton firm and finance group and got success . he is not satisfied with that same bussiness he want to invent somany thing mean the new thing by that he became a successful person . he also took somany risk to get succeed . i conclude that it is correct statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well '' . by using the above example i can state that the person should have gut to start the bussiness in other feild rather than in the same feild he known well , it is also a risk to do new thing but eventhough they know it is risk they use to do the new thing that is the successfull person 's secret to success in life .
