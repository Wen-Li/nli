i agree with the stament that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' , for the following reason : first af all , learning is not a steady situation , learning is a dynamic process , and to be successful you never stop learning , and in this process you gain experience , and maintaining working the brain with new challenge is the best work out to became successful , trying new thing and taking risk is a kind of learning . second , if you knew more , then you are better prepared , furthermore you can apply your vast knowledge to your every day activity , and this allows you to go with new idea and improve what you use to do , and also solve problem more easily than the people who do n't like to think . third , take risk is also a great tool in the learning process , and it drive you to be better in life , because if you do n't take risk is like you are not doing anything , and if you do not anithing you may not make mistake , and another way to learn is from your mistake , and also this is a dynamic process which allows you to improve your life and became successful . fourth , people who just do the thing that they already know how to do well is because they lack of imagination , and they look like robot , following mechanically what they have learned . fith , active and smart people always are trying to do differents thing , and their personality most of the time show confidenty in what they are doing , more over it is contageous in the positive way . for all those reason explained above i think that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well .
