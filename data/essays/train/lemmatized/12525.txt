some say that specializing in one specific subject is valuable for japanese university student . however , i found more advantage that having broad knowledge of many academic subject for japanese university student . there are three advantage to support to have many different type of academic subject . one reason for my belief is that comparing some subject are important to study the academic subject . one example of this is that because i am taking international politics at my university , it is much better for me to know different subject such a ecomics , business and history in order to understand international politics . it becomes me link with other field to get better understanding for my study . another reason is that it is possible for university student to meet various people who have different background . if the student could meet each other with various knowledge and experience , they can absorb new idea and broaden our perspective . in specific term , i can consider that i met a student who is studying indian politics and a student who is studying chinese politics through studying international politics . because of different backgrouds , we shared cultural difference and exchanged a lot of information . final reason is that having many opportunity to get a job . for instance , if the student only know one subject , it is difficult to choose many field of job . on the other hand , if the student have many academic subject , it is helpful to choose some field of job . moreover , it is used in practical flexibly . actually , i got a job a an account in japan . i will paln to change my job to be an worker of united nations . considering all of the above factor , comparing different subject , meeting new people and getting a job are advantageous to choose many academic subject . thanks to globalization , having many different academic subject will be much more vital for studnets to understand international issue .
