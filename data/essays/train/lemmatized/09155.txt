i agree that there will be fewer car in the near future , because current technological and scientific development prove to alleviate man 's desire and need of mobility by driving . other mean of transportation have come to be used much frequently over the last 10 year due to the fact that they cost much lesser than they used to . flying , instate and out of state , is more common and practical by all mean . besides , when i consider the urgency of fuel in each individual vehical , i can not help but think that the earth 's reserve should not last long enough to support such spenditure . although plane run on fuel , they carry much more people at a single occasion . just a mean of transportation have developed , our habbits of communication have also changed and we have become more mobile , meaning more accessible , so that we do not have to drive to those place where we are expected . our daily job are mostly handeled from our desk ; over the internet , or on phone . the unstoppable growth of mobile phone technology enables u to be at multiple station at the same time . we can drive while we are ordering pizza over the phone and keep a client on hold on the car phone . as far a technology go , perhaps , we will not even need feul-oil car in the 20 year to come . the most recent technology pormises to developed more profound model of solar car , or hydra automobile . world 's leading environmental foundation support , both financially and ideologically , that more investment should be bestowed upon technological improvement so that alternative mode of transportation can be attained . i strongly believe that the world may turn out to be a le polluted and peacefull abode afterall . 20 year may not be a lot of time considering the historical development of people ; yet , a lot can be achieved in such a duration if the drive and the motif are right . less fuel consumption , lesser car , and car accident for that matter , may be a few motif for starter .
