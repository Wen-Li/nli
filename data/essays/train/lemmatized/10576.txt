i agree with this statement . here is my explanation why and how i beleive so . successful people do not quantify their success by where they currently are in their life . they constantly strive to acheive more than what is normally possible . they have a desire to constantly excel and acheive a higher level at anything they do . once the next level is reached that doe not satisfy them , they continue to charge along to the next possible level . often time this involves taking risk in situation that ha never been either tried or known . these individually have a special knack of pushing the bar to the next level and changing ` status quo ' . this doe not mean they do not fail but they do not take failure to be the end . they are quick learner and are able to adapt and identify new way to approach a tough problem . one key characterisitc of a successful person is that they are innovator . there are world-wide example of innovator like thomas edison , bill gates etc . they are never afraids to venture in to the unknown or take risk . and because they do so they are often goal-driven and do not give up until they get to a solution . this allows them to develop and test new concept by mastering the well known one . they understand the difference between doing thing well versus exceptional . their ` out of the box ' idea provides them the opportunity to create solution that others would not think of . but it is not just the thought of great idea , it 's their ability to work dilegently and having the tenacity to survive all odds to execute on those idea that help them produce result . this is what differentiates them from others . successful people do not think their current place in life defines their future . they know being successful in life mean staying in the game , never giving-up and treating it a a marathon not a race !
