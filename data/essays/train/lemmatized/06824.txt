i very much agree with the statement . research , development and innovation are certainly the key to success in modern and developed economy . it seems to me quite obvious that people who dare to take risk and try new thing are successful people . if nobody try to risk the economy will never be competitive . however , i would add that , once you take a chance and dare to risk you must prove that you are actually capable of keeping that success . in other word , trying new thing and taking risk will only make you successful if learn how to run well your new business . we live in a world which is becoming more and more a global village and the new economy like china , india , taiwan and south korea are becoming more and more competitive compared to the country of the so called developed world . developing country can produce what we can already produce with very low wage , which is why we have to compete with them in term of innovation and new thing . in order to be successful you have to do something well but you can not just do that . i will make an exemple to make my position clearer : milano , the city where i live in , is famous all over the world for the fashion and furniture industry . clothes and furniture are very easy to copy , so if we want to compete and keep a leading position in these sector we have to add some extra that can not be found in product made elsewhere . it may sound strange but innovation and research can be found and have to be extended to fashion and design industry a well . the point is that the success that italian product have all over the world is mostly due to the fact that we can do some thing well and better than others , and we have to keep this leadership . this make me think that keeping on doing well what you already can do is a important a trying new thing . as usual , both aspect are important .
