i could imagine that this statement might become true . several reason lead me to this conclusion . first , in the future job in agriculture will be replaced by more technology . as a consequence the people will move into town . there are tram , subway and bus , so a car is no longer needed . second , in future time will be ( hopefully ) more conservation . people will try to reduce emission , so they will share bus and will use train . i could imagine that globalization will contribute to a reduction of car , too . a better connection of city , country and continent will be neccessary . more flight , for example , will exist . because i live in germany , let 's look at my country . if i live in berlin and have to work in munich , i have the choice to go by train , plane or car . the advantage of the car is that there is no specific time when i have to start from berlin , i can decide on my own . today , the plane and the train have fix time of departure . the disadvantage of the car is the long traveling time . but imagine , in the future more and more people have to travel between berlin and munich because of the globalization . much more train and plane will be . then there will no longer be the question `` will i go by plane/train or by car ? '' because it simply take too long . as you can see , here the car is replaced , too . another reason for fewer car might be a raise of working time . in the future people propably have to work more than today , so they will have le leisure time . a a result they will have le time to drive out of the city to see the nature , for example . a car is not neccessary any more , because in town they will , a already mentioned , have train and bus . in conclusion i can say that i can imagine very well that there will be fewer car in use in future and i really do hope so because then there would be le emission which contibute to the depletion of the ozon layer .
