young people clearly do not help their community a much a they once did . but their change is mostly due to the change of the whole world and the society we live in . the last century ha seen many technological revolution such a television and computer and a consequent change wa more than expectable . now that study are getting so long for young the free time they could potentially spend for their community ha been drastically reduced . big city that have been growing all over the world lately have also somehow reduced young activity in a comunity so big that sometimes does't make them feel at home . now that the world is accessible to anyone and the young travel everywhere they loose the sense of home that someone that ha always lived in only one village could feel . that 's why who life in small city knowing everyone inside them and staying there for their whole life ha a much bigger sense of belonging at his town and is much more keen to help out anyone . but that is not the only reason . something that play a major part is the education people get from school and most of all from their family . the new family model in the occidental world complitely degraded . almost half of the over 30 year old people ha been divorce at least once . their support to the child can only be drastically worse than it once wa . people who grow in a solid family close to their brother , their parent but also to their grand-parents and their old traditional value will without any doubt stay closer to their community . i 've personally got a lot of doubt about how this new condition can improve . i think a moral change is almost impossible and people will have to adapt . and yet family more reasonable are probably the clue to make a difference .
