i agree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept then it is for them to learn fact . in a student age it is very much essential to get a idea and concept on the subject before learning fact . for example math is a subject where we shoud have an idea and the concept ie logical thinking of how we should do the problem . if we dont have concept of how to do addition then how can we proceed furrter . concept is like a root to devolop furter . when a student can understand about the idea and about the concept it is very much easy to learn about the fact . the student if he start understanding the concept and idea he can never forget the thing . witout a concept studying is simply muging up . when the student start understanding about the idea and the concept of a subject it is very much easy for him to learn . at the student age only our main idea and the concept start . if a student is learning anything without a concept is something like root without a stem . whenever we want do something we shoud have an idea of what to do in a similar manner whenever a student is studying or doing any practical he shoud have an idea of wat to do and concept of it and then think about the fact . many student loose the oppurtunities because of lack of devoloping idea , and lack of concept in the subject . i feel if we have an idea and concept on the subject it is very much easy to learn . secret of success of many student because of there conceputial way of studying . i conclude that it is important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact .
