in our society , we have a lot of family which have more than two car , whereas only one car can be driven at each time . in addition the oil is more and more expensive and to drive a car might become a luxury . that is why we can wonder if in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . first i will show why there will have always more and more car in use . second i will explain why i think that there will have le car in use per family . first i think that in the world , there will have always more and more car . nowadays there still have a lot of poor country . but some of them will become reacher . for instance china and india are country which have each one billion of inhabitant . and a they have a quick growth of their standard of living , that is why in few year many family which have no car will buy one . but if i am sure that there will have more and more car in the world , i am convinced that there will have le car own by one family . indeed if the price of oil carry on increasing ( it is quite sure that it will carry on increasing because oil becomes more and more rare and difficult to exploit ) and if ingeneers do not find a new technology to replace oil ( for example electricity or hydrogen ) , it would affect the budget of a family and people would prefer riding a bike or taking bus to go to their work rather than using their car . in addition more and more people want to preserve the envronment and that is why there will have more and more people who will take the bus to go to work . to conclude i can say that , even if the price will be probably very high in twenty year , it is quite obvious that the development of country like china or india will be responsible for the increasing of the number of car all around the world . but it is quite obvious too that , if we do not discover anothers technology , the number of car in a family will decrease because of the negative impact , of the price of the oil , on the budget of family .
