i do not agree with this statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in fact , i believe that these day young people feel more responsible towards their community and try to contribute towards them . these day , because of the advent of faster and better mean of communication and transport , young people stay well connected with the world around . by mean of tv channel , internet etc , young people are more informed about whats happening in their community . this awareness , ha also made them more responsible . for example , whenever some accident or a catastrophe occures somewhere then the news is spread very fast because of the faster mean of communication . and one can see that there are several young people who willingly provide help in such situation . they provide service to the hospital , are ready to donate blood and what not . clearly enough , in this case they are contributing a lot to their community . the current young generation ha grown in an atmosphere which is more free and liberal than ever before . they have always experienced this freedom of choosing what they want to do . and so they also choose the kind of community which they want to belong to and also in what way they want to connect to their community . obviously when a work is done by free will and not by force , it is done more willingly and in a more inspired way . so in this case since whatever the young people do for their community is done out of free will and not by force , so they do it in a more inspired and dedicated way . and hence they spend more time helping out their communties . for example , these day young people have opened up different kind of community center or group for helping their community or society in different way , for example center for animal right , center for education for the poor and so on . all these group or center are made out of interest and motivation , and so the young people who work in it work with great devotion and zeal which is clearly visible in the amount of work such center do these day . so clearly young people these day are more informed , free and motivated and it clearly reflects in the amount of time they devote to helping out their community in their own way .
