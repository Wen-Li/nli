from what i learned , knew and heard and told throughout this life . it is much more importnat for a person or a student in this situation to understand idears and concept than to learn fact . to learn fact you have to understan the concept and the idea of what you are learning . therefore a an example : a person can learn a fact from a book about the world war two but not understand why the war started from the beginig . every person have brain therefor , it should be used . logic and commen sence are all mater for understanding idea and cocepts . a person can memorize a book but that doent mean that the person understood it . people should use their brain to understand thing . for example : newtons law of motion , `` for every action there is a reaction '' . a person doesnt need to learn this method and no it fact , but a person can use his brain and a littel bit of commen sence and understand the idea rather than searching for it fact . however learning fact is important for a person to do , but not a important a understandin the idea and learning the concept . facts are important for example when a person right a paper , he or she need fact to prove what they are saying . while a person can teach something if he didnt understand the idea of what he is teaching even if he fact about what he teach that is not good enough . as i said before a person need his brain , logic , and commen sence . therfore understanding idea and learning concept are much important than learning fact .
