i agree in part with the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge on many academic subject than having speciality only in one specific subject . i give my view and opinion to my decision . firstly , having broad knowledge in every field of academic is essential to know the different aspect of our day to day life . like having a knowledge about biology is essential even to a mathematician in his daily life . silmilarly , having knowledge about buisiness , art , technologhy is also essential to him . these apply to all the field of people , a botanist or zoologist need math for his statistical analysis and geography to study the distribution of life . a buisinessman should be aware of the software program to use in his buisiness life . a software engineer also requires knowledge regarding changing cost and about the finance . on the contrary spending so much of time in studying all the field make his time le to master his own subject . society need specialist in every field of academic from doctors , engineers and in every field of life . taking example of a doctor , he need to study all the subject in medicine to a basic extent . later if he specialises in a particular subject like cardiology , pediatrics or gyneacology . he should have awareness of the complaint and disease all kind of people suffer from . because if a woman come to a see a cardiologist and he find she also ha a gynaecological problem he should immediately refer her to a gynaecologist . this show the respect and smartness of a doctor in dealing her overall health status . but he is a specialist and he can correct her cardiac problem alone which a nonspecialist doctor could not do . so specialisation is required in every academic subject to show maximum result of the study and master the field one is in . on the other hand basic knowledge about all the other subject should be incured in every individual which is required in this current era .
