in my opinion , for student , understanding concept is more important than merely learn fact . thanks to my personal experience , there several reason which can support this statement . first of all , if student manage to understand concept , then they can study them in depth maybe discussing with the professor or with other classmate . they can decide if they disagree or disagree while , learning fact , doe not allow student to dicuss about them . from discussion , new idea can develop , giving to student the impression of contributing to the general knowledge grouth . secondly , trying to understand a concept is much more challenging than learning fact . of course , this is a more difficult way of learning , but i am convinced that in the end it give better result because if student want to understand concept they have to think about them . while reasoning and discussing about a concept , student start naturally to memorize it without learning the lecture by heart . finally , studying thanks to the understanding of idea and concept is not only useful , but also le boring . for example i would find really boring to learn a sequence of date and historical event , while i would find much more interesting to try to link them logically , finding cause effect bound . in conclusion , i understand that sometimes , especially for literary subject , learning fact is necessary , but i strongly believe that this way of learning ha to be accompanied by a deep understanding of the fact and of the link betweeen them . this is not only a good way of memorizing witout too mucch effort , but also a way of making the learning more engrossing .
