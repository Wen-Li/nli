there are many way to be a successful person . i think trying new thing and take risk is highly releated with being a successful person and this approach effect positively the way of being a successful person . life always brings some problem and extreme situation that we have to deal with . we all have a different method to handle those situation and problem . sometimes we can not be able to solve problem with the way that we already know . at those situation we must try new thing and sometimes take risk to deal with it . my past experience showed me that take risk and trying new thing in certain area let me to be accomplish many objective and led me to be a successful person . for example the company i worked for had to make a decision about entering into a new market or not . this new market were totally in unpredictable condition and highly volatile to make an investment . but our manager decided to enter into that new market and that risk taking brought u many new customer then we thought and it surely worth that what we decided . furthermore , life doe not go the same way . conditions may change . doing what you already know well doe not work all the time . for example if you are an agricultural product seller and when your neighbourhood becomes more industrialised . it is better you to change your job to an industrial device seller . it is a risk taking but it help you to survive at new condition . if you want to be a succesful person you should definetely take risk to survive and go on life .
