i totally disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoy life more than the older people '' . a there is a famous saying `` still young at heart '' . the above statement suggests that there is no limitation of age to enjoy life . it 's your life and one should enjoy it 's each and every single moment he life , because life is precious and the time which ha gone by will never return . it is certainly old fashioned to think that once you get old , you have lost the authority to enjoy . but in this stage of life one should enjoy life to the fullest a you have spend your whole life trying to make both end meet both personally and professionally at several circumstance . now when your child are grown up and you no longer hold their responsibility , one can spend this important part of his/her life by living upto each and every moment that pass by . a when a person is young and full of energy , he get into the grind of life facing this harsh world . once he come out of his college and start earning money , he is ultimately engaged with the chore of the family life and face day to day problem . and now in today senario , where the world follows the express lifestyle , one ha no time to spend with his/her family memebers neither get time for himself so that he can enjoy the variety of thing that this life ha to offer . he work day and night to earn money just to buy that extra comfort for his retirement . so that he can spend those last day in peace and enjoy rest of the day . the very which show u that we work hard all our life to improve our retirement , then how can one say that young people enjoy more than older people do . each person doe this for himsel , for a secured life later . he add up mone so that one can enjoy lidfe with one partner without hassel and problem of daily life .
