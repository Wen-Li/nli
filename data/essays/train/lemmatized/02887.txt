understanding idea and concept and learning fact , thats two different way of leaning new thing , but which one is more important may lead people discus about it . in my opinion , to understand idea and concept is more improtant for student than just learn fact . becuse many problem-solving are based on the idea , concept or theorie . firstly , when student understand a idea or a concept , they can use what they know to apply to viours of situation , to analyze the problem , to think of them and solve them . many thing happen in the world are based on some theory , such a how a object move , why some time computer do not work etc . for example , when a car is designed , engineer need to follow the rule of physic , and chemistry . however , when engineer know the theory of the dynamic , they can use same theory to appliy to other manufacture such a ship , plane and so on . in contrast if student only know the fact that a car can move in this way but do not know why , they can not deal with other problem , because they only know the fact , but reason . secondly , fact are only restricted in few aspect . students who learn fact are usually can not analyze some situation indeed . students know what are happening on some thing , they know the appearence , but they might not know why that is happened . sometimes they might know the reason that course the condition happened , but because there are not idea and concept in student mind , they would not understand the reason fully , they can not analyze correctly , therefor they might not solve the problem , the problem is still on there . to sum up , in my opinion , to understand idea and concept is more important for student them to learn fact , a i mention be
