today people , especially young people , enjoy more then older people . i think it is a very true statement ! for example in my family i often go out at the saturday night , i usually go to the movie , to pub or to the restaurant ! instead my parent never go to the restaurant or to the movie ! i think it happens for several possible reason . one possible reason is that the life today is earier than before . today we often have a lot of money . my mother usually tell me that when she wa young she ha only two or three dress . i think it is incredible ! i have a huge amount of dress ! a second possible reason is that in a city now there is an incredible amount of cinema , pub , restaurant . there are several opportunity to enjoying . furthermore each family ha a car . a car allow to move people easier than before . thus actual young people can enjoy themself more than previous young people . in fact the actual economy is better . there are more money , so there are several possibility to enjoing .
