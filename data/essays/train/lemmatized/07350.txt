as student i am directly concerned with the subject of this question : ideas and concept are they more important to learn than fact ? i think it is interesting to see both point of view and to try to understand why it could be more important for student to understand idea and concept and then why fact could be more important to learn . the first reason in favor of idea and concept is that when you understand an idea , a concept you are able later to find the way to the solution even the problem is not exactly the same . for example in biology you would be able to find the good way to find the solution even if the problem deal with frog and you have studied rabbit . then the understanding of concept and idea help you to build your own opinion because there is necesarly a reflexion , a discussion during the class . that mean that it help build yourself a an adult . the last point is that if you learn the fact without understanding the idea there are behind them , you will build your judgement on a small part of the problem and you wo n't be abble to understand the globality of the issue . for exemple if you learn about the problem of israel and palestina without knowing nothing about their religion you wo n't be able to have a general view of the problem . now fact also are important to learn . first of all learning fact help student to understand our world . for exemple if you do not know the important date of the evolution of your country it will be hard to understand your country today . then , fact are very important in a discussion . indeed in order to convince somebody you ca n't present only idea and concept but also fight . they will proove , explain , give more weight to your idea . as far a i am concerned , i really believe that it is really important for student to learn both idea and concept , and fact . learning both of them it is the only way to avoid ignorance and to build real adult .
