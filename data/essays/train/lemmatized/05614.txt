yes , i agree with the statement that `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . according to my knowledge many famous scientist , mathematician etc had tried to invent new thing even after they discovered one task . a successful man doesnot sit idle after finishing his work he will try to invade new thing which depends on his interest and he love to take more and more risk inorder to acheive his goal . let u take an example of a school boy who is in the starting step of his education . he will try to improve his academic life by reaching higher study one after the other , rather he dont like to sit in home and study his kindergarten repeatedly to become master in that stage . so in the same way if any human want to become a successful in his life he should face the different risk and face the outside world to become a successful person . a boy can not become an graduate only in one day he ha 2 face many consiquences an pas many milestone and had to face many risk in order to become an successfull graduate . in the similar fashion the people who keepon trying or trying to invade new thing become more successfull rather than the people who only do what they already know how to do well . let u consider an another example of a politician , any politician can not become directly president of thier respective country unless they take new risk and face all different people . the politician start his career from the small post a an local area leader and then try to fight with the other politician in the assembly and try to win over him an becomes an minister . so , it can be infered from the above example that the politician can not become directly the minister unless he face different risk and stand in election and win . similarly this suite each and every human on the world that if any one want to be successful in his life then he should take a many risk a he can and keep doing them .
