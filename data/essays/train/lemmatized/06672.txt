live is full of expereince that can determine some attitude and behavior and lead them to choose what is important in their live . in the meantime , one can assume that learn from others theory , idea , writting or experience , can somehow be important to help them better understand a situation or a problem . on one opinion , it is really important to learn from fact because one will have all the detail at his hand . it obvious that it is easy to make assumption about a situation , that one had witness or a situation where one had spend time digging to search the true . one opinion is more critical and more explanatory that a simple description out of a bunch of idea collected in differents book , idea or concept of others people that did some research on a problem . facts make you judge from your own angle , fact push you to the next level to use what you know from the result of your own work and apply it to previous idea before you will conclude . if you are a student in criminal justice . it will be so easy and wrong to just beleive that someone can be guilty and sentenced just by what the criminal book or idea and concept that one learn from the criminal book to encriminat or sentence some because one verify the stereotype of a criminal behavior or person . one can not judge like that . one shoul understant that , it is important to have the fact , to search the true instead of just assume from idea and theory . it is important for student to understand idea and concept but the fact are what can make one avoid being wrong . fact give one more insight about experience and how to deal with your surrounding but idea and concept are more of way of thinking base of others work or research .
