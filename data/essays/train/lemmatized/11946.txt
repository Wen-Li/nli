as we all know , creative people succeed in our society . i agree on the statement ` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well ' . basically there are two reason ; for new inventive way , and another chance of getting failure . firstly , you can have better solution if you try new thing . if you recall all the invention in this world , those were invented through the attempt to try the thing in another new way . successful people also try new thing to have new invention of their own . since the creativity is the key to the succeed in these day , the chance you can be successful is up to your creativity , which mean , trying new thing with probable risk . secondly , you can have the failure to learn from them . even if you had failed in the attempt for a new way , you are still gaining something from it : the evaluation skill . you can evaluated the process yourself and find the new other way that will not repeat the same mistake . and if you succeed , you can have another new way of your own , which you know so well since you invented it . for conclusion , i think if you want to be successful , you should be creative enough to undertake the risk that can be follow your creativity , because in that way , you can have your own solution to be successful , and that you can learn from the failure if you had failed .
