enjoying the life is one of the most significant step that each person should experience . there is no clear cut answer to the question if young people or older people enjoy life more . i think that it is not related to the age but the situation of the people . moreover , people have different advantage at the different age . some advantage of the young people to enjoy life are their energy and money . however , on the other hand older people have more time and more experince . one of the biggest advantage of the young people to enjoy life is their energy . they are much healthier than the old people and have more willingness to do more thing in order to enjoy life . for example they can travel to the other country , while it is not very possible for the old people . however , energy is not enouhg , time is also required . when we consider that most of the young people have to work , old people have more free time for themselves . they are mostly retired and do not need to work so they can enjoy the life better . the second point is that enjoying life mean money . for the young people that is not a great problem since they are working and earning money . in contrast , for the older people it is not easy to enjoy the life with luxury thing , because their salary from the retirement is not very high . however needle to say is that with the experience that they have gained for many year they can find the way to enjoy the life with le money . many of the older people have traveled and enjoyed the life since many year , that mean that they know very well the cheapest place and thing to do . in sum , i disagree with the statement that ` young people enjoy life more than older people do` . based on my personal experience i can claim that enjoying life is not dependent on the age , but on the situation . as i pointed out above , young people can have the energy and the money needed for enjoying the life , however that is not enough they need also time and some experience that the older people have .
