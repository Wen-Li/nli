in twenty year , there is a possibilty that the amount of car would decrease in comparison with today . since science and developement is moving on a fast pace , everything is bound to happen . technology is a big part of our life . scientists could have been researching for a better for transportation . in twenty year , they could have found a more efficient way for traveling , other than car . there must be a plan to decrease the amount of car available on earth . traffic is taking it 's toll on our daily life . the street are getting more and more crowded . in order to have fewer car traveling around , there must be an invention done first . in twenty year , there could be more train , a well a different type of train too . there could be sky train , and underground train too . there also could be an underground transport system . it could resemble the one present today , but it would have to definetely be bigger with larger amount of train , bus , and probably a new invention too . pollution is a big topic today . by the time twenty year are passed , there would be a different concept of transportation available , and pollution would not be one of it 's side effect . we have heard about the different type of possible alteration that could be done to present transporation system . in twenty year , there would probably be a whole new aspect to these system . in addition to those we have today , more plane , bus , and train would be invented . each type of system could have a region or destrict to work in on it 's own . the transportation system would be more efficient . new gadget and invention would take over the one we have today . there would be a whole new era , where car would be of no interest .
