everybody ha heard about future city which respect the enviroment , with no car and lot of yard where you can go anywhere using the public transport t and what is more important , with no pollution . but is it only a dream or will it become true anyday ? firstly , everypeople know that the car a a form of transport is getting old and that in this age of technology , modern form of transport are developping , but million of people use their car everyday , even to go to nearby place . this abusive use of car raise pollution , acustic problem and other effect like the global warming or the greenhouse effect caused by the gas that car , between other thing , take to the atmosphere . furthermore , most car , more than 99 % , use fossil fuel . these fossil fuel not only cause pollution , they also are estimated to be exhaust by le than 30 year . it mean that car like we know now wo n't be used in twenty , thirty or fourty year instead of other car which consume other fuel will be in use . besides , project like ecocities and many management from different city promove the public transport , creating new line or just making the public transport available now cheaper . at least in theory , these fact contribute to reduce the use of car . as far a i am concerned , i believe that car whose fuel are made by vegetable sustances like oil will remplaced our car , but i am not sure at the time to affirm that there will be fewer car in the future . big city have usually traffic jam and problem with car parking and the noise that they cause and it is true that public transport are growing faster now . but on the other hand , i think that some people can find car so comfortable and that car will still be use for many year . in conclusion , i hope that there will be fewer car in twenty year , and i certaintly believe that , but who can know about the future ?
