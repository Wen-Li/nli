i disagree with the statement because i think that the old people can also enjoys their life by doing what they want . it is true that there will a fewer choises to do than the youger people , but they can still enjoys it in other way . for example , let 's say that there is a old man who loved to do basket ball game when he wa young . he might not able to play it anymore , because he doe not have enough strength . but he can rather watch the game which his grand son play with his friend . also , it might be a good time to do what they wanted to do , but not able to do , in their young age . some people still doe work even they get old , but usually they retired the work and have entire day that can spend freely . i think most of people have some hobby or favorite thing to do , and this is the perfect time to spend all the time , just for doing what the one 's really want to do . for example , there might be a old couple that really love to travel to other country . they woulnd not able to get time so often to do so , when they are l young . but they can get a lot of time doing it if they got old . they might even able to travel aroud the world i they wish to . so , by 2 reason , i disagree with the statement that `` young people enjoys life more thatn older people do .
