did you ever think how successful people become successful ? the answer of this question is most probably : by trying new thing and taking risk rather than doing something already known . trying new thing is one of the way of being successful . one of the important characteristic that make a person successful is being different . people usually do not clap something they see everyday . why people like magician ? because they are doing something that we can not understand how he is doing it and that can not be seen in everyday life . the same thing can be applied to subject of success . of course this doe not mean you are unsuccessfull with an university grade 3.5 over 4 because there are a lot of 3.5s , but any way a person with a university degree of 4 is more successful than you , since there are le 4 . another way of being successful is taking risk . you can not know what you are doing is good or bad unless you see it result . in order to see the result , you should do that thing and in order to do it ; you should take risk . this is like a chain . none without one . think of climber . when we see them at the top of the mountain with a great smile on their face , we understand the happiness of success , but how doe a climber do this ? by taking several risk . he may fall because the rock he hold cracked . this doe not mean that every risk can be or should be taken . risk is something external . if climber fall because he hold the wrong rock , this is not a result of risk ; because this is his fault ; he is not trained enough to climb that rock . this is something internal . in conclusion , trying new thing and taking risk bring success , but knowing what is risk is an important point to be considered .
