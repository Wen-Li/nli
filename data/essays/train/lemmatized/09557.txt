i believe that every stage of life ha it purpose . as the saying go , ` there 's a time for everything ' . a time to enjoy being young and a time to enjoy being old . surely , i can relate to the feeling of missing the younger year . those time seemed to have been better than the now . when we are young we are usually happier , but , sadly , that is caused by ignorance and a lack of responsability . for example , people who are around 20 year old could seem to be happier than people over 30 , but that doe n't mean that there are no complication in the younger way of life . when people are over 30 they are very likely to have been through the challenge in life that define a person and make him or her to be called an adult . also , it could be very stressing to be an adolescent or even a kid , with all of those thing that you need to survive to be able to call yourself a grown man or a woman . older people seem to be le fun i suppose . but that is not the rule . there 's no need for u to expect that every grown up is boring and not funny . i believe that if people can find a way not to lose that spark they had when they were younger it could be a fun way of living for sure . i can see that life could become more and more enjoyable a we grow up , and i bet that it is going to stay that way a my yet young life span into the future . furthermore , i can recall being a kid and wishing to be smarter and more mature , i wanted to be able to understand life and the way thing are in the world . and that vision can only be achieved through experience . in conclusion , i would say that i prefer to be old and wise than to be young and silly .
