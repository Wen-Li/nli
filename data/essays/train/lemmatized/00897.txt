i deeply agree that undestanding idea is very much decisive than learning fact . it mean that you understand the general concept of a situation instead of a little step in the middle of it . in other word , it is just like , what do you prefer ? to take a great view of the horizon from the peak of a mountain or simply from the ground . first , it is important to teach this kind of statement when we are kid . we are starting to learn and understand . we are facing a new process which ha nothing from early period in life . there is no rock in the way . as soon we understand this pattern of behaviour , we will put that into practice . furthermore , once you are used to apply that teaching , you will see thing clearer . for example , you do not need to sit in the middle of the problem in order to solve it . step backwards , get a huge view of the problem from different angle and , now , try to face it . we tend to base on our experience to behave in this way . but , it is much better if we learn it a a child . another important thing associated with learning only fact is that we still have to climb up a whole mountain in order to reach the idea . ideas are high up there and we will not undestand how a clock work or a plain flight if we just merely think about fact . it is up where the whole knowledge is located . again , there is always the highest point in the city . say , a skycraper . go there , climb up from the very beginning , start to see advantage and disadvantage and once you get up there you will solve the whole problem . life will be much easier this way .
