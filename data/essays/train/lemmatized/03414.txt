i do not agree with this statement . opposing , there will be even more car than there are today . people are more and more interested in status symbol ; therefore , they want bigger and better car . this is not only represented by the huge variety of possibility we have to buy a car nowadays : we can hand in our old car and pay le for the new car bought at the same firm ; we can buy car only used for exhibition a lot cheaper than they would have been normally ; we are able to lease car and even if someone is not a doctor , he might well be able to drive a new mercedes . due to this importance of luxury good , people demand for better thing . the car industry is already making use of this because i have never seen a much advertisement for car a i do at the moment . they advertise on poster on the street , in magazins , in the cinema , and the car industry seems to become bigger and bigger rather than smaller . as we all know , car pollute the environment . i live in frankfurt and i remember those electronic board put up on big street in the city center where people are asked to refer more to puplic transfer . on the other hand , and i can only speak for myself , it is just more convenient to drive my own car , listen to my own music and drive at my own speed ; so i will definitely not be using more public transfer in the nearer future . considering my point of view , i am very sure that there will not be fewer car in twenty year than there are today .
