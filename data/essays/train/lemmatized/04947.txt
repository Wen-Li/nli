bussiness people try to market their product by advertising a lot . even though the product is not much important in our daily life , marketing people will make an impression that the product is very improtant for u . so , i totally agree with the statement that `` most advertisement make product seem much better that they really are . '' i usally watch home shopping network channel . in that channel lot and lot of product are advertised . people watching this channel are impressed about the product and ca n't wait without buying them . for example , i wa very much impressed by storage bag which are used to store vegetable in the refridgerator . the advertisement wa so impressive showing that vegetable will be fresh for longer period , if we store in that particular bag and they have shown two group of vegetable , one group of vegetable stored in ordinary storage bag and one the other group stored in that special storage bag . so i wa impressed and i ordered that particular item . in the real , i do n't feel that lot of difference about the bag and i wa not satisfied with the product . advertisements are only one type of way to introduce the product in to the market . just by seeing the advertisement we ca n't judge the reliability of the product , unless we experience the advantage and disadvantage of the product by using it . normally most people inculding me are easily carried away by the advertisement . by doing so , we are wasting time and money . so i suggest to spent some extra time to know the pro and con of a product form friend or relative who have used that product before and then decide to go for it or not . i finally conclude that we should not buy a product just by seeing an advertisement of that product . we must have the knowledge of that product , it use and how improtant it is and then buy it .
