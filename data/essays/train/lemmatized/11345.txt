the use of car today is almost `` automatic '' in our society . most household have at least one vehicle and people use their car for any purpose , from major trip to going to pick up grocery down the street . however , the use of car is being threatened by the lack of oil the world will be facing soon . on the other hand , the use of car threatens our environment , contributing to the pollution of our atmosphere and to global warming . what will the consequence be in twenty year ? will there be fewer car or just higher pollution ? what solution will we find ? so many question to answer , so little time , and so much of our everyday life and comfort affected . .. i think that our society , in order to be able to have the many car we have today , will need to find solution to our biggest problem . first of all , we are already facing the problem of the decreasing amount of oil leading to the price explosion of gasoline . exploiting oil becomes more and more expensive and rare , and it is starting to affect everyone who owns a car . any trip or use of the vehicle becomes pricy , and a a result , more and more people consider using public transportation . i think this will eventually lead people to a better understanding of what the society a a whole can do : if there are fewer car , it reduces the pollution and help the environment . from an individual point of view , using public transit will become cheaper a gasoline price will go up . for those reason , and because i want to be optimistic , i think there will be fewer car in twenty year . people will realise how much money owning a car represents and most household will simply not be able to afford it . nonetheless , if governements and innovative corporation start to work hand in hand , solution to find better environment-friendly resource to replace gasoline will appear . as a result , people will be able to buy vehicle that work with elecricity or natural gas , and will be able to keep using their private mean of transportation . in this case , we will tend to see more car than today , a the world population tends to grow . some solution have already started to show up and enable u to keep confidence in the future . however , i do believe that we are reaching the highest point of consumption today . i doubt there will be more car in the future , and i really hope people will consider public transportation a a great alternative , for the sake of everybody a well a for the preservation of our environment .
