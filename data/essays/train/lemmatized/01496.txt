i agree with the statement because i think that young people have more opportunity in life . three major point convince me that life a a young person ha more to offer . at first the body of young people allows much more stress , thereby offering the possibility for various activity . for example you can enjoy most sport and other leisure activity without endangering yourself physically . you are also sound enough to travel for a longer time like for example flying to far away continent whereas you might not be able to do that anymore from a specific age on because of medical problem such a a low blood pressure . as a second point life a a young person offer numerous option for your future both in social and professional view . you may have date and can search for the boy or girl of your dream unless you have not met a marriage partner yet . additionally you can choose the career that suit your personal preference and even more important , you might try out more than one profession because of your young age . these various choice may make you feel happy because you can look forward to your future . the last very important point is that you do not have so much responsibility while being young . as an older person you might have to care for a family or employee , this may generate stress and make you dependant to certain place or people . when you are young , you might move to another city or even country more easily . you are also allowed to make mistake because you have time to try it again and grow with the challenge . not everything that you do ha to be reasonable , for example buying an expensive car or having a dangerous hobby like parachuting or whitewater-rafting . i am certain that young people enjoy life more than older people do because of their advantage like good health , many option and le responsibilties to take care off .
