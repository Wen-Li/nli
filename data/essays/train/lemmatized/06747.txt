when you are a student , there are many different way in which you plan your studying or , in the other hand , the way your teacher or professor help you to do it . i believe that when you are a teacher you must have some point clear when teaching your student and with that i mean that you must understand that is more importan that student understand idea and concept than learning fact . when a student learn concept , he or she is able to manage general idea and adapt what he or she have learned to solve or explain some other situation that will come in his future life , when the student learns thing simply a a fact , that idea can not be adapted or foccused to understand or explain other topic . when the student start a process of learning there are different form in which they keep the information they recieve . the first one is understanding idea . they need to understand the general idea of the topic and they must be able to relate it to common daily thing . understanding idea will help the student to work with the principal idea of the topic , it will help him to see the main point and will help the student define in an accurate manner the caracteristics of it , that mean , he will be able to give a concept . when we talk about an specific topic some time is very difficult for the student to express what they are thinking , you can have the idea but you can not transmit it to other people . if a student learns only fact , probably those fact are unique , that learning will only be useful in that specific situaction , you can not generalize , so de student will not be able to use that knowledge in order to solve any other problem . what is necessary for the student is to catch the precise information , that mean , to get the concept clear , to understand the main idea and over all , the student must be able to transmit that knowledge to other people . that is why is very important that they understand idea and concept . when a student is capable of transmiting the information he learned ( idea and concept ) to other people we can say that he really learned what we expected .
