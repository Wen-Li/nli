i agree to the statement . if you think , speak , and behave like any other people or in the routinal way you are used to , then how could you make change and reach the top ? of course , being successful mean different to everyone . for me , being successful mean being one of the top , without regard to the field or area you are in . a successful businessman is one of the most influential leader in the field of managing and administrating an enterprise . a successful pianist is one of the most revered musician and play the piano more accurately , at the same time gracefully , than others . for instance , hee-ya , a 19-year-old girl with only four finger , is now a successful pianist in korea . her performance may not be a good a mozart ; but the thing is , despite the harsh circumstance , she became one of the prospective pianist in korea . she would not have gained the fame and recognition , had she given up and blamed the situation . the potential to succeed is not born with ; it 's all about grabbing a many opportunity a one can and doing thing that usual people do not even think about .
