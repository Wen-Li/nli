in my opinion , the young people nowerdays are dedicated and dovouted to help their community . though no such statistical data exist a of now but being a part of the young generation of india , i myself can support my stance with several example . the best example that can be qouted is of the recent devastation caused by t-sunami . the vast destruction caused by upsurge of tremendous tidal wave not only affected economically but also led to casualities and serious injury . in this situation , from primary school child to college graduate united here in india to help the needy . we being the part of this association went door to door to ask for any form of help , that included money , medicine , clothes , food etc . even the ngo 's and well acclaimed society like red cross and sos acknowledged this enthusiastic participation of youth of india and well assured that the fund and support liquidated to the proper cause . t-sunami wa just an example and this happened in case of gujrat earthquake and other disastors . though it should not be inferred that this kind of participation is only restricted to natural calamity only . nowerdays , student participate more in programme like national cadet camps ( ncc ) which go to rural area to help understand their problem and educate them about certain topic like aids . moreover , blood donation camp is another example of frequent participation of young people to support their community . appart from that the technological advancement ha made it feasible to provide modern and extensive technique that ultimately lead to social and financial upliftment of community . in developing country like india , we are still having a large population that need to be properly educated . nowerdays more capable and intellect people are getting into politics and civil service . it is the young doctor who cure disease and it is the young engineer who make a village glow at night . the extensive research done now will definately have implication for the betterment of the future . if we look into the situation more practically , we will see that more and more young people are participating in the development and upliftment of their community . though some population is still not a enthusiastic about community service yet i would state that , `` nothing is perfect '' . it will be illogical to expect cent percent participation . thus , to sum up , young people are giving time to help their community .
