when we come out the idea we can creat the idea and and the concept . since that we must care about the fact . as far a i am concerned , i am strongly disagree that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to lean fact . first of all , in real life , fact include many unfornseen trouble . the diffical fact will become valuable experience . they will tell u how to do it and what we need to do . the hard fact will allow u to endure hard time in the future . it also provide many information for u to think deeper and more close to the real life . secondly , fact is very important in the real life . even you can realated the idea and the concept , you can think that a well a you can , you still need to care about the fact . if the fact in the real life did n't work very well . no matter the idea and the concept is well , the fact also play an important part in the real life . third , fact state the important position between the idea and the concept . the fact can let the idea and the concept go through fluquently . without the fact , all the idea and the concept is empty . the fact will let people think deeper and more comprehensive . it provide a broader range for for people to explore it by themselves . all in all , i strongly state that for people to learn fact is more important for them to learn or understant idea and the concept . facts is so important that it play an very important position in the real life . it connect the idea and the concept to make it into real .
