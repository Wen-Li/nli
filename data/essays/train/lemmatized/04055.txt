from my point of view it 's better to have a good knowledge of the academic subject in some specific profession and , inside this profession , is good to specialize in one particular subject . so , a usual in live , the radical position are not always the right way to choose . to explain my point let me define a basic framework . you have a set of profession , fo example , economics , law , art , etc. and inside one profession set you have some specialize field , for example , inside economics you have microeconomics and macroeconomics . finally , inside a specialization field you have specific subject , for example , inside the microeconomic field you have , consumer 's behavior or firm 's behavior . in that sense , you have to choose a profession according your personnal skill . once you choose your profession you have to know , al least in general , all the aspect inside it . because the specific subject you choose always deal with others general topic . for example , if you choose economics and specifically microeconomics , you have to know some statistical technique . finally , of course , you choose a specific subject . there 's an advantage in choosing and specific subject because you can profundize some subject and studied it better . eventually you can do some interesting contributing to the theory and became a reference research . however , my point deal with the perception of live . if your only objetice in live is to get some money to pay the bill , maybe it 's a good path `` know some of all '' , so you will never get unnployeed . but i think , even with this point of view , you can have more opporunities if you specialized in one subject , due a few person could do your work .
