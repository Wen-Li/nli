i agree , because young people nowadays are getting confusing from the interest in our life , and they give their full time to these kind of interest , video game , computer game and party , etc i believe the devlopement of the techonology it ha effeceted badly about the this generation , all these new technololy distract people from doing their job and study and helping their communiteies besides the time are running fastly these day . secondly , i believe that there is lak from the universities and school , that they should encourge the young people how to help their communites and country , because if anyone explain and advise the student that they should be more concerned about their community that would be usefel . thirdly , in the university in whatever major or what ever college , we are not getting free time to do anything since i am spending whole day preparing for project and studying for exam , which caused u to feel that we are overloaded , this is how the university can effect about student , nevertheless , i am sure that are many people who are helping their country and tthat they should encourge the new generetion and the young people how much the comunity is meangfull to u , and to explain to them how to utilize their time to use to help our self and our country , time and that they should be helper for their community
