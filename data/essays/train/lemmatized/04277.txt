i completely agree with the statement that it is more important to understand idea and concept than it is to learn fact . the following reason explain better my opinion . i think that understand idea and concept present some advantage . in fact , if you learn the fact but you do not understand the concept behind the fact , probably after no many time you will not remember the fact yet . insteed , if you really understand the concept , in your future probably you will not remember the specific fact but you will remember the most important idea of the argument . so , you have to learn fact only after you understand concept . the fact that student do not understand concept ha two different cause first , usually in the exam student ha to explain only the fact ; so learn only the fact is easier than understand the concept . then , i think that to understand the basical idea student need a really good professor , because it is difficult to understand them by textbook . finally , i believe that if you really understand the concept behind the fact , you can put them in practice better . if you learn only the fact , you can not therefore i think that you can understand why i believe that student first have to understand the concept and the idea , and then the fact . in conclusion , i think that this statement is true not only for student , but for everyone in general . usually it ha more value for a student , but it is a right statement for everyone because i think that it is alvways better , in every situation , understand the concept than the detail .
