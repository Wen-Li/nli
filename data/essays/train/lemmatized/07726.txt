i think we should study towo question te make response to the subject : why today product seems tobe better that they really are ? and is the increase in advertisement explain this fact ? first i will make a little history and the evolution of marketing . first the production wa local and not industrial they were a little number of product on the market and to sell it wa very easy to sell them the offer wa more important than demand . in a second time at the beginning of the industrial revolution , when the demand egalize the offer , all custumers could fine on the market the same product one exaple is the ford t the same car , same color for every one . a third evolution of the industrial revolution is to propose , on the market , for a same product which have the same function , differents option . for example a car with a choice of differents color . so in this phase of the evolution people could satisfie also primary need and also desire wich is new abotu the pattern of buying something . maslow with his famous pyramid explain and illustrate the different need and desire . the technology of indistrials production have change the market and today we have an offer more important tha the demand and the primary need or the original function of a product are today le important than the desire of make an acquisition of a particular type of car . for example if you buy a bmw car today you also buy a certain range in the society . when people were buying the ford t they were buy a product which permit to go from one point to another and it wa n't a for distinction from other people . in conclusion i think advertising contribute to clarifie and communicate on the desire wich is offer by the product to the person . the quality bqsed on the primary function is secondary .
