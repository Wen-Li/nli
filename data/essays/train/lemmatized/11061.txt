in my opinion young people have to help their community because in this mode the youngers can improve their personal experience and this fact is very important for every work that they will do . on the contrary , even if a young person might help community , he or she can not do it because they have not time for this purpose . infact , usually school steal much time to student and free time is not fair to help community . at the same time a person must enjoy her or himself in free time to not explose ! . so , if a person want to help community he or she renounces to free time and this question is very difficult to deal with . infact , after an hard week of study i believe that a young want to go out with his friend or make some sport . in my personal experience , i wanted to entry in red cross beacuse i think that it is important organization to improve our society . the lesson of this organitazion are made at monday and friday evening in a period that i have to prepare exam and i can not follow lesson . so , i did not follow my purpose for school reason . another experience in my life is related to church activity that i don not want to follow because they are made on saturday afternoon and this is the only free day of my week . i am very sad for this , but after a week in a place not near to my home i want to visit my friend for example or to play tennis . so , i believe that if school need le time youngers can help community but in these condition are very dfficult to realize it . a purpose that can be made is to put in scholar schedule voluntary activity like red cross or to help in hospital . it might be a mode of stimulating youngers to be near to their community .
