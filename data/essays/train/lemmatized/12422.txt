i agree with the statement because i believe , that we would not live in the world of today if it were n't for men and woman who had the courage to leave their old job behind and start something new . to begin with , we all profit from those extraordinary men and woman who have dedicated their life to try new thing and take risk rather then enjoying the merit they could have had by doing their normal job . every successful woman or man today could not have been that successful if it wa n't for the pioneer in the past . although it take a lot of courage to take a risk , the chance of being really successful are much higher too . if one is dedicated and put all his passion into one idea or thought , the chance that he might be succesfull will increase a lot . this point can be illustrated by taking an example from history . in today world we all profit from the high mobility which is made possible by car , and even more so , by plane . but it took two brother in 1903 all their courage and money to construct an absolutely new type of vehicle and to test it themselves . their risk wa a high one , but their success wa even higher and can be seen everyday in today 's world . this is only one example of how we profit of those people who chose not to live a cozy and unspectacular life , but to dare something . i am not saying , that everybody need to try to invent something new and be innovative , but a certain percentage of those pioneer is needed to strengthen the innovative process which underlies economic growth . in conclusion we can see the enormous importance of pioneer and how no country can go without them . everybody will profit from the advantage those innovation will bring for a society . thus , a government should always support those people who take risk since their innovation are the basis for a better world tomorrow .
