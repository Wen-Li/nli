in my opinion , it wo n't be an exaggeration that young people do not spend time on their community . it is true that young people seldom do thing for their community . the reason is simple . young people have other thing to do and ; most of all , few young people have the sense of community . seldom young people in my country are required to do anythings for their community . they are often be told that they have to study hard . their reposibility is to focus on their study and their school work is always on the top of priority . to their `` consederate '' parent , thing like helping their community is taken a an bother to their child . even the task is a easy a cleaning the sidewalk around the community , parent will usually choose to finish by themselves rather than getting their chidren involved in . on the other hand , few of young people nowadays have the sense of community . they even do n't know who their neighbor are . how can it possible to ask those indifferent people to pick the garbage scattering in the house next to their house . they usually think that their will solve the problem in the community because it is adult 's bussiness . they are seldom be educated to help others . they claim that they are too young to have opinion and ability to making descions about their community . i do n't think that it is all the young people 's fault that they pay little attention to their community . their parent should also be responsible to this situation . our younger shoud be taught to be more earnest to their living environment instead of caring only about themslves .
