some people think that young people do not spend their time to do something that is beneficial for their society . but i do not agree this opinion . the most primary reason for this is that modern many university student are much more ready to be the one of member of worker than those in the past . some illustration of that is they join internship , experience the work a a part-time job , and study abroad to master english . my fatehr said to me that he did not have to study or experience work like today . moreover , a people can prolong teir life , young people have to help them nowadays . it is critisized that there are so many old people in japan , where i live in . i think that it is only young people who can help with their living . to summerize above passege , young people nowadays can not help giving much more time to help thir community a the system of teir society is changing .
