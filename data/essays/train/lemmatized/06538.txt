i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do . both these are the stage of life and people enjoy at every stage . but , i feel that people get more enjoyment at old age . in young stage , people strive to earn their life for themselves , for their child and for their parent . they always work and work to earn more money , more status etc to earn living at that point of time and to save money or invest money for later part of life , which is older age . real enjoyment start when they use the money earned for enjoyment a they are having more free time for enjoyment . secondly , old age is the last stage of life when people have seen all the wordly pleasure of life during their various stage of life . but , in my viewpoint , people get more satisfaction when they are with complete family including their grand child . that is the stage when people feel more enjoyment to be with . people earn money for getting this phase of life with good time . thirdly , i feel that in old age , people can do any work according to their liking because they are under no pressure to earn their life . but , in young age , people remains under pressure to fulfill their dream and always running after life . in old age , life come to a stand still and people enjoy the fruit of the tree what they have planted in young age . because of this reason , old age people get more satisfaction during that time a compared to young age . lastly , in old age , people get more respect in the society which in turn give more enjoyment towards life . people at this stage can indulge in activity like temple work , which help them in soothing their soul . beyond this there is no enjoyment on earth which human can get . i would like to retierate that people enjoy more in old age a compared to young age .
