i agree with this statement that most advertisement make product look much better than thier real quality . in these day , a lot of advertisement of product come out through medium . as people saw those advertisement they never feel those product are not good , but they feel those look good and want to buy or use it . it is because ad do not show all of real , exist quality of product . when people watch ad , they just accept ad by medium . all of the medium are one-way communication , so people have to accept it and they do not have chance to reveal or ask about the product to medium . moreover , company , which make product or good , only want to show benefit of product rather than shortcoming of product . therefore , people can not know side effect or demerit of the product , and it make people to belive that product do not have disadvantage . for example , i bought an `` i-pod '' three year ago with a proud of buying good looking mp3 . however , after i had been using that for two year , it wa broken . then , i went to service center to fix that . but service worker said they could not fix that because of it had been over it warranty . it look very good in ad , second , when product maker use advertisement , they hire famous people and super star who are effective to majority to make product seem better . it is due to the fact that people want to be and like to be them . for example , if woman watch the jennifer aniston us a certain hair product in ad , that product will be sold out fastly because many of woman want to have hair like jennifer 's . even though that product do not have good quality , it look good thanks to jeniifer , so woman feel that product ha good quality .
