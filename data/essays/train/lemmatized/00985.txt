it is debatable whether young people do not give enough time to helping their community . some people say that youth are pay enough time helping their community . however , i believet that young people do not spend enough time helping their community because they have a lot of assignment and most yougers are individual . first , young people have a lot of assignmemt , so they can not spend their time helping theit community . nowdays we are live in a flood of information . youngers should study lot of information . it result to young people to have a huge of assignment . they do not have enough time . for example , when i studied gangnamgu library , one of the most famous libries in korea , i always study with juvenile . they studied their school assignment too hard . thus , youngers do not give enough time to helping their community . second , most young people are individual . they do not pay attention with their community . even they do not have affection about their parent . modern society brought an individual circumstance . people do not worry about surroundings except oneself . accoding to the dongilbo , one of the most famous research center in korea , 76 % young people do not know their neighborhood . even they do not care about that . thus , young people do not give enough time to helping their community because they do not care about their neighborhood and surroundings . in summary , youngers nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community bacause they have a lot of assignment and they do not pay attention .
