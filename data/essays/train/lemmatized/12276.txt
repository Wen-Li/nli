young people now a day doing a lot of work for their community by running old age homes , & child homes . many old people in the community are send to the old age homes for their better life . child in the street are send to their child home . practically people are busy in this year , but indirectly the young people are sending money for old age home . they are contrubuting 10 % of their income to church & charity trust . mainly people are engaged to earn money for their good life . i think contrubuting money to the poor is also a indirect help to the people . which help alot for their survival . my own experience , my uncle 's old grand father used to serve their old parent in their home in olden day . and he used to serve the community . but my uncle used to serve their own parent by sending them to old age home . my uncle used to send money for their expense to the hostel management . they were given excellent medical treatment by the 24 hr doctor facility . they were taken better care & good food i think it is better because my uncle is a job holder. & aunty wa expired . he is not having time to see his parent , so i think it better way for the old people to stay in the hostel , where his son will meet them every day evening . coming to point my uncle is paying high amount for the hostel , that 6 people can survive with that amount in that hostel . i think he is indirectly helping community for the improvement . in olden day many people not having proper job & mainly doing agriculture a main occupation in that time the people having more time to serve the community . but in moderen day people not having sufficient time to sleep also . in this situation i think helping the community . throug practical approach is impossible . so a satyam company people are adopting several village around their localty , they are providing water , health facility , school , etc to the ; people in the village . it is mainly succesful because by getting profit to that company , by doing hard work by it job holder . i think by doing their job perfectly they are doing service to the people arround the village , it is indirect help doing by satyam company job holder finally i conclude , involuntary work can also led to service to the community like i stated above .
