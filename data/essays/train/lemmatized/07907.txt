in my opinion , the main difference between understanding and learning is that everyone is able to learn something but not necessary able to understand it . for sure , in my point of view , the most important is to understand thing . it is the main feature which diferentiate two student in term of inteligence . i will explain why in two point . firt , according to my own experience in school , i can assume that it is really easier to learn something when you understand it than it is to learn it by heart . for example , if i try to learn the economic theory of keynes , i will maybe succeed for the exam but for sure , 10 day later , i will be unable to explain and to remember it , otherwise , if i try to understand how really this theory could be apply on the economic system and if i can use it on my own , then i will remember this theory for a longer period . moreover , for the exam , student are more and more asked to understand the concept and not only to repeat them . second , what is the most important thing in the work area . my bos will not ask me to learn something by heart . he will expect me to think and to develop idea . all people with high job in a company , do not spend their time to learn fact but interpreat them in order to find solution . for those reason that i mentionned above , i really think that the most important is to understand concept . moreover , it is so gratifying for yourself when you understand something very hard and it is a personnal reward .
