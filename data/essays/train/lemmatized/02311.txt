advertising , effective marketing are the big buzz word which everyone in the field of business talk about . but in reality how good are these product , is the big question that need to be answered . the mantra for any advertising is to make a product sell and increase sale , in this process some of the ethical issue remain unanswered . for example , lot of the food product which are advertised do not specify the content in them . some ingredient may be harmful for child . this ineffective and hidden advertising is harmful and in the long run doe more damage than gain to the company . with the advent of advertising on televison , the way the product is perceived ha been totally changed . with newer technology in the medium industry , it is questionable if the product we get is what we see ! in a lot of occassions , food product have been made to look lot more appealing to the eye , this kind of visual stimulus in deed sell product , but is it really right ? i really dont think so , this this just an illusion which ha been created and camoflauges the actual product and deceives the consumer . another major thing and the big talk of the present day is obesity and it 's harmful effect . a lot of commercial from exercise equipment to health food have been exploiting this concept . the socailites and other personality emdorse the product and sometimes are paid hefty for these endorsement . there have been talk about celebrity overeating and then on a diet with an endorsed product just to promote it . this kind of wrong advertising cause more harm to the public who try to follow and rely on this information . hidden fact is another way which ad make the product seem larger , this is esp seen again with health equipment . the exact duration of performing the exercise and the assocaited diet modification are seldom mentioned . this when seen by the public is perceived big and hence the result is the same health status iof the indivudual or even worsening . another example of this would be the fuel efficiency in car , which is advertised a very efficient and the best milage on testing road conditons , but in reality with the bad road and stop at traffic light , this efficiency is never achieved ! another wrong concept of advertising is the comparing of the rival product and degrading them in comparison with theirs . the customer should be given the choice and make his decision , rather than imposing the idea . publically or through medium showing comparison of their company product another is always wrong . it is obvious that to promote their product the harmful effect of it , or the drawback are never mentioned . this is unethical and not acceptable in advertising . the comparison should always be left to unbiased body , who would be better judge . advertising is the biggest way an economy can be influenced , it would be more beneficient if it is done more positively . this would benefit the public using the product and the company which make them and in turn would finally build up the economy .
