nowadays , modern man became very much busy with making money . he ha totally forgotten the moral and ethic and he ha forgotten about the importance of inter relation ship between individual . young people now fall under this criterion now . young people now are filled with ego . they are generally egocentric , self centered who have apathy for the other issue which are taking place with out involving him . so any problem in the community doesnt make him to think about the issue . young people now adays are doing any work if there is any material gain in their work . we know that from generation to generation the people have changed and the relationship between them also changed . as , the world is devoloping lot , there is more competetion in the world . so , the young people spend much of there time how to evolve victorious or successful in this competitive world . young people are generally over ambitious . so , they fail to understand in the sociable relation and fail to be amicable or convivial . they spent a lot of time in school studying over the vast syllabus eating away all the time and energy . they dont even sometimes have time to do their work properly because of the hectic work schedule . as many of the young student prefer to be independent rather than depend on adult for money for their expanse . so , the individualism also have an indirect impact on the young people for helping the community . so , the people will be busy in getting money by doing part time job in the night or any time when they are free . this keep them restricted in involving themselves for the community help . this young people some time have no time to sleep and can not concentrate in the community help . we can not fully blame the young people for that . it is the life style which changed the relation so , i think strongly that young peo [ ple should concentrarte more on community .
