in my opinion , succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . because of their character , they are succesful . for example , the architect build building . aldo rossi is one of the succesful architect . he ha a lot of drawnings , industrials design , building . in his school year , his teacher didnt like their drawnings and building . they made him to draw the way they wanted . if he didnt do the teacher wanting , he didnt graduate from the university . so he give up studying in university . then in his work , his bos wanted him to draw the way his bos wanted . he didnt give up drawning . he ha alotof drwanings altenatives about one building . in addition to this one drawning about his design is not enough for him . so you can alotof drawnings about one of the building . also he search while designing . he always try alot of alternative about his design . so he take risk . for example : his building or his design arent sold or liked by the people . in addition to this other architect disagree with him about the building or his design . but to explore new thing ( pozitively or negatively ) make him more successful . by the way this make he is different from the other architect . by trying new thing and taking risk help him while other designing . he can easily improve himself and her career . so her design and product are not similar . in architecture the variety is very important . so aldo rossi is very successful architect . on the other hand , if he only doing what he already know how to do well , he repeat himself and his career . so aldo rossi isnt known a a succesful archtect in the world . in conclusion , trying new thing and taking risk is very important in our career . if we want to be successful , we always do the best that we can .
