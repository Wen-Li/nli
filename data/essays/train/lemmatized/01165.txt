some people might believe that learning the fact is more important to student . but personally i agree with the statement that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . here are the reason and example from my experience to support my opinion . first , i am thinkig about my mathematics class in high school . i learned many fact how to solve the problem . my teacher just taught the method to solve the problem . we did n't focus much on the theory , which is origin of the solving method . i wa good at solving problem on exam , but now i forgot most of problem solving method . i can not apply to real life . i believe it is caused by learning just fact , not the whole idea or concept . second , i want to talk about my design class at college . professor taught about wide variety of the idea and concept of the art history . and she gave the specific fact of each idea and concept . it is much easier to approach the class because we understand the idea and concept first , it helped a lot to understand each characteristic and fact . it also helped when i developed my design and portfolio . if i just learn how to make the portfolio with same way or how to sew my design just following the direction , how can it be different from others ? in conclusion , we should understand the idea and concept first . this is the way we can reapply the idea and concept to real life . if we just learn the fact , we can not be creative and reapply the idea and concept to the real life . i truly believe the statement that understand idea and concept is more important to student than learning fact .
