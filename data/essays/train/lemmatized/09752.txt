buying or being sure of a product ha become a very hard `` homework '' , in fact it offen appens that the pruducts that we choose are not so thrustable a they are supposed to be . the problem , in my opinion , is the large role of money in our society , there are few very power company that own the pruducts'mark . their strongness reflects itsself on all the mean used to promote more a product than another . they produce a lot of publicity and convincing tattics throght newspaper , televion , stand and so on ; that , in any way , influence the taste of the listener . `` normal '' people think to feel surer on a product according to how much this product is known or broadcasted . there are so many example to say that this topic is complitely wrong , we have too many time heard about big company scandales and sometimes about the collapse of one of them , but thought that , people seem not to change their idea . we are too involved in the society , where we live , not to can make good distinction on what this society offer to u . i could suggest the people , that are going to buying something , to be able to decide without outher conditionments , they must prove a product and decide if it 's a good product . this choise is difficult to make because of our unawareness of being influenced by everything around u . people are offen afraid if a product is not very common , they compare themselves to the other and that , i think , it 's the main mistake , we have to decide for ourselves , we have to listen to what the other say with an accurate distancy , that let u to take our own decision . i think , that 's one good solution not to fall into missunderstandings that everyday are around u
