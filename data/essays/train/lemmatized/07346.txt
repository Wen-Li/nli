i agree with the point that in twenty year are going to be le car in use . this is going to happen because some reason : the first reason is for sure that people is geting concerned about the enviroment and pollution . if we do not stop sending pollution to the air , more natural disaster will happen and nobody want to die soon . people is getting concerned about taking care about our little planet . another reason is that other transport are growing , example of this are : much more people use public transport like plane , taxi or bus because it is cheaper to move in the city by public transport , than using your own car and paying the gas . other reason is the continued evolution of the mechanic technology , new transport are going to appear and maybe they are le polluting than car , but for sure this new vehicle are going to be faster , more comfortable and cheaper than a car . speaking about car , we have in one hand that they are relly cheap and they are very useful , for example to go working on time , but in the other hand we have that car are the thing that kill more people in european country during a year . for sure this is a good reason . a car also is something that need care , and you have to spend your money on it , changing thing that are not fixed enough , gas , parking and load of other thing that make very expensive having a car . in conclusion , for all this reason , in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today and for sure , people will think twice before buying a new car , because it is something expensive , it is something that contribues to pollute our planet and is something that in twenty year , is going to be considered old-fashioned and boring .
