i do not agree with the idea that it is better to travel with a group led by a tour guide . however , i like to travel alone or with my own friend . and , i actually have three reason for that . first of all , it is more enjoyable for a tourist to discover the country he/she is visiting by him/her self . the tour guide doe not allow you to have the pleasure of exploring the new area you are in . actually , that is the opposite of my advantering personality . second of all , you can not be free enough with a tour guide . whithout a tour guide , i can wake up whenever i want and i can go wherever i like at any time . however , if i am led by a tour guide i can not do that because i will have appointment and i will have to be on time for them . third of all , the only advantage a tour guide can give me is to show me the best place to visit or let me aware of the nieghborhoods in the city i am visiting . howeve , i can complete my trip with need to this advantage . and , there is no reason besides that to have a tour guide . based on those three reason , i make my preference to have a trip without a tour guide .
