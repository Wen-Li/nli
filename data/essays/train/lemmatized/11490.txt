to have a knowledge of any academic subject is very important because we can learn how to think in an academic way with this type of study and thinking in that way make u to ask question about anything in life . there is a lot of subject to specialize but i would choose to specialize in only one specific subject and this can also help me to learn how to ask . acoording to me , if you decide to learn something , you have to give all your energy to it , and this help you to notice and understand every detail about the subject . because every detail ha a reason and these reason take you to the profession on the subject . the point is , you have to understand and feel the sense of your subject . with studying the regular part and then studying the detail , you can achieve in any subject . moreover , how much time you spend on your subject is the other important point . due to the change , you should keep on studying and develop your research . if you decide to specialize in subject more than one , it will be difficult to research all the meterials , actually detail . . i can give a primitive example that i decided to apply for the conservatory in u.s. , and they want me to give a recital , take the toefl andpass the musician placement examination . first i started to study for all of them at the same time , but after a while i realize that i forgot some detail about each subject , and start to study one by one . this help me to finish all the work . although i can not allienate myself from both side , i would choose to study for only one subject and got the broad knowledge of it . i believe only this way can let you to have a dominant character studyingin academically .
