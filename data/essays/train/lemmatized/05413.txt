today , when we look at our environment we can see many car than old year we could see . i disagree that in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . in passing year , it is observed that the number of car is increasing fastly . i want to focus on reason to increase car . first reason that population is getting growth . many people start to use their individual car . all family buy car to their child or young people buy car by ownself . for example , in turkey many family who have 3 or 4 member have at least 3 car . however , many company start to improve theirselves . they use many car for their job , especially for sale and marketing . they should sell or do their job by car . another reason , car are always seems people very comfortable . all people want to have a car . cars are comfortable because , you can go wherever you want , you do not have problem like missing bus and being late to school or job . you are free in a car , because it is yours you can listen to music highly . although another transporter are produced or government make some campaign for their cost , pesple do not use these transporter such a train , bus . .. etc . moreover , government cost much money to produce new highly technology vehicle for transporter . these are tried by people but it is not used in much time . also , there were many accident when they were tested . new high tecnology vehicle are comfotable but not like a car . beacuse these vehicle are community , common used . the comfortable of these vehicle can not like car . in conclusion , in twenty year or thirty year , there will be always increasement of car . people produce comfortable and good technological car also good anoth
