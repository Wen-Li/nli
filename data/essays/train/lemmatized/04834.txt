i could not say that every young person dedicate themselves to helping their community , but i do think that a large number of them are doing a large amount of voluntary work to help make a better community . i have witnessed many participation in social service by young people around me . when i wa in high school in hong kong , the city where i live , almost everybody at school joined at least one volutary activity , be it elderly home visit or fund-raising carnival . some put a lot of effort into organizing these voluntary work , while others supported by generous donation or active participation . we all enjoyed being involved in these activity , knowing that we are contributing to our community . i have personally contributed and experienced community work , too . as member of the hong kong red cross youth units , my team mate and i have initiated a few service project which served the objective of charity organization . we designed a 3-day programme , which included a fun day for elderly and child , to convey message such a social harmony and cross-generation communication . all of u have dedicated ourselves into the preparation and launching of the project . it wa time-consuming but we all believed that it wa worth making a more joyful community . helping the community is not only demonstrated by actual participation in voluntary work . i think that the young people who are really making contribution are those who manage their time well between voluntary work and academic study . we should always look at thing in the long term . instead of complaining that young people do not give enough time to helping their community , maybe we should appreciate how they are trying to get the most of their study and contribute to the society later on . that mean that they are not wasting the resource that the society is giving them in their education . they also prove that the ` investment ' in their education will generate return when contribute what they learn back to the society . are n't they helping their community , too ? many young people are actually aware of their position in their community and are giving a lot of time to help . we should appreciate what they have done and encourage those who are doing le to contribute more . ultimately they will be the one who benefit from a better community they themselves live in .
