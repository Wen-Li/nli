i agree with understanding idea and concept instead of learning fact . in the beginning of the contemporary period , people tand to teach and learn a marerial in a easy way to accept . however , this method of way to reach ideas restricted the flexibility of thinking . learnig only fact is the same a learnig skill . students must learn how to use a skill instead of maintain a state of having skill . historically admirous teacher socrates taught his student to think them self and find the fact or answer through their thought . in the example of eignstain , he could not fit into public school . however , he found out the fact and inventied many product through his flexible idea . next , learning fact also influence to a person 's self-esteem . learning at school mean the same idea with solving a proplem for student . students will experience of great achivement through solving problem . this is the process to fully understand idea of the study . through that experience student will le most of people know one plus one is two . however , before learn concept of how it work , they can not explain that it is a real fact . now it is the era of imagine and dream . without new idea and concept , not only people but also society can not develope .
