i agree wth this statement . the experience of the most of the school are that student firstable understand idea and concept before learn fact . some reason are : in the first step , student should know the idea and concept of the thing , because this method applied in our life . when we were child , our parent tought u in a first way the idea of the thing and then the fact . after that , we learned the fact , basicly , because our parent wanted to show u the thing that we proyected in our mind . this system wa implied in generation for our parent and the school follow the same method . other thing , it 's that the idea or concept show u what we are talking about . we create an imagination of the thing in our mind . we clearly know what we are talking and what we are studying and that allows u to make a preliminary image before to know the fact . after that , the fact can be easyly . this make a better compretation of the definition . in adition , fact in the school can be use like experiment or practice , so it 's help to the student to undestand in a better way the idea o the concept . facts reflect the preliminary idea in the practice but we know them in our however , both of them are important to give them to the student . it 's necesary for the better compretation and the get better result in the student . school should take more importance in the idea and the concept , then the student in the job or in the simply life can use it .
