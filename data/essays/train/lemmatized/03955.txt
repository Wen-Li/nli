i agree with the statement which say it better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specilalize in one specific subject . i think this will give u alot of information in many thing and this will support me in the situation that maybe i will in it for example , if i study math and i want to be a teacher thats doe n't mean that i dont need to study computer , maybe i have to do presentation by the computer so it 's important to me to know how to learn how to use it by studing the computer subject . also i see this will help me to deal in correct way with the thing around me for example if i have information in the medical thing so i can protect my self away from dieseas . having broad knoledge of many academic make me aware abaut many thing such a how to deal with others or with my student in the future by studing comunication with others which is not the math subject . if i have information abaut one specific subject i ca n't do any thing with other situation which is part of the onther subject . finally i advice others to have broad knowledge of many academic subject and do not stop
