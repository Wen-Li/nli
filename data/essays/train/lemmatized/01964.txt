i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first , most advertisement tell u the adventages of the product and do not mention the disadvantades . advertisements are generall short . in order to inpress people advertisement have to say the most inportant advantage and do not have time to tell people the shortcomes . so people will consider the product better than they really are . second , some product have different effect to different people . it is good to you , maybe it is no effect on me . the advertisement only give u the good example , such a the drug for lossing weight . my friend use many kind of product to loss weight . every time she told me that she have seen the result of using this product from advertisement , but she disppointed every time . third , some advertisement use inaccrute word . for example , a advertisement said that the drug for lossing weight is very , very effective . but what mean `` very , very effective '' ? every person ha his/her own oppoinons . some people think it mean that this will decrease 10 % of weight , but other people think it mean to decrease 20 % of weight . to the factory of this good , `` very , very effective '' maybe mean decrease 5 % . so i think i can not beleive all of what the advertisement said .
