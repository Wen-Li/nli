lately a lot of people discussed the questioned if young people enjoy life more than older people do . and infact this question is not very simple to answer , because there are a lot of view with different standpoint from people in different period of life . so you can divide people into a lot of group concerning their attitude on these question . if you mention sport for example , i am sure that young people enjoy their life more than the older one , because if you are younger you are more agil and have much more energy to do sport like rafting , base jumping , windsurfing an so on . maybe older people are a little bit unhappy of not being able to do all sport because of their health situation . another contrary aspect is working . younger people for example at the age of 18 have to make their final exam and maybe want to go to the university for becoming a doctor or a manager . then they will have to spend a lot of time being at home learing all day and night to get a job in the future . they have to concentrate all the time and are not allowed to have fun until they have reached their goal . if you are older , for example at the age of 40 you are yet working in a company and maybe you are lucky of not having to learn so much because your are doing the same work the whole weak , the whole month or even the whole year . because of this reason it is possible that younger people can not enjoy their life until they finished school or university and are able to do their work . another reason why older people could be the happier one enjoying their life more than younger one is that they have allready made their experience with school , parent and so on , that they could benefit from these experience . so from a special moment on you can start enjoying life because of knowing what to do with your time , knowing some important secret of life and knowing how to keep the balance in life . when you know these important fact i assume that it is much easier to enjoy life . the most convenient way of making the best out of life would be to know all the important fact from the date of birth on , but i think , then life would not be a funny and enjoyable a it is .
