nowadays many people go to travel . most of time they firstly should chose place where they want to go , then will think of whom they want to go with . in a group or individual way ? there are some benefit to travel in a group led by a tour guide . however , there are many reason why i believe that the best way to travel is an individual trip . it is more enjoyable and economical . the threshold reason i like individual way to trip is that i can enjoy my time with myself . travel is the best way to find one 's self . if i want to think deeply , i need to be alone , but unfortunately , in a group , that 's almost impossible to happen . i have to consider what other people want to do since i 'm in a group led by a guide . sometimes i have to do and go what and where which i do n't want to . more over , i like to sit and read while i 'm in foreign place , and this is also difficult to happen if i 'm in a group . the second reason is that i do not spend more money than what i planed . sometimes the tour guide lead people some store where they are connected by little commition . in this case most of time people or i tend to buy something by accidentially . this is the one of many benefit why i like individual trip rethar than group tour with guide . i know there are also some benefit to travel with group and guide . i do not lose on the street in foreign place , do not need to worry about hotel and schedul . but , then , there are no way and nothing to learn from my travel . trip is an adventure in our life . since i believe that is the best way to find myself , i would like to go my trip alone rether than with a group led by a guide .
