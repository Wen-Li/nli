in twenty yers we will live in a different world in which we will have completly avoided pollution by wasting le natural resource a possible . in my opinion , we have already experimented successfully the method to reach this aim consuming everyday le oil and using more bicycle and pubblic transport . as a matter of fact the cost of the bus ticket is going down because people is starting again to consider this way of transport a a valid alternative to his own car and a an easiest possibility to save money ( nowadays , the cost of oil is growing too much and , on average , only 2 person per 5 are available to spend a lot of money for it ) and to avoid to be stuck in the traffic of the city center . but refusing to drive car and choose to go to work by foot or to reach university by bicycle is also a good motivation to keep in haelth and to do an everyday-life gym without spending any money which can help u to mantain younger and good-looking a long a possible in order to teach our child or grand child to respect nature and to improve our physical attitude simply by using an alternative transport to car . in fact , car ( a we are used to think of them ) are doomed to be fewer because we will improve the prototype for different way to give locomotion to them . recent study have asserted that is possible to make car working by involving hydrogene insted of oil and it could pollute and cost ever le than a traditional car . so , i am sure that car in twenty year will disappear and we will be able to support the missing of alternative transport better because technology is working to give u the best of itself in order to improve the quality of our life .
