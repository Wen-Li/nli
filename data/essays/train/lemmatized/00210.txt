underastanding idieas are far more important than knowing the fact . understanding is the best way to learn said by my teacher . human developed year together by understanding rather than knowing the fact from the early stone age we are understanding the concept rather than knowing , for example we came to know about fire , by rubing two stone together thus unerstanding the process of fricton by using stone . we cant simply rely on subject by knowing but for undrstanding it . for example every one know about law of conservatiopn of energy , a person who understands applied in form of electricity or mechaniocal engine . student who got good mark in examination cant become a good enginer or doctor or infact good at his or her career but a person who can apply it to his career can be good . thus application is important for a student which come with understanding the subject . practical understanding of subject is best preferred than simply knowing it , this the reason why the nowadays the education orl study is based on fieled work rather on simply class room teaching . each and every course of today wether you take a science or art or technology project and the field work are introduced . concept of understanding not give u the success in profession but also help get beter in our subject which we dont for get for our life long . this doesnt happen in simply knowing . a stident should not apply this to the study but also to the vaerious aspect ofdaily life . this can better not only a person life but also his relation with other people thus ultimately his life standerds are also increased . this aspect can not bew leaerned oput side should be made to lesrned in schooling stage itself . finally understandig make perfect not only good academecally but also in li . fe
