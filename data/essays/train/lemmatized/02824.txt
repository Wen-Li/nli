the statement that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialise in one subject is an controversial one and i would describe the reason why . the statement actually begs the question and is an overstatement at best . one must have a stronghold over one subject , and not just ` broad knowledge ' and additionally , one should be aware of the happening in other stream . the speaker 's claim that one must have information of many subject is problemetic at best . the speaker fails to give a number for ` many ' here . however , i believe that any sincere student must have information over related subject . for example , a student of food technology must be an informd student of biology , chemistry , biochemistry and engineering too . but his core stream will be food technology and it related subject . thus , the speaker 's claim of speacialising in one subject is unjustifiable since the student may know about related subject in more detail than just having broad information . the student specialising in a subject is expected to know in detail about the subject . for example , a student studying medicine is expected to be proficient in not just ready with the information but also to be able to practice it a and when needed . this come through continuous hard work and devotion to one 's chosen field of study . if the student try to indulge in other academic discipline too much , he will harm the pateints and his own career . thus one ha to be cautious about studying other subject . studying many subject , will make the student a mere dabbler who risk hampering furture growth . additionally the student is expected to have some inclination for art and it various form , political science , finance for these subject help the student to go ahead with life with ease and to understand the significance of event efecting him . thus , the speaker 's claim about knowing only one subject is also not sufficient . thus , both the scenario - of having some knowledge about all the subject and knowing everything about just one subject - should be discouraged . with the world becoming a smaller place and university offering a host of admixed stream and choice to student , these are actually not even possible in today 's scenario . a student should study hard at his chosen field of study and also , a he can devote time , try to learn other related and unrelated subject but not at the cost of his subject .
