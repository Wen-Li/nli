i am in complete agreement with the given statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact '' . ideas and concept are very important and they act the source of general conscience in human being . i feel so because understanding idea and concept is far more important than just learning fact only . if a student is clear about the concept and idea behind a phenomenon than it will hardly take a second to learn the fact . it is concept and idea that give rise to fact or one can say that fact is denouement of idea and concept . to clearly undersatnd take an example of `` falling of a hurling ball on the ground '' . this falling of a ball on ground is a fact but the force of gravity and the phenomenon of gravitation come under idea and concept behind this fact . so just learning that a hurling ball fall on ground is trivial a compared to the concept of gravitation . also learning fact doe not count to intelligentia , one shuld have logical thinking and innovative idea to get success in any field . logical thinking is the path to success . and logical thinking develops only when one think innovative idea or mere idea , so one should think newer and newer idea to solve a problem . thinking innovative idea lead to logical thinking and reasoning . as everybody is familier with the milieu of competition , so to survive and compete in this competitive environment the student shoould be ancouraged the student should be encouraged to go for understanding of idea and concept instead of learning of fact only . if the student are good then the institute will also succeed and definitely the country too . so to make future generation better and competitive the student should be encouraged to understand idea and concept rather than mere fact only .
