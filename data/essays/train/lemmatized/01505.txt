advertisement is meant to attract people attention in order to sell a product . in this case , i agree with the fact that most advertisement make product seem better than they really are . advertising company use people 's psychology in the way they present a product . they can make fusture customer relate to the product , and ultimately buy it . advertising company rely on how people relate to their product : for example , a brand of shampoo may want to reach out to stay at home mother and tell them that they will be `` sexy '' and attractive by using it ; a company that sell baseball bat may want to reach to father and tell them that by buying thair bat and playing with their son , they will be hero . it is not necessarily the product in itself that attract people , but how the advertisement is presented and the idea behind it . not every advertised product is good . for example , i saw an ad on tv about a vaccum . the ad said that the vacuum could even clean bacteries from the air and that it deep clean the carpet . it looked good to me , so i bought it : the vaccum broke the next day . there is no real way from knowing if a product is good or bad because there are so many advertisement nowadays . the only way of knowing is by trying out the product ; and by that time , the advertisement company achieved one thing : selling their product . advertisement is a part of our society to the point where we can not tell what is true and what is not in the matter of product : what brand is really better ? do we take price into account ? as a customer , there is so much to take into account that we end up being confused and choosing what `` look '' good . advertisers know how to make use of this fast-paced society , where people do not have time to look closely at a product before buying it . it is ultimately the way the product is presented that make them profit ; not the quality of the product .
