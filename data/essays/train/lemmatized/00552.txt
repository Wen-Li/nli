i completely agree that succesful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they know how to do well . first , to succed you need to take risk . probably everyone that ha succeded in their life ha taken risk . and when you take a risk it doe n't mean that you are going to succed for sure . when you are going to start a new proyect , when you are going to start running your own buisness or if you are going to take a posdoctoral education for example you are usually entering into an unknown field , in a place wihich you are not familiarized with and where you are going to make probably many mistake and failing exam . but that is the only way to succed , trying , making mistake , and the most important thing , learning from them . by the contrary , of course you can just do what you already know and do n't want to go further in your knowledgent or education . there is nothing wrong with that point , but your life and knowledgent are going to be limited only in what you know . you are not even going to be a specialist in what you think you are good at , because to be a specialist you need to study more , take new exam and take new risk . nowdays we live in a very competitive world where you need to know everyday something new and you need to be updating your knowlegment , taking continuing education course etc . probably if you are going to look for a new job the most qualified candidate is the one that is going to be chosen . the same happens with student : we need to further our education in order to be more competitive to be accepted for example in a college . and the only way to do that is taking risk everyday . for studying purpose , we need sometime to retake an exam in order to have a competitive score since all student are very qualified . in conclussion , taking risk will allow u to be more competent , qualified and succesfull in our life
