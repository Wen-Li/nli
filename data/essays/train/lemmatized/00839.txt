nowadays more and more young people do n't care about their livning community . they spend a lot of time on their study work in school or cream school . even they have free time they may use it on their entainment activity , like go shoping with friend or family . although there still some young people have pay some attention to their community , it is my believe that they do n't give enough time to help their community . the first reason that caused the young people ca n't devote more time to their community is that the high competitive pressure in the education system . their parent wish their child can get a good grade in different subject that caused them need to attend different course . even ater the day time from the school , they need to take some course in the cram school to do some supplement . in addition , while they have free time after the hard work in their study . they usually use it to do some entainments , like see the movie or sing the song in the ktv with their classmate or friend . furthermore , due the the busy work of their parent that cause the father and mother did n't have much time to edcuate their kid , not to metion to teach their kid to do something helpful to their community . so from point of veiw , if we want to encourage the young people to do more in our community , we need to take more effort on our education . firstly , we need to encourage the parent to take their child to attend some activity in our community . let these young people to know more their society . then in the school , we need to allocate more time to teach the importance of helping community , not just ask the student to focus on their study . through these improvement , i believe the young people will pay more time in their community than before . and the problem in the community will reduce and whole socity will become more stronger .
