enjoying life depends on a decision and not on a the age or the circumstance that a person is going through . i have known many old people who are happier and healthier than many teenager and adult . i know , for example , a 60-year-old woman who ha more energy than two teenager together . i might be exaggerating , but her attitude toward life impress me a lot . she swim every day , she go to the beauty parlor all the weekend and she ha her own business . in fact , she told me last time that she won the first place in a 2000-meter swimming competition in the atitlan sea . she is also the most hyperactive person that i have ever known . she like to joke and she is smiling everytime i look at her . on the other hand , i know a 30-year-old man who always wake up tired and upset and who hate his job . when i go to visit him , he is either eating or watching tv . i sometimes do not like to talk to him , because he is always speaking negatively . his bad attitude sometimes scare me . because of this two example given , i believe that enjoying life doe not depend on someone 's age . i am sure that the woman , whom i wrote about , wake up every day expecting something new and that she is thankful that she ha a new day to experience . she ha a possitive attitude and she is the one who decides to have a special day . the other man could have a terrible job and a terrible house , but if he want and decides to make of them something pleasant and enjoyable , he will make a paradise out of it . it conclusion , i disagree with the statement . happiness depends on the person 's attitude and decision .
