yes , ido agree with the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well '' . generally people do thing about they know and about what is familiar and if it becomes hard or difficult they try to shift to the other one after trying it for two to three time . but , successful people wo n't stop doing that . they will continue doing it until they will succed in it . they contact many other people or do anything for obtaining the result . normal people also stop doing the work if they completed it doing or solving it . but , successful people try 's to do they same work in a different or new manner . they use their own way of thinking to solve the same problem . they may think every matter in another way and try to solve it . successful people also dare to do anything . they take risk without hesitation . they love to take risk . they try very hard for doing anything . for example , a person might think of keeping a restaurant . firstly , he should take a risk over that business . because , it may raise the price or low down the price . normally people start a work and if it go down they will stop it continuing and go to another one . but , successful people doesnt stop it they even try to do some more improvement and start doing the work . once it might go wrong but , latter they will definetly succed . because , hard worker doe n't get the failure . successful people not only succed they even go to higher position because , once if the business go nicely they wont stop looking at them , they think of improving it in another way by extending their business to further more what people needed . thus , the successful people take risk in everything they do .
