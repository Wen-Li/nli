students usually have many kind of different caratheristics . someone can memorize a poetry in few minute and play it without failing a single word , someone else can understand very easily difficoult concept of math or phisic . i am one of the last cathegory and i think that understanding an idea or a concept is more importatnt than learning fact . first of all , whenever i have learnt a fact without understanding the logic meaning of it , i have forgotten it after some week because memorizing detail is useless . i think student can remember idea and concept longer then fact and , for this reason , they can maintain information even after long time and this is the main porpouse of shool education . another important reason is that brain developes much more thinking about an idea or a concept than memorizing something . in fact , trying to figure out a problem , collecting thougths and making choice for reaching the best solution is more stimoulant for a student who learns to use his or her brain . instead , learning just fact memorizing detail , brain work in other way , developing not the most important and usefull part of it . thus , i support a teaching method based on understanding concept and idea , much more that a method based on memorazing information and fact which i think they can not last long time .
