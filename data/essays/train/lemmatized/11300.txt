personally , i am disagree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . in my opinion , i have three reason to support my saying , they are the increasing community service certification , the sense of youth social responsibility , and the expend concept of international community . firstly , the increasing community service certification among campus . for example , there are more and more university provide community service certification to encourage student to contribute more time to helping their community . under the improvement of community service certification , more young people are eager to give more time to do so . in addition , the sense of youth social responsibility is addressed among society recently . for instance , a lot of ngos hold seminasr and conference to bring youth people together to discus the issue of youth social responsibility . meanwhile , more young people express their opinion on internet platform and implement action among their community . furthermore , the development of techonology bring chance and channel for youth people to contribute their thought and effors for community service . for example , i have joined an online conference which wa about youth community action , mainly connected between taipei and kaohsiung . to decrese the cost of transportation and physical attendance time , i still had the opportunity to express my opinion and had the smooth interaction with other participant . finally , the expend concept of international community arises . according to the idea of globalization , there is no limitation among country , especially there is no barrier between commmunities . for instance , i can easily reach another community to have cooperation for improving my community 's weakness . moreover , the use of technology for communication , young people develop their potential to make positive impact to helping their community internationally . for example , i had a discussion forum on my blog of september , 21st earthquake recovery several year ago . there were quite vast young people replied and gave me advice to make some improvement for my community . to summarize , the increasing community service certification among university field , the addressed sense of youth social responsibility , and the international community concept are main support evidence to prove that young people nowadays do make effort and give a lot of time to helping their community .
