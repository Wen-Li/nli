the issue whether the student understand idea and concept is more importnat for them to learn fact is of great interest amont people . in my opinion , the student understand idea and concept is more important than learn fact because it is reasonable and it is the first step of learning knowledge . students can study better if they know the idea and concept . first of all , if the student do not know the idea and concept , how can they discover the new thing while they are learning . students study new knowledge logically . knowing the idea and concept is good for their study . learning knowledge is a thing which should be step by step . second , when student study a new kind of knowledge , they have curiosity to know what is going happen in the new study . tell student the new idea and concept would stimulate the interest of learning . i third , while studying student may do a lot of research in library or on-line that will bring surprising news to student . students can use the idea and concept which they just learned to solve the new problem . this method can develop student ' spirit of exploration . in summary , i prefer understand idea and concept to learn fact . understanding idea and concept is more important than learn fact .
