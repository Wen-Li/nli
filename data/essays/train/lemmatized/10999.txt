some people argue that when student study , they just learn important fact , and memorize those fact without understanding real meaning that fact have because it is more efficient . however , i completly disagree this opinion because student who learn just fact can not adjust the fact that they learn to different problem , also can not go next level easily , and can not have lot of knoweledge . first , if student learn fact , they can not use those fact for the other situation because they do n't know real concept that fact have . for example , student who learn the fact about the part of american history , the civil war , can know what happened during the war time , and who achieved some important job . however , they do n't understand the real meaning of civil war that affected whole american history , and can not find common or different thing from the other similrar historical event . second , they will have a difficulty to learn some fact that is hirher level . in the math class , some student just learn the fact about formula of the limit and memorize specific rule . if they meet some higher level problem , or problem that is more complicate , they can not answer . also , if they forget the formula that they learned and memorized , they can not solve the math problem . however , the student who understand concept and idea can use their concept for the question that is higher level . finally , student who understand idea and concept can enhance their knowledge and information . knowing fact will be forgotten over time . however , understanding basic concept and idea will last over time , and it will be their knoweledge during their life time . therefore , i strongly believe that it is the most important thing to understand concept and idea at first for sutdents because it is helpful for understanding the other thing and more difficult problem , also earning valuable knoweledge .
