there is no doubt in saying that successful people try new thing and take risk . i agree with this statement cent percent . in my view success come when we try out something new . doing the thing what we already know doe not pave way to success . for example , scientist try out new thing in order to invent or discover thing . for instance , take the example of mr. thomas alva edison who is a successful scientist . he took many risk and tried new thing thereby inventing a lot of thing we use today . likewise madam curie who took great risk in discovering radium wa a very successful scientist in this world . the reason for taking risk , in my view , is to reach out for new thing and innovation there by getting success . by doing the same thing doe not give u a chance to grow . another field which we can imply this statement is the field of business . the basic rule of the business a far a i know is the ability to take risk at required time . without taking risk the business will not develop . the entire commercial field and advertising field rely mostly upon the new thing and risk . the successful business person in the past and present support this statement because they must have taken risk at some point of time . in the field of information technology also innovation is very important and it is the basis of that field because it is a ever changing field . we can add the space technology , biology , genetics and lot more field in this list . whatever field and whatever condition may be one ha to take risk and try out new thing in order to get success .
