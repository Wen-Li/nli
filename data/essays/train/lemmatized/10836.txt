it is a fact that if the student do not understand a concept and do not understand the idea , the thing surrounded by them would not make any sense and there wouldl be a confusion . at the same time , it is also important to learn fact whihch make the thing real to the student and student can easily visualize the thing and can develope their own thought and idea . i had an experence related to how important it is learn the fact than understanding idea and concept ; therefore i disagree with the statement . when the student can see the fact , they can accept a reality they face , develope their idea and think deely and a the result , they will be more independent . before i had a situation to do a lab experminent in my chemistry class , my teacher taught u what the purpose of the experminet and explained the step but it wa not realy helpful for me to visualize what i suppose to do . the lab wa not appeal to me and i found it wa boring becasue i could not use my thoughs to think deeply . i thought it wa really passive way of leaning . then , in my physic class , the other showed me the lab in front of the class and told u the all the fact what is happening in a real life which is realted to this experminent . i could accept the rality of the lab really easily that time . i wa able to think beyond the physic experminent . i also could use my imagination and so my thoughs got really deep . form my prsonal experience , i found it wa much better to learn fact a my attitude get more active and more independent from what the teacher teach me a concept . i can learn idea and concept from text book , so i think it is really important for the sudents to activate their mind and learn the fact .
