yes , i agree with this statement , it is more important to understand what you are studing in spite of understand few fact , but it is also true that usually fact improve your knowledge of idea and concept . i mean , if you want to understand an idea you probably need an exemple , this exemple is the fact . i show you a situation in which fact are extremely releated to the knowledge of a concept : we are in a history classroom , the teacher of an elementery school told his student that the second world war wa a very horrorfy event . the childrens understand the core of the statement , but they do n't know why it is so , or if they really do understand the thing . so the teacher show some event that occured during the war , like hitler 's policy , like olocaust , ecc . . now child ha theirown opinion and can actually say that war is bad , because thay understood the concept , that is substained by an exemple , that mean , by fact . it can be also stated that learn fact over fact can not really help you , because if you do n't pay attenction to what you are saing you 'll never be able to have a true opinion on some topic . you have to improve your knowledge by add idea and concept , with an array of clear fact . infact it can be inferred that fact are the basis of knowledge because they prepare your mind to a concept , only in this way you can add information . more over is true that understand idea and concept is more useful for you than learn just fact , indeed fact can be learned with a mnemonic process , viceversa an idea have to grown up in you , it have to suggest you something . in conclusion maybe the statement should be `` it is important for student to understand idea and concept , supported by an array of fact that cleary explain the content of those idea and concept '' , so i actually can say that i agree the statement .
