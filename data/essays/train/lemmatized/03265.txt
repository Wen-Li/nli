but you for your professional work you have to be specialised in a specific subject . because today you have to be one of the best in your field to success and to be able to answer to all question . but their is not just the professiopnal world who is important . and you ca n't progress if you are just able to speack about your job in my opinion it 's very important to have a general culture to be able to discus from all topic with other people , to be able to understand the world , the art . you have to be aware on the world . but general culture isvital in the all day life . history is very important for example . and you ca n't forget the history of humanity . it 's a question of respect but it 's important to do not make the same mistake a in the past too . another argument is that to have knowledge in some field can help you in other subject . for exemple you ca n't study art without having knowledge in history . and i think that study mathematics can bring the logic you need to understand philosophy . that 's why i think it 's important to have a minimum of knowledge in all the field and to be specialised in one of them . i think that the study have to bring this balance betwenn the general culture and the specialisation . it 's the key of the satisfaction of a person .
