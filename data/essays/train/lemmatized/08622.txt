i am agree that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guied . well , at my point of view and experience i have had , the cost-benefit of these kind of travel are a 100 % people satisfied in all sens , economy , saving time , enjoying a much time a they can , etc . the guide plan every single detail in order to satisfy customer need and try always to prepare information regarding the place where people are going , even if is a long or short trip , a guide with his or her skill will provide with a good plan to cover the most interesting thing and place to see during these day his best effort will be reflected in tip from people . also , very often a guide provide knowlegde , important date , cer tain historic enrichment in detail regarding the place you are visiting and all of them can complete or expand the travel itself . sometimes traveling is hard , heavy boring , we do n't have time to go all ther place we want to , a guide can enphatize you to really enjoy what are you seeing . they plan the whole trip since the arriving at the place until coming back , they worry for keeping you busy and interested in the trip , since the morning until night , the disadvantage i can see in these kind of trip , you can not handle your time a you wish , you have to be able to respond to the schedule and the group need in order to complete with the program , you have to wake up and go to bed on an scheduled basis , no matter how tired or bored you are . you have to take breakfast lunch and dinner when schedule tell , and break also . but at the end surely you will enjoy your trip with the group and the guide .
