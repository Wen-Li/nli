in my limited experience , it is quite true that more and more youngsers neglect their own community and pay scarce time and attention on hepling their community . personal speaking , i think that there are three possible cause of this result . first , more youngster are taught to study harder and focus on their schoolwork , and this may make them more self-centered because teacher and even their parent require them to pursue their own accomplishment or higher grade in every contest . thus the younsters surrouded only by this information gradually accept this thought and are le willing to attend the publich issue , like helping their community . second , it might be possible that the youngster spend their time with their own friend playing the basketball or baseball , studying and preparing for the exam , or something eles . whateve they do , they always take activity together , and stay in their own group ; therefore , if the original goal of their group is not to help their community , they will never touch such issue . we all know the power of the group to constrain the member to obey and do those thing recognized by other member , so this would be one of the reason that cause them unwilling to help their community . last but not the least , such event may be caused by the lack of their passion to help others . our education system always us the acheivement in the school performance or the grade in the exam to ass the potential of the student a a reference of selection in university entrance exam , and therefore both the student and their parent place this event a top priority , so no wonder there are le and le youngster who devote themselves to the public issue and are happy to help others , including their community . in summary , i think it is the ignorance of public issue that cause them pay much attention on helping their community .
