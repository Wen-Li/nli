although there may be some special case where youngster are helping their community , i agree that they are not spending enough time . there are three reason why i arrived at this conclusion . firstly , in these day every one is striving for a good career - to get a good job in some reputed company or to start his own business . in this race for a good career , most of u will not care for what is going on with the outside world . instead we will concentrate only on our aim until we get it in our hand . we will motivate all our thought in that direction . we will spend each and every second in our life for that goal . so we are not getting time to help our community . another reason is that , now a day a person becomes famous mostly because of his wealth . he will be given respect based upon his fortune . in this scenario , it 's no surprise that every one becomes greedy for wealth and fame . so we doe n't waste our time for non-profit activity i.e , activity which will give no profit in form of money like helping our community . we will focus all our time on doing some work to earn some thing . one more reason is that most of u enjoy playing sport . so if we find any leisure time we will cater it to playing instead of doing any other thing . what we also feel is that playing is conducive to health and also maintaining a good physique always fetch . obviously there will be no free time to u when we are spending it in another way . finally , youngster now a day are giving more preference to their career , accomplishing wealth and also maintaining good health . they are missing the fundamental rule of helping others , which inturn help u . let 's hope a time definitely come when our people will realize this truth and thrive for the prosperity of our human community .
