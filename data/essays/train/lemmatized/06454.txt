i agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . to begin my passage , i would like to provide my own experience happened in my home stay family . it snowed heavily last year in vancouver . when faced with such snow , different member in the family have totely different reaction . the homestay-father and mother thought it wa a big mass to be cleaned up , they hate the snow . however , the child in the family , who wa only seven year old , wa very happy to see so , because she ha never seen such heavy snow in her life . she can enjoy herself in the snow for a whole afternoon . why young people enjoy life more ? first , because they usually have le life experience . in such manner , they are more curious than adult . young people just want to try new thing , even though older people may think it wa bad . also they have le experience to see bad thing . sometime , they do not have the ability to tell good thing from bad one , so they may engoy both of them . in addition , adult , older people , are usually under lot of presures , which are not only from daily work , but also from their family . they may think something wa a trouble while their child think it is enjoyable to play with , just like the story above . last but not least , young people usually want gain different experience in life . they would like to discouver different thing in their life . in this case , they may have more opportunity to approve interesting thing in daily life . when meet these kind of thing , they can have more enjoyment , so young people enjoy that more than older one . all in all , people of different age have different opinion to their life . but , in general , young people enjoy their life more than people of an older age .
