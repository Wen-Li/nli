i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know . todays world of comfort and happiness we are enjoying is , because of the effort of many successful people . i can mention the following point to support of my argument . firstly , each and evry person ha their own success , in their own term . people who have urge to get a good life keepaside the thing what they achieved , and try to do thing what they have n't achieved . if we take the school going child , success for them is to complete primary schooling , and after that undergraduation , and then graduation and then getting a job , then they will start thinking about the familly and their child . though they remember about their past at the back of mind , they will concentrate more on the future and be a sucessful person at that instance of life secondly , success may vary from person to person . for me success is more like a getting a good job . for my parent success is having abetter education for their child , eventhough it is difficult for them to invest for the study and taking the risk . if my parent just stop investing on my education thinking that they can not risk it , we will not have a better future . each and everyperson try to be successful by trying newthings and taking risk . finally , each and every country have their own successful leader and buisiness people and people of variety of field who took the risk and invented new thing . we must be thankful for them for what we are today . they are responsible for happiness and comfort of life that we are enjoying today , and we must put our effort and be a suceesful person rather than sticking and doing the same thing . in conclusion each and every person can be successful , if they work hard and give more better life for the future generation
