i disagree with the topic . young people nowadays do give enough time to helping their community . even though the system is becoming more and more mechanical the helping nature of the young is not degrading . they really show up and help when the time come for doing that . consider the example of katrina hurricane . the hurricane left many people homeless and made many child orphan . during that time student and other young people through out the wourld gave the helping hand . students have eshtablished many camp around the victimized area to help the poeple . many people from foreign nation have also helped their best by donating their pocket money . even though many of the student are busy in their college schedule , they devote some time for social sevice . many student from club in there collge for helping the under privelaged kid and others . this i am stating from my personal experienced . i am a member of rotract club in college . me along with some other student have arranged a camp in college to encouraged the under privelaged kid . we went a orphanage and brought few kid to our college and gave them training in sketching , fabric painting , clay modelling etc . we have this program once in a semester and the member of the group work for two to three day on it . even the employ many of company do have a charity trust to help the community . these trust or most commanly called a ngo have a lot of young member . they are more active and enthusiastic when it come to some adventerous job helping the piligrims who visit temple which are very difficult to reach , setting up the first aid camp in such location etc . the youth even though is getting busy with their daily routine , they are giving enough importance amd time to helping their community . infact it is the youth which think le selfishly when it come to help . they always want to show their enthusiasm in helping others .
