i not agree with this statement . i think there is much young people that help his community and spend a lot of his time for it . for example there are some volountaries in many place : in hospital , in center for old people . .. and so on . i know some people who work for the ambulance : they are volountaries who stay , some time also all night , at the ambulance to give his help in case of need , and the day later they are in office to work . there are also some girl i know who give their help to center where old people stay because they 're seek or need help . theese girl have a big sense of responsability in helping others , i think . moreover , my cousin is always around the community of her church ( she is much religious ) to give her help to guide and educate child . in her blood and heart there is the force to do this . she say me she feel much better when she help the neighbour . i talked about some people i know , but i did n't say nothing about myself . that 's why i have never done something for my community . this because i 've never had the occasion , or because i do n't think to be able to give help without nothing in change . i think that are very admirable people who do this , but also that you must feel it . i could give some time to my community for example cleaning natural park when the community of my town organizes the event of cleaning the city . .. but i am sure i will forget it or i will decide do do something else that day . .. that 's why really i do n't feel to give my time to the community . .. i 'm not a good person like my friend . so it 's true , there are many people like me who do n't spend enough time for the community . it would be a better world if anyone would spend more of his time for that . i think also that this behaviour of people is not only of nowdays , it ha always been so . but today there is more people who need help , also becouse the number of old ( and so seek ) people is larger than some year ago
