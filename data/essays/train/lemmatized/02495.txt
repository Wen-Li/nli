people living in modern time have benefited from many invention and discovery that have enriched the world . dedicated scientist even devote their life time in order to explore different way to make our life better . when exploring the subject , these people do not hesistate to rake risk and evolve their project rather than only doing what they are familiar with or know how to do very well . there is one important question that should be asked . why do people need to try new thing and take risk ? i strongly believe that people , who are or want to be successful , do take risk and try new thing instead of concentrating on their every day subject , since repeating everyday knowledge and not questioning their current involvement would not be heplful and enough to make them successful people . first , when i consider about people who had left important print on the history with the different ascpects and various subject of science , literature and art , i can reach a conclusion that almost all of these important figure were filled with the motivation of becoming successful and they took risk to achieve their target . for example , the nobel laurette economist james tobin say that ` rare is the child who want to grow up to be an economist or a professor , i myself did . .. ' . although being grown up in a village and very poor family , prof. tobin did not easily give up his dream and inspite of her father 's rejection , he decided to study economics instead of working a a farmer , which wa the thing he wa very familiar with and even he wa very good at . without giving up his dream and by taking some risk such a failure and financial difficulty that he experienced in the time period of his education , he continued his study passionately and became a worlwide known economist . finally , he wa awarded with a nobel prize in 1982 , which is a strong evidence of his success . second , when people are just concentrate on the subject and work , which they are very familiar with , then they may loose their desire to be successful since there is an huge possibility to think that they have already achieved enough knowledge so why to struggle more and try new thing . in conclusion , i strongly believe that there are yet more to exlpore and more to develop also question all around of the world to make the future brighter and better for next generation . in order to make an epoch and not only have a solid contribution to the social world we live in but also to be successful , people should be able to take risk and they should not be just depended on the subject they already know .
