i agree with the view that in future there will be fewer car than there are now . on the one hand , the car are one of the most convenient mode of transportation and also the most popular one . on the other hand , the factor such a growth in population , scarcity of land and concentration of population in the urban center indicates towards a future situation where we might actually see a reduction of car in future . in the final analysis , there are more and stronger indication for decrease in the number of car in future . first , due to the rising population and overcrowding in the city , it ha become extremely difficult to travel in car a there are frequent traffic jam and lack of parking space . the other mode of transportation such a bus and train are more convenient and faster . further , since most of the car are owned by people in city the number of car will decerases due to the above factor in the coming time . second , the problem of pollution and overcrowding in the city due to the increase in the number of car have forced government in country like singapore impose high tax on purchase of vehicle . they have also imposed toll charge for entering in the main city area . thus , the government regulation can also discourage people from purchasing more car and this will contribute to an overall reduction of car in future . third , the probelm of the scarcity of non-renewable fuel is pushing up the fuel price everyday , making it more and more difficult to travel in car . it ha already led to the increase in popularity of the cheaper public transportation , this ha been the case with train in mumbai ( india ) , where many people who used to travel in car have shifted to travelling in train and for these people new air conditioned train have also been started . finally , the development of the alternative mean of transportation like improved buse service , better network of train , etc can again lead to a reduction in the number of car purchased by people and contribute to a reduction of the total number of car in time to come . thus , for the reason given above i believe that in future car will be fewer in number than they are now .
