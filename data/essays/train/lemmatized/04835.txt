i do n't agree with this statement . i 'd like to explain why i think so . there are three reason . first , the number of human being will inclease in this twenty year . now , there are about 6,000 million human being in the earth , and it is incleasing , especially in china , india , and so on . and these country are the good market of the car . second , the car will become more typical way of moving , because typically , the country in which the number of human being will inclease have very wide country area , like china . so , they will want to use car for moving . lastly , the car will become more personal item of moving . currently , typical style of owning the car is that a family or a company owns the car . the reason of this is economical reason . the price of car is very expensive , so we must share a car with some people . because there will be the cost reduction by the production technology 's advent in recent year , the car price will be down . in this situation , the style of owning the car is change to the style of per person . because of these three reason , i think that the number of car will inclease in twenty year .
