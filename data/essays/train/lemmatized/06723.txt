in my opinion yes young people enjoy more life than a older people because young people are more enerzised , fun loving , enthusiatis , out going and more over a passion to do something new and great which attract others . let take my example when i have gone for my holiday with my family me n my sister both ha done riverrafting and diving whereas my parent were there but they had not done anything like this they were actually roamimg around in the beach and enjoying the wheather . similarly at night i would love to go night club but if i give change to my parent they would choose to go for a long drive . the only reason is i enjoy dancing and having fun at disc with friend and they enjoy conversation with there age group people . another good example would be u can find a club in a are where college and hostel and even place where more young people are there , whereas you find a nice beautiful park when you visit any society of retired person . in my organisation people who are working in field force a a sale executive or document pick up are mostly young boy or girl because they are more energetic whereas if you see in administration and back office more olderly people are working where job profile doe not include much stamen . according to me older people would to do those kind of job which reqire more mental stamen rather then physical . young people ha more stamen then olde people . but yes there are always exception i have a uncle who is always into a mood of enjoyment or having fun all the time . you find these kind of people very le who ha lot of energy even at older age . so it again depend on the person to person how he take his life to potential .
