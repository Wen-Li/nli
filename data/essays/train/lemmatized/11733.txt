some people might say that try new thing and take risk to suceed . but i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they alreay know how to do well . because those who are working like professional , they have confidece and dream when they work . first of all , they are not always successful either they try new thing or not . i think the most important thing is confidence for success and without knowledge , it is hard to try new thing and take risk . for example , one of my friend studied economic but now he want to transfer to art school . does not it make sense ? he had not been drewing about 20 year , so that he gave up . like i said , when we try something new thing , even we should have basic technic or knowledge . in addition , we have to have dream for our successful life . there are so many people who try to new thing without dream . in my opinion , if we just work without dream , we need more time to suceed than peolple who have dream . for instance , in korea , people try to suceed everyday . but it is extremely hard to suceed , even they have skill . thus many korean surrender their job then they have their own business and they are more successful in life than people who go to company everyday . in conclusion , we all want to suceed . but in order to suceed , we have to have confidence and dream in our mind and also we have to know how to do very well . if we always try new thing without know-how , we always might be behind .
