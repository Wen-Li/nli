generally i agree with the statement . understanding idea and concept is exactly what you need when you finished university and when you are going to work for a company . there are some fact you have to know but it is definitly more important to understand concept and idea . if you are a business student and you learn something about the product life cycle for example , you definitly have to understand how the cycle work ( the main idea of the cycle ) when you start a job in a marketing agency . if your new bos or supervisor see , that you understand the idea of the cycle and that you know how a certain product performs in the market , he will be glad to have you in his team . but if you would n't remember this concept at all , although you learnd it in university , your new bos would ask himself if he maybe made a mistake by employing you . if you just forget the correct name of all the stage of the cycle ( the fact ) , he would probably not even notice it . and if , you could easily find the answer in a book or in the internet . but remember that it is impossible to understand the whole idea or concept but just looking it up in the internet quickly ! of course it is also important for all student to know some fact . for instance a doctor must know the different indication between a little injury and a double-broken bone and a lawyer must have a really broad knowledge of the most common law . but in my opinion the main reason why student go to university is that they need to learn to connect the given fact . no-one can be a lawyer by simply knowing all the law , he must have the ability to connect the given information ( law ) with the different opportunity to use them . he must have a concept . he will use a law-book with all the fact to help him , but he go to university to learn what to do with the law-book .
