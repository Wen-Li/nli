is understanding idea and concept more important for student than learning fact ? this question is quite hard to answer . to give an opinion on this topic , we will discus these point with the use of example . first of all , understanding idea and concept is crucial . how can you understand an issue when you do n't know anything about the subject ? you must know the basic idea and concept . let 's take an example : the war in the middle east , to get your own opinion on this issue you must know what ha been going on there , you have to understand the concept and idea of the area . another example could be found in economics , you have to understand how a company work in order to manage it well . thus , idea and concept are essential in education , they are the base of your knowledge like the first brick of a wall . on the other hand , fact are important too . they help you to understand the concept and idea , they provide you further information . they are the painting on the wall , sometimes useful but not essential . moreover , i do n't think learning fact is an interesting way of learning . how can you analyze the fact that you just have learnt when you do n't know the concept and idea underneath ? that 's why i think learning fact is n't a crucial a understanding idea and concept for a student . to sum up , i agree with the statement `` it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . '' . time should be increased on understanding concept and idea more than learning fact , nonetheless we sould n't neglect fact , even if they are not vital to build our knowledge , they still add something more .
