for beginning this essay , i just want to ask a question . if you win with a game 100 dollar , you will be happy , it 's obvious . now , if with a game , you win first of all 200 dollar , and afterward in the same game you lost 100 dollar , eventually you will win 100 dollar , but will your feeling be the same in the two case ? the really thing which is very important , is not a situation at an precise moment , but the evolution which lead u to a situation . thus , even if we are in a very good situation ( in work , family or friend ) , and this situation stay like that for a long time , our feeling will not be the same , because at the beginning there is a changement which do that we are happy , but after there is not thing which influency our life , so we take the thing differently . for example , we can quote , richard branson , who ha a successful life , but he try new thing all the time , like diversify it company ( virgin ) , or thing more crazy like do a turn around the earth in balloon , travel in the space ( not yet do , but maybe soon ) . by all mean , there is also people who prefer do n't take risk and stay in the same situation . i think that there is not many people in this case , because if there is not evolution in our life , it become boring . obviously , there is some situation exceptional where it is not right . for instance , i do n't think that michael schumarrer ( ex f1 pilot ) wa bored by the fact that each year during five year he won the championship . but it is a special case . for me , the most important in the life is the evolution , to come back to my introduction , obsviously i think that we are not in the same feeling in the two case ( besides , some study show that it is right ) . so , i agree that people ( not only successful people , but in particular ) try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know to do well .
