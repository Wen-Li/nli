i do not agree that the best way to travel is to be a part of group which is led by a tour guide , i feel so because i do not enjoy much when i travel in group with more peopleand led by a tour guide , especially with people who i do n't know much . eventhough travelling with group led by tour guide is quite comfortableand have lot of advantage , i feel it ha many other drawback . first of all time is an important factor , i feel that travelling in group with a tour guide will not give u enough time to spend in all place we visit , more over they follow a schedule which may not be always acceptable to all people . recently i went to nigara fall there we contacted a tour guide and we were asked to join a large group who also were visiting the same palce , he wa so quick and did not allow u to spend more time in certain place which we really liked , we felt that we really missed a lot of fun by joining the group . the second reason that i perefer to travel alone is that i find it challenging to fine my self variuos place to be watched , i really enjoy it . furthermore if we travel in a group led by tour guide , he provides a lot of un interesting information which i really do not enjoy and feel a waste of my valuble time , if i were travelling myself i would have avoided it and would have spent more time in certain place i really liked . the other factor that make me to prefer travelling alone is food , if we travel in group the tour guide will suggest some restuarants for having food during tour which may not include my choice of a particular place and is not possible because it will delay the schedule of the tour guide or out of reach during the time alloted by the tour guide , for example in my tour to nigara fall we want to have good food at a particular indian restaurant , we could not have that a he stopped his tourin vehicle some where else which can not be reached with in the time alloted by the tour guide overall i prefer to travel alone
