pepole usually think that yong people enjoy life more than older people do . but i am not agreed it . in my opinion older people enjoy life mor than yong people . firstly , today , people on the world are more and more . as a yong man , they will find a lot of chanledges , that is older people can not thiking . i am a yong people , i wa born in china , there are too many people . i wa a student , i leave school in july . in my university , one millien people in there . today , we are friend , but when we leave school , we will be fight each others . secondly , yong people should have there own house . but it is too expensive to buy for a yong people , who leave school just now . pariends were stay at home , although the goverment will give them some money each month , it is not enough . yong people must give there pariends money to help them . but yong man will have there child also . thirdly , yong people have a lot of friend , some of them are classmate in school , some of them are new friend when work . they will have some partty , it is a lunge spending . i am worker now , i will gain 2500 rmb pre-month , it including all of mine . give some money to my pariends , a part to house owner , a part to phone , some use to keep friendship . i have none . fourthly , older people have a lot of time to enjoy their live . they are not work any more . goverment and their child will give their money each month . they can vasit each they want . bucause all above of the all . i am sure that , older people enjoy life more than yong people .
