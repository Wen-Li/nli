for some people , you will suceed in your life just by taking risk . and it is right , in a certain way . in fact , our society show admiration for these kinf of people . but we have to go deeply in this field to demostrate another side of this way if living . first of all , let u consider in which way taking risk could be a good strategy . if you are used to take risk by trying new thing , you will become more and more famous . in that respect , our society are prouded of these behaviour of sort . for example , you do n't have passed your exam when you were young . but you succeed in building your own business . then , journalist put forward your activity and all the risk you are able to take . thanks to these article , you will become famous . due to these side , this strategy seems very attractive . but , some people , in order to become more and more famous , will take too much risk . people who adopt this strategy have to be very carreful . on the other and , we trend to forget negative side of this strategy . actually , if you take risk to succeed in your life , it would induce issue such a financial issue . for instance , you own a shop . you have to finance this shop , by getting a lot of money on it . if this shop doe n't work in the long run , you would have debt . it may lead to financial issue with your bank . according to me , it is a lack of consciousness , especially when you are in charge of a family . this argument is far from being useless . when you make the choice of taking risk to succeed in your life , you must be awared of this . to sum up , i ca n't help thinking that taking risk is a very good strategy . as far a i am concerned , i am convinced that some people should try this strategy because of their nature . the others sould carry on their habit of living .
