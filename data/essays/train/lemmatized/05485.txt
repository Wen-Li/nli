knowledge is the key to success , is a saying which go a long way . without knowledge we a human are incomplete and not worth much . its knowledge which seperates a fool from a learned . the most important form of knowledge in today 's world is academic knowledge . academis knowledge is what one need today to make a stand in society . without academic knowledge one can not go far in life . i am personaly of the opinion that a broad knowledge of many academic subject is better than specializing in just one subject . with the fast changing world it better to have broader perspective and that includes broader knowledge in academic subject . i feel this way because in today 's fast changing and ever evolving world it better to have knowledge about more subject that to be restricted to specific knowledge in just one subject . academic knowledge help u choose the career we wish to pursue in life . if we are versed with various type of subject our choice are vast . we are not limited to a particular subject and the few option available with it . we have a kaliedoscope of choice to choose from since we are better equipped with more information about various subject . we have it in our hand to choose from those subject which we were able to cope with or find interesting or feel an aptitude for . therby if we just specialise in a single academic subject we are limiting our own self restricting our very own choice . we also have the advantage that at any stage when we feel that a particular subject that we studied can not be continued a a profession we can always fall back upon the other subject we had studied and then adapt ourselves to our new career accordingly . to know whats best for u we have to have knowledge about more than one subject . only if we study a subject will we know if we are mede for it or not or if we can apply it to our future or not . and lastly i would like to mention that knowledge of every kind is useful . the more you know the better equipped you are . the variety of subject you study the more aware you become and it hepls you improve and grow a a person . if you stick to one particular subject it becomes monotonous and you tend to stagnate . for a balanced overall development and approach toward life one need to be oriented with a variety of subject . and therby i would like to end by saying that academic knowledge should always be welcome in variety and abundance and not restricted to a particular subject because the day the mind stop learning and gaining knowlegdge , it stop being alive .
