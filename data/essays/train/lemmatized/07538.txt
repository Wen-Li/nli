have you ever seen on television and advertisement that say that you are going to loose ten pound in a week ? i heve seen this kind of add many time no just on t.v. but in the news , radio , etc . at the begining i did trust them and i used to buy every single product that eventually will make me loose my extra-weight and make me look better . but then i just realized that the advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . five month ago i saw on t.v. an add about the pill of the century . acoording to them `` the pill will absorve the excess of oil in your body in just two week and you will have the shape you have ever drum with '' . i bought the pill and after two week i end up with five more pound . some copanies make their product seem much better than they really are just to sell and enhace their proffits , but how abot the consumer ? do they really care about the frustration of a girl like me for getting weight with their product instead of loosing it a they said ? the unswer is easy , they have the money they do not care about the rest . for instance , that time i rise a claim to the company against the product . i asked them for my money back . their unswer wa : you should have exercised and not been a cauchpotatoe , the product that we sell is not a magic pill . in conclusion , company should advetise their product a they really are . making them seem much better is the same that lying to the consumer , and if it is not a maggic product they should advertise it too , so that next time i wo n't be a couch potatoe and i will enroll in a gym .
