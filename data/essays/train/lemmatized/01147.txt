i believe that younger people enjoy life more than the older people do . young one have nothing to worry about and they always remain close to their parent , pal and obviously cartoon which keep them happier . the older people have much more thing to make their life enjoyable but the kind of enjoyment young one take , it just cant be compared firstly , they dont have any sort of tension in their life a the older one have . it 's a very wise saying that , `` life is too short buddy , dont spend the time of your life in worry '' . older one have responsibility towards their family , their job , their society which make their life somewhat miserable and full of worry a compared to the young one . many philosopher also have supported the view that child are the most innocent specie on the earth . so , obviously being innocent and without worry may be sound impractical to an older man but in reality this is the main reason behind being happy the family and friend of a child act a an agent of socialisation teaching them the difference between the good and the bad . these agent of socialisation always put them in such a domain where the child will always prosper . they bring every thing for the child that is necessary for his goodwill and for leading toward a bright future . friends are also play a big role in developing a childrens life which make their life enjoyable thirdly , they can do the thing in their future what the older people do , for instance , going to a club or mountain trekking or having a girlfriend . but the older people cant have the type of fun the young one have a they cant switch back to their past . we heard many time older people saying , `` wish i would be young again '' and many song too by famous artist . thus , family , friend and all of the agent of socialisation having around the child to keep take care of them , child dont have the thing called worry . and if they have , then santacluase always present around them to make them happy
