i disagree with the statement and it is what i do n't like of the intruction system of my country . i 'm studing engeneering and i have to study a lot of thing , a lot of idea and concept of difficult subject . my professor only explain concept difficult to understand and , important too , to remember for the exam . i see that there is something wrong because if i study very much for the exam and i barely remember a concept , two week before i ca n't remember that concept because i do n't undertand it or because i have n't a fact that can conduce me to remember the concept . i think if a professor tell a fact or a story to support a main concept or idea i can using that fact or story to remember and , most important , to understand it . i can say this because i had a professor of ecology and he wa very different from others professor . he only spoke about fact of little animal to reach the main concept of their reason to leave a place . or for example he explained a chinese problem with the woman population . he told that a chinese man can be considered a man only when his son put him in the ground for his death . for this reason when a chinese man had a doughter he kill her because chinese government do n't want family of more than five person , so the woman decreased . with these example i understand and i remember ecology thing after three or four year . i think that is the best metod to explain complicated concept too , and it is a funny and not hard way to understand and remember thing of different subject .
