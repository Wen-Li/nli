the statement raise an important issue of the modern society . i completely agree to this statement . it ha been seen that a the society is progressing the interaction of youth with the society , that constitutes it proximity , is decreasing . this declining communication restrains them from taking the initiative of supporting their community . with the advance in technology young people have started spending more time in playing with the device that they treat a the source of entertainment . consider for example television and computer . if an option between watching television or doing some social work is given to a bunch of young people then most of them would choose to stay at home and watch some tv show rather than taking the pain of doing social work . these technological gadget and source that promise to amuse the user do very little to motivate them for any community help . hence they never realize the need of involving themselves into any social help . moreover very little effort are put into to make the young people realize about the responsibility of helping out the nation and community . young people do n't want to help their country because they can survive happily without doing that . another reason that might supplement the above mentioned reason to spare very little time for the young people is the expectation of the family . every family want to see their child a a succesful person . very few family would like to see them a a citizen who is trying hard to help his community . this combined with the vast variety of source of entertainment push the youth into a vicious circle where he/she either spend his time trying to fulfill his dream or relaxing after the long duration hard work . these point explains the reason for the unavailability of enough time with the young people . but this should not be a justification . the modern society , which we call the developed society , is actually abasing itself if we compare the behaviour of the today 's youth with that of the previous generation .
