every one know that when we are learning we learn fact and idea . no one in the world can change the fact becusae fact are fact . some people just like to know the fact and they do not pay attetion to other idea . in my case , i strongly beilive that understanding idea is more important for student that understanding fact . i think like this beause of many aspect which are a good way to learn how to respwct others , make you creative and make you persuisve . first , understanding idea open very good and big way of thinking . it make you think and respect other 's opinion . if we look at fact , we will find that most of thefacts were just idea in the past and by disccuss them they becam fact . second , trying to understand idea is a good way to make your brain working . it make you creat new idea and new opinons . on the other hand , understanding fact is like open your mind , put thing in it and close it . third , understanding idea led you to the fact . i beilive that most of the fact are coclusions for idea . if you understand the idea you can easly figure out the fact . i think understanding idea teaching u how to be a persuisve person because when you are trying to get a result from an idea , you are following certain and clear step . this certain way of thinking can appears on your personality . finally , i belive that understanding idea is very important but also we can not say understanding fact is not important . we should know the main and important fact of every thing . on the other hand , we do not o make understanding fact our way of learning and thinking . i beilive of that because of many aspect which are a good way to learn how to respect others , make you creative and make you persuisve .
