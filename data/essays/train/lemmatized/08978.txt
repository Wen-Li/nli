some people might think that it is more important for student to learn fact , while others think understanding idea and concept are more important . in my opinion , however , knowing idea and concept are much valueable than just learning fact . i agree with the statement for two reason , if understood idea and concept , the student could use the theory in other aspect when studying various happening not only in their academic study , but also in ordinary life . and the student might think more logically . firstly , understanding idea and concept will help the student about the related factor . they can use the theory they have learned in many area . for example , science knowledge can be happened in our real life . in the kitchen , in the garage , in the play ground , and so on . if the student have understood about some various theory they can understand the happening that they have seen . like newtons theory ; the object usually fall to the ground , easy scientif knowledge like , if ice melt it get into liquid . .. etc . and they can deal with it when emergency situation , too . secondly , just learning fact would interrupt student when thinking logically . students those who get used to memorizing fact will have a hard time when they have to solve logical problem . for instance , especially to those who are in language major student are mostly get used to memorizing . i heard that professor in chinese language course warning to the student practice thinking logically , unless they will have hard time when they go into some company . to sum up , it is essential for student to get the idea and concept than just memorizing and learning fact . so that the student can get knowledge which can be related to our ordinary life , and could think rationally . that is why i agree with the statement .
