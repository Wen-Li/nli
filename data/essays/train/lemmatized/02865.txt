some people might say that using a tour guide is a waste of money . but , porsonally , i agree with the idea that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . my primally reason is that using a tour guide is more safe than not using . especially , people who participate in the group travel have le experience going abroad . they are completely lack of knowledge about this foreign country . a tour guide have much experience and many information about it . for expamle , in asia , there are many dangerous area which almost all residens keep away . if you are teached by a tourist about this imformation , you will not face to the dangerous situation . however , it is truth that there are poor guide . preventing you from hiring a bad tourist , you should choose the big company which provides good service . second reason is that the tour guide can lead you to the good place where you cant not detect by yourself . espescially , in a short trip , you should go aroud some country in a hurry , and you do not have enough time to spare . in this point of view , the existence of a tour guide can reduce the waste of time . in addition , he can provide much information which make your trip more exiciting . if you do not hire a tour guide , you will regret hardly . most all of people seldom go on a trip , at most , once in year . it is important for u to make much effort to make good plan . in the case , a tour guide can support your trip . considering above all reason , i agree with the idea that a group travel must be accompanied by a tourist . it is worth of paying additilnal charge .
