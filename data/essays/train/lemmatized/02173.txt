do the young people enjoy life more than older people ? my answer is exactly no beacuse of two reason ; one of the reason is that the life is so hard to understand to young people because of their lack of experiment and education . and the understanding the life can raise the taste that you take from it . the other reason is that you can know about yourself much when you get older , and if a person know about himself/herself enough , this maturity give him/her a chance to rule on him/her life in a more correct way , so they can enjoy their life more than the others . knowledge about life and about ourselves . i think that they are the key of happinies . socrat , the famous greek philosopher , say that `` know him/herself '' . i think this advise is explain the most important thing in human life .
