i agree in part with the statement , but i do n't think that those are the only two characteristic a successful person ha . in my opinion , those characteristic are strongly associated , if not derived , from self-confidence . a person that is self-confident is not afraid of trying new thing and taking risk . in a way it ha to be a person that know that whatever happens there is always a way to make thing work . on the other hand , i disagree in part with the statement because there is a good amount of people who have success and not necessarly take risk or try new thing , in fact they do what they know well or are especialized in . could it be that success is associated sometimes to luck ? there ha been a lot of people , throughout history that they had a good idea , but it wa n't the moment and year later it became a reality . in my opinion , in order for a person to have success a variaty of factor should come together , such a , personality trait , knowledge and the moment or period of time he or she is born . success involves a large scope . a person may be successful in his or her professional life but he or she is a failure in social aspect . taking risk and trying new thing may be applicable and a desirable characteristic for a person that run a business , but i strongly disagree that it will be a desirable trait in a relationship . so , to call a person successful i consider it is important to see not only a part of a that person 's life and in order to have success characteristic do n't limit only in taking risk and trying new thing .
