some people agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . other people disagree with the statement . personally , i think that young people do enjoy life more than older people do for several reason . young people have more strength , hope , and friend . first of all , young people have more physical strength than older people do . for example , young people can go swimming in summer , and go skiing in winter . however , older people , such a people around eighty , can not swim or ski anymore due to their physical strength . especially , sport like skiing are dangerous to them . if they fall off , they might break their bone since they are not strong enough a they used to be . furthermore , young people can travel around and walk whole day long . when young people go to other country to travel , they can go to many place and enjoy the place a much a possible ; however , older people easily get tired and can not move around a young people do . they spend their time in hotel which is not very exciting . in addition to having physical strength , young people have hope and dream toward their future . for instance , young people study hard and try their best in order to achieve their dream . even though they face some difficulty , they do not give up . young people have bright future ; therefore , they put their effort into everything to create and change their future . on the other hand , older people can not change their future that much anymore . they get up and eat and go to bed again . their daily life cycle would not change anymore . therefore , i think their life is much more boring than young people 's . lastly , young people have more chance to get to know many people , and they can make many friend who surely make their life more exciting . for example , when they go to school , there are many classmate , and when they go to company , there are many co-worker . all the people they meet definitely have some influence on them . when they have something happy , they can share their happiness to other people . furthermore , when they have some difficulty with anything , people around them might be able to help them . young people learn important thing from people around them a they grow up . it is clear that young people enjoy life more than older people do . they know how to entertain themselves by having more strength . they know how to create better life with hope by working hard . they are influenced and inspired by many friend and people around them .
