i disagree with the statement saying that it is better to have broad knowledge of many subject rather than specializing in one specific subject . i will illustrate my view below . there is an english proverb which beautifully fit in the above case : `` a jack of all is a master of none . '' in the past scientific knowledge wa relatively limited a compared to now . now many new field have been developed and even in a single field there are many sub division . for e.g. computers . before there no sub-divisions in the field of computer but now we can broadly classify them a hardware , software , middle-ware , internet & networking , etc . even in these sub-divisions we can have several more option . the point i am trying to make here is that field are more diverse and varied then they were before . hence it is simply not possible to excel in all of them and having only a general idea about them will not suffice . additionally knowledge ha become more and more complex than before . having a general idea about thing is not enough to perform the task adequately . for e.g. a cfo ( chief financial officer ) of a company ha reasonable knowledge about law . so doe it mean that he will be a competent a a lawyer specialising in these task ? alternatively a lawyer can not do adequate justice to the job of a cfo . let me illustrate my point further . would you like to live in a building which ha been made by person having a `` general '' idea of construction , architecture and engineering or would prefer living in a building made by a team of expert in their respective field . focus on one topic inspires confidence not only in others but also in the person doing the job . hence with the point above i have best tried to justify my conclusion .
