travel agency suggest their service travelling in a group led by a tour guide . and mant people use this service for their safety and guide 's profesionality . but one of unversity student , i disagree with a group travel along tour guide there are two reason why i prefer travel by my self : opportunity for learning other nation and saving my money . forst of all , traveling a group with tour guide remove my opportunity for learning other naton 's culture . i had a chance to trip in vietnam about two year ago . there wa guide for our group . most of our group did not concentrate guide 's explain and he did not care about it . and i needed to keep our group so i do not have profer time to enjoy senary and food . i went around at night with buying some beer and snack . it is more exciting and memorable . if i did not go out along and do noting the travel wa just waste of a few day . second guide fee is expensive . i do not have enogh money and there si many way to prepare travel plan , reservation for hotel and search for air plane scedule by using phone , travel book and internet . when i wa in savoy for visiting my cousin . i traveled a lot of place in u.s.a . i usually saw the travel guide book in the university library near my cousin ' house or searched the net . so i did not spend unnesaccery cost such a guide fee . in conclusion , i would like to travel without a your guide and along . i want to prepare my travel schedule bv myself and save my money not spend guide fee . traveling is one 's opportunity for broading their knowledge and expeirences . making their plan and behavioring more activites will help their exciting travel .
