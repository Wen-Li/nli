it is obvious that people have more energy and desire in the earlier time of their life , however this doe not indicate that young people would enjoy life more than older people do . i think that it is possible to enjoy life at all age , provided that we keep our spirit and mind contemporary and young . most people say that there are certain thing that can only be done when we are young . for instance , extreme sport , partying late hour , eating excessively or even falling in love . i agree the fact that there are certain activity that we can not perform after a certain age , nevertheless i believe that it is not only a matter of activity that keep u young but it is the state of mind we are in . basically , i think that there are different joy people get from life when they are young and old . when we are young , we search for the unconventional , unfundamental and extraordinary and we can go for it no matter what . as we get older , we begin to think of the result , effect and evaluate situation more carefully . these are the different level of joy that we can get when we are young and old . youth brings along lot of energy , excitement and desire to reach the unknown and accomplish the undone . this ha a certain joy factor , but only a long a we are young . trying to act such cluelessly in older time may lead u to alienment from life and society because we have more responsibility a we grow older . even though our responsibility increase and we may be limited by the society a we get older , i do not think that we would be enjoying life le . if we could accept getting old and adopt ourselves to the changing environment , we can always enjoy life because there is an endless energy in life , we only need to capture it and connect with it . no matter how large the number get on our age , we always have the opportunity to enjoy life if we have the energy and the mentality to do so . being dynamic and having a loving and caring family and friend that connect u to life would always enable u to enjoy life at all age .
