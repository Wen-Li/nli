i do not agree with the following statement that the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . and i prefer for travel alone even though i will face many unknown problem because i think it will save my time and i will go to anywhere i want to without limitation . many people have a traditional idea that they must be in a group led by a tour guide when they travel . but i think it is incorrect since it will waste your time . whenever you move to a new place , you must follow the tour guide 's step and can not control your time by yourself . what you should do is waiting all the time even though you have been exhausted . waiting for other people who belong to your group to prepare , and waiting for the tour guide 's tedious introduction of some famous buliding or carve which you are of interested of at all . eventually time is up , and you have not do what you are desired to except hearing the word `` because of no time , let u go back '' by your tour guide . the second thing is that you can go to any place you are interested in if you travel alone . without the tour guide you can go to the museum or theare which may not be included in the schecule of a group led by a tour guide . you can go the shopping mall to buy whatever thing you like instead of lining on the traveling group to shop in a mall which is the tour guide 's recommendation . finally you can alos have food in the restraunts where serve you well and make you feel gorgeous . so above are my reason that traveling by yourself can get lot of benefit . if i you make a decision to travel abroad and want to have a good time , try to do it by yourself .
