i agree with the statement saying that it is more important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact . it is more interesting to understand concept , because it will be a base you can use , modify or widen , whereas if you learn fact , you ca n't go further . let 's take example . to a student studying history it is very important to learn the fact , which is part of his knowledge . on the other sid , if he understands the logical connexion between various historical event : what led to them , which are the consequence and how they got resolved ? he will be more conscious of the subject , and thus will be able to explain it . in architecture for example , it is important to know some fact , that are milestone in the history of architecture , but what is more convincing , is not the application of fact , but the accurance of you concept when you will present your project . to me , there is a big difference between `` understanding '' and `` learning '' . if you learn something , you are only a `` recipient '' that is able to contain and to restitute information . you will not be able to talk about the subject , once you have quit the sphere of your knowledge . whereas if you understand a topic , you do not have a mental and intellectual limit anymore which are consequence of ignorance . nevertheless you can widen your knowledge and go beyond the limit once you have understood the idea and concept . in my opinion , both of them are complementary . you ca n't have a solid base if you do n't know fact , but in the same time , if you undestand idea and concept , it will help you to learn fact . but it i had to choose , i would rather understand concept than being limited by what i have learned .
