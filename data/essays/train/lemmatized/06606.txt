success is the word that one can achieve after lot of hard work done with the appropriate step taken at right time . not only that , one would to getting the knowledge and realize the thing that helped one to be successful . successful people tend to use there new idea and hence making them to try new idea with confidence . one would be setting new thing in their path once they are successful already in the field area they wanted . they may be risk in trying the new thing but they would be quick enough to pull out the profit out of it . for example let take reliance industry in india which ha expanded it busniess in all the area let it be mobile , petroleum , etc . they have tried to put new thing for there brand company . they took risk initially and they are successful in implementing there business right now . one should be innovative in thinking and would rather try to be successful in new thing which they ha ever tried before . successful person would put his startegies , budget , idea behind implementing them , how would they be helpful to each and every person in mind before practice it . as they are already know how to do well they would be trying to simulate the method they have tried to make it a success to the new thing they are trying to emerge . it would be good practice for succesful person to implement his idea in new thing and would help if they would be any crisis in the thin gthey are already doing well . as they are already through the different stage that one would be going through when they start new thing , successful people would be able to handle the consequence when they are risk attched to it . may be initially it would take time for a new implemention to gain profit or lower risk but later on it would be fruitful . they would be visualizing the future of the new thing that they will be going to implement beforehand . not but not the least one would be taking the pro and con of the new thing they would be trying . i think successful people are the one who could afford to take the risk to start a new thing rather than any ordinary person . in anyway there would be no development ecoomically if one stick to the thing they already done . i would definitely agree that a successful people should try new thing and take risk rather than doing the thing they already did well .
