some people believe that successful people shoud try new thing and take risk . others believe that successful people shoud only do what they already know how to do well . however , i believe that people should only do what they already know how to do well rather than trying new thing and taking risk . i have two convincing reason . they can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well . first , we can save time . if people want to try new thing , they have to do error and trial to establish new thing . it take time to establish new thing . if i want to establish new physic theory , i have to spend a lot of time to think about the theory , probably i have to spend my whole life . in contrast , if they only do what they know how to do well , they do not need to spend so much time . in the case of physic , they just need to remember physical law which alreadly known . thus , we can save time by doing what they already know how to do well . second , we can save money . if people want to try new tnings , they have to take risk . often they lose money because they fail to try new thing . many people want to have their own company . however , they do not because they want to avoid risk . for example , if i have enough knowledge about car technology and want to have new company to make car , i have to invest enormous money . in addition , i have to compete other car company like gm , ford and toyota which have far more money than i. thus , my car company will bunkrupt easily . then i will lost money . therefore , if people want to success , they should do what they already know how to do well . they can not expect to earn more money than they expect , but they can earn money a they expect . in conclusion , i believe that people should only do what they are alreay know how to do well rather than trying new thing and taking risk . i have two convincing reason . they can save time and money by doing what they already know how to do well .
