i do not agree with the statement that the number of car will be smaller in number in near future than they are today . it is evident that the traffic within the city center is getting worse each day and the public transportation is gaining increasing importance . especially around big city , like istanbul which i am living in , it is true that people are increasingly avoiding car usage due to the above mentioned reason and have the tendency to use public transportation or taxi etc. instead , which might lead one to think that the number of car will decrease in time . however ; there are other dimension of the subject . first of all , even if some people are becoming increasingly reluctant to use their car in city , most of them still feel it necessary to have one . the reason vary . one could be privacy , which you can not have with public transport . the other could be availability ; all of u have experienced not being able to find a taxi when you have an important appointment . your car is always at your service and is actually a medium for independence . besides , the increased number of suburban living area make the people living there almost totally dependent on car a public transportation is wider and more frequent around city center . finally , due to increased technology and the saturation level of the market , car come to the consumer at lower cost when compared to past . the company are extending product range to cover the maximim number of consumer within a wider range of economic status . therefore car are more affordable and also convenient to use compared to last two to three decade . i think these improvement will continue with an accelarated speed and car will reach a wider range of population . even if the frequency of the usage of an individual car might decrease , i think the total number of car in use could only increase during the next twenty year regarding the above mentioned reason .
