some people in japan , where i live , the life old people ha is more enjoyable , but i think young people enjoy life more than old people for the following reason . first , youg people can do many sport without concerning about their body . for example , when i wa a student at kaisei high school , one of the best university in japan , i wa on a baseball team whose name wa swallows . even now , i can remember those day easily . i practiced baseball with my friend every day . that wa the most enjoyable time for me . it wa not matter for me whether i could catch ball . the most impotant thing wa doing my best for catching white ball . the moment when i jump in to the ball wa the best moment . so , i think without exciting sport it the life is not enjoyable . second , the happiness to go to school is what only young people can get . for example , when i wa a student at waseda university in tokyo , japan , i had a school festival . our group decided to open waseda cafe . though we used a lot of time and money , we were happy because we could get important friendship . so , i think school is very good . as the reason and example show , i strongly believe that young people can have much more enjoyable time than that older people have .
