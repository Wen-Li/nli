at first , there are a great people said that : to be or not to be , that is a question . i still remembered this word , it makesme do not be lazy and should be still work hard . for my opinion i would like to say i agree the statement . there i would like to give ome short story . i do not konw whether the people had read a famose book name is `` who touch my cheese ? '' if yes . i think they will understand me . the book talking about two mouse and two small people they like ate cheese very much . the mouse they are animal , so the only can smell . but the people they are very claver . the can depends their mind to find where are the cheese . one day . they were found the cheese will be finished . the are tinking about the future what theycan eat . the mouse immidietely left their house and go outside to looking foe there new house where have kind of cheese when they found the cheese not have anymore . but the two people still set down the old place to waiting and dreaming . they dreaming for one day a lot of cheese appeard in the old house which the house they feel good . they still fall in the beautiful memorise and lost the confidence to got out and looking foe the new place . at the end . of course the mouse find a new place first . and the one of the small people find another one . the one people study a lot through the process . he think do not be afriad the risk in the future , maybe still do not have cheese . they will successed if they hold on their confidence . the people can not stop when they already successed for something . they still nedd work hard to continue , even there are tome risk in the future . but that can make people go the higher step and more seccessful .
