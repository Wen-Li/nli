i disagree with the statement because in my opinion this fact will not realize . because of the pollution , that exists in amount of quantity yet , the governaments will take misurs of security . the situation today is yet dangerous because the car in use are million and million i the world . even if there are better situation like in holland and in other northern country the situation is dramatic . in these country , life is more natuaral than in other country like italy , because abitants usually use bycicle to move . they prefer this way to the car . in italy , for example , don-t exist this attitude and this education for all or about all . but according to me for the nearby future we , human , will arrive to the point that we will have to constrict to use public service even if we don-t want or other service will be invent to permit u to move without car . the essential problem is not the car like object but is how and what it us to go , gasoline . with the many war of today , this element is another enormous problem , for example . yet this is a problem . for these problem i think that governaments will do law or other thing with the idea that today will not be the future . in this way car demand will be le than now but only if the governament will know how to fight all problem to garantee better service than today . an idea will be the sostitution of gasoline with a material le dangerous to the environment . this can cause le pollution but we need resourses for this new gasoline . the fact are difficult for u , people who live in different city , what will be the better thing to do , especilly how will be our reaction at this changement . i don-t know , but i hope in a positive
