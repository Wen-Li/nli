though discussed for long , the question that wether to have broad knowledge of many academic subject or to specialize in one specific subject is better doe n't have a peaceful end . for my opinion , i prefer to have a knowledge structure with more broadth rather the more specific . there are three advantage of a broad knowledge make me feel like it : firstly , broad knowledge mean tends to support more comunication between people which mean more understand . you 'll get more character in common with others when you share some knowledge with others , so you 'll probably get to know what the like and dislike for other people , for example , my father can understand me quite well for he know all that what i have known ; secondly , this will make you more successful in social activity . as you understand others more and give them what they want , get rid of what they do n't want , you 'll build a good relationship with any others and gain their help when you need . as for example , many political leader and business champion are this kind , such a bush and bill gates . last but maybe the most important point , you 'll find the knowledge of each specfic domain are connected to each other . in fact , under some situation , the connection is even more important in each of the individual one . take computer lingustics for example , before 1980 , lingustics is not considered to be a popular research area , but after the induction of computer , more and more organization and people devote themselves in it , even govment cast an interest on it , and it is a hot research domain now , both for domain of lingustics and domain of computer science . since all of above , i prefer to have a knowledge structure with more broadth rather the more specific .
