some people think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . on one hand i agree with this idea but on yhe other hand i think it is not true . of course young people have usually no responsabilities and serious problem to be sad . they play game and they live without thinking to their future . young people are very innocent and they ignore all the tragical event of the life . this time is the best period for dream , and young people think that they have all their life to do what they want . when we become older , we loose this part of dream which caracterizes young people . death and illusion have destroyed our part of innocence . but i can barely believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . happyness depends on lot of factor . even if old people have already lived a big part of their life , i think this experience is the best way to appreciate the event . i mean that happyness depends on the value we give to an event . old people usually know what is the most important in the life . there is a kind of wisedom which help old people to be happy and to enjoy life . moreover many young people have a lot of problem . they are not protected against the event of the life like illness . so i think that those two period offer different way to enjoy life . we do n't enjoy the same thing on the same age . each life 's period is like a season which give a lot of fruit . i think the real difficulty is to pick up the fruit . ..
