there is a controversial issue about whether in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . depend on personal experience , personality type and viewpoint of the globe , we may find that some people may hold the opinion that there are more car in twenty year than in today , on the other hand , some people may choose there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than in today . the choice , nevertheless , is not easy to make . however , from my point of view , i would like to believe the later one is more reasonable . for there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than now , my argument are listed a follows . a essential reson can be seen by everyone is that the gas released from the car in big city pollute the environment around u seriously . according to a recent survey accounced by the a dminister of health of china , the car gas pollution account 38.7 % in the total pollution which harm our environment . this strongly demonstrates that the car pollution is very harmful for our atmosphere and there should be le car used in our life . another reason of my inclination is that the numberous car make the city become overcrowed and it is very unconvenient for people to go to study , work and so on . for instance , in big city , it usually take one person live in outskirt one or even two hour to arrive the company he/she work in in the center of the city . so this is very convenient a . althrough i agree that there are a couple of advantage of using car , but the disadvantges are more obvious , such air pollution , traffic jam , expensive fee for feeding car . taking account all the factor and recognizing the fact discussed above , i would like to maintain there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than now . in a word , even though there are many different view towards this topic , a far a i am concerned , i will vote the opinion that there will be fewer car in the future than in today , not the idea there will be more car in the future .
