i do n't believe this question can be answered by yes or no . it all depends on the people , on the activity of these people and in the period they live in . in the industrial revolution for example , you had to try something new to be successful because the activity were changing . an activity in which one might have performed well suddenly got surpassed and that person wa forced to change his activity . the people who made the right change became rich , others who had put their bet on the wrong horse became poor . in the actual time both way are possible to become successful . the first way would be to stick to something you know you can do well , but you have to do it better than everybody else . that usually is n't possible without investment and the risk that go with it . so i think that , in most case , there is no success without taking risk . another path to success would be to try something new . in that case the risk are usually higher , but if it wa the right thing to do , the reward are higher too . the difficulty here is that you have to get into the right thing at the right time . the advantage by trying something new is that if the new thing doe n't launch off , you can still go back to what you can do well . if that happens you probably wo n't get really successful , but you have tried . but to try something new is n't possible to everybody . to get into a new thing request the right idea and much bravery . most people stay in what they 're doing , even if they 're unhappy , because they do n't have the gut to make a change . in conclusion i would say that the most important factor for success are bravery , to take risk ; luck , to be in the right activity at the right time , the character to want to be better then the others and fantasy , to have the idea . of course , you also need the skill to then lead your activity to success .
