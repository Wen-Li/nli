although there are some people claiming importance of understanding idea and concept instead of learning fact , i disagree with this idea because of three reason . first , idea and concept are two intangible feature that you can not observe or prove with a scientific method . however , fact are real and ha been in the world before u . moreover , you can prove them with a scientific method . understanding fact make you understand your environment , which may lead you to understand your and other feature live . second , learning fact is more important than understanding idea and concept since you can create your own idea or concept after leraning fact . when you learned reality of life and thing that ha surrounded you , you would simply started to think about them and inferr various meaning a much a you can . without basing your idea on a fact most probably your idea would not be proven and may not become valuable . third , people can see importance of learning fact instead of understanding idea and concept because by learning only idea and concept one may tend to copy those idea like he or she ha owns , which is called plagerism . without knowing the reality and fact that are behind of an idea one can argue or defend an idea which is not her/his . to sum up , it is more important to learning fact than understanding idea and fact . god may be think and than create the world , but people ha seen the world and than started to think about it .
