i personally feel that this kind of situation will never occur in next twenty year . because of the rapid development in technology and in the machinery good and gadget , which are expecting more materialiastic gain from such kind of development . in our day to day life every thing is becoming so easy and fast . comparing with the older generation , car are rapidly changing in their mechanism a well in their outer apperance . due to which there is a great change in human life . for example , previously car were used only for transport so that they can easily reach their destination . but slowly they started adding luxurious comfort to this system by adding various element such a a/c , music system , lavish seat . . it go on . .. and due to the rapid development in the country with the competetion there are adding more and more comfort to the simple one . now a day due to the availaibilty of car in economic price every one are having access to buy a car . so there will be healthier comptetion between the car marketting company , a they try in different way to attract the customer by giving additional facility which is lacking in other car . due to this kind of competition there is a launch of many car per year with different name and different model , which is proved in a research . few company started manufacturing the car to get the publicity and to show their intresting innovation which will attract the customer and can simply remember the brand name ex : { ferrari } in other case the car which are very costlier and can never be affordable to the common man are increasing day by day . and buying these kind of car give more importance to their social status . so people work hardly and vigorously to buy these kind of car and can have a prestigious symbol or a tag with them . wenever these people go out for a drive it grab the attention of the others which make the car owner feel happy and make vivacious . i personally feel due to this kind of tremendous effort by the engineer they will improve a lot in the mechanism which make the customer very easy to drive a well to enjoy the comfort and luxury provided by them and there will be more number of car in the next generation .
