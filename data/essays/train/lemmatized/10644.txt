first of all i have to mention , that the statement doe not give any detail about the age or profession of a person . i think that the advantage and disadvantage of a broad knowledge just apply regarding to the state of socialization of an individual . a broad knowledge ha a lot of advantage in today world . i would even say , that a broad knowledge is nessecary in our world of globalisation . we live in a multiculturell and globalised world . that cause a damage to the individuality of a country . kulture , religion and knowledge get mixed up . since the globalisation support communication the broad knowledge is increasing rapidely . globalisation cause fusion of firm . combined firm need people with a broad knowledge and the ability to combine different subject rather than knowing everything about a specific topic . on the other hand it is nessecary for every company to have specialist in each field . for example : the it section in germany doe not have a lot of good qualified specialist . so the german gouverment applies for it specialist from india and pakistan . germany wou't be able to meet the world-wide average knowlegde in information technics without the help of those specialist . my opinion is , that it is nessecary to have a wide spread knowledge a a young person to be able to be flexible in a multiculturel civilization . on the other hand i have to admit that every succesful company need people with specialized knowledge to create knew knowledge . i come to the final decision neither to agree nor to disagree with the statement , since i believe that it isdependant on the age and spacific field of an individual whether the knowledge ha to be more broad or no
