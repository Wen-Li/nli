the humankind always need knowledge to reach good life standarts . everyone ha different aspect of this idea . some assume that it is more iportant for student to understand idea and concept , in contrary to this some assume that it is important for them to learn fact . i totally agree with second idea . these are my following reason . firstly , the reason the knowledge from learning fact is important is permanent . when people learn fact with experience , they do not forget easily . so they use these fact through all their life . for example , i had an car accident last year . before this event , my parent advised to not drive fast . i understood the idea , however it did not help me avoid to make accident . now , after accident i learn my lesson and drive my car slowly . in addition to this , the reason that the learning fact is more important rather than understanding the concept is to show an example of it in real life . the understanding the concept can be so abstract . for example , the concept of communism seems like so perfect , however in the real life this concept can not be worked well . so student can be confused by this abstract concept . as i mentioned above the learning fact is more important for student than understanding idea and concept according to these reason : it is both permanent and real . i think the teaching system should modify with these reason .
