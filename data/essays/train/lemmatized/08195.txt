i totally agree with the statement . the basic purpose of an advertisement is - publicity . and the more flashy an advertisement is the better publicity it attains . it all derives from the fundamental rule of business and marketing , that is , making profit . when a product is launched into the market , stress is laid on how wel it is advertised so that it catch the attention and interest of the mass and not on how wel it is going to stand upto their expectation . so the ground rule laid for the advertising company is to make the advertisement ( or ` ad ' a it is more preferably addressed ) a luring a possible . and hence , most of the time the ad end up promising much more than what the product actually deliver . on quite a number of occasion the ad have been found guilty of misleading the mass . they lead people to believe how safe and benefitial the product is when actually the safety front ha been compromised . the recent decline in the number of people indulging in soft drink after some toxic chemical were found in their content is a good example of how the advertisement blow the product out of proportion . in order to make huge profit every product is depicted a an ideal one but the the flaw only start appearing after a while when it is actually used for a period of time . the sad part is they prey on the most comely bait i.e. the common people . they are the one who have to bear the brunt of all the false claim made in the advertisement . making advertisement is a very innovative work it true , but it should never compromise on it ethic which on most number of occasion it doe . it should always be kept in mind that in a way it is also a mean of serving the people a it let them know about the thing that are available to them and that can make their life better in one way or the other . today most of the advertisement do not seem to realise this and are evasive of their responsibility towards the people and the society .
