because i am a collage student now in taiwan , and have a deep feeling of this situation that being indifferent about the environment around u . i must give some explanation that why we student in our generation are fail to have time helping our community . we student in taiwan are brought up by an attitude of life without caring about the environment around u , in a brief , we are growing in an selfish attitude even though the text book had taught u we should devote ourself while we can . most of time , we studying all the time to get good grade and burdened with so many pressure on studying . as a result , even we want to help our own community , we are really lack of time helping . some time i can see some club in campus which are tend to devote themselves in the servise of community , and it really have a great impact on those resident . but what i can see are just a small group of willing people . after all , what we student considered most now is how to get relax from our pressure and have fun for our limited young life , because we are pressed under the line in the textbook . take me for example , it seems i should enjoy my college student life . but i will graduate next year , and i am faced the pressure to apply the grauduate , i even do n't have time to relex because there are so many chore such a million of assignment and lot of part-time job task for me to deal with . how can i arrange my schedule to devote myself to community ? i agree on this statement that young people do n't give enough time to help their own community , but i think it is the education that cause this situation being indifferent about helping community . in my opinion , if we have the hope that our future generation have a passion to help others , we should teach them this attitude totally from their childhood .
