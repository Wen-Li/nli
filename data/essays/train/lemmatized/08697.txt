well i think that i also thought that at once , but now i realize that young and old people can enjoy the life the same way . a lot of people think that young people can enjoy the life better because they are more healthier and also they have no problem that make them angry or worried . without problem they think they can only think in the pleasure of the life but that 's not true . for young people there are other kind of problem that for them are really big , but when you get older you realize that those problem wa n't that important . old people say that is better when you are younger because for example you are not married or have childrens . with a family you ca n't take a lot of travel or thing like that bacause you must stay at home with your child and do thing like send them to school work for them and your husband , etc . instead when you 're young you do n't have to do any of those thing and only think of living your life and enjoy it . in another hand i think in another big example . my mom . yes my mom get married when she wa only eighteen and that year she have my brother and two year later she have me . she doe n't spend time on her and actually she did n't live her youth . but now that my brother and me are in the university she can redo her live and do thing that she always want to . for example she love to go out and hang out with her friend and family . one of the thing that she always want to do wa go to europe and now she did it . well , with this little example i can show other people that older people canenjoy their life too just like we , young people , do .
