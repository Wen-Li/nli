i am agree with that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific . someone around me i like them very much . it is because them have many knowledge to share with me , and from different subject . i am a person who always keep a heart of curious , i want to know every thing around me , why the bird fly , why machine work , i ask and ask , my friend give the answer , i think they are mr.know-all . it is not the most important reason for this topic . however , i may use a exampel to say . there is a chinses book wrote by many centries ago . people agrued about whether it is wrote by one person or two , and who is the second writer . many people searched in libery , history . but they had not succeed . about 50 year ago , a people who is specialized in stastics , gave u the answer with stastics mothed . he compered the sign , mark and languege signal , and then , he find out the book wa really wrote by two different writer . also , a you know , in science , physic and chemistry can not be without each other . with out chemistry , physic can not describe something happened . be very proudly , there wa a great chinese teacher thounsands year ago had talk about this topic . he said , if you had study one subject to the end , then you had already study others to the end . it is hard to say that to specialize in one specific subject is not so good . however , in my opinion , it is too narrow . a wide knowledge will give u a good reason to carry on our study . that 's all .
