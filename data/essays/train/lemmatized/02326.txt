unfortunately i am not totally agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . it is for sure that success encourage people to discover or invent new thing but if there is risk i am not sure that every people would be courage enough . after knowing how to succeed feel some people would like to live with it instead of trying new thing and have risk to fail on it . it is obvious that if you can not take risk you can not success . but risk is something you can take mostly when there is nothing you can use . for instance think about a director who had won oscar prize . now he did the best at his work and now people all over the world know him and expects a lot from him . the hardest movie he can make is his next movie . since he already is known a best and he ha to be the best for rest of his live . but what if he want to direct another kind of movie than he always do ? and what if he fails ? you think he can be that courage to risk his famous for just to do his ambition . i think not many people would do that . .. but on the other hand if people keep doing same thing then who going to discover or invent or try new thing ? only the young people or the people who never had got awarded yet ? but what about experience then ? experience is important to success something . to put it in a nutshell i would like all successful people try other thing than they had already done . that is how creativeness can improve i think . but also i dont believe most people can take risk .
