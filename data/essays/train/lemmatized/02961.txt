i think that there is not a general answer to the statement , because it depends on the course and on fact and concept object of them . surely , it is very important for student to learn idea and concept , but it doe not mean that everytime they are more important than fact . there are some course , for example history , in which the fact are the main important part of the program : therefore , if we , according to the statement , will not give the correct importance to the fact , history will be more bored and le important . for example , it is important to know idea spreaded in the america in the eighteen century befor the war of indipendence , but i think that it is more important to know fact which caused the war of indipendence . however , in other course , especially in science and math , the idea and concept are considered the most important thing to learn and to teach ; since , although it would be interesting to know the life and the different way to discover thing tried by isaac newton , the core information about him are the idea and the discoverings . moreover , i think that idea , concept and fact are argument which increase the culture of a person , and indipendent on the school purpose , it is nice to know something which is suitable . unfortunally , student prefer to study only to achieve good grade , without give importance on the real meaning of the argument , for such reason it could happen that will be more important what will be for available for thei aim . in conclusion , i think that it is important to understand when it is more important a fact and when it is more important an idea or concept , so i disagreed with the statement , since i think that it is not right to apply such concept to all course .
