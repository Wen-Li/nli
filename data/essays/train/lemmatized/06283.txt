since the younger people have more energy , some may argue that young people enjoy life more than older people do . personally , i disagree with the statement . i belive that the older people have better understanding of life and therefore are capable to enjoy their life more . first , a people get older they experience different situation and learn various thing . older people tend to know more about how life work and be capable of accepting thing a they are . younger people , on the other hand , tend to complain about their life more . they are always dissatisfied with their life and thing happening around them . they spend more time on questioning and complaining about thing than on accepting thing and moving on . older people , having experienced in different situation , can look at thing more objectively and move on faster . second , younger people spend more time on different thing such a studying and working than the older people . young people are often too busy trying to achieve what they want to take a closer look at their life and understand what they really need for their life . in the novel , tuesdays with morrie by mitch albom , for expample , morrie , the old professor who wa dying , tell the reader how young people tend to waste their time trying to earn more money when what they really need is each other . as people get older , they learn the valuable thing in their life and tend to enjoy theri life more than the younger one who are often stressed out about their job or status . finally , one may argue that young people often are capable of spending their time and engergy on doing something wild and therefore can enjoy their life more . who say doing something wild is the only way to enjoy one 's life ? sitting around at home and having a relaxing converstion with some friend could be more enjoyable than trying to jump off a bridge with a rope attached to oneself .
