in my opinion , i think it is much more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . when student in school , obviously they can learn almost every thing form the teacher , but after they graduating they have to lean the social skill all by themselves . before they are going to learn the social skill indivisually they need to know how to learn by themselves , there is no teacher anymore . as a student in high school , there is a math teacher of mine always tell u that preview the lesson before learning is much better than doing nothing before lesson . preview the lesson and learn it all by ourself is useful for u to know how we can learn by ourselves without the teacher . we always face some the question that confuse u and there are also several question we can not solve easily . we have to face them and try our best to solve it , we do not have to care about whether we will get this question or not while we are doing the preview . if we finally solve them all by ourself , then we are not only feeling well but also earning the expirence about learning indivisually . if we can not find out the way to solve the question , we should bring them to ask the teacher while we are in the class . we can learn how to solve these kind of question only by teacher point out some way that we can go , because we have already tried it before the teacher start teaching . it is also a good way to remember this kind of question . when we face it in a quiz or test , we will easily remember what the teacher ha taugh and find out the solution . not only thesis , we also learn the skill of how to study independly which i think it is most important . when we finish our education in school , we are going to find a job or whatever we need to do . many of thins that we have learn all by ourselves . and the way we can learn thing indivisouly is to get the idea and concept then it is for u to learn fact .
