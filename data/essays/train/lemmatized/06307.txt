i agree with the most advertisement ( ad ) make product seem much better that they really are . there is two resons such that ad 's pictuers or tv comashales are not same a real product , and ad have to show that the product are looking nice . the first of all , most ad are over acting because ad 's pictuers are very butifule and look nice . for example , some buger chane restrant give u the ad on tv . in the tv , the bugers are very big and fresh , but real one is not look a like ad 's . also , car ad is a well a the burger ad because the car run in the mountan for faster but in the real life , nomal car can not do that . so ad are shown much better that real one by creaters . the next , ad have to show the product that are looking nice , so ad are made much better than real one . the ad have to grab or cach people 's interest , so ad are made nicer than real . for example , if a restlant give an ad to people , they make some food pictuers . the pictuers are have to look nice . the picters can not smell so creater make some trick to look smell good . pople look the pictuer . they think the restlant make such nice food and then they would go . so the ad is made nicer than real one because it have to look nice . most ad are made much better than real once becasue ad 's and real product are not same because for example , the humbirger is not looking same a ad 's . and the other reson is that the ad have to look nice becaseu of advrtisements . the ad have to foock the people a many a they can . therefor ad ' product and real one are not same .
