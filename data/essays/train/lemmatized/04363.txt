given the choice about young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community i agree or disagree . i agree this topic . there are three reason wa followed . first , our eduction never encouraged them : `` you need to help their community . '' instead of community helping always become a way to make them be good . so , they did n't want to join the community helping . they feel this is not a good thing . second , young people have too many choice to get a right one . today in taiwan , homework always full of young people time . it is impossible that claim they to help community . young people always feel too tired to do others thing . they only care about their grade . third , young people merely think what is good for them . and their point always on dress , money , entertiment . they did n't want to pay some time or money to help community . they feel this question of government . to sum up , i think young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . i think we should educate our young people to helping thier community . because they can get many benifits when they start to pay their time . helping community is a good thing we should do it .
