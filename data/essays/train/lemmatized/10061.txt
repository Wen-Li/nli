the concept of success due to risk taking or not is hard to explain , and it is also a controversial one . on the one hand , taking risk is something very exciting but dangerous at the same time . on the other hand , keeping his/her knowledge and never taking others is more comfortable , but all the same dangerous too . but in my opinion , i think that the key of any succes is to take some risk . first of all , taking risk in all field of life make the person more stronger in his/her mind , even if they can be dangerous . but you have to be enough intelligent to check your ability to know if one risk is very dangerous or not . for example , when you know that when you will do this or that it can be a threat for you , a you can lost your money , you do not take it . but in another way , the risk doe an attractive thing to you that you want to try . that is the vicious feature of the risk that can lost you . secondly , i think that if anybody would have taken risk , our society would not be so effective ! for instance , the hardest part of the company created here were created by people who have taken risk . .. and if someone never take just one time a risk in his/her life , probably he/she ha gone next to marvellous thing . finally , my device is to try something even if you are not sure of the result . and if you are really motivated , you will gain what you want and accede to success . there is no failure when taking good risk , that is to say risk that can not destruct your life . but he most important thing is to be able to know the limit . in a nutshell , someome who never take risk is someone too angry and who will never win a real success . to sum up all the thing , taking risk is something very important in anybody 's life and overall , it can make the people to dream about thing that they could realize one day , and to look for the future .
