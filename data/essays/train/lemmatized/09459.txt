i believe that young people enjoy life more than older people do . i am certain of this statement because of three reason , they do not have a many responsabilities , they are most likely to be in a better physical condition , and devote more of their time into pleasing themselves . all of these characteristic enable a young person to enjoy life more than old people . the majority of young people have minimum responsabilities . the responsabilities that they have mainly consist of taking care of themselves . for instace , wash their clothes , go to school , walk the dog . in the case of adult , this implies going to work for long hour , having the pressure of mantaining a family and taking care of their child . young people do not have to carry this burden and have more free time to do whatever they please . this enables them to take walk , to run and go out experiencing life in a spontanous and stress-free manner , thus , enjoying life more . another reason why young people are able to enjoy life more than older people is because they are most likely to be more physically adept . by having a better body , meaning stronger muscle and bone , young people are able to perform more physical activity . for example , if for a person one of the greatest pleasure in life is climbing a mountain in huaraz they are able to accomplish this effectively with a good physical condition . in the case of old people who could suffer from calcium defficiency , their bone would restrict them from performing this activity . this example clearly depicts how a young person can enjoy life more than an older one . because of the fact that young people take more time in fulfilling their personal need , they are able to enjoy life at it fullest . they are most likely thinking about themselves and what make them happy . since they do not have to worry about other thing , and school is not excessively time consuming young people have more spare time . for instance , a young person may not do a many task a an older one so they are le tired at the end of the day . this put them in the position to be able to go out with his or her friend . this is another scenario that illustrates how young people can take more advantage of life than old people . consequently , having le responsabilites , being in a good physicial condition , and having more time to please oneself are key characteristic that young people have and that allow them to enjoy life more than a person of an older age .
