at first , we should make a definition of enjoyment . when poeple have a bad meaning of enjoyment , they numerate drinking , playing with trivial thing and unrestricted acitivities . but i want to make a distinction between good meaning of enjoyment and bad meaning . i think that young people can be described a a progessing unit to become a sound personality . in this case of young people , enjoyment can be a good way to enhance their ability to become a adult . if person could not have a chance to learn the good way to enjoy himself , he would not know how to make his life meaningful with balance between enjoyment and temperance . the emphasis only on temperance can cause a stiff life and dry life style . to young people , the enjoyment mean physical activity related with sport , travel , outdoor campaign . because young people usually hav much more energy than the old , they can show their desire to enjoy their life more apparently that the old . from this difference , some people think that youg people enjoy life that older people do . but it is based on the different way to show their taste , not the fundamental difference between the younger and the older . for example , a people get older , they realize that the outdoor activity are sometimes beyond thier physical capacitiy . this realization doe not mean that the older give up their desire to enjoy their life . they want to find more comfortable way to enjoy their leisure time a far a thier body condition can not be hurted . it will be very wiser for them to adjust their taste to situation . so , in the matter of visible level of the enjoyment , young people seem to enjoy life that older people do . the visible thing can not explain all of the enjoyment . if we apply the enjoyment to the very limited category , the old people who do a yoga for health in leisure time would fall into the categoy of patient who want to recover from disease . widening the meaning of enjoyment can be helpful for u to understand each other . enjoying their life according to their situation can not be blamed . the one thing that young people should keep in mind is that the enjoyment should be accompanied by temperance . usually , young people do not be equipped with temperance . they have le experience than the old . young people take a lesson from old generation . as time go by , young people follow the way that the old had trodden . enjoying life is very important . making life rich and giving a room aside from busy job is a basic function of the enjoyment .
