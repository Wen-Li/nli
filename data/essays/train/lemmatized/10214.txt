some people think that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . according to me this statement is true but not all young people do not give a help to the their community . i live in an university college . my friend and me are very busy with exam , class and laboratory . for example we are in the university from 8.00 am to 6.00 pm all the day ! so we return to the college very , very tired ! however , when we go back to the college we find time to help our community . for example some student work in the college 's garden , others help our secretary in the office , others help in the kitchen and so on . i think that if you believe in something you will find time to do it . i know , other student in my college do not help the community because they are out for all the day and go back to the college only for the dinner . they tell u that they have not time because they study all the day . but this is not a good reason , according to me . i have to study too ! i want to pas all the exam and degree soon but i am in a college with other people and so i want to help my community because i think it is a right thing . today young people are busy in not important activity and so they have not time for important thing , such a helping the community . in the feature i hope my son understand this because helping community is one of the best thing we can do in our life .
