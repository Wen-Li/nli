yeh , it is very important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because it will help them to have a grip on the concept . studying the concept with out any idea will not develop the knowledge of the student , the student knowledge develops only when he think on the topic . how he/she get that thinking ? once if they are having some grip or idea on the topic . the student knowledge will develop based on their understanding capability and also their thinking capacity . i am agreeing to the concept because i have a practical experience once up on a time . two student of my class attended to an exam with full of practise . i am explaining the practise module of both of the student , one student had got a text book and memorised through out the day with out breakage and also without any idea . and the other person who also studying the same text book but he is not reading , he is understanding the concept . after they arrival after the exam one of the person who prepared whole night without any brakage told me that the question papper is very hard and i didnt understood the concept of the papper . but the other person told me that the question papper is very easiy to answer , i answered with in 1 hour out of 2hours . that much of easy the exam is ... he told like that i cant get first why they are telling like that , when asked both of them how u studied i got the answer for my question . on that day itself i understood that the instead of memorising the word we will go for understanding which will be very help full to the person to develop in any way . finally i conclude in such a way that people must understand the concept or idea , instead of studying that first we have to study and we have to understood , without that we ca n't achieve any thing .
