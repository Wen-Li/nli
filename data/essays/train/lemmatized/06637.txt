i disagree with the statement , that young people do not give enough time to helping their community , but actually i can understand the the people , who suppurt it , either . if you consider young people nowadays , they always tend to be hanging around and avoid doing thing , which might be useful at all , not considering , whether it is useful for them or for anyone else . i must admit , that there are youngster , who live according to that . but on the other hand , you have to look for the reason , why young people are acting like this . one reason might be , that there is not the appropriate offer in the community the people live in , which depends on the community itself . another reason could be the identification with the people 's hometown , which , in my opinion is strictly related to the size of the community . because in smaller community every person know every other person so the social reward , is much greater , when people recognize your work . furthermore people work together in the community , who know each other for the whole time of their life , which brings along a complete different kind of motivation . on the other hand , it is very important to consider the expectation other institution have on the student a well . and there are quite a lot of institution apart from community , like school , sport club , family and of course friend , respectively the partner . young people want to be succesful in school to have the oppurtunity to apply for a good job later , they want to have a hobby they can spend time on and the family and of course friend also want to be part of your life . if it is quite difficult to handle all these thing successful on their own , then it is hardly applicable to fulfill a further task . nevertheless it is possible to give time to help your community by declaring it a your hobby , if you find something , which you really enjoy to do . in my case , i had also the opportunity to help my community , even full-time : one year ago i worked 10 hour a day , five day a week for one year in the civil service a a driver for retarded and elderly people . by the way , this wa a very interesting experience , i will never forget .
