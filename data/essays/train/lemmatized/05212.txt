it can be read every day in the newspaper , local facility like the youth center or the sport club have to be closed . this mostly ha two reason : firstly , the decline in budged and secondly the problem in finding staff willing to work for fee . in my opinion , young people should contribute more to their community . first of all , i believe that young people being member of a community activity like the local soccer club or the youth center ha many advantage in their personnal development . and if an active soccer player or youth group attender is enthusiastic about his activity , he or she will one day take over responsibility and lead the group . in that way , the person give back what he receives from the community additionally , community service is getting more important a the average age in a community get older . older people need a strong community and young people contributing to it . young people should do more to make life more enjoyable for old people . in other country like china or russia , there is a strong focus on the community . everyone contributs to the community and also get something out of it . it is like one hand washing the other . for instance a family in china would help to paint the city hall in order to create a value for the community . western country should take thes le developed country a an good example how community live can be . in conclusion , i believe that the government should introduce a system to encourage young people to help their community . it ha to be mor attractive to do social work . for instance , i could imagine a system by which young people receive credit point for social activity they have done . these credit point can be used to get a discount from tuitio fee at university or to receive free membership of the local soccer team .
