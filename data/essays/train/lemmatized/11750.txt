`` seize the day '' used to say the epicurists , who else but young people would apply this moral point of view ? indeed i think that young people do better know how to enjoy life than older people . there are several reason for this belief . first of all i must acknowledege than the older people do , in one way , enjoy life for the simple reaon that their life is coming to it end . but , given that , i think that the young people live their life more intensively than their father or grand father do . why do i say that ? because teenager , and the young adult are eager to live their life , not only to live it in a normal way but to feel they are alive . they want to feel the life flowding in their vein . thus they do crazy thing thinking that they may be unable to do it afterwards . for instance young people are very fast driver , very heavy drinker , and very good at partying all night long . moereover , they do n't only live more intensevely `` normal life '' but they are also looking for crazy thing to do like jumping from an aircraft or jumping with an elastic from very high spot . i do n't think that an eighty-years-old-grand mother would do that . thus for two reason . one is that she will be physically too old , an other one is that she will be mentally too old . at her age pleasure of life doe not remain in risky thing to do . she is just looking for some quiet stuff to make . but is she still enjoying life ? she is certainly enjoying the end of it when young people are enjoying the dawn of it . that is the other main reason why young people are not only enjoying life but living it . it 's because all opportunity are wide opened to them . a young mind is full of project whereas an old one is full of memory . one is living thing for real , an other is living them in fiction . all in all it appears that the young seize the day when the older look at it . but we ca n't deny them any pleasure for that . they are just saying `` carpe diem '' in a more peaceful way .
