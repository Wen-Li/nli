i believe that successful people try new thing and take more risk than other people . being successful mean to built new way . when we search about successful people life we could see what made them successful is that they find new subject , creat something new , they found new way , new style etc . to continue what you know well doe n't make you successfull but it can make you experinced . being experinced is a good and essential for doing a job but it can not built your ability to create something and change your life style or thinking style . when we look at some artist or scientist life we could see that they tried to live in a different way and change sometihng which they never lived before . so what make people remember and artist because he different thing and make a cange in people life . why gandhi is well known figure in the world that he doe n't want to live like all people live in his country and he made a decision and take a risk . the risk also can take his life from him but without taking any risk no matter can change . it is so politicial issue to discus in this section but i want to mansion about only one thing if he never want to change his life and protest soldier with a quiet way he can never show the people how successful politition he wa . successful people have take risk to be successful , and being successful also need new thing to try and never give up .
