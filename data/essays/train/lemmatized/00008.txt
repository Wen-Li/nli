on the premium art of risk taking success is a very well balanced cocktail . a person whose quest is for success should keep in mind that without taking risk , gaining is virtually impossible . but taking risk is an art in which one should be extremely careful and wise . one should know his vice and virtue , he should know what he is capable of . taking risk by planning cunningly and regardingly what you already know how to do well is the recipe to the elixir . when one study politics , bussiness or military science , he 'll see that success is nearly always achieved by risk taken cunningly . but one will also see that many failure are caused by miscalculated or misinterpretated risk . a person who is in the position to take risk should ever be aware that thing can always go bad ; therefore risk should always lean on some quality the risk taker pose . let 's take the battle of thermopylai a an example . the spartans and their ally took the risk of facing an persian army that multiplied them in number . the spartans ` knew ' that they had superior training in infantry tactic and that the battlefield wa not fit for cavalry . the spartans also knew the geography that helped them hold the persian army for that long . in the end , the greek ally in thermopylai held the enemy long enough for the assembly of the athenian navy . hitler a another example , thought that he could capture moscow in december 1941 then return home . this wa a miscalculated risk and the german army which wa n't prepared for winter suffered dramatic loss in the winter of 1941-1942 , when it could n't reach it 1941 objective . taking risk is a key to sucess indeed . but one should keep in mind that miscalculation and ill preparedness in taking risk is the most likely cause of downfall .
