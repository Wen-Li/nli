in now a day the young people are not give enough time to helping their community . yes i agree with this . because the main point is they have no intrest helping others . some young people are are giving enough time for helping their community . because they are intreested in that . but in this day the young people intrested to go for a cinema whereas to help for the oyhers . they are spending more time and more money on the joyfull entertinements . but whereas in my opinion this is not true because , me and my friend are having enough time to halp for my community . we spend time for that when we are free . so that in now a day the young people are preferred to enjoy with their friend , family and with others than to help for the community . the young people should hel for the community . because it is very benificial for communitt and society . the main idea is f we help for the community , by seeing u our yonger friend or any one , they may try to help for the community . so that this will be increased by seeing one onther . at last it suppors the community . the helping for the community is main idea of me.because in now adays no one is preffering to help others . because every one is having their own problem and every one is having a littele bit selfishness . so that they cant help for the community . the young people in now a day are preferrring to enjoy than to help for the community . if the young people will hwlp to yhe community the community will become good . the helping nature of the people should grow frm the childhood only . because if that grows from childwood they can help after that also . if it no grows it is immpossible to help in the young age . the young in this day are very joy full person . so that they cant help for the other people . young people in nowadays do not enough to help for the community . because the work pressure on them is very high , and some young student have no time to help the community because of their study pressure on them . these are the main reason why the young people are helping or not helping for the community . some people young people may help by word not by money . i think the word are very helpfull for development of the community . so the young people should help for their community hen they have time . if every younger do th the community will become good . and it is usefull for future community development . i my opinion every young people is not helping their community , if they dcided to help their community the community become good . and by seeing them the otheryounger may try to help others . so the younger should help for their community .
