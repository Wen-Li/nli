with the developmemt of the industry all over the world , a though race or competition ha begun between company to sell their product and therefore keep surviving in the industrial environment . for this purpose the company put a lot on advertisement , most of which show the product much better than it really is in order to sell it . there are several reaons why a product is perceived much better than it is by the customer . first reason is that when introducing a product , the advertisement mention only the good and attractive aspect of the product . the consumer purchase it without knowing it ' negative side . for example a product may have many technical property , which are also presented in the advertisement , however the product may not be durable and in the advertisement it is never mentioned . second point is that many product have some certificate , presented in their advertisement , which do not really account for the quality of the product . a low quality product can even get a cetificate because the requirement for the certificate are only based on the document that the company present to the quality assurance comapny . the company is not actually examined for conformance to the stated issue on it report . the advertisement tell that the product is very high quality and show the certificate it ha a a proof . an example for this type of certificate is the iso9000-9001 . this worldwide certificate deal only with the documentation of the quality system in the company and usually fails to account for the actual quality of the product . when consumer see this certificate on the advertisement of the product they take it for granted that the product ' quality in convenient . last point is that advertisement usually do not use real example when introducing a product . for example a person who is advertising a sport device is usually an athlet or even a body builder . however when the consumer watch that advertisement he usually think that the man or woman on the advertisement ha built those muscle and become fit by that device . another example might be on high fat containing food . people on the advertisement of these food are usually slim and the consumer think he can also be slim although he consumes that product . to sum up , advertisement generally mislead the consumer about the property of the product due to several reason ; they mention only the attractive and good part of the product , they expose insufficient quality certificate a a proof of quality and they use unreal example . therefore , consumer should be more careful in buying a product relying on an advertisement .
