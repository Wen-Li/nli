at certain point of our life , everyone ha to make essential decision that will have consequence for the rest of our life . one of this decision is education , the path of studying we want to follow ; then the following crucial question will arise : it is better to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject ? the answer is not so straightforward , it is not possible to rank broad knowledge versus specialization , we have to find a deeper response . a broad knowledge is essential because a variety of different situation will show in front of u along all our life and to deal with them , we need a basic knowledge . for example , we are not required to know how to make a surgery , but we are better off if we know that if we have the flu , it is better if we stay at home and not stay outside at the cold . on the other hand , since it is not possible to have an extensive knowledge on every possible subject , we need to specialize in something to find a job , from the most humble to the most powerful . the level of specialization will depend on the job we would like to do or that is offered to u ; thinking again about the previous example , if you are a chirurgian , you have to reach a very high level of specializiation , while if you are a waiter you do n't need a very sophisticated knowledge . besides , a first broad knowledge is useful to understand which are your preference and what you would like to do in your life . if you don ' t learn the first basic concept or notion of astronomy , you will never know if you prefer this subject than studying chemistry . at the end , the bottom line is that a broad knowledge is essential for everyday life and this broad knowledge doesn ' t need to be too sophisticated , but if you want to make career or if you have certain aspiration , surely you will need to specialize in something .
