being successful some people try to create new thing and take risk although some people only doing what they already know how to do well . being good in my work and getting success is important for me beacuse i am trying to do my best . some people thing if they do what they already know they will be successful . thats not such a bad idea . but , on the other hand some people look the situation like that they thing if they can produce or try new thing and take risk they can be more successful . in my personal opinion trying new thing and taking some risk is the best thing that you can do in your life beacuse you should find new thing for the next genarations . besides if you can find new thing you can be more important business man also you can get the success easier . as an example if i had a big company i would like to see my employee that they are trying new thing while they are working . i will share what i thing and ask what they thing . after we discus some thing i will choose the right desicion . for doing that you can be a good business man or a good employee . in the meanwhile there are some boss that they only want from their employee just do what they know how to do well . doing something good is important a well but if you are a man who is n't open new idea and you are't produce new thing you are not be a good employee or a good bos . despite for all these resions create some new thing and take risk to being good in your job and show something for the next generation otherwise you would not do your job good in this life .
