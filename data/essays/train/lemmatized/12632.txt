if it is more important for student to understand the idea of a topic or to learn fact can be seen from different point of view . there are positive and negative side in both way . understanding the idea and concept of a topic often make it easier for student to learn . they do not have to study a much . many people think that this way of understanding is more important than learning fact . of course you have to understand the idea to be able to understand the whole but topic but a topic can be too complex and contain too many detail . a very important accpect is also how a teacher explains a problem . some teacher are not able to teach and student are often confused by their theory . other teacher are really good and everybody understand the concept . but if a teacher is not good you have to study on your own which often mean to just learn the fact . it also depense on the topic given . if student have to study for history for example it is often enough to just learn the fact but on the other hand studing for physic or math need the understanding of the concept . some subject you can not learn , you have to understand them . another point is that people are different and that people learn different . some student understand the idea and are so able to understand or realize the other part of a topic . other student do better by learning the fact , by reading thing over and over again they eventually get the whole concept . all in all both theory are necessary to understand a problem fully . understanding the idea can help learn the fact and learning the fact can help understand the problem . in my opinion wether understanding the concept or learning the fact depens on a topic is better is better , i could not choose because for me it always depense on the topic or the problem . sometimes i need to learn the fact and on other occations i understand the idea and it help me to succeed .
