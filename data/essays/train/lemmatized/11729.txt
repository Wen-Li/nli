transportation and crowded there is a huge number of car and truks nowdays . big number of thim are for transportation . is that huge number going to be reduced or increased in future ? that is very important quistion to ask ourselves and think deeply on this important issue . my own opinion is the number of car are going to increase repidly . there are alot of way to go and back in or out city because there are more and more way of transportation are discoverd . cars are the first modern kind of way we use for long time . now , we have another useful transportation a train , bus and taxi . for example , we dont have these other kind of transportation in saudi arabia , and we are suffuring from the crowded evry single day . other factor help in decreasing number of car used evry day is car price . it is increasing day than the other . it could cost you an arm and leg to buy a car these day . cars maker are chalinging each other not only in the quality , but also in the price . also oil price are increasing and not steady . it is cheaper to go by train evry day to your work than taking your own car . another aspicte on oil is that it may vanish some day sudinly with out wrning . that would cause a disaster . w
