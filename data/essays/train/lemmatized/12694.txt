the followin statement refers the original attitude of a successful man . the main attitude of the successful man wa to win his aim , in order to do this he take several risk , they take several aspect in the new way for getting success even though they know how to do it . i will definetly agree with the statement . because without doing any risk we can not invent a new way for sucess . i can give an example regarding this statement which happened in my own life , when i wa working in asmall company in which i am getting a salary of ten thousand , i wa very happy with that job but to be better in my life i thought of earning more money ihad resigned my job and started own busuiness in which i made risk but iwas succede well in my busuiness . i am giving you another example . an ordinary professional who had think differently about his view had left his job and all over thought creating a site which sreves of free in electronic mail division and he named it a `` hot mail '' and creates a history in which one and half lakh subscriber had enrolled with in a month . even this incident made surprise the billgates and made him buy for avast amount from him. `` i wa not sure of the name of the person'but which made him the millionare his risk of leaving the job and his different way of thinking made the man successful in the society . now a day this made him live in a luxorios house and use an expensive car and giving party for celebrity . these are the main reason which made me agree with the statement that every successful man take risk in inventing new way for success .
