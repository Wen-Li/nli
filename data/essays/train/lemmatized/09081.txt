new idea = success ? the most successful idea are new and never seen before . almost all people are attracted by thing they do not know yet . so by following new way of thinking you can become a successful person . i agree with this statement , a new way of thinking can help you to be successful in some situation of life . starting a company is a high risk . in order to be successful in an economy you should really have thought of an idea no one ha had before you . especially , if you want to sell thing , new idea may help you to make your good more attractive to people who would buy it . if you would try to sell something everyone doe already have , you will have a bigger problem . so you must make yourself special , what mean that you have take new idea apart from what you already know into consideration . another great example are internet company that convince people to by thing they used to by at normal shop , even food or car , via the internet . new comunication form , such a specified formus , have come up . now the founder can get rich by selling their internet site . but there are other part in life where you can be successful with a work that is known and you can do well . for instance , building up new friendship or partnership , a well a social engagement . for these kind of `` job '' it is not important that you earn any money or make profit . here people can be successful in this way that he or she is satisfied and happy with their life . this would be a definition of success where i can not completely agree on the statement . the of couse you have to be really good at your job and better a everyone else . this is the point where new idea may help you to stick out of all other people again . all in all the conclusion is that if you want to be successful in an economic way you should definetly try risk and have new idea . however in other part of life it is better to do what your experience is based on an what your good at .
