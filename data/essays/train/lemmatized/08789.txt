the given statement sound to me a it implement that young people have better thing do than to spend time with their community . in general i agree with the given statement . as far a i know it wa more common to help in the community a century ago . the society structure those day wa different then today . not only that the number of inhabitant rised with the time and we have much bigger community today , also people mostly live in big city now and not in small community like then . at the same time the structure of the community changed . nowadays the work which wa done in a community many year ago is done by other institution now . the state is much more responsible in welfare-questions or question concearning social security in recent year . when community were smaller , people helped themselves out in time when someone wa sick , or needed help because he or she wa old or could not work anymore . today , i think , people and especially young people are very concerned about their own life . time is rare , at least for people that have a job and \ or a family . they need their time to manage their hoseholds . but if they have the slightest bit of time that they can determine by themselves , i am sure they use it for their own amusement , for cultur , fun , sport or just to spend the time with their friend and family . i do n't know anyone out of my group of friend who is somehow involved with community-work . neighther am i . the reason for this is for sure the change in society and also in social value . the interrests changed a well . one reason people are le interrested in politics , social life or in their own community might be the increasing anonymity in society . so many people live on a very small area and do n't know each other . no wonder that they do not even care for each other anymore .
