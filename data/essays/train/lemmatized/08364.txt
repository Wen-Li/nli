yes , i am agree with this statement because if the student understand clearly and know the idea and the concept of something , they can expect what to wait and how to act in any situation . is better be prepared than learn on the way and receive punished por that . so is very important that the student be prepare all they can , study and learn all the tool the human being need on their live . the education is very important because this help the person to resolve the daily problem and get a better live . i think a person dont have knowledge is a person dont have nothing to talk and to say the to the other people . an educated person is better because this knowledge help you to your entire life and not to be an ignorant . yes ignorant is the better word to describe a not educated person because if you dont know about nothing how you can share with others your opinion about something , about any topic . so if you understand the idea and concept , you are not a ignorant person and you the talk with anyone about any topic and you can defend your point or statement of something . then you go to the fact , that is like an example of the idea or concept you are observing . actually , this fact help you to undestarnd more cleary your idea and concept but , if you don know and understand what is the concept you could never see , how the fact work , why the fact is , so you maintain a a ignorant all your life because you see something but dont know what is it . in summery i agree this satatement about that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact , because the intelligent and brillant people have a trick , their trick is , the knowledge and the education . if you are a educated people you are a person with a lot of experience and knowlegde to share in your life . that is very good .
