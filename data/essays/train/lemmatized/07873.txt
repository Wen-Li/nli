i agree with the statement that most advertisement make product seems much better than they really are . because i believe that in the business world , the sale men always want to make money in the market , they have to make the product look more attractive than they really are . there are my reason a bellow . first , in the competitive real world , the business man are always tring to make a much money a they could . in this manner , they have to convinced customres to buy their product . how can they achieve their goal ? they will try to over describe the function of the product a it really doe . the product look more attractive in the advertisment to persuade the customer to buy the product even they really not need it . for example , i always buy some stuff that i really do not need . why i still buy them ? because of the attractive advertisments made me believe that the product are more efficient than i can imagine . second , the business man have to make their spending and income get balanced . they spend a lot of money on advertisment , such like on the tv show , newspaper , magazine , and even on the radio station . if they do not over describe how the product is greater than the others , the customer would not purchase it . in addition , the sale man have to spend money to hire the designer who create the advertisments . for these two reason , the sale man have to make more and more money to compensate the money they spent on the advertisments . to sum up , i believe that the product seem much better in the most advertisments than they really are . we usually found out what the real product is after we bought it and used it . it waste customer ' money to try it if the sale man could truely describe the poduct on advertisment .
