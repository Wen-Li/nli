there are several thing that make our life easier such a computer , plane , car and cellphone . there is a statement about car : `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today . '' i can not agree with this idea at all . first of all i do not believe that there is going to be an invention that would take car ' place . the car are the easiest way of transportation in daily life . as long a someone do not invent a machine that can fly between short distance and is cheaper than a car i will not sell my car ! addition to that we use car for public transportation too . i would n't be able to go somewhere i do not know if there were no taxi . what is more twenty year is too short to make an invention that can beat car . although i really wish the number of car to decrease in twenty year . cars are good for transportation but what about the environment ? they cause air pollution and the gas poison people . every passing day the situation is getting worse . people die from lung cancer . there is also a big problem called ` traffic jam ' . i think all of the big city suffer from traffic jam at the rush hour . this cause city people to be more stressed and depressed , than the country people . the car have a lot of advantage but i think disadvantage are more . i use my car not because it is fun , because it is a necessity . unfortunately i can not agree with the idea that say `` the number of car will decrease in twenty year . '' . by thinking of the sentence `` necessity is the mother of invention '' i hope there will be a better way of transportation in the future but i do not think there will be an important invention in twenty year . therefore i do not believe there will be fewer car in use than there are today in twenty year .
