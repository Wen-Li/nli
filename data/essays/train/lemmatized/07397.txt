pleasure taking the honour in analysing the given statement , i would like to stand aganist the topic that the student should be relaying more on fact than on concept and idea . a student get most of the concept from the class room lecture thus he creates a basic idea about a topic ( mostly outdated ) , but he gain knowledge about fact from the outer world through various source like medium , friend , article . .. etc if we stress on the definition `` a fact can be defined a a statement given after a through observation and consicutive proven reasults with experments '' it is always be demonistarble , but in contrast a `` concept '' is always derived from a `` fact '' which ha been defined earlier thus leading to a new idea ! concepts and ideas are brainchild of fact , and they do vary on a consistent basis with the technology advancement , a the consistency of an old fact is pretty le with the advanced technology there are all chance that the concept and idea do change . to name few the old scientific theory are no longer good in the morden era , the present day science formuate the concept based on fatcs and observation reliving the importance of fact . to name few . 1. gallelio `` theory of gravitation '' . - gravitation law and earth 's orbit 2. darwin `` theory of natural selection '' . 3. `` theories of genetics '' . 4 arthametics `` law of boyency '' 5. newton laws . a fact under prolonged expermental condition becomes a concept and a law would if refered by future generation , and there are even some concept which are discarded a the fact were proved to be genune that the old concept to name few 1. old concept of church where they used to say a. earth formed in seven day , b.earth is round . c. traits are inherited from generation to generation . few concept are often challenged if they do not have enough support of fact , to name few some of the modern scientist say that there is global warming but other do challenge them , a there is no physical evidence showing that the phenomen is relivent and do exisist so a a student it wa the age where he pump in knowledge to become intallectual it is important for him to know the fact and learning them than allocation more time on the concept and reinforcing them thus making himself almost uncompetent with the present day world
