i am agree whith the statement rhat is better have one specific knolodges of one subject tha n a broad knowledge of many accademic subject . the reason why i am prefering the first one are severals but the most important is know well your subject help people working whith you to feel sure of what you answer when is asked to do . for example if i need a doctor because i am having desease i prefer one who realy know is subject not one who ha studied twice in his life the desaese i am havin at the moment . the worst thing could happen is that he gave to me the wrong medicament and after having pay for his treatment i feel in the same way whit all the problem wrong medication could do in my body . another example because i prefer knowledge in one specific subject is because time . nowdays time is essential to do everithing if we spent asking someone not sure not enaugh prepared we do a disaster and we can reach the pourpose we are expected to reach . this why of thin is specific of mediterian country always lovig waste time and do so much discussin usless to reach one single point . americans study are more focosed in specific knowlodges and that the reson why i prefer study abroad a specific subject lather italy where knowledge is composed by many academic subject and after graduation people work but relly have to do the double experience because realy do not know well their work . finally know well his subject is the better thing for all in many aspect of life good clean and clear work are made by people sure of what they think and what they know . how could happen if worker spnt thir time usless and ma
