i believe that it is much more important for student to understand idea and conceots than just to memorize fact . through my life experience i realized that understanding the idea of a fact and the reason why this fact is availabe to u is very important . i did n't come to realize the importance of understanding fact before learning them until i wa in high school . back then , i faced a lot of trouble trying to memorize the requirement for the test . i especially face trouble in biology , where i spent hour and hour memorizing the step of `` photosenthisis '' . and when i finally gave up and asked my friend for help , he gave me the most important tip . he told me that unless i understand why the step is taking place i wouldnt be able to memorize all of the step of the process . he also said that understanding the `` idea '' behind the step will help me in memorizing their order . take for example taking in mineral from the soil , these mineral have to be present before taking in light from the sun for the burning to occur . so , offcourse talking in sunlight come after talking in mineral and before burning . i remember memorizing the step and in their right order in le than 10 minute , offcourse after understanding each and every on of them . so , personally i alwayz make sure that i understand idea and concept before attempting to learn them a simple fact . i believe that all student should go by this rule of `` understanding before memorizing '' .
