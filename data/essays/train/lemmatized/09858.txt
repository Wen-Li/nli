no risk no fun i agree the statement `` successful people try new thing and take risk '' . in my mind it is so , to . when you thing you like do new stuff you need a liddelbit the kick . that is the big point what i need . for exsample i like to go to a big city like new york . i wa never in this town i dont no from the city . but i like go to the city . thats fun i stay every time for proplems . i need eat a hood offer my head . the ather side i can go dow . i dont gat waht i need . i m die that the side ot risk now i have a nice life . may be a sport exsample what i can say about boxing . you have two side the winner and loser . eath of one bring the risk with same he can lose . he risk that he is the loser . next exsample the wall street you put money in fund , well you this make a good job . dont for get the risk look like lose money . thanks for
