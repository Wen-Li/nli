advertisement is everywere ! it is hardly impossible to escape from it . on the one hand you get a lot of information about new product but on the other hand it is nearly impssible to stop it . in my opinion advertising doe not make product better a they are , it manipulates u in different way so that we buy the product . advertisment try to show u the opportunity and advantage we might have when we will buy this particular product . it could also create new need . some time ago nobody would belive , that we would drink water out of bottle . it wa the advertisement which told u , that only the water in the bottle are clean . and on the other side they told u that the water out of the tin is dirty although it is nearly the same . advertisement doe show product in an other way . it ha to because otherwise we would not even notice , that we miss something . with a lot of competition in the market every product ha to be something special and unique . nobody would buy just an ordirnary chocolat bar or just a shirt . brands and the trust that people have towards them is very important . advertisment try to create emotion . when we go to the supermarket and we would like to buy some sweet we should remember that good feeling a the girl in the advertisment tasted this chocolate bar and how happy she wa . this picture should lead u to buy this product . the product doe not differ from other one but we get influenced by the advertisement . the reason for doing advertisin is that the selling increase because of it . with that background you might think that the statement is completely true . but a i mentioned in the text it ha a lot more to do than just showing there product . the connection between the customer and the product is much more important than just the selling number of the next month . the difficulty of advertisement is to make a bond between the two side so that the customer will only buy the own product now and in the future . that might be the biggest challenge in that business .
