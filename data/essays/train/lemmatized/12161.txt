nowadays , in europe and north america , almost each family owns at least one car . however , a few current issue raise the question of the number of car there will be in the next twenty year . in my opinion , there will be more car in use in twenty year than today . first of all , it is obvious that the world 's population keep increasing , which mean that more people are going to need a car within the next two sdecade . moreover , in important demographic region such a china or india , more and more inhabitant buy a car . what 's more , one reason for which there could be fewer car in use in twenty year would be the lack of oil . nonetheless , according to scientist this should not happen before the year 2050 . besides , in order to fight against the air pollution issue mainly due to the car 's traffic , scientist try to find out solution , and work on other energy ressources such a solar energy , or even hydrogen energy . then , if they eventually manage to create a new type of car which would not pollute the air , driving a car would not be a problem anymore for the atmosphere . hence , the number of car would be likely to increase . another reason is that people tend to communicate more and more , and the road network is getting wider and wider . then , people really enjoy travelling with their own car in order to be able to meet whoever you want wherever you want . indeed , having a car provides me with a lot of autonomy . for instance , if i intend to go from one side of the country to another it is much more easier to drive my own car than to take the plane or the train , if the place i want to go is far from the airport or the train station .
