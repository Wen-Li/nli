are young people too clod to help their community nowadays ? the is a question without precise answer , because it depends on the different style and purpose of each person . for example , what are the reason one person is always cold and do n't have the intention to help others ? he may hurt by community before , so he would n't like to do so . or he think he ha more important thing to do , then he wo n't waste time on others . this kind of people care more about himself , and believe he can complete mission without others ' hand . we can see them all around u , because this society focus on benifit more than before . but it is not the whole world , there are still another kind of people live on the earth . they are more active and kinder , their action are total different from people we disguessed before . they may do this in nature , or they may want to be a leader so they have to create their own friendship to help him . the number of this kind of people is also large . however , we can find that besides some special reason such a the nature or their past expiences , most people decide to be kind or cold by judging what they want . the interesting thing is identical purpose can produce differen action , if we all want to earn money , some will choose to be a professor , then the need of him to make many freinds is lower , but the one decides to join the enterprise will have a higher need to do so . on the other hand , there are still some purpose will follow the same behavior , like we all believe that a good leader should give much more time to help their community . so we can conclude that people is cold to their community is not perfectly correct , it 's just a part of phenomenone in this society , there are still different thought exist .
