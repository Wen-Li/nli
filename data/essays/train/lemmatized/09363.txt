i agree to the statement that nowadays young people do not give enough time to help their community . there are various reason for this . first and foremost , the cut-throat compitition prevailing in the market force the young generation to devote most of their time developing their own career and they are left with no time to concentrate on helping out their community . in addition to it , with the development of technology , there ha been a numerous number of distraction that have cropped up in the market which , many a time , astrays the young blood to an undesirable path taking them away from what they ought to do . but why , do we think , ha this chage been seen in the new generation . are they at fault ? well , from my point of view , i think the system , which we term a ` society ' ha led to this downfall . young people are not made aware of the importance of the cultural ethic and it in-grown value . they are not subjected to the happiness and have not felt the tranquilty that one enjoys helping their community . young blood are supposed to the part of the society which ha always brought revolution . they are the one who have given birth to a new system of governance by eradicating the ailing society . they are the most enthusiastic crowd who ha the zeal to turn the society the way it want to . but if they are not able to bring about change or help thier community , it is not solely their fault . we need to re-think if we are concluding this decision . now it is high time to rejig the way , the thinking of the society ha become . if the young people are not able to extract time for helping their community we need to find the answer to a very relevant question . and the question is -- ` why ? ' . why are they not able to do it ? is the light of community work fading ? are they not able to find value in performing this job ? if day we have these answer and the moment they start getting implemented , i think , my point of view will change .
