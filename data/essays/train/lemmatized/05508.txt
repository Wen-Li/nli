i completely agree with the statement according to which advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . what make me think that is my reflection on the marketing strategy used by company during my marketing class . advertisement strategy is based usually on the following three pillar , making the packaging of the product agressive , by creating a new consumption trend that do not necessary correspond to the real need of consumer , and by making the product look the unique one adapt for the costumer need . all the above mentioned pilars of marketing concentrate the effort on improving the perception of the product not the inner characteristic of it . does improving the attractive capacity of the packaging material in which the product will be sold will improve it quality ? i am convinced that it will make only the consumer choose it even if it ha a higher price or lower quality . the colour of package will attract the eye of the consumer from other similar product that could be a better choice in term of quality and price . the consumption trend have to do with a certain image created for the ideal consumer of the product , this can be achieved by using very famous artist or singer in promoting the product or by the use of very beautifull woman or handsome men , according to the product consumer target , which implicitly give the idea that if you use this product you will be act a your favorite actor or singer . again it ha not anything to do with the product itself , it is only a created and virtual image . the last pilar is making the consumer think that the product is done to satisfy his or her need a if in the mass production era it is possibile to have an unique product made for an uniqe consumer . in my point of view the best way to deal with advertisement is try to consider shopping a an activity necesary to satisfy the own need and not like a tool to look more trendy or more modern ,
