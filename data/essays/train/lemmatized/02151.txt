travelin with a tour guide although traveling with a tour guide is interesting , but traveling alone is more fun because of many reason such a , a tour guide is more expensive , the commitment with the tour guide , and speaking the country language is enough to travel . traveling with a tour guide is more expensive . nowadays , if people want to travel , they can find all the information about the place that they will go to in the internet or book guide . it is cheaper and they can discover the place by themselves . there is no commitment by traveling without a tour guide . i had a europe trip last summer and i travelled without a tour guide . i went there with my friend and we used the book guide it wa really helpful and fun rather than traveling with a tour guide . because the tour guide have specific time that people have to follow , they are not quite interesting . speaking the country language is enough . my native language is arabic , and i like to visit arabic countries such a , egypt , united emirates , and lebanon . i always visiting a travel agent before i went to these country and he gave me guide about the good place in these counitries , so i did not need a tour guide . on the other hand , traveling in a group led by a tour guide is interesing . people can learn more about the country and the place if they have a tour guide . the tour guide can show the toursit all the historical place that they want to see , and they can explain the place for the tourist . they can save tourist time because they know the place , so they show the tourist many place in short amount of time . in conclusion , the best way to travel is different between each person . many people prefer to travel by themselves , and discover the place and live the adventure without a tour guide . this kind of tourist want to be free , so they can go any place at any time without commitment .
