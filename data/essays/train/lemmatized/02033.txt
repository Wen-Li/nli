did one ever asked themself the question how the world would like in twenty year ? i guess everyone did . i am asked to write an essay about the following statement `` in twenty year there will be fewer car in use than there are today '' . today it is the year of 2006 . twenty year from now would be 2026 . popular thought against car are that they are not good for our enviroment ( ozon ) so that it would be much better for the nature if the people would use train . as well a the argument that if one take the train one will not have to mess with traffic . those idea might contribute to the statement that there are going to be fewer car in use than there are today . in my opinion i do not think that there are going to be le car in use . a car is a really nice way to get from point a to point b. one is not dependent on the bus or the train . it is nice to have the opportunity to use public transportation but one also ha to rely on them . most of the time the bus doe not drive when one want to be at a certain place . for example , if a student want to be at school at 8.00 a.m. but the bus only arrives there either at 8.05 or at 7.35 , he will have to be 5 minute late or wait for half an hour . having a car is much more convenient for that matter . i am sure that people will not stop driving car because of them harming the ozon . people destroy nature all the time . people already know about the problem and do not do anything about it so they will not stop driving all the sudden because of that matter . if one take a closer look at the argument that traffic might people hold back from using car , one can see that a train or bus ha it place where they need to stop and their certain route . by taking a bus one might even waste more time than being stuck in traffic . it always depends on where on life though . i would recommend taking the train in large city like nyc . but taking the car outside of the city . i came to the conclusion that one need to differenciate between the city and the suburbs/country . i think that in twenty year from now car will be used fewer in the city but in the suburb just a much a today .
