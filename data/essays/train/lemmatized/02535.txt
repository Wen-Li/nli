traveling is the best thing we can do it when we have free time or a vacation . traveling ha a lot of benefit . traveling is the best way to learn another culture and another language . when you have any problem with your life , wife and even your bos , you should take a rest and travel to another country or city . howeve , some people prefer to travel in a group but others totally disagree with this idea . i agree with traveling in a group led by guide is the best way . also , it ha many benefit when you travel to any country , you want to visit the most famous and important place in that country . also , you do not want to waste time to find that place . that is why i prefer to have a traveling guide . for example , last year i went to eygpt . it wa a nive vacation , but i could not find what i want quickly . everyday i asked more than guy about how can i find that hotel or famous place in eygpt . inn adition , guide make your tour very interesting . on the other hand , guide help you to choose good hotel and the best company for renting car and tell you where is the best restaurant . traveling in a group is so safety , for example , my friend went to an arabic country when he got there , some men hit him and stole his money . finally . i really interesting in traveling . every year i go to a different country . it is very good to upfresh me . it is a good idea to forget problem in our life . i advise everyone to travel in a group because it ha many benefit and it is safety . i really like to visit famous place .
