have you never observed general behaviour of a group of people , let u say a school class ? if you have , you probably distinguished some particularly shy student , some other more quiet or polite . among these behaviour , you surely have been able to notest the most brave one , the one who did something that nodoby else did . this is the leader . the leader is , for instance , the student who have the courage to tell the professor about something inconvinient . if we bring this situation out of the school , we can say that the leader , the successful person , is the brave one . thi mean that those person who have never the courage to try something hard , different and new , have few possibility to succeed . one reason for wich i believe that brave people are likely to be successful is that they normally love challenge , and challenge are opportunity to learn . a genuine curiosity also characterizes brave people often . curiosity mean aquiring a wide knowledge , which a good starting point of a successful life . on the other hand , those who never pluck up the courage to measure themselves against challenging situation have few possibility to enlarge their skill . moreover , such a behaviour reveals scarce curiosity and feature people who are not willing to learn and improve themselves . the second reason is that successful people definitely need to be self confident , and brave people necessarly are . in fact , a successful life is often the result of many successful battle . in order to win all these , people must be confident in their ability . i consider brave people to have this approach when they chase new challenge . in conlcusion , i definitely believe that a brave approach to challenge is required from those who want to be successful in their life . brave people are not frighten of the event that may occur , and this approach in my opinion is the right one in order to lead the situation .
