for young people , life seems not to end . they live their life so fast that old people ca n't . there are lot of thing and option for them to do , lot of chices to make . but for old people , lot have been lived and done , it 's like time pass slower than normal . children are filled with lot of energy that they can spend . they run , they fight , they even do so weird thing that many of u ca n't even imagine . this can be seen on almost all the young people . having lot of energy and the state of having little responsibility cause the young people to live their life so fast and funny . when i wa young , i never thought that i would come to an age of 30 . i had no responsibilites other than studying for the exam in school . so i had lot of time to do lot of thing and had so much fun . i enjoyed all part of my life until my age of 30 which i am at now . but when i think about my future , i usually feel depressed and a little bit hopeless , because while enjoying life i seem to miss some serious point in my life like having a serious job or marrying with a nice girl . as poeple grow older , they tend to think more about their future or care about the people they love . they begin to spend their time on these . so the funny and enjoyable part of their life slowly fade and they face the other side of the coin . does this mean that older people miss the enjoyable part of the life ? i guess not . .. but considering the younger people , i can say it is getting rare .
