`` young people enjoy life more than older people do '' - a challenging topic to discus , but also a question that becomes more and more important . our society , especially the german society , get older and older . since the birth rate decrease from year to year , we will confront an `` aging '' population in the future . in contrast to emerging and growing culture like the chinese or the indian , we will confront upcoming problem a lot earlier . but what defines your ability to enjoy life ? does age actually have an impact on the way you live your own life ? do factor like physical ability , experience and your current situation in life affect your ability to enjoy ? since i am just 22 year of age - i know how much fun it is to be young and how easy it is to enjoy life when there are no physical boundary or limit . you do not confront the boundary of movement , orientation and sight a 80-year old man would have to live with . when you are young , you are at a point of time where you are constantly experiencing new and interesting thing . and the younger you are , the le you think about the future . everything is taken care of by your elder - you do not need to worry about anything . in my opinion this is the perfect base to start an enjoyable life . so especially when you are really young , it is a lot easier to enjoy life a it is . but what happens when you are growing up ? there are many , many event in life that change your current situation dramatically . you live in a period of constant change . from day to day you are confronted with more and more problem . starting with puberty , life get more challenging from day to day . your first relationship , your first break-up , your first day of school , your first bad grade , your first car , your first major accident - with all the positive thing happening in our youth - you are now confronted new and unkown situation which might prevent you from enjoying life a you did when you were really young . and the older you get , the more you think about how easy everything wa when you were just a kid . .. but is getting old really that discouraging ? does the fact that you might not be able to do everything you want , be it because you are physically `` handicapped '' or your current position in life , prevent you from enjoying life ? i think , a you grow older and older , your preference change . activities like going to club or playing around and being physically successful do not define your life any more . at a certain point of time , be it the retirement-age , different thing make you feel content and happy . seeing your own child grow up , spending time with people that are close to you or just being able to be a `` good advisor '' to the younger generation might become way to make your day . since life ha become more and more stable and change dont happen that quickly anymore , you get the chance to view life in a totally different way and thus you become able to benefit from different thing and enjoy your life . in my opinion not the age but your own character , your own `` soul '' define wether you can enjoy life or not . even the richest man or a child that get everything it can possibly imagine might be the sadest and loneliest people in the world . whether you are old or young , rich or poor - happiness and the ability to enjoy your life are not mainly influenced by external fact - what really play a role is the person you are and how you see life itself .
