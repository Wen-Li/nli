i think that today , there are a lot of student that want to study and in this way they could have a better future . i believe that it is easier to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is also true that it is very important to know fact because it could be usefull in our life . therefore it is up to u to understand what we want to do . there are differnt type of thinking about it , but i reckon that for a student to understand idea and concept is more and more important and simple copared to learn fact . for instance i 'm an architect and when i wa a student i discussed a lot with my teacher about this problem . i wanted only to understand idea because i considerded very difficult to remember fact and other thing . today i think that to understand concept and to learn fact should be important for all of u and each one shoud make it better .
