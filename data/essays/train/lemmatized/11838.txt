i personaly think that there are substantial number of people who think this statment is true and i am one of them . the retionale behind this is that the advertisment is the best way to introduce new product and let potential custer get attention to the product . consequently leading the public to buy this product is the final goal . in order to make the people come and buy the product , advertiment should be more impetus and sensational and advetisment make product seem much better than they really are . advertising company use a celebrity to advetise the good becuase people can easily think that if the celebrity us a certain product , the good are good enough to buy and people can get the wrong percetion about a product only because the celebrity us . for example , in my country , many advetising company use one famous commerical star whose name is ji-hyun jeon becaus all the item which she advertised made great sale . the public regard all the item that she us a higher-quality than they actually are . i think the celebrity 's word on th tv commerical make the product look better . moreover , the advertisment is itself very costly . so the advetisements should be enough to get attention wihin a short time or small space with expression that can let the people get imagation that the product are good to buy . for this reason , the company use computer graphic to make the product . to illustrate , i have a bad experience that i bought the ear ring online becuase the product of on line adveristment looked so fancy and i wa very temping to buy and bought . however after i recived the actual product , i wa so upset . in a nutsell , for these reason , i strongly agree this statemtn and advetisment shoud be improved for fair
