do you think that your young son can handle at least taking the trash from the street if he saw it ? our child today do not alot of simple thing than our father and grandfather used to do it proud . this is becouse many parants do not let thier child to try and experince how it would be for them to help your community and community nowadays do not open the chance for young pepole . first of all man y parent do not let thier child to to experiment how it feel good when they help thier community becouse parent think that helping community is a waste of time . even if the child try to do this kind of thing thier punsh them and tell them to concerate on thier studing and forget about this kind of thing , therefore even the child ha the intention to help his community his parent may let him down . as a resolt tje child willdo the same thing with his child when he grow up . in addition community are not in the same way they used to be . there are some certin custom that recent communityies think that they like a holy thing , no can talk about it and say his opnion about it . before community were used to to live anin a way that everyone ha his own duty and in sometimes when have ve a festival or something like that . but nowadays these habbits have dissapeared in some way and just egsists in some small comunities who stell do a thier father did . so , one of the resons whay young do not help in thier community . in conclusan , i want to say that young people do not do anything worth in thier community becouse of the parent way to look at this kind of thing and for the community way of looking to young do jops that they think it is not found for people .
