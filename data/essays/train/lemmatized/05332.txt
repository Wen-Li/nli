the number of car ha been continuously increasing in the last fifty year . this brought to the result that city are getting more and more crowed every year , especially big city in which it is becoming almost impossible to go around by car . a great solution to this problem is to improve public transportation and i believe in the last year we have been trying to do so . using bus , subway and any other kind of public transportation will give a chance to our city to be le crowed by car . plus in twenty year our public transportation will improve with no doubt , the service will be more efficient giving le chance to be late for the people who use it . thus owning a car wo n't be convinient anymore . even today people tend to choose to go around without car because using your own car take much more time and brings a lot of more stress in your day . simply finding a place to park most of the time take lot of efford and often it will not be near the place we need to go . i believe in twenty year price of transportation will decrease a well . starting from plane , their price will be cheaper and long trip wo n't be done by car anymore , too long and unconfortable compared to cheap plain ticket . we also have to consider the increasing growth of population . cities are already crowded with car nowadays , if we do n't find a way to reduce them , we really will not be able to live in a city any more . finding a way to make people use other transportation will be necessary and inevitable . about searching new way i completely believe technology is the best answer we can find . i 'm positive that in twenty year technology will step forward many time giving u new imputs and solution to deal with the problem of car , and all this new improvement will definitely make people own fewer car then today .
