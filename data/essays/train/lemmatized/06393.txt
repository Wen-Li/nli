although it totally depends on how a person look at his or her life to say he or she is enjoying his or her life , from my experience a a man who just turned 31 , i disagree with this statement . as far a i am concerned , older people can have more chance or time to enjoy their life and more of them might already have got great memory that can last until the last day of their life . i believe that older people enjoy life more than young people do for the following a few reason . first of all , most of those ` older people ' are assumed to have retired or to be in the near future which mean they already have enough money in their saving or other investment portfolio to live without working for the last of time . it is not unusual to see those older people who are doing all the fun stuff they could not or have put off for a long time . it is possible for them to enjoy their life because they worked or have been working for such a long time preparing for retirement . also , since mostly the older people do not have to work to support their own family by the time around retirement , there are not much time for them to get stressed . it lead them to more enjoyable moment they have wished for . at last , the older people can finally have their own time spending more time with each spouse and other community and so on assuming all the child are independent of their parent financially and economically . in conclusion , a long a heath condition for both young and older people remain quite same , the older people have better chance to enjoy their life than young people in many way including financial and ecomical reason .
