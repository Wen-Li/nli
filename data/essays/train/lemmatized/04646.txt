this quotation about successful people is not an easy question and i do not have a ready-made answer . on the one hand , i think that it is true that successful people try news thing and take risk . indeed a manager who decides to set up his own businness take risk . he is not sure that his shop or company will be a success . consequently he take a risk that he will not make money , whereas in the company he worked a an employee he wa sure to obtain each month his wage . nevertheless , if his business performs he will make money easily . thus , the remunertation he will have is the conterparty of the risk the manager took . in my opinion , i consider that ambitious people are often the same who are successful . on the other hand , this affirmation might be refuted . indeed , sometimes people became popular and successful not because they took risk but rather because there were at the good place at the good time . it is rather a question of opportunity . why do not take into account the case of a son who becomes successful just because of he is the son of his father / he ha done nothing but he is well-born . moreover , there are people who take risk but do not automaticaly become successful . then , if we analyse the case of a singer we can also criticize the quotation . the singer is famous and rich and everybody speak about him . however can we say that he is successful because of the risk he took / what are the risk in this case / as far a i am comcerned , i do not agree to recognise the risk he may have taken . then , there are also people who take risk in doing what they already know . for instance , the pilot or the driver of a bus take each day some risk because they may create a danger for the passagers . in a certain way , they are successful person .
