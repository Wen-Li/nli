i totally agree with the idea that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one spesific subject . one good example of an academic subject is medicine . i have a friend who study medicine at medical scool right now . she often tell me about her school and about doctor . now i will explain following reason and example which i heard from her to support my opinion . first , it is difficult to diagonise desises . for example , if you are an ophtalmologist and one patient came and she insisted that she could n't see well . you checked her eye but noting wa wrong with her eye . in that case , there might be something wrong with her brain . however if you do n't have any knowledge about a brain , you ca n't think about it . you ca n't save the patient from her eye sight problem . we ca n't say that you are a good doctor . second , if you have only have knowkedge about medicine , it is fun to talk with others about medicine . probably you will be speaking with other doctor only . however there are many kindsof people in this world . you can gain and learn many thing form talking with them . you do n't talk only about medicine with them . a lot of knowledge will help you to communicate with others and make friend . from these reason and example , i think we shoud have many kind of knowledge . it is fun to study one feild and specialize it . however while we specialize one subject , we should also study broad subject . this will make u to have a lot of friend an knowledge in our life .
