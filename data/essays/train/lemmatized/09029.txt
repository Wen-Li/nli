nowadays young people do not give enough time to helping their community because they are more thing to do . i think that young people likely would help their community but they have not the time for do it . an example i go at university everyday when to back go at home i study , eat , sleep and i have not the time to talk with my friend . i have not time to talk with my friend and i do n't help the people more near to me for this reason i can not help my community . i think that many people like me have same problem because nowadays in the life there are more stress than in the past . i do n't think that one person do n't help her-his community if he/she can do it . today we think only at to work because in this society is the best opportunity for to have much money and to have in this way a good life . in the past , pheraps , there is not the stress that there is nowadays . i know that this a incorrect behavior but i want to think about me before of to think to helping my community . however when i can give enough to helping my community i do n't have problem do it . infact in my life i helped many people also because i work without to earn money in the hospital however when i had more free time while now with the university i have not time . in my opinion this problem is only problem about the time , the fast to live and other problem of this type but no for choise .
