regarding the question of agreeing or disagreeing with the statement that indicates that `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' , i would have to disagree . the main reason : why pick one side of the balance , when - at least in this case - you can choose both ? i think that the specific knowledge of a subject doe not excuse a person of knowing other subject , even if it is at a small level . knowledge always complement our activity and , most importantly , it complement ourselves . knowledge make u more complete individual and better professional , no matter what activity , profession or craft we practice . imagine if the statement wa true . .. if we could only pick one side of the balance it could be inferrered that an aeronautical engineer would not be able to sustain a conversation with the louvre museum curator , for example . do you imagine what they both would be missing ? regarding the second part of the statement reffering to `` broad knowledge of many academic subject '' i disagree based on personal experience . i 'm a journalist , and in my country there 's a saying that state that journalist have `` an ocean of knowledge . .. only one inch deep '' . this highly offends me , because it generalizes the idea that a journalist is not able to conduct and actual investigation on a subject ( because of his lack of knowledge depth ) . on the other hand , i 've seen journalist use this `` statement '' a an excuse for their lack of knowledge and investigative capacity , which offends me even more ! why not have specific subject knowledge combined with broad knowledge of other subject ? for me , this is the perfect choice : it allows me to become a more complete professional and person , and to talk and exchange idea with a variety of people and professional , which derives into constant learning of new thing . this would also make the world a much `` social '' place : everybody could satisfactory discus topic and exchange idea with lot of different people . the world would n't be made of `` knowledge ghetto '' ( engineers vs . artists , musicians vs . chemists ) . could you imagine the isolation ? so let 's get all the knowledge we can , both broadly and specifically . when it come to knowledge , do not choose a side , learn about them all !
