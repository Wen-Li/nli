it is rightly said that `` knowledge lead to success '' but it is also said that `` half knowledge is dangerous '' . according to me one should have knowledge of all subject when you are undergraduate level but when you go for master degree or doctrate degree one have to specilize in a perticular subject . having broder knowledge is always useful . one should have a broader perspective of all subject at school level and college level . this provides them with a carrier option who are really confuse what to choose a there future and what they are good at . knowledge is helpful in every walk of life . people here are really confused about distributng and how to utilize their knowledge . one should understand that knowledge is never wasted . if one is gaining master degree for instance he can not do master in all subject . in that case he ha to choose a specific subject . but imagine if there is a group of old school friend meeting after several year and if all are from different field . imagine a person sitting quite and can not speak because he ha no knowledge of what they are arguing on . what a miserable situation that is . hence according to me every type of knowledge is useful in life but one ha to make a choice in later part of his life have to go for a single subject .
