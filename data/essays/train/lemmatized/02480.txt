although some may assert that knowing the fact is the most important thing when studying , i believe that it is much beneficial for student to actually understand the idea and concept for their better study . to begin , it would be much time-saving for child to grasp the concept before studying the fact of the subject . if they memorize the fact initially and then try to understand the idea , it would take them more time to obtain all the knowledge in that area . since people usually forget the fact they memorized , after going through the concept of the study they are working on . for instance , if i memorize the term used in water circulation and then try to understand the concept of it , i would have to go over the word again , since i have to fit my knowledge into what i have learned right now . while understanding the idea in the first place can make me only fit the term in to what i have already done understanding . on top of that , it would make the study much easier to know the concept first . when one understand the thins and then learn the fact related in it , it come to person 's mind in more influential way . the study of math can be a good example . if a child in a kindergarten learns that ` 1 plus 1 is 2 ' , they would know that ` 1 plus 1 is 2 ' but do not actually understand the term of plus . while , if they initially learn what plus actually mean , then they would know that ` 1 plus 1 is 2 ' and ` 3 plus 2 is 5 ' and so on . by understading the idea of something , it lead people to learn in more efficient way . by grasping the concept of the subject , one can save their time and effort . all in all , i believe that learning idea and concept of something in the first place is much benefitable and profitable for the people to actully learn and study a subject .
