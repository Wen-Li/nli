young people these day tend to have le contribution to their community compared to the previous generation ( s ) , this is very obvious if we had a look at the behavior of most of the youngster , for example young people in the old day used to help their family working in farm , raising cattle or in any other business the family might run . they were also very compassionate to other poor people were they used to look after them or help them a much a they can . whereas these day young people are found to be much le of a help to thier family or to the community in general ; they tend to look after their own interest or even spend any spare time relaxing . there are several reason to this change in behavior : the first and most important reason is that the whole world is demanding more and more on currency for living , the demand of an an average person are increasing too which lead to more work required to keep up with the accelerating life style . communities are growing bigger which lead to having le effort being done to community member . also religious instruction are not being taken a seriously a they used to be and hence le help is being provided to the community . in conclusion changing life style lead to change in behavior and personality of the young people and a a result young peolpe are le helpful than they used to be .
