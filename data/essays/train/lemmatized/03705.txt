when one weigh the pro and con of using a car , it will lead to an inevitable conclusion : in twenty year car will become a kind of ` endangered specie ' in our modern society . currently , this question is raising a huge controversy because , on the one hand , car is widely used a a traditional mean of transportation and car are also a part of our cultur [ especially , in the us , where car driver are totally enamored with their car ] . but on the other hand , the increasingly price of petroleum and fossil fuel , the environmental issue linked to the widespred use of car and other drawback make people think more deeply about car . as a matter of fact , i maintain that car are going to disappear in a very close future , mainly because of economic reason and environmental issue . first and foremost , people are more and more concerned about the sharp growth of their expense . using a car involves a lot of shortcoming since it is very expensive to purchase a car , to buy oil and to ensure your car , for instance . so it seems that car tend to become le available for the middle class family in developped country . besides , one should bear in mind that it is not so comfortable to use a car because you have to endure traffic jam , which may end in traffic accident sometimes , you have to commute every day and i strongly believe that people are fed up with such problem . moreover , car will be fewer used in the next year because people are well aware that it is damaging to the environmemt and the nature around them . obviously , one should not expect modern human to renounce technological progress or to return to the stone age . but , if thing are left a they are , the human specie will finaly disappear . thus , i am sure that one should prefere rescue our planet and life of next generation rather than keeping his car . that is all the more crucial that the situation is obviously getting worse , so i can not help thinking that men are able to make sacrificies if it is worth it . similary , we can see the harmfull impact of car in our daily life . in big city there a lot of exhaust fume , a lot of noise , smog and pollution and , to my mind citizen will not stand it any longer . finally , the developpement of alternative way of transportation will also lead to a fewer use of car . for instance , a mayor in a big town can decide to increse the public transportation network , to make it more convenient and available in order to replace car . that is what happened in paris recently . to conclude , eventhough a lot of people are still addicted to their car , they will soon change their mind . economic reasonning and ecological issue are couple of reason which let u thinking that there will be fewer car in use in your city . there is no doubt that it will enhance our quality life for both generation , present generation and future generation .
