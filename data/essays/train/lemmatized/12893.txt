many people choose to specialize in one specific subject such a biology , litrature , or business . yet , there are people who have abroad knowlegde of many acadamic field all together . it is important for a person to expand it knowledge by studying different subject in different field . studying different subject will help people understand more of what is around them . if a person study economics for instance , he/she will understand the economy country very well . but can this person complete this subject without using math ? therefore , many program were built to help student obtain a sense of link between subject . an example of these program is myp and pyp , where student are teached to creat a linkage between health and economics for example . if a person ha no knowledge in other subject he will be lost in many part of this world . for example , if a scientist ha specialized in science and only science , he would have a great knowlegde about biology and chemistry but he would be a stranger to other subject . he would not understand politics . he would not understand the world around him and what is happening other than in his scientific point of view which ha nothing to do with politics and such field . having broad knowledge of many acadamic subject help in communicating with others . for instance , people from different field can share talk among themselves . a scientist will be able to chat about litrature with a historian or an engineerer . it will be easier to make friend and chatting mate . a person with only a specialized subject will have a hard time dealing with his work . it might be hard for him to find a job or work at his job when it come to dealing with other area other than his field . this is why many company and bank work on training their employee to have them learn more about different subject . this is why i think that having a abroad knowledge is better than specializing in one area or feild .
