i am 24 year old and a student , so i have not so much money and i am unsure about what the future will bring . therefore i disagree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than older people do . one reason for my disagreement is the perspective for the future , which differs between younger and older people . younger people usually do not have concrete plan for their future . therefore it is difficult to really enjoy life , because one always think about what the future will bring . i know these problem when i have to decide wether to spend a lot of money for a new computer , an enjoyment for me , or better save the money . due to the reason that i do not know wether i will get a job , it may be better not spending so much money . older people mostly have a job and spending the money will not have such a big importance . another reason why older people enjoy life more than younger people do , is their opportunity to spend more money for certain activity they enjoy . for example i would enjoy learning how to fly a plane , but i do not have enough money to take course . older people may have enough money to learn how to fly a plane and therefore can enjoy in doing so . beside these example , enjoyment may also mean to have a wife and child . this is something generally older people have . so from my situation today , i look forward to have my own family and i think i will enjoy it . the reason and example above show , that older people may have le problem concerning money . they also may have a familiy and may be able to perform cost intensive activity they like . in contrast to that , younger people do not have these possibility and often have to think about their future . therefore i think that older people can enjoy and do enjoy their life more than younger people do . so i am looking to the future and think that i will enjoy my life when i am older .
