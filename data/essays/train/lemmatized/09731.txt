since god creation of adam and eve , preceeding generation were always fascinated toward providing the aid and support for others specially that god and his prophit mohammed had huge focus upon these issue and how is it going to aid a person 's happiness when it come to the judgement day . from here , we can understand how it 's important for u not just to look at others just a they are regular people , but look at the a human . i agree that young people are not gived enough time in helping their community . throughout the topic , i will use specific reason and example to support my openion . first of all , people can help in their community and it 's strongly recommended to that but there are certain point we neet to put into an account when we are speaking about younger people who are not given the obligation to do so and it can be summarized a followed : 1 ) younger kid do n't have sufficient time since all their time is spent upon their study , specially when it come for a person who he or she is willing to get good grade to get accepted in a well - know university . 2 ) youngsters are always attached to their family specially their parent and elder brother and or sister . they mimic what elderly do and by this they can be affected by their vision toward life 3 ) life matter , such a focusing on their career and wanting to give their maximum when they are assigned at workplace 4 ) it 's not the proper time for a child to volunteer and when it come the time to do so i totally agree 100 % for each one of them to go and so . all these factor influence a child 's thought regard providing help to their community and from my personal point of view i think the more a person get elder the more wiser he or she will be because a you know each person when he or she do any sort of additional job , it will be attached in their cv 's and at the same time you will gain experience , built self-steam and enrich your soul with god 's happiness toward putting a smile on other 's face . in conclusion , each person must look at his or her neigbour not a a person but a a human giving them all the need and support the will to have from you and from this i can conclude that if a person wa givin a sufficient time from aiding others he or she will not refuse .
