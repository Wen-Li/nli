young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their cmmunities . as we knowk , the develpment of the world in diffirent waysw is getting increasing more and more . this , will effect the time . let 's take the internet a an example , a range of 4 to 6 hour is being spent ; and when you add this to the time that is spent on the education and sleeping we will see mostly no time to help the community . parents can helpe by teaching them the importance of our community and we must focus on how can we develope them . keep in mind that young people should be a developer for the community not only a consumer . these word have to be touhgt in depth to them and sure we will see a good generation that help not only our community but also our proparaties that exist everywhere . finally , the enviroment where the young people raised in is important with the nature of thier parent .
