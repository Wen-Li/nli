nowadays , the fuel price is upper higher and higher each year . we have to spend more money and tax to use our car . therefore , i agree with in twenty year there were be fewer car in use than there are today . first of all , the lack of fuel is the most considerable thing to decrease the use of car . as we know , fuel are now a much a we could take . one day , we have to face the problem that we have the car but we do n't have feuls . the price of feuls also will increase year by year . that woule make many people lost their desire of buying a car . besides , finding a parking space for your car also a difficulty . you have to spend much more time to find parking spot than you shopping . secondly , the train and mrt system is built up much more than it used to be . we could take mrt or train instead of driving car our self . the commuting system could be much faster , much safer , and could save more money . epecially on holiday , the freeway just like a huge parking space . you have to waste much time to arrive the destination . we do n't have to worried about that when you take the train . finally , conbine those reason i mentioned above , there are much more reason for u to decrease the number of use our car . air pollution is the most concern problem of using car . it wa also bad for our health . to keep our environment clean , car control is a issue we fave that 's why i agree with there will be fewer car in use after twenty year .
