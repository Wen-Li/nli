in my opionion , successful people are the one who try to create or do something new . the more one developes him or herself , the more success he or she gain . it can be obviously observed from the civilization ' development . a the civilization improve themselves they reach higher power . that is the same with the success of people . improvement and trying new thing ha some risk a well . the risk of to be unsuccessful is one of the greatest one . in my opinion , people are abstaining to take new action due to the fear of taking the risk of fail . however it is over estimated idea . you can not do anything if you do not try to do something new . perhaps some might say that it will be better off by trying to do your own job in best manner and way . but the question of ` what to do after specializing on the thing you do ' still remains . i agree that it is more likely to specialize on some issue . however after specializing , developing that issue , gaining new approach and taking risk to do something new brings success . for instance do you think that microsoft could be such successful if it had not improved it techonolgy or renewed it software ? i think it would be impossible at all . eventually it would be a risk for microsoft not to work for further development . we are living in a process that always recquires improvement . that is why we should always try to improve ourselves in our job , or the smallest thing that we do in our normal life . creativity is the thing that brings success . if you stay behind this process and stay a you are , do what you always do , you can never be successful . you can only be whatever you are and always be the same .
