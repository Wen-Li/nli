i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . recently , there are many people who need help in our community such a the people who have disability or elderly people . for example , in japan , we have the greatest number of people who have the age of over sixty-five today . in spite of the fact that there are a lot of elderly people who are waiting for the help , there are not enough young people who can support them because they do not have much time for helping people . first of all , young people are more likely to work rather than help community recently . for instance , a lot of young people prefer to have pattern job because they want to earn more money for theirselves . young people are usually independent enough to live by theirselves , so they can not get affored by their parent any more , so they need to work hard . on the other hand , a lot of opportunity which contribute for the community are unpaid work such a volunteer work ; therefore , student who want to earn money dont have interest to spent the time to help community . secondary , young people are busy for studying nowadays . a lot of university student are busy for doing their project or homework everyday , so they do not have extra time to help community . in japan , many people think it is getting difficult to get hired by a good company recently ; therefore student have to study harder than others and win the competition to get better job in the future . to conclude , young people do not have much time to contribute for the community recently because they are busy for working and studying .
