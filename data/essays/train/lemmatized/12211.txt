there can be many opinion in this topic that twenty year later car will be fewer than today . actually the oil and gas will be gone in 21c . however i disagree with this statement . because car is developing very fast and in some year we can needed just 1liter of oil to go 30km . moreover before the oil and gas gone scientist will make new car that go by electricity or by sun light . first , car is developing extemly fast . before 10years normal car can go 5or 6km by 1liter of oil , however now car can go 18km by just 1liter of oil . and now car is developing very fast that , we can not imagine . for example , their wa a car that , go 5km per 1liter of oil . and in the future car will go 30km per 1liter of oil . than oil needed 1/6 than the past . however scientist calculated that only 40years left to use all of oil and gas . however when car develop like this , the time will be spent 120 year to use all of oil and gas . and of course you will change your car when you use 15 ~ 20years . than it mean after 20years there will be a plenty of car by development of car . second , scientist will develop and make the car that do not need any oil and gas . like electronic car or sun light powered car . now vents the car company is developing the electronic car and sun light powered car . and vents company will make that car in 20years . that mean in 20years people do not need oil and gas car anymore . for example , the oil and gas price rise up , like 3times than now . after that oil price rise up car company made electronic and sun light powered car . than what do you prefer to buy ? new car or oil and gas powered car . many people will buy the new powered car . than there can be a plenty of car on the street like now day . in my opinion i think there will be plenty of car after 20years . because car will be develop very fast and scientist will make electronic car or sunlight powered car . and this will make people to ride car after 20years
