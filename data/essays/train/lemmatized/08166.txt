the humankind always need advertisement to reach good life standart therefore advertisement is a very important aspect of humanslife . everyone ha different point of view about the idea of advertisement . some assume that , advertisement make product seem much better than really they are , in contarry to those , some think that advertisement is reflects the origin of product . i personally agree with the second idea . these are my following reason . firstly , advertisement is important because of customer . for example , last month i decided to give a party in my home . i live apart from my parent so i did n't know which brand is really good . actually , i have no idea about food . however i had wanted to give a very good party . when i went to supermarket , i look around and some brand are similar for me. i have sen them in the advertisement so i could remember . i believe others idea about the brand and when i prepared the meal , i wa very pleasure . everthing wa okay in my party . i am sure that , advertisement open a light for me. if i did n't have any idea about this product , i think nothing would be better than my decision which are learned me from advertisement . secondly , advertisement are important for education . it is not only important for food or clothes . for instance , last year i decided to take spanish course . i did n't have any idea about which course is better and i had no friend who took a spanish course . then , i looked in the internet because there are a lot of forum where people tell their idea about different point . when i entered the such website , i wa face to face with a lot of idea . however , when i read all of them , one course is more populer than others . therefore , i decided to take a course in there . i think , it ha become beneficial for me. although there wa some bad information or idea in the ionternet , i can select the suitibla one . in my opinion , this is a kind iof advertisement in the internet and it is the most logical way . to last but not least , advertisement have an important role on purchasing . moreover it is beneficial for businessmen . for example , if i am hungry i want to eat something which is showed in the television advertisement . and , in one week even if i eat my meal , i buy this product . i think , this condution affect the rate of purchasing . by this way , people can sell a lot of product . for instance , last evening my little cousin wa watching television and she saw a advertisement about milk . in the advertisement , a baby wa drinking milk and he wa beginnig to grow up . he is taller after he drink milk . even if my cousin doe n't like drinking milk anymore , he tell u that he want to drink milk . i think , this advertisement ha positive affect both the customer and seller . it is a fact that , milk is beneficial for child to grow up healty , so it reflects the main idea truely . in addition to this , it is important for seller , because advertisement ha positive effect on buying some good . all in all , a i said before advertisment is important for purchasing and it is beneficial for customer . advertisement is related with both customer 's necessity and seller 's benefit . the long but the short is that , advertisement ha positive effect on people and it reflects the main product truely .
