i agree the best way to travel is in a group led by atour guide for many reason . first , tavel with atour guide can save your time . so , you can know the whole the place you visit such a city or island or any general place with short time , because you have a tour guide can answer your question any time . second reason , atour guide ha a good expert for what you should to visit or what you should not or not intrestting for you . another resone , travel with groub can make the trip more fun and more usefule . every one can meet with a new man or woman . so that can be helpful to know detals about him or her . sometimes , we know a new culter when we travel in agroub . i think travel with groub is the best way to make the trip more fun .
