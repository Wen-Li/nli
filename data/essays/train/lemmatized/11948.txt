young people are more energetic and they might therefore appear to enjoy life more than older people . however , in my opinion , happiness and enjoyment are closely related to a human being 's state of mind , no matter what the biological age of that person is . therefore , i do not agree that young people enjoy life more than older people do . one can reason that young people have lesser responsibility and therefore more reason to enjoy life . again , this might not always be the case . i would like to give the example my friend who wa financially supporting his family when we were still in school . he had taken on responsibilites early in life , however , that did not keep him from enjoying it . he seemed to be the happiest person in my class . i think his happness had to do with how satisfied he wa with life . on the other hand some older people do not loose their sense of adventure . they keep their body fit through exercise and use their strength to travel and enjoy the vacation they could not afford when they were younger , due to time or money constraint . some older people enjoy hobby they otherwise never had time for . i know of a gentleman who started writing poetry after he retired from work . his poem were greatly appreciated and he soon published a book . at the same time there are young people who get disillusoned and resort to self destructive or illeagle act in the pursuit of enjoyment . in conclusion , it doe not matter what the age of the person is . if a person ha a healthy state of mind , he / she will always manage to enjoy , no matter what his / her age .
