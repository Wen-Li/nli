for sure im totally agree with that statement , in adition to that i will explain why for two point of viewing , one personal and another more objective ; i remember long time ago , when i wa studing a elemental school all teacher were making u to stock in our memory useless data , name and another crappy stuff that nowadays i still not using . now im a physic , and the most part of my personal world is ruled by mathematical law , equallities , operator and overwhelming logic . i know this thing cause my college professor taught me to smart-thinking by making me undertanding all from the basic , i.e : nothing about memmory but yes in understanding . this wa a brief and personal explanaiton of why i am totally agree with the statement , now i will focus on reason and example to support my answer . firstly , fact are of course useless if it have not a concept or idea within ( newton and the apple falling is a ridiculous fact if newton wasnt explained all with his newtonian mechanics theory , when we see that exists a force field called gravity ) . of course fact are sometimes funny o funniest than an explanation of a concept , but talking in term of use or importance , concept win . imagine an example of a science student , to be more accurate a biology one ; in the college a professor say to his student that human body is made from water and carbon basically , it ok , but this is only a fact that contains only a partial true . the idea of the human body is the community of a lot of organism living together to mutual advantage that are called cell , of course these cell are made of water and carbon , but that is only the fact that a lot of living unit conforming the human body are chemical composed by water and carbon , the idea is that carbon and water could create different type of microscopic structure depending on his molecular structure giving place to the formation of cell . well , if the student only knew that human body is made of carbon and water , nowadays organ transplant would be impossible , a lot of modern medical threatments also would be imposible , genetic therapy also would be impossible too , only cause we knew a partial true instead the big one .
