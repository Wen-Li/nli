it is good to have knowledge on many academic subject , however , upto what extent we need that amount of knowledge is questionable . in my opinion , specilizing in one specific subject will bring lot of good academic work . suppose that you are a person who have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . this mean that you studied a lot and learned a lot of thing . but first question appearing is that doe that person really need that amount of knowledge ? and , more importantly , by using that knowledge , can he focus on the topic properly ? i claim that speclization will bring efficiency , time management , and gain in focus . for instance , in society , almost everybody is specialized on a specific job . in other word , a a rational people , everybody want to do the job in which he ha a comperative advantage . by doing so , not only the person will be happier but also the society will be more close to a pareto efficient allocation . on the other hand ; if people know a broader knowledge of many thing , then they might have some useless information and lose their focus on subject . another example would be related to an academician 's situation . when writing a paper , almost always specifing on a certain topic is a much a desirable . for instance . if that person specifies in the field of industrial organization and game theory , the paper that he will be writing will certainly be affected by the knowledge that he created in that field before . however ; if he focus on different field and try to specialize in a lot of field at the same time , there might emerge some problem regarging to the accumulation of knowledge in the future . everytime he writes on a specific area , he need to focus on that field again , and this will take considerable amount of time and bring inefficiency . in conclusion , i think that it is better not only for people but also for society to specilize on certain subject . it might sound good to know everything at the first place , however , a deeper thinking on this topic show that there might be loss on the time and efficiency concern .
