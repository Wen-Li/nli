nowadays , scolarship ha developped a lot and people have an ever increasing pannel of choice to study . thus we feel entitled to wonder if it is better to study many academic subject or to study a specialized subject . we will see first that in some case it is better to be specilalized but then , we will demonstrate that it is often beneficial to study a large pannel of subject . first of all , the specialization in a subject is useful and preferable for some people . indeed , when you have studied only few subject , you are better in the field concerned . thus , some job need to be specialized . to be a doctor is a case in point . someone who want to be a doctor had better to learn only biology and medecines to be better and to succeed . moreover , it is preferable to learn only one subject when you are very intersting in it . indeed , if you love what you do , you will have better result and you will be le disturbed . you will be more concentrated in what you are studying . however , specialization is not everytime the best thing to do . studying a large range of subject at school make people more open minded and more cultivated . in a matter of fact , when you are not specialized , you will discover in some subject very interesting thing that you would have not discovered by yourself . in addition , learning many subject enable people to be more adaptable and to practice a large scale of work . for instance , in a buisness school , student can reach many different job because they have studied a lot of different subject such a finance , marketing , human resource . .. this kind of person is able to replace itself in the case of non success or non interest . all in all , we can say that specialising in a subject can be useful for people who know what to do in order to be the best in their field . yet , to broad own 's knowledge enable to adapt to everyone and to reconvert ownself .
