i disagree with the statement according to which it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than to learn fact for the following reason : first , a theory must always be followed by a praxis , a the austrian philosopher karl popper used to state at the beginning of last century . as an example , this make me think of the last class on pedagogy i attended at the university of bologna ( italy ) a couple of week ago : the professor told u that student need to know fact , but it is also true that in my country on the whole we student are not trained so practical way second , i believe that what make history is praxis , fact and event , not just theory : it is the praxis that determines the change and the development of history . third , a young student who is more `` theorical '' than practical ( just like me unfortunately , i should say ! ... ) can give the impression of living in another world and he sometimes can even have some difficulty in everyday life : how many time have i personally felt somehow lost and unconfident in practical situation that apparently were not so hard to face ! ... that is due to the fact that unfortunately i am still not so experienced , i believe . .. ! in conclusion , i believe that idea and concept should always be related and applied to fact , even though i can understand that that is not always the case .
