there are different type of people in our society and every individual ha his or her own ideal . while some of these people prefer to continue the way the situatuion they 're in , some always try to do new thing and to improve themselves . in my opinion , first of all , one ha to improve himself every passing second . you should never stop at a point and say ` well , that 's enough for me ' . in order to do this , though , one should always try new thing , otherwise there would n't be any develeopment . at this point it should be considered that there might exist some risk at new thing . new try could lead one not only to success , but also they could lead one to failure which would be an unpleasent eperience for everyone . in order to give an appropriate example to the subject , i should mention about my fahter who ha come to germany a a worker and worked for many year a a humble worker . by the time he ha been working in germany he received a salary which wa not that immense . but he than saved his money to make a capital form his earnings and to try some new bussiness with his saving . he got involved to estate bussiness and succeeded . but there wa this big risk that could have lost all his saving by investing it in an inappropriate bussines . if he would n't took this risk , though , and kept working at a factory for a low salary , he would n't have been able to be in the situation currently he is in . but this doe n't mean that one shoud always risk to be succesful . one could be succesful in other way a well . some charachteristics of an individual such a ambition , hard and steady working never givin up , could also enable the person to achieve his or her aim . though i think that it would worth to take risk in order to achive important goal . therefore i agree withe the statement that one should take risk to be successful .
