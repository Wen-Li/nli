that depends of what kind of tour do you need , if only you want to see turistical place or you are interested and the history of those place , or if you want to hang out by yourself knowing that your not going to know much about the place that you going to planificate everything by yourself . a tour guide can be a good decision because he can show and also tell you about the place history , the main part , famous part of the place and you can learn a lot from it . for example i went on vacation last month to the niagara fall with a tour guide and it wa intresting of the evolution and the information that the tour guide oferred me . but if you go by yourself you 're not going to learn anything you just going to take picture and have fun . another reason is you can get lost without a tour guide , you dont know where to go and sometimes you can even feel lost and tired , and addition to that is more dangerous because you never know what could happen . when you go with someone that you can ask any question that you have you feel more relaxed more confident and secure . another problem depends if you going with your family or is just friend or if you have kid , why ? because of the planification , if you have kid is better to go with a tour guide that way you do n't have to deal with the problem of route that you 're going to select , for example : the firts place that you going to land that you goint to visit , not including map and route that you 're goint to need not to get lost . so the best choice will be in most of the case going on travel with a tour guide .
