the issue of `` understanding idea and concept , than to learn fact '' , is quite an interesting , raising significant interest in today 's world of competition and survival of the fittest . many student believe that fact are more important than understanding idea and concept , and at first glance it appears to provide an adequate solution . however , when juxtaposed with the alternative of understanding idea and concept , the solution of learning fact appears le convincing . the importance to understand idea and concept ha several advantage over learning fact a mentioned below . firstly , by understanding idea and concept , student can apply the knowledge they gain while studying , to the career they pursue later on in their life . for example a car mechanic , who understands how the machinery in a car function , can easily diagnose the problem a car is facing , when the car is brought to the workshop . this can make him a better car mechanic , with experience he can go on to become a successful manager in an automotive shop , and someday own his own automotive company . secondly , a better understanding of different subject taught in school and college , can have many different benefit . let u take the example of a biology student . what he learns during his biology class can be applied to real world situation . he learns that growing tree can cause so many health benefit by improving the functioning of our ecosystem . planting tree in an area can increase the amount of rainfall , thus solving a water shortage problem . there are many good reason for the opposing argument to argue that to learn fact is sufficient . however it doe not have the several advantage which understanding idea and concept ha , a mentioned above . such a better career growth and benefit to the society and environment . thus i would like to conclude that understanding idea and concept provides a much better solution a it is not undermined by potential drawback .
