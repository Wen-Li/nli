i disagree with the idea of a society formed by selfish young people . it 's not completely true . it depends on their family , their friend and their social background . indeed , if you lived in a family where your parent think only about themselves because they are concentrated only on their job , it would be difficult to think helping the community . in this case , the son or the daughter usually think about her or his study , toy , thing , good and not about the others who can need their help . if i lived in a different family where my parent have taught me to help other people and also animal , the matter would change . we can start also from our home and our daily routine . if i taught my son that it 's important to help me doing something , he could do the same in other occasion when he is not at home . if my son stayed at home in front of tv all the day and i said nothing about that , it could be negative for his sense of help and responsabilities . so all begin from the education . the education to help someone is the basis . it doe n't depend on young people but on their education . i have met in my life a lot of interesting young people who help every day their friend or people in need . they always belong to a catholic society or have many strong value such a family , love , friendship , sacrifice and so on . they always believe in something : god or politic value . or they believe in some utopistic theory such a communism . i never met generous and unselfish young people without strong value . so where young people are not interested to help their community is where there is a lack of important value . i believe in some strong catholic value and i try in my free time to help other people in differrent way . i 'm a teacher and i work in some case without earning in order to help some poor people . there is another important point and it always depends on education : young people sometimes have too many hobby and appointment in a day and so there is no time left for helping people . if a parent prohibited this kind of day routine , young people could be le busy and they could have more available time to help others in need . in conclusion , in the soul of young people , there is the desire to help the community and the adult have to help them to do that .
