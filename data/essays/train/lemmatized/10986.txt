i am inclined to support both position because both have their own validity . however , i believe that , in the next future , there will be more car in use compared to now . i am deeply convinced , in fact , that many development country , such a china or india , in the next twenty year , will improve their economy . althought they have different tradition , and diverse way in witch they move in their country , they will probably start to buy car . at the moment , just a few million of chienese people have enough money to buy a car , but in the future , they will be able to afford it . moreover a few day ago , when i wa at home , i wacthed a tv 's program about this topic . it wa focused on the chinese 's reality and it tried to explain what are their dream . i wa really surprised because they said that car is the most important dream for this poplutation . in fact , they admired our society and they probably would like to have the same `` quality of life '' a we have . althought we already known that car are doing many problem in our earth and plante , in fact , will still using it . i am deeply convinced that if you live in a big city ( rome or barcelona for instance ) you will have pollution 's problem . for this reason when i became older i decide to sell my car . i have n't had a car since 2000 . after that my father decided to give me a gift : a bmw . it wa so nice and i wa so excited , but two year later i decided to sell it . i believe that car doe n't improve our `` quality of life '' and for this reason i really do hope that in twenty year the situation wo n't be different respect i have just written in this essay .
