a day will come when there will be no automobile because of the pollution they cause and the depletion of the fuel resource . i totally agree with the topic that in 20 year there will be no car unless some major action is taken by the government to reduce the polution that is caused by the car . man invented car thinking that he would help the fellow being in using easy mean of the transport but , he never thought about the consequence that the planet earth might face due to excess usage of car . initially , car were actually used by the rich because it wa costly . but nowadays car are available at affordable price and are available in a wide range so this ha resulted in excess usage of car . firstly , the problem caused by the usage of car and thier effect are humangus . the car drink fuel to run so there is a need for excavation of fuel resource in the earth which ha resulted in soil erosion , land sliding and depletion of the natural resource . so unless a method to conserve these resouces are adopted the car may not be able to get the fuel to run in the future . secondly , another major problem caused by car are the pollution they create when their engine us fuel for combustion and give out highly dangerous exhaust gas which result in ozone layer depletion . as a result of this we are facing the problem of global warming . the solution to this is now being majorly thought about . new hybrid car are being designed so that they make use of le fuel . cars driven by electricity and fuel cell ( water ) are in a devoloping stage so that they reduce the pollution caused by their engine . only if these problem of using car are awnsered with good solution , the next generation can enjoy the thrill of traveling in a car . i would like to take my child 20 year down the line in a car which is100 percent pollution free . hope this happens !
