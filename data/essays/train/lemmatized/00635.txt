saying wether or not knowing many academic subject superficially is better than specialize in one speficic area of competence is very hard . i ca n't give an immediate answer because there are advantage and disadvanteges of both type of knowledge . people who have learned many academic subject will be prepared more completely than those who specified in one single subject . but the knowledge of the former will be clearly more superficial and inaccurate in every field than the knoweldge of the latter on the area of their competence . i would probably prefer having a broad knowledge of everything because it allows you to try different study and different job to test your ability and make your goal . furthermore i think it is more interesting to know little of everthing , you finally know a lot of thing that you could always want to know better later in your life . in addition this type of knowledge permit you to understand , . although superficially , different aspect of the world . on the other hand the person who know one single subject and who excells in it is oblyged to do that thing all his life . of course he can always improve his knowledge and find new goal to reach in the same field , like a researcher doe , but i think that not only it is more boring and le stimulating for our brain but it lessens one 's possibility to find a job in another work 's field . of course i have to admit that without people with a very specific knowledge in one field we would n't have progress in science or new discovery due to their patience and application in their subject . in conclusion i would say that it is good for a country to have people who grew up with both of these two different type of knowledge .
