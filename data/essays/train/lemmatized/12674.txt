most advertiments that company made for themselves look really good and perfect conduct for every consumer . however , consumer have experienced that conduct , they always made bad compliment about their conduct that they had already used because of too much expectation about conduct . however , i agree the reason that why most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are to consumer . there are two reason . the first reason of most advertisement emphasize much better than they really are is appealing to consumer . if company want to appeal to their consumer , they have to make a kind of ` fantasy ' to them about their product . if they do n't do that and they say about the truth , that could n't appeal their consumer ' market at all . in addition , if consumer heard just truth , they would think about their product a just normal other thing . then , it can be same thing like other product . there are no difference . therefore , for using some fantasy about their product , it would be a good way to appeal their consumer and market . the second reason of most advertisement look better than they really are is about their goal . naturally the most important thing in each company is about their goal that sell their product a much a possible . when the company make some advertisement , they have to think a new and creative way to sell . on advertisement , most company have to show only good side about their product to consumer . therefore , consumer might think that company make fun of their consumer . however , that is not true . in conclusion , it is the only way to appeal and sell their product to consumer for showing much better thing than they are . when consumer are seeing some commercial and they think '' wow , that is going to be really useful ! i want to have it ! '' . i think that the conduct is ready to be sold . that commercial is really good . the last my thinking about commercial is that commercial is made for ` cheating ' to consumer .
