especiallz the elderlz often complain about the younger genreation . in their opinion the zouth doe no longer spend much time of beneficial thing to their communitz . i think that 's true . in the following i want to point our = t several reason why . first , there is a more severe competition among young people on job than in the past . nowadays the youth ha to work harder to obtain their goal in their professional life . as a result activity that do not reward in the short run , like helping in the community , are no longer on the schedule of the youth . despite the honour of politician and new law to strenghten the juristical position of voluntary work , many abstain from it . second , in my opinion people are now more individual than earlier . young person occupy themselves with tv or video game . spending their time alone with no , or little interest in other people affair seems to be more atrractive . this egoistical behaivior can be found in a current published '' shell studie '' . as the study point out lesser and lesser young peole are enganged in public interest activity like foodball club or scout organisation . finally , acoording to the study we can assume that more person are not willing to work hard for other individual . as a result , oing something to your commmunity is always connected with some labour . most citizen think to lead a foodball club for kid , for example , can be no fun at all ! it is generally thought that having a beer in a pub or at home is more valuable spend freetime . but is it really ? i think not , working with child is quite satisfying . monitoring their progress and celebrate victory with the team is real fun , a i know from my own experience . to sum up , a fully agree with the statement . besides political ambition are visible , only view individual are engaged in helping their community .
