as it ha been shown by history , country which have been specializing in the production sector , have been growing economically faster and more effectiv . in my opinion , this can be compared with the differa big range of knowledge in several academic subject and the specialization in one subject . concentrating in more than one subject , always mean to neglect some important issue of anotherone . this cause to a wide knowledge of certain subject , but always lead to only an average understanding of the material . an example for it is playing many sport at the same time , and beeing an average player in it , or concentrating and focusing only on one particular sport and try to become a good a possible . then you will probably be one of the best in your team , which is in my opinion much better . but this could differ among various character . but the more important reason why i totally disagree to this statement , are the chance in finding a job after university . the better a person is in one sector , the more outstanding he will be in comparison to other applyers and so he will increase his chance . especially in nowadays people , those , who have not a nearly perfect or adaquat practise and experience in a certain section will not find a higher waged job . last but not least , it is much harder to try to maintain a certain level in different subject , because at least some of the theme can not be compared among all the class and have to be learned by hard singularly . to conclude , i want to claim , that in my personal opinion , not concentrating and sticking on one issue is le effectiv than trying to be good in several academic task .
