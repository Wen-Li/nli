in my opinion , i agree with that it is more important for student to understands idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact since it offer lot of advantage to student . among diver reason i support this opinion , there are two reason in that . first , throught understanding idea , student may become more logical than before . for example , when i wa a high school student , i would attend the experiment of sience class in laboratory . it make me solve the teacher 's prompt which make me get a complicated theory in the science . in addition , the course of experiment in the science class help me learn about new harmful phenomenon such a global warming , soil erosion , and so on which make me more sophisticated understanding the phenomenon . there for , i agree with that student must focus on understanding than learning fact since they would be logical . secondly , a student under standing idea , they can become a specialist in the specific scholarship which make all around the world thrive than before . for example , when i wa a middle school student , i would like to study geography since it provides exotic amusement and happiness . back then , particularly , my geography teacher had a special characteristic which expalin to understanding idea untill a number of student perfectly graps the content of geography . as a result , i could be a specialist in the geography and at the same time i had a major geography in the university . therefore , i prefer to understanding idea than to concept . as it is discussed above , i 'd like to understand idea than to concept since it provides lot of benefit to studen
