according to this topic , it is really a question whether using the broad mind in subject is the better way than specialize . due to their respective angle , different people hold different view . in my poinion , although the specialist in nowadays is important , the generalist is really the major part which can not be reduced . in the following discussion , i would like to provide the evidence to support my view on this topic . as the developing of the technology all over the world , things are changing with each passing day , the invention always appears in the market , and we could fairly said that the specialist in the program is doing the great construction . they have deep mind in their own major , and would provide the worthless suggestion to the people , if without their suggestion , it might be hard for people to invent the novel thing . although they do not have the wide knowledge of all the area , acturally the depth of the major they are specialized may not be touched by the generalist . and because of the depth , they could find out the useful imformations generalist could not find . to be honoest , if without them , just using the broad knowledge way , not all the invention could come out so quickly . hence the specialist is really play an important role over the world . the specialist contributed to the society , doe not mean the generalist is le useful . in the actual life , they just using their wide information to connect the major which they researched with the other area , which is important to the research . if a major just have their way and not communicate with the others , they would just like the frog in the hole , which could not get the farther developed . and the generalist using their broad knowledge of many academic subject to straighten the connect with the reference major , which would provide the researcher more space to think and to compensate the weakless , using this way , the technology is growing so fast and just this way can giving the sociey long development . from the above we can easily see that the specialist and generalist are all suficient to the society , either of which could not be missed . just using the whole imformation that they both summerized , the invention would stable in the society , and meet the need of customer . if just having the specilist , the thing is just adopted in the small area , which mean it can not get the greatly developed . and also , just using the generalist 's mind , the thing are not deep stand in the society , which mean the other product would easily over them in the short time . so the specialist and the generalist can not seperated . from the specilist , the generalist could get the detail of the invention , and from the generalist , the specialist would not just focus their eyesight in the tiny area , hence a the compensation they two get togher would take the novel developed to the technology .
