ever since i have been introduced to the learning system in our country , i have been always faced with two approach while learning : the american approach versus the french approach to deliver knowledge . whereas the french system encourages the assimilation of idea and concept for a specific topic , the american way tends to deal with the more practical side of that topic . but the question is : which one is the best ? here lie the `` chicken first or egg first problem '' . some belief that the best way of teaching a student about a subject is by introducing him/her and explaining to him/her the theory behind that subject . this way , the student knowledge about the subject is enlarged and then he/she might be able to predict fact emerging out of it . as an example , if i want to teach someone about how an engine is turned on , i would introduce him/her to the mechanical theory and concept behind it . while this approach is followed by many , others believe that exposing the student to fact ha far more impact than teaching the idea and concept . in other word , by being exposed to fact , student will gain the advantage of interaction and most probably will be simulated , leading him/her to understand the idea and theory behind the subject in a more efficient . in other word , if we are to come back to that engine example mentioned above , instead of explaining the theory behind how an egine is to be turned on , the way to run the engine can be presented to the student in a way to experience and being exposed to that subject , thus assimilating much of the theory behind the idea . i emphasize the importance of learning fact over understanding idea and concept . i can still remember the effect 's power that a fact will leave on student , at least on me when i wa back at the university . i wa more excited and felt more involved than when listening to abstract concept and idea .
