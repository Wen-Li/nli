i agree that young people enjoy life than old people . this agreement is based entirly on my own experience and common sense . to demostrate what i believe , i would like to state some view here . everytime when i meet young people , i feel an air of freedom . they may be presumptuous or fatuous , or even ill-mannered , but they are never anxious social climber . they may have little knowledge or even non-educated , but they have desire to explor the new world . unlike the old one who life and think via his early learning , and stopped there . all these can be defined by the air of freedom that lead the youth to be higher , stronger and faster in order to enjoy their life more than old people . another important condition is the physical and mental state of the youth . because of the limitation by age , the old lose lot of enjoyable thing . they may be rich and healthy , but they do not have interest to nice food ; they can buy a great varity of clothes , but they do not have good look . apart from their elder , the young take advantage of a nice age . no matter what clothes they put on , they seem to be active and handsome . they do not need to worry about the blood prssure while taking delicious pizzar or other fast food . life begin with good food . in conclusion , i admit that there are negative ponits to young people . the fear of unemployment , hard work , scarce resource , consist it . but they are lucky for the youth .
