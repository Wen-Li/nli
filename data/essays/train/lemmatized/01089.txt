it is a common vue that advertising lie on the real quality of the product it aim to sell . actually , it ha become one of the first goal set for most advertisement : to convince would mean to conceal . but the most important function that should , objectively thinking , be attributed to advertising is an informative role . we can think that advertising wa born with this idea , that result in some way from the only consumer 's interest : a society should inform it client on it different product , so they are able to make a better choice . eventually , it would have occured that information turned into disinformation , because each society want to get greater benefit by selling more and more . to appeal , advertising first play on dream and create new desire . but a radical step further is done when what just consisted in presenting the good aspect of a product becomes giving to it a wrong aspect . in fact , each human representation depends on desire : advertising turn an objective representation of the product into a subjective , desire dependent , representation , that allows the consumer to build a wrong image of the object . in that way , the product seems much better than it really is . for some particular product , we have an opposite process : the quality of the product come from the advertisement . it is the case , for example , in fashion or for all luxury product . the client will buy that specific car or that specific perfume , just because he want to be associated with the representation produced by the advertising . in that case , advertisement not only make product look better than they really are , but really improve the product and make him simply better .
