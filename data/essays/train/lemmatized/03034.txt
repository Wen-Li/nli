i totaly agree with the statment that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than doing the monotonus work , which he know how to perform well . a successfull person always show detremination , try to act differently , exploring new idea & ready to take challenge . successful person know ho get new achievment , he must have to perform differently , skillfully on different thing than a normal person to get success in his life . he always in search new idea & try to implement it . for example , edision , he discoverd the bulb after faced so many failure . but he never loose his hope and try to learn from his mistake and this approach make him a successfull person . moreover , a successfull person is determined what he ha to do & try it untill he get the success . he know his path is fill with lot of difficulty but he also know that after success , he get lot of admiration & praise , which is more valuable then the difficult he face during the work to achieve the success . for example , tanmaya , one our technical head , he started his career a a apprentice but today he bacome the head of technical team , just a span of 3 year . the only thing , which help him to achieve this success is his determination and ready to take any challenge . i realy admire him for his stun performance . according to me , he is a successfull person in his life . in sum , a person is successfull if he ready to do something new , take any challenge/risk , determine & skillfull . this above mention quality make a person to able to handle any situation adroitly in his life ( social life & professional life ) .
