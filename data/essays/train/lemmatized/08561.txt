it is true that the question whether young people give enough time to helping their community ha always been of great interest . although many people argue that community involvement is not sufficient , especially within the younger generation , i personally believe that there is much more activity than many people know . first of all it ha to be taken into account that many young people , after finishing high school , spend a couple of month or even a year working for the community . indeed , no matter whether it is military or social service , this time is sacrified for their country or for project abroad . second , unlike many people believe , statistic proove that community involvement ha even increased during the last year . for instance , already during high school many pupil spend their free time within club or association . these activity might be related to sport , within a religious community or even related to political work . but the growing engagement of young people is especially obvious on college . indeed , all university have different kind of student association and they are likely to have also one where student deal with social project . these may include fundraising for a third world country , helping child with their homework or organizing event for elder people . there is a large variety of what student do , but they all proove a high committment for other people an the community . but there is also another reason , that clearly indicates the growing importance of engagement which is not directly related to the acedemic or professional career . since a couple of year , it can be noticed , that company are looking for people to hire who have a proven track record of social engagement . indeed , social skill are getting more and more important , and young people are also aware of this . therefore , they try to proove their community involvement and thus improve their career opportunity . to conclude , given the example described above , there can be no doubt about a significant involvement of young people helping their community . on the other hand , there is still potential for more and people in general should always try to spend some time in helping others .
