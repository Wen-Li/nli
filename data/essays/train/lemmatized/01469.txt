i agree with the statement that successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do well . i think successful person is one who had done many risky think in his life time thats why we called him a an successful person , we dont achive great thing if we ar n't take risk . for example if we consider madum cury she wa on of the great woman scientest 's , she discovered radium element , it is one of the natural element which emmites radiation , at the time of reasearching she knew that radiation from the radium could cause a very seviour dammage to her body , even though she knew it she ha taken the risk , which led to the finding of radium , radium is use to generate electricity , and is also used to cure the some of cancer dea , at the time of her experiment is she doe want to take risk of her life now we probabuly may not know radium and there may not be cure of some of the cancer dea . another example is wright broters who were the invention of the aeroplane , they ar n't invented aeroplane but they have invented the blue print of aeroplane and they have showed proof that human can also fly like a bird , from their imagination and their inspiration let into the invention of aeroplane . if they think that it is risk in doing experiment in flying , it is different from the way we see the world now . with this invention it make u easy to travell place to place and thier risk factor changed our way off seeing the world so with these specific reason and example i think that there is no other way of getting success by try new thing and taking risk .
