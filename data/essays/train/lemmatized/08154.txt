some people think that yong people nowadays give enough time to helping their community . but , in my view , i think young people nowadys do not give time to helping their community , because of three reason a follows . first , i think young people nowadays have a tendancy to dislike thier community . perhaps the best example to illustlate this point is that when i , member of comunitie festival , wanted to have a meeting in the city center for preperation of festival , and call the member of my community , only seldom yong people assembeled . most person are elderly person which do n't enogh power to do the job . in other day , when i happened to meet one yong person in my community , i heard the reason why he did n't come the meeting . his answer wa so simple that i ca n't tell anyting - he dislike such a meeting because it is boring . what is more , i think yong people nowadays have a lot of thing to do , compared to the people 20 year ago . for instance , waching tv , playing video game and using a computer and so on . what is worse , to spend the time in doing these thing , yong people nawadays have little time to commucate with thier family . and a aconsequence , they also do n't have time to communicate with the person in their community . nor helping their community . third , comunity power itself come to weeken it power these day . long time ago , community play a important roll in keeping it sequrity . but , these day , i think comunity fanction itself is weeken thesedays with the progress of civilazation . therefore , i think young people nowadys do not give time to helping their community , because they have tendancy to dislike their community , they have a lot of thing to do , and community itself come to weeken it power .
