success can be seen a the result of one 's capacity to try new thing and take risk . on the other hand , people who avoid changing and stick to what they now best are not candidate for success . we will begin by pointing the advantage and disadvantage of these statement . changes can be a good thing . for exemple , someone can decide to quit a unsatisfactory job for another one , one that is closest to it goal in life . he can decide to become a painter instead of a accountant . but by doing so , the person can find other difficulty and realize that it is not much better . so change can not assure success . on the other hand , someone who stay at the same place all his life can miss opportunity that are giving to him . he can have regret later . but in all , success can not be based only on whether a person take risk or not . it must be based on something deeper . if success is being rich or famous , then of course one ha to risk a lot . but if success is defined a doing what is right , doing one 's duty , being honest and so on , then change are not so important . in other word , change become submitted to doing what is right . if it is right to remain an accountant in order to support a family and give others chance , then that is successful . if changing mean only to gain something for oneself without thinking of the others , then that is not success .
