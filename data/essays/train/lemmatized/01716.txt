i agree with the statement that say , most advertisement make product seemmuch better than they really are . for several reason this statement is true . for example , advertisement show only the good part of a product , and their only concern is to sell the product to the consumer no matter what suit him . advertisements only show how the product is great and wounderfull , and they even show it in a way that make it look different . let u take a child 's gum or a lolypop for instance , in advertisments you can see two or more child grabing one of those sweet , and when they try it , their appearance and the whole world change around them and all of it becomes like a sweet dream . now , what kind of messege would an advertisement give to a child ? the answer is clear when you just take a look at a child in sweet section in any super market . those child who will try the dreamy product will feel that they wear tricked , simply because they will remain in their same spot with a normal taest . advetisements do care only about gitting bought regardless of wheather they suit the buyer or not . let u take clothes for instance , in advertisement you can see people from different age wearing tha same styile and the same color and the same fit . now , what would such an advertiement make people think is alright ? the answer is also clear from what you can see in the street of poeple wearing thing that are not appropriate for thier age . in conclusion , i agree that most advertismen
