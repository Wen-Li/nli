i would agree with the statement that young people enjoy life more than old people do . i believe that younger people are usually le burdened with the hardship and stress of life , that come at a later stage . also , younger people have an attitude to not take thing too seriously and so , they tend to enjoy life in more situation . further , older people usually lose out the patience to enjoy and experience adventure and fun in life like the way youngster do . when we take the example of an old man , who becomes weak due to age , it very obvoius that he doe not have the stamen to enjoy any adventure in life . also , he would tend to become more subdued and mellow . in drast contrast , a youngster is usually filled up lot of energy and enthusiasm to take on new task , adventure , visit interesting place and so on . also , younger people tend to hang out a lot with friend and share lot of fun moment together . for example , if a young couple were to make a pleasure trip , and an old couple come along too , it is highly possible that their view and sense of fun would n't match . the older couple will usually prefer to stay indoors even while on tour , whereas the younger couple , i believe , will explore the place , in and out . i remember an incident when i had to go out on a tour alone , and i asked my grand mother to accompany me . she just did not want to go with me . she said she would get exhausted and doe n't take interest in travelling anymore . when i asked the same to a friend of mine , she immediately obliged ! this show the clear contrast between the view of an old person and a young one . i believe that we all usually get a matured and proper understanding of life only after facing some serious trouble . this kind of a view develops over time , and can not be seen among the youngster . youth therefore symbolizes more of energy , idealism , innocence , etc . adding to all the above mentioned reason , i feel that maybe biologically also , younger people have higher level of adrenalin , which expels higher level of energy . this can further explain why youngster tend to enjoy life more than their older counterpart do . however , i admit that the same youth will eventually turn out more matured and get more serious about thing , and fall in the categoty of old people .
