while some people say that there should be a tour gide during the trip , i do not agree with the idea that going on a trip with a gide is beeter than going alone . there are two reason of this : being responsible and more chance to communicate with local . going on a trip make me more responsible person in many respect . for example , i have to make a reservation by myself and handle difficulty that i face during the trip . if there is a tour gide while taking a trip , i wiil rely on him or her too much and i will not do anything neede for the trip such a reserving a hotel . as a result , i will tend to be le responsible person . in addition , if i got involved in trouble such a fighting , robbery , or getting lost , i would mamage the situation with my little skill of the langage . this experience will teach me how to overcome difficulty when i am alone , making myself resposible . by contrast , if you are with a tour gide , he or her will all take care of you whenever you ask help . furthermore , indivudual trip or trip with out a gide will offer me lot of opportunity to talk with local . for instance , i can make any schedule that i want and hang out with people with i get to know there . if i go to an ethinic restaurant to have dinner and make frinds with local , i will enjoy eintire trip with them communicationg each other . however , in a trip with a gide , you always have to be in a group of visitor . in other word , you have fewer chance to talk with local . in conclusion , i prefer going on a trip alone to going with a gide because individual trip will produce more chance to learn responsibility and communicate with local people .
