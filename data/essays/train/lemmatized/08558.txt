in the world of today a lot of company make an often exagerated use of advertisement , throught the mass-medias or pamphlet , to sponsorize their product , in order to bring the people over to buy them . i generally think that product we can find in advertisement are not actually much better than they really are , because the idea of the product that we have is too closed to the image of the product that the company want to spread among the people . from my point of view , actually the advertisemets give away an ideal image of the product that doe not reflect the reality and the true essence of it . there are a lot of example to support this my opinion . a common example can be found in the spot on television . there are lot of advertisement that suggest to buy a product , like gel for shaving , using a male character surrounded by very good-looking girl , about which the people think that the use of the product can change them is succesful individual like the man in the spot . other example are food product that seem much better in taste than other food brand because they are represented a healty product , while in the reality they are the same of the others about the nutritional aspect . i personally wa deceived by one of this advertisement : i thought to have bought a product , like a cream for the face , that seemed to be better than the others because in the advertisement wa announced to be very common , succesfull and one of a kind in his category between the people , but in the end it wa the same of the other product , by the fact that wa merely a cream with no special or particular ingredientes . so i agree with the fact that most advertisement make product appear better than they really are
