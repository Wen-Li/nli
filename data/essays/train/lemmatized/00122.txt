i agree with this statement , because the main point of a student perspective is to get the principal how thing work , so that the student is able to understand the idea behind the concept , and can explanation why . that will encourage them to continue developing on that matter . to understand the concept also play an particular role . if you want to analyse somethink you need a concept , a kind of roadmap to do it , if you want to create or develop innovative product you also have to follow a determined concept . from my point of view , this are the keyfactors in getting better and creating safety and better product and that is exactly what you future imployer require afterwards from you . in comparison with the thesis that it is more important to learn fact , if you learn fact , you can mention think related to a specific topic , but you are not able to explain them . in different case it can be helpfull to know fact , but the more impotant is to know how you can find the information , we have a very good posibility to do that about the greatest information source , the internet . so i come to the conclusion that the more important tool is to understand idea and concept , this can be a great help for further investigation and the first step to be innovative to create something new , if you need fact to that issue , you will be able to read it in a book
