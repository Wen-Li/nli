having broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one subject may lead to messing up of subject . i agree that having a knowledge on one particular subject stick your knowledge with that particular subject only . having knowledge in one particluar subject make you to concentrate more on that particular subject and it make you more interesting on other hand . for example if a student is intrested in doing mathematics and his academic deal with lot of subject . he should conecentrate more on other subject a he find them tough . whenever we are not interested in subject we find it 's difficult and more over the tough subject should be given more time to study . as the student is interested in mathematics he can make it easy but he may not develop more in that a he should concentrate more on other tough subject . if subject is more interesting to him then he can find out time to learn more information regarding that subject . he can get some new idea regarding his interested subject which may help out in some new discovery too . if at all he is having many subject at a time he may not find sufficient time to leran more about his interested subject . as the student is more interested in particular subject he can make use of time by learning more about his particluar subject . he enjoys gathering information on his particluar specified subject which is of his interest . that is the reason why the university offer them specialization coures in their academic . students can choose their own specilized subject and build their carrier . students are given chance to choose their choice of subject . they will not be messed up with are other subject . they can concentrate on one specilaized one and can improve their knowledge in that subject my learning more about the specified subject . thats the reason i agree to have specialization in academic .
