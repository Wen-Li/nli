about the statement , some people may agree that , but others may have negitive attitude . as far a i am concerned , i agree that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their communutues . afterward , i will develop my opinion in sufficient depth and detail . first of all , the transpotations are so convenient and developing today . people , inculding young , go to everywhere so easily , their appearences are not limited in the community . when young people step out the door of house , they can take bus , taxi , or subway , even drive car by themselves and go to the place they want to . they even never pay attention to the community they live in . how to talk about helping their community . moreover , the social security today becomes worse and worse . no one can warrant that it 's always safe in the community . it 's possible that the bad bad guy are our neighborhood . besides young people , all people may have no confidence about the community they live in . no one is willing to behavior friendly to the community with no confidence . last , there are too many attractive thing today for young people , like internet , pub , movie , vedio game , etc . so many funny staff can be done by young people . they are too busy having fun on those thing to care about the community they live in . in a word , i would state my opinion that young people nowdays do not give enough time to helping their community after thoes reason analyzing above .
