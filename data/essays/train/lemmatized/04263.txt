i strongly believe that the ability for student to grasp concept is of the utmost importance . my belief is based on three main reason , that are further developed below : first of all , learning concept and idea allow student to understand the core of a scientific explanation , of a general idea . while simple fact are more likely to change frequently over time , concept and idea tend to remain the same for ten , even hundred of year . even though some main idea can be contested , their understanding remains vital to the comprehension of current debate in a field of study . it also allows the student to better understand ( and remember ! ) subsequent fact . for instance , a biology student ha to be familiar with darwin 's theory of specie variation in order to understand the spectacular survival of a special type of bird . secondly , i feel that student , especially post-graduate student and-or research assistant , are often invited to juggle idea themselves , to come up with an opinion of a specific notion or idea . being familiar with a general frame of reference help them develop their own critic and make them free thinker ! i could also argue that there are plenty of way to learn fact ( for instance , watching a news bulletin , reading book and article , or doing a research on the web ) . however , it is a known fact that concept and idea can be more efficiently grasped in university ( or other academic institution , for that matter ) , where the structure is designed to help student develop and perfect their ` mental framework ' . in conclusion , i would repeat my belief that it is crucial that student be introduced to abstract concept a the main focus of their study . nonetheless , i feel that fact do have a place in an academic environment , in that this type of ` concrete ' knowledge can help student better apprehend the different conceptual idea .
