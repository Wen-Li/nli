in my opinion i can not really agree or disagree with the statement `` succesful people try new thing and take risk rather then only doing what they already know how to do well . '' for example , it is always necessary to do thing which i really know are good and how i have to do them . i can not open a design agency if i do not know how to work with colour , art , sign or type . that are necessary and elemantary topic for a designer . but if my agency work good , i could try some risk . for example , i could try to achieve new goal . this doe not work without some risk . when i first only coloured book and invented new corporate design for other firm , and now i want to offer a new part of design , the imagefilm , it includes a lot of risk . i have to ask me some thing : `` do i have enough money for the new equipment ? am i able to handle with the new topic ? '' or '' will i have people wanting pay me for my work ? '' this are all risk and the topic is a new thing for me . but i could really be succesfull , maybe i have a great talent in making film . and new idea are going to be searched . it could be , that i have not many limit in my mind about this topic and i could try mostly everything . this would be a new way for me and my agency . and if colouring book and making new corporate design are thing which worked good before , they are the basis for new thing and risk . and i can be sure that i have thing which are able to allow me the new risk . that is why , i think you need both to be succesfull , first you should have knowledge which you already know to handle and then you can try new thing amd take risk . this would be a very good combination for beeing a succesfull people .
