i agree with this statement because the most advertisment even do n't show the product alone and discus only this . advertisments are just made to attract people and to turn them into a possible customer . they are made powerfull , colourfull and sexy . they show the product but often they do n't even discus the prediction of it . in the past i had such an experience . i wa blinded by the advertisment and bought the shoe . but after around two week they were broken . these shoe were not so stable and even not such comfortable like it wa said . i just used them for walking and running . but they already were walking shoe and well i did n't run through a nightmare . so these shoe were obivisius not that what they had to be . i wa truely blinded by advertisment . but now i know how to handle it . you have to be carefull with everything you want to buy . you have to compare the price and even you must have a look on the product . you do n't need a eye of an eagle . i just mean that you should look at the product before you buy it . you shall look if it is ok . well i have to addmit that i like advertisment because without it , it would be really boring . but it is not fair if the product ca n't reflect what the advertisment is saying . i think if you are the producer of an adverisment and you know that this product will be shown much better than it is in this advertisment then this production is made for a judge . you ca n't sell something and know it is not that what you will present . this acting is similar to cheating and you have pay for it .
