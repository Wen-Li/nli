if young people enjoy life more than the old people do ? there may be many defferent answer according to defferrent people 's indentity exprences . in my opinion , i do n't think that young poeple enjoy their life more than old one , because of several reason following : first of all , young people have le time to enjoy their life compraring to the old people . people spend their early life on studing , working and many other thing that can promise a goog future . old people in the other hand , almost retire from the busness that calling hard-woks , so they have a plenty of time to enjoy the live . secondly , young poeple , sometimes , dont't really undterstand what is the best of live , so they always spend their time on something they do n't really like . when they think they are enjoying the live , actually , they dont't really feel happiness . for example , many young people believe that big city can make their dream becaming true . they going to there to look for good job . but always they ca n't get the job they want , because there are so many young poeple there and the competing is very sharply . but the old men who have a lot of live exprences may be more clare whith what they want really and spend their time to get it , to enjoy it . finnally , old people have le pressure than yuong people . their yuong child have grown up , their career ha completed , their life push ha slowdown , so they have a release haert to enjoy the life . yuong poeple , on the contrast , have varis of pressure , such a childen , career and even the old parent . they have many tast to do . they do n't releasing heart to enjoy the life . in a short word , the old people may enjoy their live more than yuong people do . it is fair , because they have spend for their enjoyment during their erlier life .
