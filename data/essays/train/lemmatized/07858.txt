personaly , i prefer to learn broad knowledge , and i believe that broad knoledge would be helpful for a person anytime . therefore , i agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specipic subject . of course , i guess other might explain equaly valid for learning one specific subject only . in fact , i am planning to enter the phd course in a guraduated university . for phd study , we need specific knowledge and it is better to know specific research area deeply than to know wide area thinly . however , even if i consider the above goodness , i believe that it is better for all people to have broad knowledge of many academic subject . why i believe this is follow : first , i think all most all people do not deep knowledge so much . on the contrast , broad knowledge is neccessaly when a person face some trouble which are unfimilire to solve it . whenever we live , we can not do well if we do not our various knowledge . that mean we are child . a child can not live alone if their parent do not help her or him . second , i believe that it is essential for researcher also to have wide knowledge . for example , when i could not write a research paper well and stoped my idea , i will read book or watch tv . sometimes i can get useful idea from medium . in addition , if i have broad knowledge , i would be able to discus the problem on research by various aspect . that 's why i prefer to learn wide academic subject . considering the above all reason , i agree with the opinion that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specipic subject .
