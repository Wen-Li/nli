most of the people are happy with the knowledge they have or say they are unconcerned about new topic , while some other type of people , have an appetite to do new thing that is try out new thing . my type of category is the second one , so i would go with and agree to the statement - `` succesfull people try new thing and take risk rather than doing what they already know how to do well. '' for their insatiable curiosity , always active and open , risk involved . unquenchable curiosity is the driving force behind all the successfull people . it is this force which keep them engaged in their work . as for example , let u consider an scientist . he is a person always wanting to know how thing work , what will happen next , what would be the response if i do it that way - are some of the question arousing in mind of these men . thomas alva edison is one of the most succesfull scientist & a men with these virtue . he experimented with around 1200 idea , and finally invented the electric bulb . it wa this appetite for inventing , rather say doing thing differently from rest of the mass made him a successfull person . always active and open to idea is an another attribute of the wise . they clasp or hug new idea with open arm . isaac newton can be a considered to be a part of this specie . everyone saw apple falling but only newton wa the one to cast doubt by thinking `` why that apple fell . '' by taking calculated risk they take their bussiness , principle to peak or pas off a an forlorn entity . a whole lot of people get success by trying out new thing differently and innovating an already active idea . some of the ingredient of these kind of people is their curiosity towards their work , their open mind and the ability to take risk . to be successful in life , a person ha to be : keen towards his work , open to different view by different people and the ability to take some good risk . .. atleast once .
