well , depends the city were you are going to live ! i agree with the point of view in general . maybe in 20 year the change in the diary life will change , and reduce the amount of car . i mean , the people in 20 year , will work at home , because they can work from their home , for this , they need le car than now . another reason , the pollution . the enviroment suffer nowadays real and strong problem . the car , and the industry related , increase the problem day by day . is posible that in 20 year , will not possible have a lot of car . the goverments limit the cuantity of car that the poblation can use . another reason would be the improving in public transport . if the people have a guareente about this service , more and more the people use them , and will be le car in the street . the ecological movement , many people , back to the natural , and encaurage the use of bicicles , walk . they promote health habit , introducing another way for moving in the city , for example . and at the same time , reduce the pollution . when i mencioned the city where you will live in 20 year , depend the direction wich the goverment will take . not all rule , or direction , work thinking in the future . this , some rule work in the opossite , avoinding that the people feel secure riding in bicicle , because the traffic is dangerous . the ndustry for car invest a lot of money in advertisments , creating the idea that you need a car . relatinating success with a big car for example . in summ . i considered that we do not need a lot of car , and in 20 year , is totaly posible will be few car than now . only we need good goverments , with different concious , invest in alternative meassures for the people . combinating working at home , invest in the enviroment , a good enviroment , of course . ecological concious , etc .
