the question face an actual problem in the modern society : the role of the young people in building the future society , through helping their community - by mean of a social , cultural and political help - and the capability of such young people to build themselves a individual and part of the society they live in . in order to explain my point of view i need of course to not take into account those society in which young people grow in war zone and are not able - because they probably never got any chance - to really know a peaceful existence . said that , and in particular now talking about the society where i live , i agree with the statement expressed in the question . a lot of survey , published in the most popular newspaper , show that young individual just take care of their personal growth without considering how much they are touched by what happens around them . these survey also demostrate how much young men and woman are not aware of the improvement they could afford if they were able to really put themselves in an effective relation with their community . as to the reason that can get young people to have such behaviour , i guess the most important is the will of personal success related to a deep indifference . as a concept , indifference take people - young or not - to not care the world 's changing and in continous evolution . trying to find out the root of this feature would seem to be a task , or a hard challenge a well , of the modern sociological science . than , in my opinion , the willing of personal success is the reason that explains such non-accuracy . young people fully involved in study , career , will of easily earn money , seem to forget the place they come from .
