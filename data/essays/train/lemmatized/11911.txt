this question is making me to think . young people are giving enough time to helping their community . i belive they dont . i can explained my view with many point . some of them are a below . young people in today world are busy in themselves . they start working at early age . most of them study and work a a part time . they are mainly focused on study and work . they don t have time to thing about their community . they dont consider it is important for them to help their community . they don t care about others . they are clueless about their life and their duty towards their community . for e g if you ask any young person what he want to do to the community . he will replay that they don t have time for that . basically they are busy with something which is not valuable . they are busy with their own interest . some of them enjoy going out , traveling every week end , goining out to party and spend their weekend doing nothing but enjoyment . then they want toclaim that they don t have time . it is very difficult task to make them understant that they owe some responsibility towards the community they belong to . having not enough time is not the real reason for that . basically they don t have helping attitude in them . we should help them to realize that they can get time if they want . if there is will they can . according to my opinion it s parent duty to make them understand their duty towards their community . they should take out somr tiome from their schedule and use that time to help their community . it is their duty and they should do it without any reason . they are living here .
