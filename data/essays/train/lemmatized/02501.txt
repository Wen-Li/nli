although some people think that to learn fact is more importantfor student to understand idea i agree with the statement it is more important for student to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact because firstly if they understand the idea then they produce new idea and fact secondly they can learn the fact much easier and faster . firstly ; the student should understand the idea and concept . then they should do brain storming and work on these idea and concept . after this step they can develop the idea that they have learned and then they can produce fact on their own or they can produce new idea , claim . maybe they can prove their claim and then so they produce theorem which will be helpful for new generation . then the new generation can develop the idea that they learned and find new thing . this continues like this . then there will be development in the field where the new idea generated . secondly ; i believe that if they read the fact from a book or learn the fact from somewhere else they will learn the fact much faster and easier because according to an experiment done by baskent university it is proven that the student who have understood the idea and concept clearly can learn the fact faster and easier than the studets who do not understand the idea and fact . in conclusion ; it is very clear to see that understanding idea and concept is more important for student than learning fact by reading the two support written on this passage .
