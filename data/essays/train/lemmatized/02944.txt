i will be honest , i never thought about such a topic if there will be fewer car in use in some year . i can not totally agree with this statement because therefore the other possibility are too bad that so many people will not use their car anymore . more or le , the only thing here in germany is the `` deutsche bahn '' and a lot of people are not so happy with this company because you never can be sure if your train arrives or not . in comparison to this , there are a few company where you can come to work when you like to come and not everyone is able to change the house for the job . as well , i can not totally disagree with this statement because there are step which will offer you better possibility to get from point a to point b but this have to be cheap in addition , the new trend from people is to live for the nature and future . furthermore , it stop the pollution if there are le car in use and you do not have to spent so much money in oil , gas and security . not everybody will be able to pay for a car in a few year . because of never thinking about this topic , i wa a little bit confused but i think there will be le car in a few year . if f.i. the deutsche bahn get it und will be more punctual and have special offer that mean that it is cheaper than having a car , then it is possible that there will be fewer car in use in twenty year . in germany there are more and more offer to get to another place f.i. there is a page in the internet where you put in the date , time and place when you want to go anywhere and there are people who catch you and take you with them to your place for not paying a lot of money .
