i agree this statement . young people doe think about their problem . because their parent always solved their problem . also , they did not afraid anything . they don ; t think about result . they enjoy it and tha 's all . that wa kind of unresposible , but they really do n't know about everything . people said when they were young they have a passion . so try everthing what they can . so they tried and sometimes faill but some time succeed . imporant thing of this thought is they always tried enjoy their life better than oldert people . so usually young people enjoy their life more than older do . people getting older and they needed to responsable to their life . so , even though they wanted to try , but they ca n't . because they already know that will be dangerous and affect other people . so , they can not enjoy their life . also , they are too busy . they needed to do plenty of thing . they think about work , relationship and housework . etc . so they could not enjoy their life to do something . young people have mor time than older people and they care about only few thing . they can do everthing what they want only reason they are young they are not afraid about anything . if you ask to people about their best life , most of people answered when they were young . and they wanted to go back that time . they said that time they really enjoy their life and did what every they want . so , this answer showed young people enjoy thier life more than older do . i think i agree this opinion because i am young . but , usually young people enjoy it and happy about their life more than older people .
