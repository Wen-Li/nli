i think that what is stated in this question is correct . it is true that people who decide to specialize on a specific topic could perform in a particular field , allowing him to reach important goal in it professional life . on the other side a person who do not ha a wide knowledge on different subject , could face some problem in his daily life . a knowledge of different argument could help someone to face a speach on multiple subject showing it huge backgroung . i think that university shoud avoid to focus their couses on a limited number of subject and allow student to choose among different couses . when i choose my univeristy cours i had the possibility choose a personal exam 's plan . in that occasion i avoid to focalise my study plan on related subject . even if it should be easier to study two similar exam , ( for example international marketing and international business ) i preferred to base my plan on different subject in order to let me the possibility to analise the different subject and tho choose , in a second time , the argument on which i prefers to focus . thanks to this method i 've been able to improve my knowledge on certains subject that i ignored before . this helped me in my post university environement letting me to chose a professional carrer not strcly related to the one i intendet to take at the beginning of my university cours . for these resons i think that a specialized knowledje could be interesting for someone who ha strong passion on specific subject , but it should be always supported with a wider knowledge in differents topic .
