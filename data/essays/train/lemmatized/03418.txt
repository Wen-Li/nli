to tell the truth , i do not think that concept are more important than fact . to my mind , both of them are significant and essential in a student 's training . first at all , i am convinced that understanding concept and idea are really important for a student . indeed , learning fact can become very useless and it is impossible to understand those fact without understanding their origin . theory is essential in a student 's training and a student can not devote his time on fact he can not understand . however , if a student only learn concept , he rapidly ha trouble likening experience and theory . consequently , i think it is very important to learn fact for many reason . first , when a student learn fact , he can on the one hand , learn a situation , and on the other hand the mistake made during this situation . furthermore , general knowledge is essential . first , in order to have his own opinion concerning a topic , and then , to liken those fact to an experience . for example , i am major in material . i have learnt a lot of fact concerning different microstructures , and when i carry out an experience , i can observe a microstructure i can easily liken to what i have learnt before . as a consequence , i think that in order to understand the theory , it is essential to learn fact . concepts are essential in a student 's training but a student can not make the most of those concept if he can not liken them to an experience . furthermore , general knowledge is essential to have his own opinion about a topic . to conclude , concept and fact are not contrary notion . a student will be well educated insofar a his education draw a parallel between an understanding of idea and concept , and the fact which arise from those concept .
