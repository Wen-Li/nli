in addressing whether younger people enjoy life more than older people , i can not state for certain . however , i think that enjoying life is not heavily dependent upon age , but rather on the different situation of each person . admittedly , young people seem to enjoy life more than older people on the outside . this is because younger people are more vibrant , adventurous , and have more energy . they have le responsibility than older people , giving them more freedom to explore and have fun . but i can not rule out the burden that i have experienced growing up . for example , the pressure of entering university , then graduating , and then acquiring a job . it seemed that overcoming a hill led to an even bigger mountain . however , i can not ignore the fact that a people grow older , they have achieved many thing along the way . for example , a stable job , leisure time to do hobby , birth and nuture of child are just some of the thing that can lead to an enjoyable and fulfilling life . in addition , the period after retirement seems so liberating and enjoyable . but on the other hand , older people have more responsibility , meaning le time to yourself to enjoy life . it seems that who enjoys life more , the younger or older , doe not depend on age , but rather on how the individual grows up and becomes older . some people may think that their childhood wa a disaster , without many good memory , while being at there happiest at an older age . on the other hand , some people may miss their childhood and wish that they could go back to the innocent day when they were free to do whatever they wanted . in conclusion , i do not fully agree with this statement , a questioning happiness based on age doe not produce a reliable answer . rather happiness , whenever experienced depends on the individual life
