in my opinion , both can be positive . the situation determines if continuing doing thing you know is the better way or if trying new way leeds to more success . if you for example run a business like a bar , which ha a lot of confident customer who are absolutely satisfied with the atmosphere , the furniture , the menu and the service , you would not really thing about changing anything . changing this already well working bar would always mean you risk losing costumer who may dislike the change , and it will also cost you a lot of money . but if you run a bar where customer keep complaining about thing , you may very well consider changing something and become more successful doing so . on the other hand , i think that even when you run a business which already seems to be perfect , it is never a bad thing to dare something new , because the world is changing so why should you refuse changing ? as a bar owner , i would rather prefer to lose some boring , old customer to serve open-minded new customer instaed , just because it is more exciting . it is clear that deciding something new is always risky , but that is what an exciting life is a about . in addition to that trying new thing mean that you make a lot of new experience . being experienced will never be a bad thing when it come to being successful . you probably have dealt with a lot of problem in your life if you have had a lot of different experience , so you know better how to handle them then somebodzy unexperienced would . this is why i would prefer trying new thing in order to gain a lot of experience .
