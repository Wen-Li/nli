i agree this statement . there are three reason for this . first of all , the conversation in familly is declising . most of young people do not talk their happenning in a day , and they also do not ask their family , especially their parent , about their job or happennings . this cause the problem that they can not commmunicate each other , so young people are likely not to be interested in the nearest comunity . secondly , ` mura shakai ' disappead today in japan . ' mura shakai ' is local town in japan . we had many relationship in our town and we everytime helped beween neighborhood . however , young people do not even greet to neighbor in the morning . some young people may not know who is living in the next door . finally , but this is the most impotant , the comunicating skill of young people is going to bad . every young people tends to e-mail and mobile phone in communication so they have le oppotunities to talk with face to face than before . our foundation of communication is talking , but we ca n't .
