in my opinion , what expressed in the statement is not completelly true . i think that the fact that for a student , idea or concept are more important than to learn fact , depends on the different attitude the student ha . in my opinion by the way , it 's really more important to understand idea and concept behind a fact . the best example i can use to add value to my assumption , is my own experience during the university study . i 've studied engeneering and for most of the exam i did , to understand concept wa the most important aspect of the studying . without that it would have been very difficult to pas the exam . because you need that to approach to a brand new problem , that you have not seen before . i can study the fact that a construction can collapse if some project aspect are not respected and i can learn this fact . but if i do n't understand the concept or idea behind structure 's phisics i could hardly been able to project it properly . on the other hand it is obvious that for someone else result are more imoportant than the cause that ha produced them , and therefor for those student , fact should definitely be more important than the idea behind them . i 'm reffering for example to those student interested to history subject . those student are mainly interested in fact that are the basis of their study field . but even for them i think schould be important to know and to understand what wa behind a specific period or event . to better rember what happened due to a logical cause-effect process .
