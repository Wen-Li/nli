yes , i agree that young people do not give enough time to help their community because they are more involved in their accademic schedule and they have got no time to serve the community due to their involvment in their job and other freak out . now a day the accademic schedule is so fixed that the young people are not getting time to spend with the society and are busy with their lesson , project , etc . as the proverb say `` untill we care one none care u '' . the part time job play an important role to earn money . they are the major source of money today . so young people spend their extra time in part time job than helping the community , thinking of the money not about the society . not remembering that `` service to the society is service to the nation '' . even the self enjoyment and freakouts got major importance in over comming once stress . so young people prefer it rather than serving the community . becauswe entertainment is getting prevailed in this modern world . i finally conclude that younge people nowadays do not give enought time to help their community .
