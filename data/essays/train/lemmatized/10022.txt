nowadays , quite a few student pay attention to understand idea and concept in the subject . other student , however focus on the fact . as far a i am concerned , i believed that it is more important and necessary for student to understand and master idea and concept that they learned . among those countless factor , there are three conspicuous aspect a follows . the main reason that student should understand idea and concept is that idea and concept are the basic for the subject . only do student master the idea and concept , they could completely understand the fact . for a example , when we understand the newton law , we could explain many fact that occur around u . we know why the water would drop down and apple would fall to the ground when they are in ripe . another reason can be seen that student could learn and study deeply after they get to know the idea and concept . students might learn more knowledge by themselves concerning to the subject . because they grasp essential idea and concept . it is important for student that they could learn more knowledge and explain the reason that might difficult to understand from the surface . furthermore , some fact are temporary and not forever . without understand the idea and concept , it is really difficult to know the truth . such a acid rain , which is partially caused by increasing industry . since we know the truth of the acid rain , people could try to control and eliminate the waste gas given from the manufactory . in conclusion , although some fact are easy to learn , it is not solution to learn the knowledge . when student understand the idea and concept , they not only could master the truth of the knowledge , but also help them to gain more ability to learn deeply . in addition , after student understand the idea and concept , they might know how to take action to resolve the problem .
