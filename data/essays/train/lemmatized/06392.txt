in twenty year there will be more car in use than there are today . that wa in my openian . i have some reasens for that . the first reason , before more than twenty year ago there are car and dont find other to transfer our from one place to other in the same city . so the car become mare and more from the bast . in fact , there are other equpmet to transfer our from one plase to other in other city , for example there are train , plane and subway , that wa faster from car but still the car are the importnat . in other hand to supose my openion the goverment make more fasilities for the rode and more safety , for exampel , i prefer the travel by car because it is com fortable for me , i can find the resturants in the rode and rest area . so i stop to take relax in the time that i feel tired , but when i travel on the plane or tain i can not stop to take relax . there are othor reason , when i travel by car i see the diferent viwes and i learn my child about it , and we can viset more city on the rode before i reach the place that i want . in sumary the car are the most spesilaties for the family , we can not fewer car untile find the other have all advantage .
