although many people say that we will not use car anymore in the future , yet car are necessasy tool even in the future . namely . car will still prevail . for this purpose , i do n't agree that there will be fewer car in twenty year . here come discussion . in the first place , cars are great invention . there are a variety of them and they help u a lot ; for example , transportation - both human and cargo . besides , they save time . we benefit from car very much . undeniably , convenient a car contribute , we can not ignore the negaitve impact they make ; say , the exhaust and energy crsis . however , scientist are now trying to figure out some alternative solution such a biodiesel . using biological source , car will not cause environmental problem . since new tecnology ha been develpoping in a breathtaking speed , i am optimistic about the futhure . in my opinion , car will exsit , maybe changing into another form , but they will always exsit . after all , we ca n't live in a world with car . they are too important to be thrown away . there will be more and more car in the following decade . advantages can turn out to be malign while misfortune to be a blessing . in brief , however , we should not abandon car , not only because they symboize the milestone of human history but also because they are practical , even in the future .
