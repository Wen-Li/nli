i agree with the statement that `` young people do not give enough time to helping their community '' . because in this modern world there are many thing to concern with to them and the young people donot find time to helping their community . the young people are most enthusiastic when they are doing some thing . easpecially when they are spending their time for a variety of aspect , they may include studying , playing , watching the new vesions of film , listening music and to be say honestly they much inclined to enjoy themselves . most of the young people are student . they do not find much time to think about community , their life go through their study . most of the young people are ignoring the community due to their competion among themselves . at this era of their life they put more concentration for developing their future . they donot spend their time for thinking about community , also it is not possible for them to help the community at that time . because every student is ruled by his or her parants . one may think that he or she can serve the people when they stand successfully in the socity . this may be the best time for any young person to think and serve there community . there are many young people who are mainly facing the problem of poverty , thay even can not efford for their education , in such a way they are in capable of helping society . according to my opinion finally i can conclude that the age of the young people is the mainly and only cause that put them to ignore their community .
