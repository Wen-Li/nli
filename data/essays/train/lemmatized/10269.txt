according to my opinion it is better to have a broad knowledge of many acadamic subject rather than to specialize in a specific subject . i will express my opinion by taking an example of an engineer who is opting for electronics a his major . in his four year of study he will be explained basic about all the subject like math , physic , chemistry , c and data structure and some other computer subject and later on going to the higher class he will be explained about the complete depth of the electronics . many people who are opting electronics a major , settled in software company like sathyam , wipro just because of thier knowledge in computer . even though they opted electronics a thier major . today world is becoming very competetive in every aspect so in order to cop up with a world like this a man should have a broad knowledge on any subject . suppose in a company a problem occured in the computer that all account list are blocked which are very important to company that day to plan the rest of the day how the product are to be produced then we need a computer professional for it who is on leave that day . so the electronics employee who is working in that company , having basic knowledge about a computer can rectify the problem easily . so by this the company go on it work without any interuption . so it better to have sound knowledge on what ever we studied in our academic year by simply not neglecting the other subject thinking that it is not our subject we can leave it because our major subject is other one . by the sound knowledge on any subject we can be advantageous in any field and also where ever we go .
