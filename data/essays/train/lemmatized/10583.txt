society ha always been divided in two group , one that of more experienced , but sedate older generation and the other that of a more enthusiastic and ripe newer generation . i do not agree with the opinion that the present generation doe n't give sufficient time to help their community . infact , the youth of today provides a very balanced and fundamental support to it society . young people have always been the main source of the enthusiasm and interest for the activity carried out by their community . infact they are the one who take initiative and drive others out of their home . for instance , the no war propoganda , to protest against the war by us on iraq and afghanistan were not only dominated but initiated by group of college and high school student . they were the one who took the responsibility to unite the society to stand and voice it opinion . young people have more time , space and entusiasm to participate in social program . unlike adult who are too engrossed in their mediocre family problem and commitment , younger generation provides a more committed interest and a promise to fulfill it task . hence , it always the younger generation that end up in helping out the society . for instance most of the latest discovery and invention are made by the young assosciated of scientist and professor . though it been under the supervision of the scientist it those young shoulder on whose basis the scientist can claim the accolode . they devote them self to the benefit of human race . young people have always been the major recruiter in the army . its the younger people who do understand their resposibility and do join armed force to the service of their community . young people provide the innovation needed to do thing in a newer and more effective way . they do provide oppourtunities to others to share , help and protect each other . to illustrate the point , several young boy and girl do participate in welfare , charity , marathon , procession , seminar , public debate , etc. to help society . they provide a feeling of brotherhood , a feeling of togetherness , a sense of unity lacking in a group of adult . in short , it the younger generation of today thats been more responsible and more approaching to a community a compared to it older assosciates .
