enjoyment can be defined by the way how you spend your time . it mainly depends on wat you like do , how you like to do it and where you will like to do it . i agree with the statement that `` younger people enjoy life more than elder people '' because younger people have many thing to do in their life ahead . doing thing for the first time give a person great pleasure and happiness which younger people will have the power , the strength that is required , the courage and the enthusiasm to and puch themselves to the limit do or experience various thing that they want to do in their life , where a older people can not accomplish all the thing they need in the life because they ca n't push themselves hard enought because of the lack of strenght and patience which is needed to do reach the goal they want . younger generation have lot of thing can do in life such a they can play various sport like baseball , football , rugby , cricket which elder people can not play and they will have to jus sit back and watch the game or just watch people doing it . older people can not strain themselves much beacuse of which they can not travel around the world to see it beauty or experience the nature where a younger people can travel to anyplace they want and experiencs all the beauty and the place he have never ever seen before . younger people have the gut to do various thing in life , where mountain climbing is one of the example where older people ca n't do it a they dont have the dare to risk their life , but younger generation find it more intresting and enjoy doing such thing . elder people have to stay indoors most of the time and because of this they dont get to njoy the nature becasue of the changing weather condition but young generation dont get much effected by these condition and enjoy the life to the fullest . as a young person i feel `` young people can enjoy more than elder people '' .
