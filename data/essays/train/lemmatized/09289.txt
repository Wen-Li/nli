i agree with this statement , but only referring a little part of advertising , in fact i think a large part of the advertises tell the truth about the good characteristic of a product . for example i can talk about the tooth paste that is presented more and more contolled by test to grant security , or i can think about any other product that reguard our sanity and need to be tested clinically and that advertisement demonstrate : i use a very great quantity of cream that i buy only with the granted name of a famous beauty factory , and this security in my shopping is given by advertisement that state their good propriety , year by year . but other advertisement seems to offer a very good product that is n't so good : i think about our tv advertises , that try to capture people with all kind of word , for example by saying that product is used only by the best people , or it'is saled only for best shop , or by a very famous testimonial like the most favourite character of cinema to capture different type of target ( from teenager to older people ) . i do n't mean all this advertisement do n't tell a true characteristic of a product , but surely it try to show the product a the best product in nowadays businness . in fact our businnes is full of product that are all the same , but are continuosly changed adding some more ingredient to make people think it 's a more suitable product , more comfortable , more capable to solve problem than the previous ( which is producted by the same factory ) . it 's a continuous increase of production to make businness move , and this is possible only with concurrential product , even if this mean to show a new product that doe n't differs by the previous one but that is shown to be bettert than it .
