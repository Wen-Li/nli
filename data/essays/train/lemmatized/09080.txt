i think people usually buy product because of attractive advertisement . but most product are worse than sample on the advertisement . therefore , i agree with the topic -- most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are . first of all , salers always tell customer how great the product are . they can make a magic story to show how product work . for example , one time i went to a cusmetic store , and the clerk told me their product wa good , it could make my skin better . after i used it for a week , i did n't think so . it wa not useful , and it wa very expensive . i wa really angry about that . second , advertisement company know how to design the product and advertisement to attract people . in addition , they know how to persude the customer and make many program , such a buy one get one , or coupon . for instance , those program usually attract woman and teenager . but they always regret after they bought those product . third , advertisement company usually make a survey to understand what kind of product will be popular . and they try to make a perfect product in a reasonable price on the advertisement . when customer see the advertisement , or hear from their friend or co-worker , they will rush to buy without thinking . in my opinion , i usually think twice before i buy something . it is necessary to consider about that . as i have many experience , i do n't want to waste money on those unuseful thing anymore . now , if i really want to buy something , i always ask my friend or look up information on the internet . salers just want to earn money , they can tell you all advantage of their product , and after you bought it , you will find out how terrible it is . therefore , i support the idea -- most product seem better on the advertisement than they really are .
