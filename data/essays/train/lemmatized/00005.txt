in my opinion the best way to travel is in a group led by a tour guide . the other option would be to go alone or in a small group of two to three people without a tour guide . the advantage of travelling in a group led by a tour guide are : 1. the vacation time will be utilized efficiently . 2. we can concentrate on sightseeing and enjoy more . 3. it is safer 4. we may get discounted ticket for tourist attraction . let me elaborate on these point . since , the tour guide is well familiar with the tourist destination , he can make a detailed schedule of our day to day activity . also , he will manage our time in such a way that we are able to visit all the important point of attraction . and because he will be involved in planning and driving we can spend more time relaxing and enjoying . this is specially important for couple , a they will get more quality time to spend with each other . on the contrary , if you travel alone or in a small group without a travel guide , you are responsible for managing all aspect of the trip . this may lead to inefficient planning and waste of time . it is also safe to travel in a group and with a person who is aware of good and bad neighborhood . one of my friend once went to a foreign country for vacation . he did not arrange for a tour guide . unfortunately , he wa mugged the very first day of his trip and wa stabbed in the stomach too . thus , ruining his vacation plan completely . additionally , most of the tour guide have contact with local merchant and attraction management . hence he may be able to arrange for discounted food and entertainment ticket . who doe n't like to save some extra money ? finally , i would like to repeat that i strongly suggest travelling in a group led by a tour guide .
