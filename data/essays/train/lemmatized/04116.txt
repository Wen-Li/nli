i think it is more important for u student to learn fact than to understand the idea . for my personal experience , i learned more when i learned the fact first . i had been raised in taiwan . when i wa a student in elementary school , middle school , and high school in my country , teacher taught u or asked u to memorize two time one equal two , two time two equal four , two time three equal six , and so on . at that time , no one told me why , i had been wondered why two time one equal two , but i had no choice and be forced to memorize them . as time went by , i have been taken many math class , such a algerbla 1 , algerbla 2 , calculous , so and so . i realized why two time one equal two which bothered me when i wa a 8 year old kid . i first memorize the `` fact '' , and understand the `` idea '' itself . although now you may think there 's a time consume , and start wondering how long doe it take me to realize the reason why two time one equal two . honestly , it did n't take me too much time to understand the concept , and the most important thing is i got the idea by myself which is more valuable . i feel more confident and start been an indepent thinker . moreover , i wo n't forget about it because people always learn by the experience .
