i agree that there will be fewer car in use that there are today . since the oil is running out , the car , in the future , would be le valued and sought than in the past and present , also there are increasing demand for private helicopter or airplane by which people can save the time of waiting for the traffic congestion . furthermore , the public transportation would be incredibly convenient and easily accessible to the extent that people only prefer to use the whole of them . first of all , in le than twenty year , the oil would run out and the oil-required car would be completely replaced by the electric car . however , the electric car have ton of problem associated with their speed , efficiency of the electricity , and so on . considering this fact , i think that many people would prefer to find other way of accessing to the place they want . second , more public focus and interest are being given to the private helicopter or airplane . somewhat wealthy people might already posse one or even two . there are several reason why people prefer to own private helicopter or mini airplane . in recent society , the most prevalent is the vehicle on the road and the most rampant one is also the vehicle on the road , which cause lot of traffic congestion and sometimes even the high way are jammed . there is no single family that doe not own their private vehicle . also , the traffic accident are incredibly increasing and many people are deceasing without any guilt . some or many people are toxicated or drunken during their drive . no matter how bad condition the person hit by their car is lying on , or no matter how softly the car were crashed with each other , the up-coming consequence are strikingly huge that they even can drop the person down the hell , or topple the person with his all authority and property . third , the public transportation are remarkably advancing a the public interest on them are focused more and more . many people prefer the public transportation to their private vehicle , because they do not have to be late in their working site due to the harsh traffic congestion . the well-designed schedule , which doe not change from time to time but stay the constant , guarantee them of the time of arrival to their working place . to sum up , i think there would fewer car in use in twenty year because of the reason i mentioned above . in my personal case , since i tend to be late at my school and i 'm not the typical student who are very organized and scheduled in time , i prefer to get my private helicopter in the future .
