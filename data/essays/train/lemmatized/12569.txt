in china , my home country , when we talk about enjoy in the past , we think of getting rid of poverty and war . but in this more and more competitive society , even the new challeging and new experience of this world are no longer appearling a some old people may think , when compared to the high pressure we young adult received . all the pressure : competition with classmate , competition with colleague , and high pressure of taking care of a new family . competition in schools-from elementary school all the way to graduate level , now is heavy like no other period . everyone around seems like genius . and even worse , the parent realise it . the kid a aerly a only 3 or 4 year old , many are forced to go to take course on piano , math or professional athelet . they live in the competition and do n't have the chance to play with the other kid , or to spend a whole weekend afternoon in the playground . it actually ha caused a lot of psychological problem of those kid . for a deploma from a prestige college , many kid ca n't stand the high standard from the teacher and parent and commit suicide . in my opinion , it wo n't be a life enjoyble for these student . the recent time that i know the deadly competition for empolyment , is when talking to a 82 year old granny i met in a local park . she told me she wa very satisfied with her life now . but the only thing she keep concering of is the work of her child . one of them have a undergraduate degree , but can not get a work with $ 60 usd a month . the insurance is problem , the house rent is a problem , even the food becomes a main concern . this probelm is facing many young adult , especially those who just go into the professional area . teenage mom is no longer news , and it thoroughly reflect a social problem when solving the family issue of young adult . most high school dropout , if it 's not for the study problem , it 's the teenage mom . they give birth to a new life , but also sacrifice their life to receive better education and better occupation . another feature odf modern society , is the age of newly marriage couple are getting older and older . everybody seems lost in the work , and rarely have time or energy to face the marriage and commitment . many guy in their 30 , do n't know anything about woman , is no longer somthing rare , too . when facing these big issue in life , young adult seem have very fragile feeling , and most of them are not happy with them . as a result , young people are a social group experiencing high pressure from all aspect . their life are not enjoyble .
