in the next few year the technology will develop more than today . so i agree with this point of view that in twenty year therr will be fewer car in use than there are today , because in future because of development of science and technology the train will develop more than present day . and it is to travel by train than by car . because train are much more faster than car and it will develop more . we can take the example of metro train of present day . these are much more faster than the old time train . we can reach in few minute to same place on which it will take many ours by reaching with car . also in car there is a pressure of driving . if our family is going on a place then one ha to drive . if we are going on night then also some one ha to drive which is very dangerous . also the person who is driving can not enjoy like other people . in train there is no pressure of driving and all of the family member can enjoy equally , because of the development it will become easier to afford the plain also . so everyone prefer plain rather than car . a we all know that it take only few minute . also in car there is a very conjusted space which make it uncomfortable . it is very difficult to travel long distance in car . it is very expensive to travel in car . because of the rising price of the fuel . i think this is the big reason to the decrease in use of car . we all know very well the fossil fuel are declining day by day . there is a big decerase in the natural resource from the last few year . so everyone must tried to control this . and we can do this by controling the use of fossil fuel . another reason for decrease in the use of car is that it increase the pollution in the atmosphere . which is a very serious problem . a pollution create many kind of problem like many kind of disease like skin disease and also breathing problem . many child are suffering from these disease in there young age . so this problem can be solved by controllling the use of pollution creating vehicle . there is a lot of traffic on the road also . which is very irritating . so we can avoid this by using train and plain . so in next some year people will prefer le use of car than today to all of these problem like pollution , traffic , longer time duration and also the pressure of driving .
