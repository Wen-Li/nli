i do not think that young people enjoy life more than older people do . life enjoying ha nothing to do with age . it doe not depend on the activity a person doe , but on the feeling he ha . it is true that young people have more chance to experience different activity and to meet different people . they are usually more open to learn from other people and to perform new activity . young people can meet new people at school , at work or at the club and bar . they are also physically able to do sport , to travel to ` unsafe ' place , and to go to long-lasting party . this kind of activity can be good source of joy and happiness . but older people do not have to experience different activity or to meet different people to enjoy life . as well a they get older , they identify what kind of activity provide them the most joy . they also learn who are their true friend . older people stop worrying about everyday problem and start understanding the thing that matter . they have more time to spend with the family : they can enjoy their child and greatchildren more than they did while young . they have more time to travel ( to ` safe ' place ) and to see their true friend . i believe that the secret for life enjoying is to understand every age and not to try to take back time . people who understand every moment a a unique opportunity to be happy can enjoy life when they are old a well a they did when they were younger . and it is not a theoretical belief : i know old people who have enjoyed life only by understanding every moment . my grandfather is a good example : he is 80 year old . everytime i see him he is smiling , everytime he remembers the past he smile , and everytime he think about the future he smile . i want to live my life that way : i want to take the best of time with friend , with my family , at work and at the university in order to enjoy every second .
