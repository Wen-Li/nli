i strongly agree with this idea . i really think that it is more important for student to understand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . if i understand an idea or concept i can really go deeply in a subject and remember it for long time . also , i can apply that idea to other situation . on the other hand , if i just learn fact i will have just superficial knowledge and i will remember those fact for short time . probably , it is going to be difficult for me to apply that knowledge to other scenario . first , it is very important to deeply understand concept and to remember them for year . from my personal experience i can say that i studied literature in high school not only reading the book but also analizing them in their context . knowing who the author wa , when the book wa written , for example . with that idea in mind i could understand better what a text said and i can still explain that topic to other people . on the contrary , i studied biology just with fact . for instance , i learnt the name of part of the body and their location , but i never understood how they worked . if someone asks me about that field , i would have to say that i do not know much and also i do not remember even the fact . second , i think that a good way to use the knowledge is applying it in different situation . to do that we need to understand very well what concept we know and how they are related with others . although we have a big list of fact , we can not use the esence of that subject in a new challenge . for example , to play the piano i have to learn how to read music . i can not just learn wich key in my piano is do , re or mi . i have to understand that the note are a representation of music and in that way it is going to be possible for me to play any piano , keybord or even othe instrument . as a conclusion i can say that if a student want to learn , he or she ha to understand the idea and concept first . the fact are also important , but they are nothing if the student can not explain how they are related or if he or she can just repeat word without a deep meaning behind them .
