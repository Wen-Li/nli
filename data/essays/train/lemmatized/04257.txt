movement or rather transport is an esential part of day to day activity . cars are included in one of the many mean of road transport . coming to the topic proper , i disagree with the statement that there will be fewer car in the near future to come . there are many reason a to why i support my decision . firstly , the technology is advancing in leap and bound . so , in the near future , car would be available at a cheaper rate to the commom people . the advancing technology would also help in combating the problem of air pollution by devoloping car that run on electricity or hydro power . the science can also be used to produce more fuel efficient car which would inturn help in conserving our limited natural resource . the present world is becoming more developed and the basic attitude of a developed society is to maintain good status . cars indicate the status of a person financially . thus more and more people would be inclined to buy car in the near future . coming to the most important factor , `` the safety factor '' . travelling in a car is far more safer than travelling on bike . this fact ha been recently prooved . last but not the least , when it come to individual concern , luxury take the upper hand . cars are far more luxurios than other conventional vehicle . for example , one would prefer to travel in a car with the ac on , rather than travelling on a bike under the scorching heat of the sun . ruling out some fact that car are robust , and thing like that i conclude my topic by saying authentically that there will be more car in the near future to come .
