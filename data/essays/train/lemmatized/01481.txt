do younger people enjoy life more than older people ? this ha been much debated and in my opinion , the older people enjoy life much more than younger people . there are several reason to support my reasoning . firstly , older people have lived most of their year and have been through a lot of stress filled and busy life . now it time for them to sit back and relax and pick up other activites for which they probably didnt have time during their younger year . whereas , the younger generation is more concerned with accumulating more wealth and improve his career . secondly , the youth is busy planning his future and supporting his family . he ha several worry and the current lifestyle do not allow him to enjoy life to the fullest . he need to be completely focussed at his career and compete against each other . meanwhile , older people generally have achieved most their goal from a career point of view , tend to look at life in a more relaxed manner . also , the older man is wiser and know the importance of enjoying life better that a younger person . for instance , older people tend to spend their precious time travelling across the globe or spending time with family a compared to younger people who are bound to their work for most part of the year . while a few might argue that the youthful exuberance would edge out over older people , in my opinion older people enjoy their life more having achieved most of their goal on the professional front and are in a better position to take up new hobby and new activites .
