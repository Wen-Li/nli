people , especially student , often discus whether having some specific knowledge about one sucject is better than having broad knowledge of many academic subject . however , i strongly believe that having broad knowledge of many academic subject is more useful . this rational behind this that it allows people to have more chance to get a job . furthermore , student can learn well-balanced education . in korea , most big company want to recruit someone who ha broad knowledge . that is because these kind of people are more helpful to them to make a large amount of money . as everyone know , a a matter of fact , having broad knowledge of many subject ha a disadvatage which lead to shallow knowledge . however , this advantage can eclipse this disadvantage . from my own experience , when i wa a university student , i took a lot of academic course such a biology , computer and spanish . so , i got some advantage when i got into my company , sam-sung . on top of that , students can get well-balanced education . basically , the purpose of school is educating their student about many subject . that is because having specific knowledge about some course is like picky . i mean when child eat their meal , they usually pick up what they want such a meat . so , it lead to health problem , obesity , which cause various health problem . i bet that having specific knowledge is definetly harmful for their personality or their future . taking all of these into account , i have no doubt in my mind that having a lot of knowledge of many academic subject is helpful for people in our future to reach our goal .
