every day in every part of the world peolpe have to ak themselves if it is really necessary to take risk to be more successful or if it is enough to stay on a certain level . every day people have to decide in which direction they want to move . my personal opinion wa always to take some risk . however i seperate it into taking stupid risk and taking `` intelligent '' risk . if you want to be more successful than you are , you have to change something and to try out something new . our society is always on the move - nowadays thing change very quickly . i am sure that we have to find new answer for new circumstance . last year i had to ask myself what kind of university i want to join . the possibility were to go to a usual university in austria or trying to get into a special one in switzerland or germany . i could have said that i take the easy way out which mean going to an austrian college . however i wanted to join a better university which meant that i had to find a job for one year ( for practice ) and to do exam like the toefl to get in . to make it short - i took a risk . probably the university is n't interested to work with me . but even if they do n't give me a chance i could learn a lot in this year . if i had not taken the risk i probably would ask myself for the rest of my life why i did n't even tried it . in my opinion you ca n't have a satisfied life if you never take a risk to find out how much fun it is if you are successful or if you see a positive result of your tooken risk . by the way i could have a happy life without skydiving . but i did it and it wa one of my greatest experience i ever had . to summerize my opinion : i would like to encourage every one to risk a lot and to take a risk again - also if you had bad experience with this attitude .
