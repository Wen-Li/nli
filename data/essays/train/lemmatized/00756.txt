i think that the car ha changed the life of the last century and it is an impotant mean for our life still today . however i think also that the car bring with them same ambiental and social problem . first of all , the car make too pollution , also new car that they have so many reststriction but again today is not enough . furthermore , the car have destroed all kind of human ralationshipm whit nature and otherelf . for example , for getting some at market the people get their car also to do few meter , because , so they do le work . the people do n't want to walk or ride a bike anymore because they are to lazie to do that and they think that the car can solve their problem of moving . this abuse of the car is allowed becouse not only for the laize of the people but also for the bad condition of pubblic traspot . indeed , in some part of the world , it is always late , durty , and sometimes very expencive , and above all confortless . in other word , these are situation that force people to take the car . indeed , it ha all confort that we want : air conditioned , music , space . .. i do n't belive that among twenty year the car will be fewer , instead i think that the number will grow up more and more . this will be possible because a wrong political way he been gotten ( i am talking about my particular country situation ) . nothing is doing to change direction . on the other hand , somebody think that the end of petroil will decrese the number of car , but for my it is not true , for to topic : the oil is still too much to finish suddenly and the car ' factory never will allwe the the car wil lose importance in our life . iin conclusion i think that the solution are two or the goverment of all wor
