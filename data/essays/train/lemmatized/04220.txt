when an image of future world come to mind , do you think that future car are going to fly in the sky instead of driving on the ground ? as far a i am concerned , there will be fewer car than those of people imagine that will appear in the sky due to the following reason . first of all , there will be fewer car in the future because the possible depletion of oil ha alarmed people to explore other resource to replace mobile that consume a great deal of oil each day . since the crisis of exhausting oil is around the corner , people nowadays are more eager to look for other resource that can replace the oil-consuming vehicle , or people just use oil-free transportation to achieve the goal of saving energy , like bycicling to work . due to the fact that everybody ha a concern about energy shortage , people will gradually decrease the amount they drive right now and the car they produce and buy in the future . secondly , to solve the problem of oil shortage , government will put more emphasis on the development of public transportation . for example , taipei , the city where i grew up , ha become more convenient due to it public transportation , the mrt transportation system . since the mrt can easily take people to to any corner of taipei city with le time , why should people spend time whining in car during traffic jam or zigzaging on road ? hence , i believe that people will le motivated in the future to drive or even to buy a car . to summarize , a highly well-developed public transportation will be every government 's first choice to explore in the future . if all can well utilize the public transportation , our descendent will no longer to brook the pollution caused by car .
