in my view , it is better to have a broad knowledge of many acafeimic subject . of course there are some disadvantage of broad knowledge because it mean a greater investment of time and tuition . howvever , there are even more compelling advantage that i want to explain . i think broad knowledge is effecticely for many area of the life . first , you have a common core of knowledge with other student . if you are an international student you need to communicate in many part of life . broad knowledge make it easier to have an intellectual exchange with other people . in opposite , specialization lead to a narrow view of thing . this people are not informed about a lot of thing so they can not share their knowlegde with other people . an additional point is that broad knowledge increase the opportunity of career that you can choose from during life . from the beginning of their study , people often do not know what they want to make in their future . therefore , broad knowlegde of many academic subject offer more career opportunity than specialization . perhaps , it help or show you a direction in what their job should be in the future . of course , people often change their job in their entire life , maybe because of their own decision or other circumstance . in this case , broad knowledge can find another interesting job . finally , you get more opportunity for leisure time . this mean , that you are interested in a lot of thing because broad knowledge provides a lot of aspect of life . later , educated people , when they are older , they will retire their job so they can spend their time on their hobby that they have developed during their study of many academic subject . in short , i think it is good to have a broad knowledge of many academic subject . first , you get exposure to a lot of thing . second , you can choose between many career . finally , you get a broad view of leisure time .
