i am definitely not agree with the idea that asserts older people can not enjoy life a young people do . i will explain my reason of course . first of all , i believe that older people know a lot about life . they have a lot of experience about life . this give them a very significant advantage on doing the right thing . it mean that they can do the proper thing to enjoy . they do not vaste time to see if something is enjoyable or not . because they know what is fun , they will just do the thing they like . second , although many people believe that older people doe not enough energy a young people , this is not something totally true . if an older person take care of herself or himself then there is no need to worry about . older people can do anything that they want , provided that it is safe . of course some thing may have some risk , but do not forget that the young people also have these risk . third , enjoying the life doe not need to have the same meaning to everybody . different people like different thing . it is not something releated with age . while some people may find the literature a enjoyable , some other may not . for example , i am not crayz about football , but my little brother is getting mad at playing and watching football even just seeing the player . on the contrary , despite my love of literature , he ha no interest on this . there is not a generation gap between u . there is only two-year gap . in my opinion it reveals that age is not important to enjoy something . if a person want to enjoy something , he or she will definitely find a way . to sum up , a i tried to explain above , i do n't think that age matter in enjoying life . it is not the age that making the thing enjoyable or not , but character of people that make the world enjoyable . if you want to enjoy the life , take my word for it , there are limitless opportunity to do so . it is up to you .
