i think that the human being can appreciate the value of the study only when understand the idea and concept that are on the base of the study and that explain the reality . in fact , not all the student have the capacity to learn fact and memorize them . in genus , they keep in mind only the fundamental information or the information that they understand , losing all the other one that they ca n't understand and , a consequence , they could n't remember . but if the teacher gave them a method to understand the real sense of the fact , the idea and concept , they will learn the fact because they could explain the sense of them . i think this is the idea on the base of the italian school and university , where student , from the youngest age , learn to understand idea and concept and not to memorize information : this is the classic method which derives by latin and greek study . in fact , greek and latin wise figured out the human being at the centre of the world and appreciated more what wa inside his mind than the background and the enviroment around him .
