media in our middle east region and a round the world always speaking about a very hot topic which is come from time to time , this topic is `` the role of young people in supporting their community '' , i think i am disagree with most of the statement which told that young people nowadays do not give the time to help their community and i have tow resons for disagree with this statement . first , the young people in every community ha alot of energy , kowledge and skill that can be utillized by goverments in order to support it is endless development , and their are alot of example from history and modern age that give a really strong evidence that when the young people give the chance from their community to play a leadership role in every aspect , the usually reflect this trust by doing the writh job . secound , some community try to avoid giving the young people the chance to helping their community because they do n't have a confidents on them , they always try to depend on the experianced poeple , and this is usually come from misunderstanding and miscommunication between the new generation of young people and the old generation which is representive by experianced people . finally , i think icommunities should give their `` young people '' the chance to demonstrate their ability to build those sociaties , then it is going to be one of those community great invesment on the real gold which the '' human resource '' factor , and which will have it high impact on the nation development .
