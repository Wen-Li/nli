i fully disagree with this sentence . some people say that it is more useful to have bread knowledge of many academic than to on specific subject . they argue that by two reason ; these day , much information are more valuable than any other thing and it is more useful if you find job . i , however , have convincing evidence to the contrary . first , some people argue that much information are most valuable . however they do not see why their argument is far-fetched . actually , information is very important to anybody . also many medias provide various information ; like internet , tv news , and so on . so we can get a much information by medias . but they do not provide always true . if you get wrong informatin , you could get disadvantage . so many company and people effort to find currect information . therefore their argument which much information are most valuable , doe not stand to reason . second , some people claim that if you find a job , broad knowledge is more helpful . however this is not always true . actually , thease day , many company reguire knowledge of specific subject when they employ person . if you have knowledge of specific subject , you will easier find a job . actually , many companis emphasis that when they introduce their company in university or other place . hence , their claim , which is broad knowledge is more helpful , ha no persuasion . therefore , with unswerving conviction , i firmly disagree to have broad knowledge of many academic . all in all , i strongly believe that it is better to specialize in one specific subject . it is more helpful anybody .
