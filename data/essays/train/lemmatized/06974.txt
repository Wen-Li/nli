travelling is very important in our life , especially when you travell from place to new one or another culture or land . many kind of travelling differ from one to another from group to another . i agree strongly with the openion to travel in group l led by tour guide for many reason we can mention some of these reason that i prefere to travell in group led by a tour guide : 1 - the tour guide is the person or agencey responsible for the group and guide them to the place depending on the scaduele , a the guide is always local or native agencey that plann the trip and be resbonsible for the group . 2 - the use of tour guide is much safer than to be alone or by yourself , especially at these day from some activity against the foreigner in different area of the world . 3 - when one travell in group this give chance to know and have new friend , and discus different topic especially about the history or political or a general . 4 - when you use tour guide and travel in group this avoid the person to be used by any one especially if you travel to another country or another land you don , t know about it that much or behavouer of this place . 5 - it is more secure and safety , 6 - the tour guide ha well educated person and have knowledge about the history and able to give proper explanation to any question . 7 - some group can use one of the group a guide for the trip and many deal with some agency to provide them with transportation and plane their trip . a general , i like always to travel in group , and i like this openion and support it strongly . when you be in group you have a lot good time either for fun or increase your knowledge . * i prefer the older people to travel and be guided by tourist agency this will be much better bec always older need much help . * i n my experience when i wa young i used to travel in group also i used to camping and always have a leader to our trip , and this the best way to travel especially for tourist . ;
