when i wa studying in school , i also felt that `` why we have to learn junk subject '' . however , i really agree about the many academic subject are good for knowledge , because it provide lot of opportunity , i mean it 's good for future . in my life , when i wa second grade in middle school , a teacher gave a homework to u which wa find your talant . after school , i tried to think what am i good at or what do i like . however , i could n't , because i could n't find my talants . however , after highschool finally , i found my talants . my talant is a law . when i wa first grade in highschool , i had a friend who called che-jea-heong . he wa very special friend . he always tried to think strange way . first , i did n't want to talk with him , but when we talked about the talant , we became a friend . actually , his father is police . and his family is very poor . so , first we started to talk his father , why he is poor . after that we started to think law . then we found our talant . actually , this i found this talant from the school project . when i wa 3grade in middle school , i had a class which wa korean language class , but at that class , we had a special study which wa law . because , my teacher thought law is good for stundent . so we tried to study the law just one period with a game . however , my friend are really bored about this , but me i wa really enjoyed that law class . so after that period , i said to the teacher that study more law , but she could n't , because lot of people did n't like that . anyway , i really like the law , also i 'll go to the law university . from this reason , i can think many way to find my talant from the school subject . i can think math , science , music or art . so we can include our opportunity . now day , many student can not understand the school about the acadmic subject that why they have to learn too much subject , i wa too , but now i agree from the school . and i really thanks from the school .
