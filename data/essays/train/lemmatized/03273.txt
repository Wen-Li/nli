`` understanding give you a better clarity and vision rather than learning fact '' , i agree to the point that understanding idea and concept ha a better result than simply learning it . when you are learning the fact , what exactly happens is that if you are not repeating it again and again you tend to forget the concept and idea . in learning you try to memorise the text without looking at it 's practical implemntation and after a period of time it get vanished . learning could be lucrative only when you have to swallow thing like . in history , where you have to learn the time and series of event that ha happened in past . but in creative and intelectual subject like . science , arts , mathematics it is not good to simply learn thing because these area need you to understnad the idea and concept . in understanding the idea and concept yoy use the creative , active and imaginative part of your brain . when you understand something you do n't have to push yourself to revise it again . taking `` mathematics '' a example when you understand the concept geomatry , than only you will be able to use it properly and efficiently . understanding the idea and concept open your brain to see every part of the subject . and after doing a brainstorm with urself you understands the fact which you never forget . understanding a concept is easier to do than learning it . it is often seen that student focus more on learning thing than understanding because they have their exam pressure on them . at last i would suggest that the dynamcis of an educational course should emphasis more on giving a better understanding . when an individual understand a concept it come into his behaviour . learning is like looking at the ocean from a distance and understanding is more about enjoying the depth of it .
