studying , idea , concept and fact are very different way of teaching . according to my experience , studying in idea and concept is more effective . ideas and concept are , opinion , they are not objective , they reflect the thought of a person or someone , if we study them we will get to know several point of view . for example , sudying idea , in history is important , we can defferentiate the point of view , and try to explain what a certain politician want , or belief , that will open a big , door , for conversation , and dialogue , and comprehension . or even in philosophy , trying to interpret plato , or socrate , in a logical way , is better to understand why do they mean what they said ? learning idea and conception , give a better chance to the student to undersand , and think , for example ; in a biology class , studying an expriment , and giving the result , these are idea , if the student can manipulate these result in a certain way , first it will give him a chance of thinking , and when he will get the point , or interpret the result in the right way he will be able , to bring the fact behind the experience , himself . but on another hand , studying facts , give you le oppurtunity to think and try to develop , a certain intelligent way , to understand think , and thought , of other people . therefore the class will not be fun , it will allways be straight to the point , the teacher , will be here in front of the student and they will just be , telling them what haoppened , whitout giving them a chance to browse there mermories and brainstorm . in conclusion it is important , to give the student , a chance to think , and give his opinion over something . but the teacher mu n't let the student mislead himself , they must allways leave him on the right track , even if it need , to correct him , it will still be better than learning wrong stuff .
