i definitely agree with the statement exposed before , since my experience showed me that understanding idea is more important that just learning fact . i think that building model of event and thing is the only way to study what surround u . since i am studying engineering i will bring two example dealing with my field . if you can elaborate a mathematic model of how an engine work , than you will be be able to produce it and maybe also to understand , if there would be a damage , why that kind of misfunctioning ha occurred , which is the first step towards an improved engine . while if you only had seen somebody building an engine , you will also be able to build one following the same step but you would not be able to understand neither how the engine work nor why a damage could occur in certain condition , or what is due to . also if you have understood a concept you could probably happen to apply it to many different event . for example if you know what gravity is and why it work , will be able to apply your knowledge to ton of experience . you will then understand both the reason of apple falling down the three when mature and not going up in the sky , a probably newton did when he first explained this phenomenon , and the reason of the moon rotating around the earth and not leaving his pattern because the equilibrium between the gravity strenght and an opposite strenght due to his speed . anyway i think it is very important not to loose the contact with reality . i mean that elaborating abstract model which do not have now and will not have in the future any concrete application it is an unuseful thinking . this is the risk of giving more importance to idea than fact : finding ourselves thinking to the best idea , forgetting none of them will be then applayble to what is our final purpose .
