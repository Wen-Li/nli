nowadays , with our capitalistic way of thinking , and our huge ideology of research for wealth , it ha become a common concern to seek for the best way to be succesful . thus , many people argue that it is easier to be successful running risk or trying new thing . actually , we can not denied that taking risk can lead to success . because finding new thing is obviously the best way to give to the people new need ( for economy ) , and also to anticipate your competitor . marcel bleustein , for example , became one of the most famous french advertisors , being the first one to try to do advertising on radio . one another hand , trying new thing lead you to take risk , and becoming unsuccessful if nobody take care of your idea . however , it is also possible to be successful only doing what you know how to do well . the principle is that , if you know perfectly how to do something , you will consequently do it on a better way that your concurrents . the big americane telephone compagny at & t , for example , prefered in the 20 continue to be the best in the telephone technologie , rather than developpe new technology such a wireless telegraph . as everybody know , it wa a good choice . actually , the best way to be successful may be both doing something we know well , and trying to find new thing . in art for example , it is diffucult to be a real artist , that is to say to create new thing , without be aware of what existed before . that is why , before becoming one of the most famous french movie director and one of the leader of the nouvelle vague , j. l. gaudard firstly worked hard to know a lot of thing about classical cinema and more generally about classical art .
