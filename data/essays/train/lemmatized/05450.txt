majority people see a lot more advertisement . some people say that by seeing the advertisement , they are judged whether they are good product or not . howerer , when this topic come to me , i firmly believe that advertisement ha a lot of drawback . advertisement foster a instant consume , and a lot of company adapt famous actor and actress with expensive model payment . i n addition , through an advertisement , people do n't think which product is good or not . to begin with , advertisement foster a instant consume . when i came to new-york , i wa really interested in victoria secret advertisement , which made me buy a lot more it product even if i had lot of innerwears already . i could not saying that the advertisement wa the worst thing for me . what is more , a lot of company adapt famous actor and actress with expensive payment . even though , the price of product is pretty cheap , we have to pay it advertisement fare invisible . we would be pay more expensive price , considering quality of product . it go with out saying that advertisement is really disadvantageous . finally , people do n't think anymore which product is good or not . especially , the youth prefer to get specific product , such a nike , cocacola and ipot ( mp3 ) , etc . they want to have some product that the famous actor or actresse advertise although it cost a lot of money . these event may cause social problem . i may well say that davertisement is harmful for the youth . to sum up , a might expected , advertisement ha many shortcoming a i have mentioned above .
