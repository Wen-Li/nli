i agree with the statement that young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community . nowadays young people became more interested of spinding alote of time on vedeo game , enternet chating , shoping , and watching tv . one of the important reasone that make young people nowadays do not give enough time to helping their community is the change in the enviroments around themselfs . for example , the improvment of technolegy create other way for spending time instated of specifing the enough time to helping their community . anather reasone that parent do not encarege the young people to give enough time to helping their community . schools are also do not pay a tention for teatching young people the importance of helping their community . thus , it is not one specific resone lead to the behavore of the young people nowadays where they do not give enough time to helping their community . it is the responcepelty of the family , school , and the other socity factores which where reflectted negativety on them .
