in this eassy i 'm going to answer aquestion which is based on my experience about '' should successful people try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how ro do well '' . and i will give my opinion whenther i agree or not with this statment and give some reason and example to support my opinion . will i think that successful people should alwasy try new thing and take risk rather than only doing what they already know how to do , because in order to succed in your life you have to try new thing and take risk because it make you learn more about your self and life , so for example , i have lived my whole life in saudi arabia a have lived there for about 18 year , and now after i finshed high school , i came to the united state to get my university degree there . so it wa hard decision for me to make and it wa also a risk to do that and also it anew thing for me , but it wa a good decsion to make even if there wa some riks but in order to succed in life a have do it , so now i am in whole diffrent culture than i wa in , and i am learning new thing and i have been in a lot og risk a tried alot of new thing , but it wa good for me . but it wa good for me that i made this decision because i leared alot from it and if i did n't do it i wo n't succed in life , so if i just sated in my country and do that same thing a i do i will not succed and learn new thing . so in conclusion i just want to say that if u want to succed in life you have to always try new thing and take risk in order to succed beacuse it maked u learn more and more about life so
