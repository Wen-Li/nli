as a matter of fact , we all can say that today there are plenty of car all over the world , especially in big city , but some people think that in twenty year there could be fewer car in use than there are today . i quite agree with these people for the reason i am going to give following . as a first point car have made our life more comfortable and nowadays moving is easier than in the past , but it is important to consider the huge quantity of pollution car are producing . nowadays people take much more care of our environment than in the past , and i think that for this reason in the future different kind of vehicle , moved by hidrogen , corn oil or electricity , will be avaible instead of car . another point to consider is that in this century we have seen a rapidly increasing technological progress , that will surely lead to different kind of transportation , like the flying vehicle we can see in so many fantascientific film , that will be of course a good alternative to car . another important point to consider is that city are getting larger and larger everyday , and every person who life in a big city , a i do , can see how many hour we loose every day in traffic jam caused by the huge number of car in use . for this reason , i think that in twenty year people will probably buy more motorbike and scooter , that are lighter and taht have better perfomances in traffic jam . as a final point , nowadys people take a lot of care of their health and fitness and for this reason i think that they will start soon using bicicles and roller_skate to go to work or to school , so that they could save the money of the fuel , avoid pollution and remain fit . concluding this short essay , i quite agree with the initial statement and i really hope that in the future we will live in a world free from car , so that we and our child could live in a better way .
