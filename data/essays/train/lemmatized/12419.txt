travel can be a good present to a person who is tired or bored with an ordinary busy life . it can be a time for a new adventure or a time for taking a rest . some people prefer traveling with a group and a tour guide . others choose a trip by themselves or with their family and friend . personally , i prefer to travel with my family and friend or just by myself without a tourguide . trip in a group with a tour guide can be cheaper because of possible group discount and agency deal . also , i do n't need to do my research for the place i want to visit during the trip . all i need to do is to show up the place where i am supposed to meet a group and a tour guide and to follow predetermined schedule . it sound very convenient . however , there is limited freedom in a group tour . i may not visit the place i wish to go , must wait for others , can not eat the restaurant i choose , and can not change schedule even if i want to . furthermore , i am usually not able to choose a group i am with nor a tour guide . if i am unlucky , that trip can be a pain to bear with somebody uncomfortable . when i wa in school , i visited bangkok with a group led by a tour guide . the reason i chose the group tour wa that it wa a very good deal . there were 35 individual in my group in different age . frankly speaking , it wa very unpleasant because there were some people distracted . they spent too much time on shopping and rest of u had to wait for them . because a tour guide get a commission , he did n't stop them rather encourage them to purchase more . i wasted a lot of time in the bus waiting for others . also , i could n't eat the restaurant i wanted to eat . i could n't stay a place long enough i enjoy the view . besides of above reason i pointed out , i want to have some good memory which will last long after the trip . for a group tour , i do n't need to do any research for the trip except checking schedule . thus , there are not a lot of memory i can have later . i would like to have a travel with full of unpredicted event . i may visit place nobody else visit since no tour guide go there . there could be some challenge . but through overcoming them , i will improve myself more . thus , the best way to travel for me is definitely not in a goup led by a tour guide .
