in this ambivalent society , the issue whether there will be fewer numeber of vehicle on the land in the future or not is often raised and debated . a portion of society belief that there will be much more car in our life , since the opportunity of delivering good increase a time go by ; however , i have a differing idea . in twenty year , the number of car will decrease because the society encounter environmental and social change : the greenhouse effect , and globalization . one example of a trigger that make the number of car reduce can be seen in the response to the greenhouse effect . as society grows , environmental issue are raised , especailly the greenhouse effect . this effect , caused by damaging gas emitted from car , harm ecological order by influencing sea level to rise . furthermore , unexpectedly changing climate threatens human live directly : tsunami in indonesia . therefore , people begin to invent alternative vehicle that doe not make harmful gas , such a hybrid vehicle . in addition , the increasing us of bike encourage people to avoid air pollution . thus , in twenty year there will be fewer car in our life to protect our surronding safe and clean . not only do the current event furnish an endless array of example encapsulating the claim that the number of car on land will be reduced in the future , but social trend doe a well ; a prime example is globalization . as the whole world become a one town , the opportunity to trade and travel among foreign country ha been expanding . as a result , rather than car that are limited in only one continent , airplane will attract more people in the future . for example , according to the research in korea , about 85 % of the nation prefers airplane a transportation . also , a most company , such a samsung , lg , and sony , expands their market toward other country , the importance of taking airplane , instead of driving car in domestic market , are percieved by many nation . in the paragraph above , i have shown that in twenty year , there will be much fewer car in our live , but much more alternative vehicle that prevent environment and help to adopt international trend , globalization . so , i call the reader to make technological progress in innovating our limited transportation to prepare comming future society .
