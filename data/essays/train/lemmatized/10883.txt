some people believe that successful people sould try new thing and take risk . others do n't . personally , i ca n't totally agree with both . for one reason , successful people should face new thing to be more skillful and adept . moreover , they ca n't have the same routine evryday . on the other hand , they should focus on what they are good at to enhance and improve their ambition and dream . for the second reason , i find it delightful and glamorous to take risk specially for successful people . because they have to be astute and wise and that will appeal by collecting data by having a new experince and a new risk . for the third reason , sometimes they should'nt take damage risk . for example , i once heared that their wa a wise successful person who went to the tropical forest to take a new hazard . unfortunatly , he ended up dead . so vividly , their are limit by having risk . moreover i think it is compulsory to know them . for the forth reason , sometimes successful people should pursue their happiness . because i find it outstanding to congregate and gather by having new risk . plus it may lead you to your own ambition . for example , i wa out once with family and friend i wa scared of sky diving but they forced me to play it and i intrestingly i 've liked it alot . moreover , i play ski diving evry month now . eventually , i think trying new thing ha an amaizing feature amaizing . however , successful people should focus on the thing that they know how to do well too .
