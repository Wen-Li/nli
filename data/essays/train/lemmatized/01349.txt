how to be a creative person ? it is really tough to answer to it since everybody know that the result of any creation ha to be appreciated and approuved by other peolpe . therefore , it doe not only depends on our personal feeling . well , it is not a good raison of evoiding to try new thing instead of keeping doing well what we already know how to do . in the following paragraph , i am going to give illustrate and give argument according to my point of view . with the evolution of new technology and the growth of the global market , competition between people and other entity are increasing . hence the need of releasing new thing in order to remain in fashion or be more competitive . all this can happen only by trying new thing . what the domain of competency , you would need to put in place new attractive thing . as illustration , let 's talk about cellphone . mobile phone company allways release new type of device , and this just because they have try new technology instead of doing or trading the same model . futhermore , if go back in the past , we will realize that all discovery made by scientist , physician , biologist and so on , have been possible because they haved tryed new thing , new concept , new experience . all can see the result today : we hace electricity , car , aircraft , tablet and medecins , water and so on . all that make our today 's life , better to live . therefore , i encourage people , whatever their social life , their occupation and their personality , to take a risk and try new thing . this can contribute to the development our world and their own partuculary . we can not stay in the same way , for all our time we are going to spend on this earth , with taking any risk by putting in place new thing . we just need to try , and one day we will get a good result .
