i disagree with the statement . i know that older people work hard and have to take care of the family , bill and other stuff . but student 's also have to study , obey parent and young people 's life is limited . i born in korea . and my parent told me that i should be happy because i do not have to work . but they do not know what young people are going through . this wa the typical life of mine before i come to u.s.a , go to school 8 , come home 3 : 30 , go tutoring from 4 until 8 , and then go to another tutoring . when i get home it 's 1 a.m . maybe older people think that we live happy life we have no life for fact . and reason that we do n't have life is because of adult . we are told to do what our parent tell u to do . they tell u if you study hard you will have better life later . moreover , younger people have limited life young people can not work if their parent do n't allow them to work or drive . olders life are not they can do whatever they want . their life is made by their choice . older can chose wether they want to work or not . nobody is going to say , '' hey !!! you have to work ! '' because they are adult nobody can control them . they have their own right to be that way . however , think about the young people like high school student . they have to study for sat , psat , act , toefl ... etc. we also need to worry about friendship , look , love , and college payment . so many thing to worry about and the pressure of the parent . young people do not have the freedom of choice and they are attached to lot of test to worry about . i bet old people do n't think that test is enjoy of their life . for these reason , the statement should change like this `` old people enjoy life more than younger people do '' .
