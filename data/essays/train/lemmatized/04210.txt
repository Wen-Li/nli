in my country i think that it is very difficult to help in community . the school take away most of the freetime that a student ha . during the past year i have been an `` au pair '' in the usa . one of the kid that i wa used to take care , a 7th grader , had to help in her community and do some volunteer work . i know that the school organize this kind of thing and i think that is really helpful for life that a kid find time to help other people . it give the person time to be with other people , time to talk about the thing that are happening around and see what your community need to be taken care of . i don-t really agree with the statement . because i think that there is not enough time sometimes to help in this really important service . i can speak for myself now saying that soemtimes i cut a little time to help others but in this way i found myself in a hurry to do other important thing that had a priority first . i experienced a community service in the states and i had no problem on finding time for that . i had to collect clothes in a tiny community center for a thrift store . it gave me a so much that job that i would recommended to anyone that want to do a community service . and , there are a lot of other thing that would need to take care of , also , some funny thing to do with child while their parent are at work or give some help to poor family that doesn-t have somebody that can help them . i agree that many people have time and they don-t care on helping in this kind of service or they prefere to occupy theirselves in other thing . but mostly , i think that the main problem is in how the community is organized and in how people expected it to be taken care of . maybe a little bit more of relation between school and service , also used for extra scholastic credit , would make a difference on having more time for student to help in community .
