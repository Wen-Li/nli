nowadays , many student are studying many academic field and at the same time , it is a problem wether they must have broad knowledge or specialized knowledge . i agree with the idea that it is better to have broad kowledge of many academic field . there are two reason for this . first of all , broad knowledge is base of all academic skill . for example , in my university , i must have taken many field of lecture in my first grade . afterwards , i study a specific subject , communication . because i learned many academic field , i study my major more effectively . moreover , knowing many academic field can be useful in many way . for instance , when a doctor make up his mind to start his job a a doctor , it is important where to build the hospital , what age of consumer in each area , and so on . that is the time when business management or psycology are useful . secondly , common sense is needed for living in society . for example , i live in japan and especially in japan , company strongly hope new worker to have common sense because japanese are having le and le common sense these day . for these reason , i agree with that having broader academic knowledge is better . i think broden knowlwdge of many academic field is base of our studying and lead to have common sense .
