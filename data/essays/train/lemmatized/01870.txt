i agree with the statement for a several reason : 1. one may not success at the first try , but eventually if one keep trying , one will encounter success . unsuccessful people do n't realize that success take time and effort . they want it to be done at the first time , and that doe not always happen ! there are several story about inventor who did not give up and tried several time , even thousand of time ! the inventor of the light bulb is one that come to my mind . imagine what would have happened if he would have given up after all those try ! but he kept trying and trying until he did it ! of course , that doe n't mean to get stuck with something that doe not work , which take me to the second reason why agree with the statement . 2. i think successful people know when to change , or try a different approach . if something is not working , then know when to quit and try it in another way ! do n't give up but do n't ob either . maybe take a break and look it at a different angle . like the chemist who could not figure out the chemical composition of an element , and discovered it during a dream , when he dreamed of a snake biting it tail . 3. life is constantly changing , and one can not stay the same without changing . new technology are developed on a daily basis , and you can not lock yourself in a shell and pretending change is not happening outside . whether you like it or not , you have to try new thing , or you 'll stay behind . that 's what successful people do . 4. people fear that if they take risk they will loose the few thing they have now . but they fail to realize that they are having a major loss with the cost of opportunity for not using your resource and take a risk . they would gain much more if they were willing to risk what they have or their time . 5. also , in addition to these reason , successful people know when to ask for help , and work in a team . one can acomplish more if one ha support from other people .
