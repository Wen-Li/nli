i agree to the statement `` most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are '' . in an advertisement such a commercial on tv 's and ad 's in magazine , it seem like it is a very attrative product and trying to get people 's attention by their first look . the company will use backgroung and surroundings , unreal feature and famous people to apeal their product . when i wa a little , i used to see commercial advertisement of barbie doll all the time . the commericials showed how you could do so many thing with the doll and how much fun you can have with them . there were music on the background and a perfect set that the girl played in . i wa absolutley attracted by the commerical and always asked for a new barbie doll . but when i baught them , it might not move the way it moved in the tv and some of the feature showed in the commercial did not come with the product . another way they are making the product look better , is by using special feature . for example , i once saw a tv show that showed how they created commercial for food product . usually they will not show the real food . there are proffesionals who make food from clay and plastic to show more texture and better in look . they will use spray to show coldness of drink and steam to show how hot they are . they can also create their commercial using computer graphic so that it can look better . the usage of celebrity ha an influence on the viewer also . even if the product is not a good a it look , when it is held or presented by a famous celebrity , you might think that the product is attractive be convined in buying the product . in an commercial or an advertisement , they will use the background , special feature that is unreal , and celebrity to make the product to be apealing . from these reason i belive that most of the advertisement are making the pruducts look more attractive than it really is .
