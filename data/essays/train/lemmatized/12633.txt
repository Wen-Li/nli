it is a well known fact that in nowadays society , youth is thought to be the best age [ use of young people in advertising , this willingness to appear young , and so on and so far . .. ] however i am convinced that being young is harder than being old and , therefore that older people enjoy life more than we do . in fact , it is a period of life in which we are worried . it is well worth mentionning that both in shool orientation and in love we are totally lost . we are stressed by exam , think that it is too important for our future to fail it , so we have constant pression , relative are another seamy side of the question , they really want u to succeed in life and want to be pround of u , such a responsability for a young man , or a young woman . besides , we do not know ourselves , how can we know if this boy , or this girl is our soul mate ? shakespeare said in '' all the world 's a stege '' that a period of life wa the lover one ; i deeply agree . from all this thing we understand that being young is close to live in our mind , it stand for a life in which question are the privailing activity . we have to build our personnality , to know how to live by our own . then , we are like prisonners who can not do what we want to : we do not have enought money to provide for our need so we have to cumulate both school , and job . with the issue of finding a good job in our society , most of student have to go through a working experience , and we can not help thinking of the future . as a consequence we don not enjoy present and turn to what will happened then . as for me , being older is a source of serenity , we have a job , a family , good friend and are able to keep being healthy with doing some sport . travel around the world will be , eventually , a possible thing . as strange a it can be for a woman of twenty year old , i want to be older soon .
