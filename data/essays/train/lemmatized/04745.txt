most advertisement make product seem much better than they really are , i agree with this statement . when a company make any product by spending a huge amount of money . than the company want to sell it . and then the main question arises that how they can do it . they apply publicity stund . by advertise they try to make it much better than usually the product is . they try to allure customer . if the advertise is good and attractive , more people attract towards it . and buy it on demanding cost . after making the product they spend lot of money on advertising to make popular it among people . because there is a lot of comptetion in the market and every product maker want to sell more product than others . for example 2 company make a same product , then there is a great comptetion among maker . who will allure more to customer , will be in profit . and advertisement make a base for this . good advertise for the product , more customer will allure , more profit will occur . so by this way most of the selling of product depands upon the advertisement . and so maker take the help of advertise .
