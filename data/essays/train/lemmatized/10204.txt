in contemporary society , specialization in one specific subject tends to be the most common thing . some people spend all of their life studying a particular year of the life of a king , or some kind of abstract thing related to an unknown topic of algebraic topology . this kind of people tend to extremely focus their point of view on a single topic , and to examinate it in every side . i think that such an approach to an academic subject is a bit limitating . in my opinion , one should have a broad knowledge of many academic topic , rather than fossilize himself on a single point of a matter . first of all , i think that everyone should have a personal amount of knowledge , and be prepared at least on the basic thing . everyone should know , for example , that the earth orbit the sun and not viceversa !! some people , instead , may know everything about the poetry in south italy between 1900 and 1910 , but ignoring at all such a basic thing . this is rather an extreme example , but it is what happens in practice . another point pro having a broad knowledge of many subject is the fact that there are many thing that diserve to be studied . the world and human history are so rich in beautiful thing , that i think it is a crime to not take them in consideration . an objection to what i am saying could be made : such a way to proceed , that is to fly from a flower to another like a bee , could lead to nowhere . acting this way would bring nothing more to society . no improvement can be reach . my opinion is that to invent something new , it is necessary to grasp relationship between thing . for example , it is the contrast between classical mechanics and electromagnetism that lead to the theory of relativity . no one would have though to relativity if thinking to classical mechanics or electromagnetism separately . for this reason , i think that everyone should have a global point of view about what is around him , and that a broad knowledge is better than a specialization on a limited , specific subject .
