`` you should go to school , learn a lot of different thing . .. '' that is what parent often said . but i not completly agree the fact that it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject . in deed , i support the way that specialization is a good thing . so , people know what they are talking about . in some field , like men who built house , specialization is necessary : how could be someone a good the painting a wood table ? furthermore , it implies a more longer study if you want to have a broad knowledge . moreover , if someone ha a broad knowlede , i think it is impossible that he know accurently all his many academic subject he had even learned . this is a great problem , there is not a lot of people in the world who have this capacity . you need to be very smart , like leonard from vinci . he is a good exemple . .. nevertheless , in contrary to my first explaination , it is important too , to have people who know a little bit of all . important because those people will bring an opening mind : they will be the referant between specialist . and because of their knowledge , they will be able to resolve problem and manage a team . that 's why they confere a great adaptibility . to conclude with this statement , i think that in a society we need specialist and we need generalist . the both are complate themselves . but like specialized doctor in esthetic for example , could n't ze imagine more people who could have a broad knowledge of many academic subject and after that more specialized in one subject ?
