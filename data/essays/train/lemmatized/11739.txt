i agree with the statement which is given , before . this mean young people enjoy life more than older people . because the psychology of youth is based on sens , feeling . it doesn ' t look over incident , fall with completely rational and logical eye . if young people would weight with rational eye what they experience have , they couldn not enjoy life so good more than older people . because they would see and understand reality of life , which are not so enjoyable . older people can look over reality of life with rational eye . because they have more experience than younger people , and choose the rational way . their sens and feeling are not stronger their youth . we can see these situation at the oldest people in the most extreme fall . because they are closer to the door of the grab than others . and nothing can make them enjoy a before . opposing that sometimes we can meet young people which behave older than theirselves . this mean , a exceptional , they move more rational , more logical and serious than their environment . therefore , they think future and behave according to future . they are little crazier but this doe n't affect their life to the negative route . hence , they can catch the succes .
