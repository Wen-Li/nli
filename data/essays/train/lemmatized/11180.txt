trying new thing is dangerous because we ca n't guess what will happen in the future ; however , i think that it is very important for success ; i agrre the successful people . there are 2 reason . first , we can get new knowledge when we challenge new thing . if people just do what they already know , they will be bored and lazy to do because their work is same every day . however , if they focus on new thing and try to do , they can get new information ; their view become wide , in addition , they can make good and new relationship with other people and company . it make people success . second , we lose the chance for success unless we try new work . nobody know where there are opportunity ; nobody can help u to be successful . we just have to try to do our best for everything . then , we can find the way for success . it is difficult for people who just do same thing to seek success because they ca n't pay attention new thing . only when people challenge new thing , they finally can find and get good chance .
