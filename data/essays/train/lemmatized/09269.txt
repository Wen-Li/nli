`` the idea and concept are based on the individual one . no one can force to the other to follow her/his idea . '' - it is well known adage . according to the statement it is important to understand the idea and concept than it is for them to learn the fact . i would also agree with this statement . from my point of view it is very impotant to be a successfull person to understand clearfully about the concept and idea wheteher in whichever field she/he is . we can take the example of the mathematics to support my thought . in mathematics we see that , it just depend on the concept . if you have the concept you can easily understood what the mathematics is all about . there are a lot of theorem in it which are just derive from the concept . when the concept of it are not clear to the student then he/she say oh my god how difficult it is . without knowing that how wonderful subject it is . the second example for supporting my idea is computer language . the computer language is beautiful combination of the idea and the concept . what you think is in the language bust conceptually structured . just take the example of visual basic language how nice and pliable language is this . if a student just follow the fact without noticing the concept and idea then it would be difficult to him to understand many problem of day - to-day life . since day-to-day life is based indirectly on the mathematics and which is total depend on the concept . since fact ca n't be changed so they are not flexible a the concept and idea are . the student ca n't be a poetic one if he just depend on the fact since for the poetry the idea is very essential factor . so fact are necessary but with idea and concept . because with idea and concept the student can get profound knowledge about the subject . concepts are fit directly into the mind without any confusion . and this will help a student to achieve the goal and fulfill his dream .
