it is sometimes difficult to discus if young people do not spend too much to help their community . some people may agree that young peolpe do n't help others , while oyhers tend to state that young people help each others the their community all the time . however , i have also come to my own opinion that young people do not spend much time on helping their community . first , a techonolgies improve , too many recreation could deflect the concentration of young kid . for instance , the video game and internet , created in late 1980 's , provide much more visual pleasure that before . so more and moer young people would like to spend all their to play game or chat on the net rather than give some time to help their community . unlike young kid before , who did have more time to interact with other member in their community , young people nowadays have le topic of community , except game , to discus . so they do n't share their life with their community , no mention to help their community . second , in my opinion , fewer and fewer young people nowadays do realize the meaning of helping others . it is a pitty that even in the school , teacher rarely instruct the real virtue of human . all the teacher ask young kid to do is that they should forcus on themslves , not others . they just acquire knowlege form textbook , but they do n't learn how to deal with other people , respect other peoplem , and even help other people . as a result , they do not give any support to their community , because they do n't how to do and what to do . thay is not to say , of course , that other point of view are without merit . i am sure that there are do some young kid serving others . however , on the basis of the above mentioned , i think the reason i have provided in favor of my position are build on a solid foundation .
