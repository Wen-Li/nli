in this essay i will shed light on the statment , that it is more imoportant for student to unterstand idea and concept than it is for them to learn fact . it is important , that student learn general fact for their cultural understanding , but mainly this date and name can be researched in a book , or on the internet at almost any time . although , some very important key fact must be memorized . when i wa in a conversation with an american visitor in genova , standing in front of the columbus museum , i could not remember , when america wa discovered . a such an important date is known by any second grade child , however i could not remember the year . he reminded me , that america wa discovered in 1492 . i felt very bad at that time that i never forget this important fact in my life . however , i am convinced , that idea and concept are much more imporant than learn fact . concepts are more likely to be necessary in the daily life , than are fact . what i mean is , if there were two or more contries combating each other , it would be war . from school we learned a lot about war in ancient and a well recent time , that in all war many people were killed , and in most of those land and people changed nationality once the war wa over . during the war many people were killed and tortured . from the concept of war we know , that it is a very bad situation for all involved and that there are many loosers and few winner . this concept is known by everybody . in an nutshell it is important to know impotant fact , such a the discovery of the american continent , but it is far more important to understand idea and concept , in order to draw conclusion of a possible outcome .
