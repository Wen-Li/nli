well , i kinda disagree with the statement given because in my opinion you ca n't really understand idea and concept if you do n't have a good knowledge about fact , and viceversa . so , i think they both are important for student . for example , if a teacher would clear concept such a socialism or comunism in an history class , he will of course need to explain and let student understand idea and concept of these two important subject , but he would n't give his student a complete preparation on that without taking consideration of the fact , like the fact that following this idea and concept the russian post warsaw-pact ( and all it satellite 's country ' ) economy have fallen because it wa n't possible to rule a country with that kind of principle . i am sure that it is important for student to understand idea and concept , so that they can take their decision and follow or ignore some of them to finally have their own idea and concept to grow their capability to interact and agree or disagree with other people in a wide range of field . but i would n't say that this is more important than learning fact , because if you have your idea and concept but ca n't use them for they do n't fit with reality nor with what history tell u , you will never be able to bring an interesting point of view about any topic given . so a good balanced preparation both in the `` idea and concepts-area '' and in the `` fact learning-area '' will give the student the best way to take decision , have their own idea to fight for , make up their mind ( why not ? ! ) and finally feel free to talk about any subject without feeling ignorant or frustrated because of their lack of knowledge about idea and concept or because of a fact itself .
