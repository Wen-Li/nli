although some student can not understand idea and concept until they learn fact , idea and concept have more value for all student to learn than fact . understanding idea and concept is the first step of studying . for example , at the beging of studying new thing , a teatcher may give it concept first and then tell fact a an example . this can happen many time especially in chemistory class . firstly a teacher tell a theory , and then student clarify that the theory is correct in a lab class . this is because to understand chemical experience , understaning the theory is the neccessary step for student . if student take a lab class first , they cannnot understand anything even if what they are doing in the class . thus , teacing concept and idea must be the first step of class . however , it is also the truth that there are some student who can not under stand concept only in explanation by theachers . for the student who can not understand whole of a lecture , this sequence can also work because there is no student , who can not understand any part of leacture , in class . during lecture , all student can catch at least so word , which are mainideas and helpful to understand idea . if a teacher write these important word and drow some picture on a black board , all student can write and drow them on their note . after a lab class , they can review their note and will be familiar with the idea . therefore , for this kind of studens , this is very helpful .
