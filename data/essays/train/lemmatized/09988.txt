in this essay i would like to discus the statement , if there will be fewer car in use in twenty year than there are today . on the one hand we have to see that the number of car increased rapidly in the past . there ha been a lot of technical development during year and year . at the moment you see more car on the street than you did in the past . city representative are saying that there is n't even enough space for all those car . they 're building more parking area and larger street . but now we have to discus wether this development , seen in the past will go on . i think in time of globalization the market around the world spread and people are willing to drive car . on the other hand the resource with which car drive , namely oil , is becoming rare . there wo n't be enough oil in the future to make each car on the world driving . but a i already said , there ha been remarkable development in technical research and i think that in the future car wo n't drive with gas or oil but with solar energy or h ^ 2 . we will have to see if industry will be able to produce a many car a they 're required by people . also we are not sure if the oil will be rare in twenty year . however , today it can be seen that the car producing industry ha the potential to build future car . but at the moment they gain a lot of money with the old by gas driving car . so they say : `` why should we build futuristic and environment friendly car , if we get enough money with the old car ? '' . they should change their behaviour and build environment friendly car so that the oil wo n't be that rare that not everybody could drive his car resp . buy a new one . as one can see there are many factor , which have to be discussed for a statement like that . a lot ha to be done that there could be more car in future than there are today . out of today 's view i think that there wo n't be le car in use than there are today . in twenty year there still will be enough oil to feed all the car . unfortunately the car producing industry doe n't use the potential for enviroment friendly car so that the number of car wo n't decrease in twenty year and may even increase but with a longer view there will be a change on the street with fewer car and car a a symol for money a it is maybe flying in plane nowadays .
