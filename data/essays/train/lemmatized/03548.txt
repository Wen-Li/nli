i agree with what the article say . some people think understand idea and concept is important for student , and some people think lern fact is important for student . however , from the fact of national survey and my own experience , i think understand idea and concept is more important for student . first off , i agree with the article because national survey say some country which teach idea and concept to student in math , and history class usually have ranked in high educated country in the wold . according to the article , in some country , such a greenland and honkong , which teach student idea and concept , adult usually have great insight and memory about what they studied when they were in high school . however , some country , which tend to teach student just fact , adult usually do n't remember what they studied when they were in high school . second , i agree with what the article say because if people study just fact , they ca n't apply what they studied in daily life . people are studyng to make them knowledgble . since , i 'm from japan , i had an experience to support my opinion . when i `` m taking a math class in hong kong , people usually asked me many question about math . even though , i wa really good on my math , i could n't answer futher question of them and they considered i 'm cheating . in conclusion . i agree with what the article say because of these reason .
