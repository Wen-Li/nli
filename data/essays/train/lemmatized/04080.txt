while many people preferred to travel in a group led by a tour guider , there are many people agree with me to choose to travel alone . there are reason behind of each choice . there are 3 main reason supporting mine . first , it is not necessary for me to go with a group because i can make a research on internet about the destination , such a where should i go ? what should i see , and book airline ticket based on ca careful comparation of a few ticket service . i will have freedom to stay longer if i need , which travelling with group wont tolerated . second , it is a challenging and surprising expereince while travelling alone , without tour guider telling me what is ahead , i would find out what i need by asking a local resident , or plan by reading the map . one of the major reason that we desire to travel is jump out from our daily routine which caused u missing our creativity and sense of freshness . so trveling alone can fullfill this need , make our soul refreshened in a brand new way . last but not least , by travel alone i dont have to share a room with someone neither my parent , nor my husband . it is important to have a privacy and freedom to sleep over , because travel is a way to relax and refresh , not only a creative way to catching bus , setting clock to get up earlier and being around crowd , like we used to in our work day . it is real luxury to travel alone in those beautiful , unique town . i always choose traveling alone , even in my 2 year grand tour and study abroad in switzerland , -- it is a breath taking journey , full of beautiful surprise a life itself is . more challenging we are willing to take , more view we can see . i preferred and always will traveling alone , for it challenge , uniquness and luxury of sleep over .
