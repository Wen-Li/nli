in my country , there is an old say ; to teach the way of take fish instead give fish . it say important of learing not only the fact but also the `` the way '' . but it highlight that the important of the way . like this old say , i agree that student to understand idea and concets is more important than to learn fact . first , if student understand idea and concept then they can understand more difficult question . for example , when i wa middle school student , at first time of math class , i could n't understand what teacher said . but finally understood the way of solution , i could solve another math question . although that question wa more difficult , i understood the way of solution so i could do it . if i could n't understnad , i could n't solve that question . sesond , if student understand idea and concept , they can imagine more idea nad concept . i mean , for instance , when i wa high school student , i learnd about poet . most of people do n't like poet because of word . that word were difficult to understood except teacher . teacher could understood all of word . that is why that is important to understand idea and concept than to learn fact , i could n't understand because i did'nt have any idea . so i agree about that statement .
