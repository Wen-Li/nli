first of all we have to define what a successful person is . in my opinion a successful person is a person who is able to find his perfect role in the society within he life . that is , his work and his family according to this definition , it sound quite logical that a person ha to try different role before settle down and stop searching . infact successful people are usually open minded and ready to try different experience , because the convinction that who dare , win is really strong , although you should always think about what you 're getting involved in . if a person is not satisfied of his job , he can carry it on without any satisfaction or try another one . sure it sound like a bet , but the choice of change can radically modify his life , and above all at the and he could say : i 've tried it . a clear example of this theory can be found in a casino . infact a player must always bet great amount of money to win a lot . that 's the risk . but if the most important target of the player is to get rich , than he ha no choice : he 's to bet , and if he win he 's a successfull person because he ha reached his purpose . nowadays our society is printed with this convinction because after second world war people didnt'have anything , and so they had to bet on something to get rich . here in italy this convinction is really strong . the self made man is always admired and respected everywhere . for example the rapper 50 cent gave the title `` get rich or die tryin ' '' to his first record . he made a bet , investing all his money on himself and his voice . no doubt that it ha been a won bet . sure the other side of the coin is really strong , because if you fail , noone will admire you : on the contrary , you 'll be judged a a failure . but if someone want to success , he 's to dare . the much you dare , the much you 'll success .
