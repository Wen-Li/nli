acc . to me a student should focus more on idea and concept than on learning concept because if he will know the idea & concept he will be able to apply his learning in his practical & normal life rather focussing on fact . by knoowing the idea & concept , he can check & approve the practality of a learning . but in the case of fact he ha to follow them blindly like a theoritical essay . also by knowing the idea , he can use them formaking basic of other related subject & can continue to research on the basis of concept & make his own learned fact . but in case of fact , he wont be able to go out his bounded area of learned fact & continue to follow on the same & wont be able to explore & prove his fact . this will kill a student 's curiousity & he will become a follower not a leader . there wont be any pace in his life . he will continue to work on same old fact . but by knowing the idea & concept , he can come close to the practacility of a topic & it will become a learning for his life . these idea & concept broaden the mind of a student to think & develope more but in case of fact , these narrowed the emrging thinking of a learning student . by learning idea & concept , he can lead them to a certified notion by producing practical result but in case of fact , he will not be boter to work any more on that because it will be a so called proff to him . so focus on idaes 7 conce
