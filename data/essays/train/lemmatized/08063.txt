i disagree with the statement . i believe the best way to travel is to guide or plan a trip by oneself . in this way , a person can see what she want to see and spend a much time a she want at a place where she want to be . in addition , she can learn a culture of a country where he or she is visiting . the problem associated with a planned tour by a travel agency is that a traveler can not stay a place where she is visiting for a much a she want because the travel is already scheduled and the tour ha to move on on time . hence , she ha le time to see or stay at a place where she is visiting . in my opinion , this is negative because i do not like to feel being restricted by time . another problem with a travel company 's planned tour is that a traveler will not be able to get to interact with people living in a country where she is visiting . interacting with local people in the country is the best way to learn it culture . if she wa in a group led by a tour guide and have a question about the country , she would not ask local people walking on a street but rather she would ask it to the tour guide who come from her country . however , if she wa not in the tour group and had a question about the country , she would have to ask to local people . i believe interacting with local people is a great way to learn a country 's culture because by watching how they react to a traveler and she can learn some aspect of the culture . in conclusion , it is better to plan a trip by oneself rather than following a planned trip offered by a travel agency . some might argue that the planned trip by the travel company would be better because traveler do not have to worry about where to eat and how to get to a place and so on . they are correct in that traveling in a country by oneself where local people do not speak a traveler 's language is hard and creates a problem with food and so on . on the other hand , i believe that it is a part of traveling a foreign country . if there wa not such a part in a travel , it would be the same a staying in your country . struggling with getting food and getting to a place would give a traveler a good experience on how to function in a different culture and how to adopt it . overall , i believe that traveling in a foreign country by oneself will give h an experience that he can use for later in his life .
