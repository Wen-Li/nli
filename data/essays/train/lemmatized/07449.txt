the given statement is `` it is better to have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject '' . i disagree with the above statement because , having broad knowledge of many academic subject seems to be alright when in childhood , but this seems to be complex and cumbersome a we grow older and older . firstly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject than to specialize in one specific subject , it becomes difficult to identify our main domain properly . for an example , consider a high school student . if he need to have a broad knowledge of many subject even after his high school , apart from his personal interest which he show at a particular subject , the decision-making strategy of perceiving higher study becomes troublesome . secondly , if we have broad knowledge of many academic subject , the frequency at which we do get update about these subject greatly matter . we need to have a greater frequency of updation in all area , which is not a simpler task . for an example , consider a student studying computer sciences . the other academic subject include some main aspect from electronics , electricals , communications and like wise . the frequency at which he get updated in his core subject ( computer sciences ) slows down if he need to have broad knowledge of other academic subject . thirdly , having broad knowledge of other academic subject do help , but not at a considerable rate . considering the example illustrated in the above ( second ) aspect , the student could hardly get bug in other area which he integrates with his core subject . in recent day , debugging mechanism are in plethora and it can be said that a person need not have a broad knowledge of other academic subject . considering the above reason , i conclude that i disagree with the given statement .
