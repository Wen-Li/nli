ideas and fact are really different thing . ideas explain something that can be done or couldnt . because it is an only idea . but fact is different . facts must be done in real life . i think it is iportant to learn fact than idea . because fact are real but idea are not . you can learn somuch idea about something but you ca n't apply these idea in real life . it is not important if you do n't apply idea in real life . but if you know fact you can apply immediately when you hear idea . but if you know only idea you cant do anything in real life . for example an electronic engineer can know how television work . but he/she know only idea that how it work . i think this not important . in real life people dont pay attention idea . people pay attetion fact . because fact are real and applicable . people want to see something . people dont want hear only idea . if they see fact then people pay attention idea . and say `` ooo it is a good idea , congratulation '' . it is waste of time to learn idea . if you learn fact you also learn idea background of this fact . if we learn only idea we must spend time to learn fact about this idea . but we learn fact directly we also learn the idea . so we dont lose time . facts is general . so when you learn fact about something , you also learn idea about this .
