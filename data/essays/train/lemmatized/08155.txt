wisdom is usually associated with age . the older we get , the wiser we become . i agree with this idea because experience teach u what to do and what not to do . for example , a child could cut himself by picking up a knife from it blade rather than the handle , but he will learn not to do it again . in other word , young people do not enjoy life more than young people because they learn through pain . this doe not mean adult do not experience pain , but they know how to avoid it better . in some way , adult have learned to distinguish the road that lead to joyful event rather than painful one . a perfect example would be the use of alcohol . young people tend to binge-drink because they have not learned to distinguish how much alcohol their body can tolerate . on the other hand , grown-ups have already learned this after repeated hangover , and instead , they learn to experience the taste of a good wine . something potentially harmful becomes a pleasure instead . however , it is not a rosy picture for grown-ups because they have more responsabilities than young people . yet , responsabilities usually come hand in hand with more freedom . this gift of freedom is not a blank cheque because one ha to work hard to earn money and be responsible for oneself . but on the other hand , kid depend too much on their parent ' time and money . they may have a lot of fun , but their freedom to move and do a they please is limited . if kid and teenager living in big city want to go to the movie , they usually need their parent to drive them to the cinema . they could do it alone by bus , but parent are sometimes afraid something could happen on the way . to sum up , youger people do not enjoy life more than older people because a the year go by , one acquires independence and experience . these two element in my value system are not a magic key to instant happiness but they are key for doing whatever make u happy without falling into painful situation .
