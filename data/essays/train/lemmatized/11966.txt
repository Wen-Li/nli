for me , it is better to have a specialize in one specific subject than having broad knowledge of many academic subject because it is easier for normal human study one subject and spend his time on it . people who prefare studying one language sue do n't have time for that because there is many thing in life take aolt of human 's time . one reason that a human could have amny social prblems make him confused and not consetrating on his studying so it is better for him to study one subject . also studying one subject make human sucsessful in what he is studying . for eaxample , if a person studied business administration and spend all his time and energy for it he will became amazing in his career and job . if he had a little time he could take some course of any thing he like . on the other hand , having broad knowledge it 's may be good to haver a well information about many thing in this life but i disagree to have many knowledge of many academic subject because it is wasting for time espcially if the person ha a familly and childrens , it would be difficult for him to take care of his family and his studying at the same time . the family need time to spend with because it 's the main ting in this life and from the good family grow good peple . but when one of the perents do n't have time for thier family that would reflect in a negative way at childrens . so studying one subject would allow person to have time for his own life and take care of it . so having one thing to study is better for the peaon him self also better for the country he live in . i think having one subject to so study or not , well . . that depends in person 's personality in his life and his scadule . each person ha his own idea .
