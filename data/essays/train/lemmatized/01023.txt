on of the big topic in this new century is the pollution of our world , especcially of the air . to give our child a chance to live healthy on this world , the are some possibility to the air pollution : one of the most factor cause air pollution are our car . so a lot of state and country think about strategy to increase the sum of car in the next 20 year . they invest money in new and more economic bus - , train - or tube-systems . to use this transport system in the future ha got a second advantage , too . in every bog city , there is a parking-problem . but the city are rising , too . and so every month a parking place chance to a new building . in future more and more people wo n't have an other possiblity for arriving their job than to use this public transport system . so the car will be le at our street . another reason to disagree with this statement is the oil . in some year , there wo n't be a much oil a today at our earth and therefore the petrol price will rice to region much people wo n't be able to pay for . ok , there are invention for non-petrol car . but nobody really support that because of the big influence of the oil industry . so a lot of people will sell their car and move with public system or train . a third reason to disagree is that there will be new kind of transportation-systems in 20 year . perhaps everybody ha got a small plane . we wo n't have any street . only fly on the magnetic field of our earth without any petrol or electicity . or we get beamed to every place on earth like in `` spaceship enterprice '' ? 20 year , that 's a very long time , and looking back to the last 20 year , a lot of thing , nobody thought about , ha been invented . we only need someone who invents this kind of transport system , and then , i 'm sure , nobody wo n't use something like a car ! because of this main reason , i must disagree with the statement and can look hopefully into the future with clean air for u , our child , ...
