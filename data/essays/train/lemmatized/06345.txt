i disagree with this statement . in my opinion , it is more important for student to learn fact than it is for them to understand idea and concept . people in these day seem to pay a lot attention to idea , but the fact is , this made a lot of useless ` invention ' . for this , i saw a new ` invention ' the other day . it wa a little fan that could be tied on the arm , which could be used for cooling off the hot noodle while people are picking up the noodle . the fan is not tiny , but even if it is , is there really a lot of consumer for this kind of product ? i do not think so . if i were the customer , i wo n't even bring a fan to a restruant just for cooling off the noodle . this is one example for people only get the idea but not the fact . as a matter of fact , many of the concept and idea are theory , which just came from hypethosis . if every student do not pay attention to the fact that are in daily life , how will they able to find out or even to do lab without a habit which is called `` to discover themselves '' ? ideas and concept seems to be very important , but if they are just there without fact , i do not think there will be anybody to be able to understand them . it is the twenty-first centry , society and technology are updating everyday , if people only get the idea and concept on the text book instead of getting the fact , they will not be able to fit in this society very well , due to their lacking of method that will work the best and creativity . and those method and creativity are mostly came from the fact that they have ` stored ' day by day . ` students ' now are the ` people ' in the future . that is why i think it is a lot more important for student to learn fact than it is for them to only understand idea and concept .
