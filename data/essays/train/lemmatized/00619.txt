jack of all trade but a master of none . what would be the position of a person in today ' world who ha a broad knowledge in many academic subject instead of specializing in one or being an expect in one . i believe that a person should specialize in a specific field and then excel in that specific field . a today it is the time for professional and so each and every sector in the world is looking for expert in that particular field . for exmple a person who is not specialized in the field of computer , but ha a vast knowledge of everything where would he be standing in the world of computer , no where , a he wont be able to have the integreity of and wont be having the complete knowledge of computer . if one ha to succees in life he should get in a particular field he/she is interested in and should excel in that only . now day every person ha knowledge about most of the thing in the world , but can that person be a successful person in particular . it is also stated in english literature , in the famous greek play dr. faustus . though he had the knowledge of each and everything he wa fooled to give up his soul just to know the knowledge of black magic . i even support the counter point that a person should not restrict his/her knowledge but even the a person should be a master of one and then of course become a jack of all trade . a person can always move forward , but i believe with something in his hand on which he can fall back on . at least that specialization is there with him . now day surverys have proved that a practical person i preferred to a doctrinaire. a person who is totally based in theory if doe not think about the praticallities of life , how will people consider him over the other . thus , in the same way i believe that a person should be the master of one and then the jack of all other trade .
